      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12788">An [[African rock python]] killed two boys in [[Campbellton, New Brunswick]], Canada on August 5, 2013. The boys, who were aged four and six, were sleeping in an apartment above their friend's father's pet store. The python – which had been in a specially made enclosure in the apartment – had escaped, crawled through an [[air duct]], and fallen through a ceiling tile above where the boys were sleeping. Following the incident, the python was [[euthanized]]. The python's owner was charged with [[criminal negligence]] for not preventing the deaths, but was found [[Acquittal|not guilty]] in a [[jury trial]] in November 2016.

==Prior incidents==
The [[African rock python]] is one of the five [[largest snake species in the world]] (along with the [[green anaconda]], [[reticulated python]], [[Burmese python]] and [[amethystine python]]). At least two other examples of humans killed by an African rock python have been reported. A ten-year-old boy was reportedly killed and swallowed in [[South Africa]] in 2002, and a three-year-old boy was reportedly strangled by a {{convert|7.5|foot}}{{not in citation given|date=June 2016}} African rock python in [[Centralia, Illinois]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=HuffPost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morales |first=S. |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/08/05/f-snake-python-sales-ownership-risks.html |title=Python Killing of 2 New Brunswick Boys Baffles Experts |website=CBC News |date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closely related species, a [[Burmese python]], reportedly strangled a 28-year-old [[Brampton]] man in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;McDiarmid, J., "[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/08/06/campbellton_nb_snake_tragedy_raises_exotic_pet_concern.html New Brunswick boys killed by python spent fun-filled last day]", ''[[Toronto Star]]'', , August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) said the python escaped from its enclosure in the apartment and entered the living room where the boys were sleeping via the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] system. The python was approximately {{convert|4.3|m}} long and weighed {{convert|45|kg|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Strangling&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57597127/pythons-strangling-of-2-boys-in-canada-investigated/ Python's strangling of 2 boys in Canada investigated]", CBS News, August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The boys, ages 4 and 6,&lt;ref name=Strangling/&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeMail/&gt;&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwong/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt; were brothers who were visiting their friend, whose father owned a pet shop below the apartment where they were staying.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;Than, K., "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130806-python-strangles-kids-canada-snakes/ Strangulation of Sleeping Boys Puts Spotlight on Pythons]", ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic Daily News]]'', August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner of the python – Jean-Claude Savoie – was interviewed by the Canadian network [[Global TV]]. According to the interview, the python was not in the pet store downstairs, but rather in a specially-built cage in the apartment upstairs. The python escaped from its enclosure through a hole in the ceiling, where a ventilation fan had been removed for maintenance.&lt;ref name=CBCNews1&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/08/14/nb-python-campbellton-boys-escaped.html Python enclosure in N.B. boys' deaths had 'flaw']", [http://www.cbc.ca/news/ CBC News], August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  This gave the snake direct access to the air ducts in the ceiling, which then collapsed under the snake's weight above the living room.&lt;ref name=GlobalNews&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prentiss |first1=M. |last2=Paperny |first2=A. M. |last3=Wong |first3=J. |last4=Logan |first4=N. |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/764130/python-that-killed-two-n-b-boys-was-in-enclosure-near-where-they-slept-friend-says/ |title=Python that killed two N.B. boys was in enclosure near where they slept, friend says |website=Global News |date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The air duct containing the snake crashed through the ceiling tiles and onto the boys, who were sleeping on a floor mattress located about eight feet from the snake's enclosure.&lt;ref name=CBCNews1/&gt;

==Controversy==
Several experts expressed skepticism about the incident and said that such behaviour by this type of snake would be extremely unusual,&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;"[http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/18377799/escaped-python-kills-two-young-children-in-canada/ Escaped python kills two young children in Canada]", ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'', August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeMail&gt;Mahoney, J., "[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/its-very-very-puzzling-snake-expert-mystified-by-new-brunswick-python-attack/article13610814/ 'It's Very, Very Puzzling': Snake Expert Mystified by New Brunswick Python Attack]", [[The Globe and Mail]], August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; although there have been some previous reports of deadly attacks on humans. According to the reports, the snake did not consume the bodies after strangling the brothers. This – together with the fact that more than one child was killed in a single incident and that the other occupants of the apartment were reportedly not awakened by the disturbance – prompted questions about the circumstances regarding the alleged attack.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;Wood, D., [http://www.therecord.com/news-story/3925976-snake-attack-leaves-many-questions/ Snake attack leaves many questions], ''[[The Record (Waterloo Region)|The Waterloo Region Record]]'', August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;Withnall, A., [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/python-attack-snake-escapes-from-canadian-pet-store-and-kills-two-boys-as-they-sleep-8747571.html Python escapes from Canadian pet store and kills two young brothers as they sleep], ''The Independent'', August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reptilia (zoo)|Reptilia zoo]] facilities manager Lee Parker said, "They don't go on killing sprees. It doesn't make sense to me."&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/08/06/python-kills-boys_n_3711719.html|title=Python Killing Of 2 New Brunswick Boys Baffles Experts|date=6 August 2013|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these objections have been made, the possibility that the incident may be a homicide rather than an animal attack has been ruled out by the RCMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/nb/news-nouvelles/releases-communiques/13-08-07-153212-eng.htm|title=News|date=23 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court records revealed that the pet shop owner was found pacing outside of the store with blood on his hands and wearing  shorts by police who first arrived on the scene.&lt;ref name=CBCNews2&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/08/22/nb-python-campbellton-blood.html Python pet shop owner had blood on hands]", [http://www.cbc.ca/news/ CBC News], August 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to prior reports,&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt; the store owner told arriving police that the snake was still unaccounted for, leaving one to speculate whether the blood belonged to the boys or was his own (due to being bitten by the "enraged" snake or cut by debris from the collapsed ceiling).&lt;ref name=CBCNews2/&gt;

[[Kentucky Reptile Zoo]] director Jim Harrison stated that it was theoretically possible for the large python to have constricted around both boys at the same time,&lt;ref name=Kwong/&gt; a theory supported by [[University of Texas]] professor, Neil Ford.&lt;ref name=GlobeMail/&gt;  Harrison also mentioned that since the boys handled a variety of farm animals ([[horses]], [[llamas]], [[goats]], [[cats]] and [[dogs]]) earlier that day, they may have smelled like food to the snake.&lt;ref name=Kwong/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSNews/&gt;

Although the pet shop was registered as a reptile zoo, police said that the [[province#Canada|province]] does not allow pythons and that the owner probably did not have the proper permits and authorization to keep the python under his care.&lt;ref name=Latin&gt;"[http://www.latinpost.com/articles/1385/20130808/python-escapes-cage-kills-brothers-aged-4-6-canada.htm Python Escapes Cage, Kills Brothers Aged 4 and 6 in Canada]", Latin Post, August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The python was euthanized by authorities.&lt;ref name=GlobalNews/&gt;
A coroner's preliminary autopsy report released on August 7 said that the boys died of [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=Gillies&gt;Gillies, R., "[http://news.msn.com/world/boys-killed-by-python-died-from-asphyxiation Boys Killed by Python Died from Asphyxiation]", MSN News, August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwong&gt;Kwong, M., "[http://news.msn.com/science-technology/boys-killed-by-python-case-baffles-snake-experts Boys killed by python: Case baffles snake experts]", MSN News, August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, P., "[http://www.chch.com/autopsy-report-release-in-n-b-snake-deaths/ Autopsy report released in N.B. snake deaths]", CHCH News, August 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner of the python and the mother of the two brothers had [[Facebook]] accounts that reporters used to obtain pictures.&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite news | last1=Zennie | first1=M. | last2=Warren | first2=L. | last3=McMahon | first3=B. | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2385145/Python-strangles-2-boys-5-7-sleep-New-Brunswick-Canada.html | title=Mother's heartbreak after her two sons, 4 and 6, are strangled in their sleep by 16-ft python during sleepover above pet shop | work=The Daily Mail Online | date=August 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two boys could be seen cleaning a large glass enclosure belonging to a [[green anaconda]] in pictures their mother posted on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=CBSNews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57597460/mother-of-2-boys-killed-by-python-posted-facebook-photos-of-boys-in-snake-enclosure/ | title=Mother of 2 boys killed by python posted Facebook photos of boys in snake enclosure | work=CBS News | date=August 7, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808020228/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57597460/mother-of-2-boys-killed-by-python-posted-facebook-photos-of-boys-in-snake-enclosure/ | archivedate=August 8, 2013 | author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enclosure later held the African rock python that, unlike the green anaconda, was able to escape.&lt;ref name=CBCNews1/&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobalNews/&gt;

[[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] Donald Arseneault expressed frustration in April 2014 that the province would not review New Brunswick's Fish and Wildlife Act until the RCMP investigation was completed.&lt;ref name=brown2014/&gt; Minister of Natural Resources Paul Robichaud defended the delay, saying that the completed RCMP investigation would help inform a review of the current law.&lt;ref name=brown2014&gt;{{cite news | title=MLA wants change in exotic pet laws 8 months after python attack | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1261136/mla-wants-to-see-change-in-exotic-pet-laws-soon/ | work=Global News | date=April 9, 2014 | first=Laura | last=Brown | publisher=Shaw Media, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the incident was treated as an accident, the RCMP arrested Savoie in [[Montreal]] on February 5, 2015.&lt;ref name="npfirstarrest"&gt;{{cite news | title=Snake owner arrested 18 months after python killed two young brothers in New Brunswick | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2015/02/05/arrest-made-in-connection-with-fatal-python-case-in-new-brunswick-that-killed-two-young-brothers/ | date=February 6, 2015 | first=Tristin | last=Hopper | publisher=National Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2015, Savoie was charged with [[criminal negligence]] for not preventing the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1456531/man-charged-over-brothers-killed-by-python|title=Man Charged Over Brothers Killed By Python|work=Sky News|date=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thestarcharged&gt;{{cite news | title=Man charged in python asphyxiation death of boys| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/03/31/man-charged-in-python-asphyxiation-death-of-boys.html | date=March 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was found [[Acquittal|not guilty]] in a [[jury trial]] in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/python-death-jurors-instructions-1.3842113|title=Python owner not guilty in deaths of 2 boys|newspaper=CBC News|date=November 9, 2016|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spider and fly April 2008-6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A female goldenrod crab spider (''[[Misumena vatia]]'') ambushing the female of a pair of mating [[fly|flies]]]]
'''Ambush predators''' or '''sit-and-wait predators''' are [[carnivorous animal]]s that capture or trap prey by stealth or by strategy (typically not conscious), rather than by speed or by strength. Ambush [[predation|predators]] sit and wait for prey, often from a concealed position, and then launch a rapid surprise attack.

The ambush may be set by hiding in a burrow, by [[camouflage]], by [[aggressive mimicry]], or by the use of a trap. The predator then uses a combination of senses to assess the prey and to time the strike. Nocturnal ambush predators such as cats and snakes have vertical slit pupils, helping them to judge the distance to prey in dim light. Different ambush predators use a variety of means to capture their prey, from the long sticky tongues of [[chameleon]]s to the expanding mouths of [[frogfish]]es.

Ambush predation is widely distributed in the [[animal]] kingdom, spanning some members of numerous groups such as the [[starfish]], [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacea]]ns, [[spider]]s, [[insect]]s such as [[mantis]]es, and vertebrates such as many [[snake]]s and [[fish]]es.

==Strategy==
[[File:Beetle larva (Lethocerus patruelis) attacking fish (Pseudorasbora parva) - ZooKeys-319-119-s001.ogv|thumb|Video of a [[Lethocerus|water bug]] nymph attacking a [[Pseudorasbora parva|fish]]]]

Ambush predators usually remain motionless (sometimes hidden) and wait for prey to come within ambush distance before pouncing. Ambush predators are often [[camouflage]]d, and may be solitary.&lt;!-- This mode of [[predation]] may be less risky for the predator because lying-in-wait reduces exposure to its own predators.--&gt; [[Pursuit predation]] becomes a better strategy than ambush predation when the predator is faster than the prey.&lt;ref name="Scharf"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scharf, I.; Nulman, E.; Ovadia, O.; Bouskila, A. |journal=The American Naturalist |title=Efficiency evaluation of two competing foraging modes under different conditions |volume=168 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=350–357 |url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/~oferovad/library/Scharf06ForMod.pdf |doi=10.1086/506921 |pmid=16947110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambush predators use many intermediate strategies. For example, when a pursuit predator is faster than its prey over a short distance, but not in a long chase, then either stalking or ambush becomes necessary as part of the strategy.&lt;ref name="Scharf"/&gt;

==Bringing the prey within range==

===Concealment===

Ambush often relies on concealment, whether by staying out of sight or by means of camouflage. 

====Burrows====

Ambush predators such as [[trapdoor spider]]s on land and [[mantis shrimp]]s in the sea rely on concealment, constructing and hiding in burrows. These provide effective concealment at the price of a restricted field of vision.&lt;ref name=deVries&gt;{{cite journal |author=deVries, M. S. |author2=Murphy, E. A. K. |author3=Patek S. N. |title=Strike mechanics of an ambush predator: the spearing mantis shrimp |year=2012 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |issue=Pt 24 |pages=4374–4384 |doi=10.1242/jeb.075317 |pmid=23175528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Liphistius |title=Trapdoor spiders |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_trapdoor_spider.php|accessdate=12 December 2014 |title=Trapdoor spider |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moore | first=Talia Y. | last2=Biewener | first2=Andrew A. | title=Outrun or Outmaneuver: Predator–Prey Interactions as a Model System for Integrating Biomechanical Studies in a Broader Ecological and Evolutionary Context | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | date=2015 | doi=10.1093/icb/icv074 | page=icv074 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/25858000/MooreICB2015_Preprint.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trapdoor spiders excavate a burrow and seal the entrance with a web trapdoor hinged on one side with silk. The most well-known door is the ''cork''-type, which is thick and beveled to precisely fit the opening. The other is the ''wafer''-type door, a simpler sheet of silk and dirt. The top of the door is usually camouflaged with bits of debris such as twigs and rock, making it very difficult to detect. The spider spins silk fishing lines, or trip wires, that radiate out of the burrow entrance.  When the spider is using the trap to capture prey, its [[chelicerae]] hold the door shut on the end furthest from the hinge. The vibrations of passing prey are conducted by the silk and alert the spider whereupon it quickly throws open the door, ambushes the prey and returns with it down the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Liphistius|title=Trapdoor spiders|publisher=BBC|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_trapdoor_spider.php |accessdate=December 12, 2014|title=Trapdoor spider |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Camouflage====

{{further|Camouflage}}

Many ambush predators make use of [[camouflage]] so that their prey can come within striking range without detecting their presence.

Many ambush predators actively attract their prey towards them before ambushing them.  These animals are often classified as [[Aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]]s.

Similarly, some snakes employ [[caudal luring]] (tail luring) to entice small vertebrates into striking range.

Some ambush predators build traps to help capture their prey. Lacewings are a flying insect in the order [[Neuroptera]]. In some species, their larval form, known as the [[antlion]], is an ambush predator. Eggs are laid in the earth, often in caves or under a rocky ledge. The juvenile creates a small, crater shaped trap. The antlion hides under a light cover of sand or earth. When an ant, beetle or other prey slides into the trap, the antlion grabs the prey with its powerful jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Geographic |url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/antlion_trap|title=Video of antlion larva ambushing an ant |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p007stjv |title=Antlion ambush |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some but not all [[spider web|web-spinning]] [[spider]]s are sit-and-wait ambush predators. The sheetweb spiders ([[Linyphiidae]]) tend to stay with their webs for long periods and so resemble sit-and-wait predators, whereas the orb-weaving spiders (such as the [[Araneidae]]) tend to move frequently from one patch to another (and thus resemble active foragers).&lt;ref name="Janetos1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Janetos | first=Anthony C. | title=Foraging tactics of two guilds of web-spinning spiders | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=10 | issue=1 | year=1982 | doi=10.1007/bf00296392 | pages=19–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection and assessment==
[[File:Leopard cat vertical pupils nocturnal ambush predator.jpg|thumb|upright|Many nocturnal ambush predators like this [[leopard cat]] have vertical pupils, enabling them to judge distance to prey accurately in dim light.&lt;ref name="BanksSpragueSchmoll Parnell2015"/&gt;]]

Ambush predators must time their strike carefully. They need to detect the prey, assess it as worth attacking, and strike when it is in exactly the right place. They have evolved a variety of adaptations that facilitate this assessment. For example, [[pit viper]]s prey on small birds, choosing targets of the right size for their mouth gape: larger snakes choose larger prey. They prefer to strike prey that is both warm and moving;&lt;ref name="ShineSun2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shine | first=R. | last2=Sun | first2=L.-X. | title=Attack strategy of an ambush predator: which attributes of the prey trigger a pit-viper's strike? | journal=Functional Ecology | volume=17 | issue=3 | year=2003 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.2003.00738.x | pages=340–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; their pit organs between the eye and the nostril contain [[Infrared radiation|infrared]] (heat) receptors, enabling them to find and perhaps judge the size of their small, warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name="Fang2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fang | first=Janet | title=Snake infrared detection unravelled | journal=Nature | date=2010-03-14 | doi=10.1038/news.2010.122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of [[Felidae|Felidae (cats)]] and snakes have vertically elongated (slit) pupils, advantageous for [[nocturnal]] ambush predators as it helps them to estimate the distance to prey in dim light; diurnal and pursuit predators in contrast have round pupils.&lt;ref name="BanksSpragueSchmoll Parnell2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Banks | first=M.

==Capturing the prey==

Ambush predators often have adaptations for seizing their prey rapidly and securely.

All fishes face a basic problem when trying to swallow prey: opening their mouth may pull food in, but closing it will push the food out again. Frogfishes capture their prey by suddenly opening their jaws, with a mechanism which enlarges the volume of the mouth cavity up to 12-fold and pulls the prey ([[crustaceans]], [[molluscs]] and other whole fishes) into the mouth along with water; the jaws close without reducing the volume of the mouth cavity. The attack can be as fast as 6 milliseconds,&lt;ref name=BrayFishes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Dianne|title=Eastern Frogfish, Batrachomoeus dubius|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2835|website=Fishes of Australia|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3484">'''Andrew Carnegie Whitfield''' (born 1910), the nephew of wealthy steel magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Missing person|mysteriously disappeared]] shortly after he departed from Roosevelt Field on [[Long Island, New York]] on the morning of April 17, 1938.

==Early life==
Whitfield was a graduate of [[Princeton University]] and had been employed as a business executive.  An amateur pilot, Whitfield owned a small red and silver [[Taylor Cub]] airplane which he occasionally flew (mostly for recreation).  At the time of his disappearance, he had accumulated 200 hours of flying experience.

==Disappearance==
When Whitfield departed in his small silver and red Taylor Cub [[monoplane]], he had planned to land at an airfield in [[Brentwood, New York]] (approximately {{convert|22|mi}} away).  He was only supposed to be in the air for fifteen minutes, but Andrew never arrived as scheduled.  One source reported that Whitfield's plane had been flying steadily—but then Whitfield "nosed his plane into a mild easterly wind, [and] disappeared from sight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848917,00.html|title=People, May 2, 1938|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=August 28, 2012|date=May 2, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His plane had enough fuel for a 150-mile flight.  [[List of aerial disappearances|Neither Whitfield nor his plane has ever been recovered]].

An investigation discovered that (on the same day he vanished) he had checked into a hotel in Garden City on Long Island under an alias he occasionally employed:  "Albert C. White."  Hotel records indicated that Whitfield/White had paid $4 in advance for the room and never checked out.  When the hotel room was searched, it was discovered that his personal belongings (including his passport), clothing, cuff links engraved with his initials, two life insurance policies (in his name listing his wife, Elizabeth Halsey Whitfield, as the beneficiary), and several stock and bond certificates made out in Andrew's and Elizabeth's names, were all left behind in the hotel room. Phone records also indicated that he had called his home while his family was out looking for him, and a telephone operator reported that she heard him say over the phone, "Well, I am going to carry out my plan."

Police concluded that Whitfield had committed suicide by deliberately flying his plane into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] despite there being no evidence to substantiate this theory.  Although a thorough search of the coastal areas surrounding [[Long Island]] was conducted,  no plane wreckage was ever discovered.  There was no evidence that at the time of Whitfield's disappearance he was having any personal or business problems. Whitfield had married (formerly  Elizabeth Halsey) earlier that year and had been planning to move to [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] (with his new wife) the same month that he disappeared.

'''Anthony, Duke of Brabant''', also known as '''Antoine de Brabant''', '''Antoine de Bourgogne''' and '''Anthony of Burgundy''' (August 1384 &amp;ndash; 25 October 1415, at the [[battle of Agincourt]]), was Count of Rethel (1402–1406), [[Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg]] (1406–1415), and Co-Duke of Luxemburg (1411-1415). 

== Biography ==
Anthony was the son of [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy]], and [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders]], and brother of [[John the Fearless]].&lt;ref&gt;Willem Pieter Blockmans and Walter Prevenier, ''The Promised Lands: The Low Countries under Burgundian rule, 1369-1530'', (University Pennsylvania Press, 1999), 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; When his grandaunt [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Joanna]] died childless in 1406, Anthony inherited the [[Duchy of Brabant]], [[Duke of Lothier|Lothier]], and [[Duke of Limburg|Limburg]], thus becoming the first Brabantian ruler of the [[House of Valois]].

The Duke of Brabant arrived late to the [[Battle of Agincourt]], and in his eagerness to reach the field, he dressed in improvised armour and wore a surcoat made from a trumpeter's flag. He fought valiantly but was captured by some English archers. He was executed along with the rest of the prisoners ordered by [[Henry V of England]], the English being unaware of his high status and [[ransom]] value.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Battle of Agincourt: Sources and Interpretations''', ed. Anne Curry, (The Boydell Press, 2000), 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution was carried out as the much smaller English force found itself stretched to its limits, guarding prisoners with the battle still not won. A counterattack on the King's baggage train (guarded only by women and children) is thought to have driven [[Henry V of England|King Henry]] to the decision, thinking he was being attacked from the rear and some chroniclers have given Brabant's belated charge as this very cause, adding to the Duke's chivalric but tragic final story (see "Agincourt", J. Barker 2005). Subsequently the executions stopped immediately the attack was seen to falter.

== Marriages and family ==
He married at [[Arras]] on 21 February 1402 Jeanne de St. Pol (d. 1407), daughter of [[Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny]] and [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|Saint-Pol]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vaughan, ''Philip the Bold'', (The Boydell Press, 2009), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children:
*[[John IV, Duke of Brabant]] (1403&amp;ndash;1427)
*[[Philip I, Duke of Brabant|Philip of St. Pol]] (1404&amp;ndash;1430), [[Duke of Brabant]]

He married again at [[Brussels]], on 16 July 1409, [[Elisabeth of Görlitz]], duchess of [[Luxembourg]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vaughan, ''Philip the Bold'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; (November 1390  &amp;ndash; 8 August 1451), daughter of [[John, Duke of Görlitz]]. They had two children:
*William (2 June 1410 &amp;ndash; 10 July 1410, Brussels)
*unknown (1412)
He also had two illegitimate daughters.

'''Autonomic computing''' (also known as '''AC''') refers to the [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing]] characteristics of [[distributed computing]] resources, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by [[IBM]] in 2001, this initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing [[systems management]], and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth.&lt;ref name="Kephart"&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1109/MC.2003.1160055|title=The vision of autonomic computing|year=2003|last1=Kephart|first1=J.O.|last2=Chess|first2=D.M.|journal=Computer|volume=36|pages=41–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The AC system concept is designed to make adaptive decisions, using high-level policies. It will constantly check and optimize its status and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions.  An autonomic computing framework is composed of autonomic [[Software component|component]]s (AC) interacting with each other. An AC can be modeled in terms of two main control schemes (local and global) with [[sensor]]s (for [[self-monitoring]]), [[Actuator|effectors]] (for self-adjustment), knowledge and planner/adapter for exploiting policies based on self- and environment awareness. This architecture is sometimes referred to as Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE).

Driven by such vision, a variety of architectural frameworks based on "[[homoeostasis|self-regulating]]" autonomic components has been recently proposed. A very similar trend has recently characterized significant research in the area of [[multi-agent system]]s. However, most of these approaches are typically conceived with centralized or cluster-based server architectures in mind and mostly address the need of reducing management costs rather than the need of enabling complex software systems or providing innovative services. Some [[#Autonomic systems|autonomic systems]] involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padovitz|first=Amir|author2=Arkady Zaslavsky|author3= Seng W. Loke|title=Awareness and Agility for Autonomic Distributed Systems: Platform-Independent Publish-Subscribe Event-Based Communication for Mobile Agents|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'03)|year=2003|pages=669–673|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/dexa/2003/1993/00/19930669-abs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Autonomy-oriented computation'' is a paradigm proposed by Jiming Liu in 2001 that uses artificial systems imitating [[social animals]]' collective behaviours to solve difficult computational problems. For example, [[ant colony optimization]] could be studied in this paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-25928-2_13|isbn= 978-3-540-22477-8|chapter=From Individual Based Modeling to Autonomy Oriented Computation|title=Agents and Computational Autonomy|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2004|last1=Jin|first1=Xiaolong|last2=Liu|first2=Jiming|volume=2969|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem of growing complexity ==
Forecasts suggest that the  computing devices in use will grow at 38% per year&lt;ref name="IBM1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn |title=Autonomic Computing:IBM’s Perspective on the State of Information Technology |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/autonomic_computing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916160342/http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/autonomic_computing.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the average complexity of each device is increasing.&lt;ref name="IBM1"/&gt; Currently, this volume and complexity is managed by highly skilled humans; but the demand for skilled IT personnel is already outstripping supply, with labour costs exceeding equipment costs by a ratio of up to 18:1.&lt;ref&gt;‘Trends in technology’, survey, Berkeley University of California, USA, March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computing systems have brought great benefits of speed and automation but there is now an overwhelming economic need to automate their maintenance.

In a 2003 [[IEEE]] ''[[Computer Magazine]]'' article, Kephart and Chess &lt;ref name="Kephart"/&gt;
warn that the dream of interconnectivity of computing systems and devices could become the “nightmare of [[pervasive computing]]” in which architects are unable to anticipate, design and maintain the [[complexity]] of interactions. They state the essence of autonomic computing is system self-management, freeing administrators from low-level task management while delivering better system behavior.

A general problem of modern [[Distributed systems|distributed computing systems]] is that their [[complexity]], and in particular the complexity of their management, is becoming a significant limiting factor in their further development. Large companies and institutions are employing large-scale [[computer network]]s for communication and computation. The distributed applications running on these computer networks are diverse and deal with many tasks, ranging from internal control processes to presenting web content to customer support.

Additionally, [[mobile computing]] is pervading these networks at an increasing speed: employees need to communicate with their companies while they are not in their office. They do so by using [[laptop]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s, or [[mobile phones]] with diverse forms of [[wireless]] technologies to access their companies' data.

This creates an enormous complexity in the overall computer network which is hard to control manually by human operators. Manual control is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. The manual effort needed to control a growing networked computer-system tends to increase very quickly.

80% of such problems in infrastructure happen at the client specific application and database layer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Most 'autonomic' service providers{{Who|date=July 2010}} guarantee only up to the basic plumbing layer (power, hardware, operating system, network and basic database parameters).

== Characteristics of autonomic systems ==

A possible solution could be to enable modern, networked computing systems to manage themselves without direct human intervention. The ''Autonomic Computing Initiative'' (ACI) aims at providing the foundation for autonomic systems. It is inspired by the [[autonomic nervous system]] of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/autonomic-computing&lt;/ref&gt; This nervous system controls important bodily functions (e.g. respiration, [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure]]) without any conscious intervention.

In a [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing]] autonomic system, the human operator takes on a new role: instead of controlling the system directly, he/she defines general policies and rules that guide the self-management process. For this process, IBM defined the following four types of property referred to as self-star (also called self-*, self-x, or auto-*) properties.

#[[Self-optimization]]: Automatic monitoring and control of resources to ensure the optimal functioning with respect to the defined requirements;
#Self-protection: Proactive identification and protection from arbitrary attacks.

Others such as Poslad &lt;ref name="Poslad"/&gt; and Nami and Bertel &lt;ref name="Nami"&gt;
{{cite journal |last = Nami | first = M.R. |author2=Bertels, K.| title = A survey of autonomic computing systems  |  year = 2007 | pages=26–30 | conference=3rd International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have expanded on the set of self-star as follows:
#[[homoeostasis|Self-regulation]]: A system that operates to maintain some parameter, e.g., [[Quality of service]], within a reset range without external control;
#Self-learning: Systems use machine learning techniques such as [[unsupervised learning]] which does not require external control;
#[[Self-awareness]] (also called Self-inspection and Self-decision): System must know itself. It must know the extent of its own resources and the resources it links to. A system must be aware of its internal components and external links in order to control and manage them;
#[[Self-organization]]: System structure driven by physics-type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system;
#Self-creation (also called [[Self-assembly]], [[Self-replication]]): System driven by ecological and social type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system. A system’s members are self-motivated and self-driven, generating complexity and order in a creative response to a continuously changing strategic demand;
#Self-management (also called self-governance): A system that manages itself without external intervention. What is being managed can vary dependent on the system and application. Self -management also refers to a set of self-star processes such as autonomic computing rather than a single self-star process;
#Self-description (also called self-explanation or Self-representation): A system explains itself. It is capable of being understood (by humans) without further explanation. {{see also|Reflection (computer programming)}}

IBM has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/autonomic_computing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The system must
# know itself in terms of what resources it has access to, what its capabilities and limitations are and how and why it is connected to other systems;
# be able to automatically configure and reconfigure itself depending on the changing computing environment;
# be able to optimize its performance to ensure the most efficient computing process;
# be able to work around encountered problems by either repairing itself or routing functions away from the trouble;
# detect, identify and protect itself against various types of attacks to maintain overall system security and integrity;
# adapt to its environment as it changes, interacting with neighboring systems and establishing communication protocols;
# rely on open standards and cannot exist in a proprietary environment;
# anticipate the demand on its resources while staying transparent to users.

Even though the purpose and thus the behaviour of autonomic systems vary from system to system, every autonomic system should be able to exhibit a minimum set of properties to achieve its purpose:

#[[Automaticity|Automatic]]: This essentially means being able to self-control its internal functions and operations. As such, an autonomic system must be self-contained and able to start-up and operate without any manual intervention or external help. Again, the knowledge required to bootstrap the system (''Know-how'') must be inherent to the system.
#[[Adaptive]]: An autonomic system must be able to change its operation (i.e., its configuration, state and functions). This will allow the system to cope with temporal and spatial changes in its operational context either long term (environment customisation/optimisation) or short term (exceptional conditions such as malicious attacks, faults, etc.).
#[[Awareness|Aware]]: An autonomic system must be able to monitor (sense) its operational context as well as its internal state in order to be able to assess if its current operation serves its purpose. Awareness will control adaptation of its operational behaviour in response to context or state changes.

==Evolutionary levels==
IBM defined five evolutionary levels, or the ''autonomic deployment model'', for the deployment of autonomic systems:
*Level 1 is the basic level that presents the current situation where systems are essentially managed manually.
*Levels 2 - 4 introduce increasingly automated management functions, while
*level 5 represents the ultimate goal of autonomic, self-managing systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/464.wss&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design patterns==
The design complexity of Autonomic Systems can be simplified by utilizing [[design patterns]] such as the [[model-view-controller]] (MVC) pattern to improve [[separation of concerns|concern separation]] by [[encapsulation (computer programming)|encapsulating]] functional concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1109/MS.2008.60|title=Flexible Self-Management Using the Model-View-Controller Pattern|year=2008|last1=Curry|first1=Edward|last2=Grace|first2=Paul|journal=IEEE Software|volume=25|issue=3|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control loops ==

A basic concept that will be applied in Autonomic Systems are [[closed control loop]]s. This well-known concept stems from [[Process Control]] Theory. Essentially, a closed control loop in a self-managing system monitors some resource (software or hardware component) and autonomously tries to keep its parameters within a desired range.

According to IBM, hundreds or even thousands of these control loops are expected to work in a large-scale self-managing computer system.

== Conceptual model ==
[[Image:AutonomicSystemModel.png|right|300px]]
A fundamental building block of an autonomic system is the sensing capability (''Sensors S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), which enables the system to observe its external operational context. Inherent to an autonomic system is the knowledge of the ''Purpose'' (intention) and the ''Know-how'' to operate itself (e.g., [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]], configuration knowledge, interpretation of sensory data, etc.) without external intervention. The actual operation of the autonomic system is dictated by the ''Logic'', which is responsible for making the right decisions to serve its ''Purpose'', and influence by the observation of the operational context (based on the sensor input).

This model highlights the fact that the operation of an autonomic system is purpose-driven. This includes its mission (e.g., the service it is supposed to offer), the policies (e.g., that define the basic behaviour), and the “[[survival instinct]]”. If seen as a control system this would be encoded as a feedback error function or in a heuristically assisted system as an algorithm combined with set of [[heuristic]]s bounding its operational space.

'''Bask''', (1956–1979) bred at the [[Albigowa]] State Stud in Poland and foaled in 1956, was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] [[stallion]] who was imported into the United States in 1963 by Dr. Eugene LaCroix of Lasma Arabians and became a major sire of significance in the Arabian breed.

==Ancestry and early history==

Bask's sire was Witraz, by the famed Ofir, who also sired [[Witez II]]. His dam was Balalajka, a daughter of Amurath-Sahib,&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;Carpenter ''Legends'' pp. 14–29&lt;/ref&gt; deemed one of Poland's finest broodmares.&lt;ref name=Albigowa/&gt; He was sent to the race track, as it was typical in the time for horses to be sent to race as three-year-olds in order to determine the horse's athletic ability and soundness.&lt;ref name=AHApolish&gt;[http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_polish.asp   "Arabian Horse – Bloodlines – Polish Arabians" Arabian Horse Association.  Web page accessed December 10, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917100354/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_polish.asp |date=September 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Albigowa ceased breeding Arabians,&lt;ref name=Albigowa/&gt; so after his [[horse racing]] career, Bask was sent to the [[Janow Podlaski]] stud.

Bask was a member of a "family" of considerable significance.  All but one of Balalajka's progeny were by Witraz, and hence full siblings to Bask.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/index.php?h=balalajka&amp;g=5&amp;query_type=progeny&amp;search_bar=progeny&amp;done=y&amp;inbred=Standard&amp;x2=n&amp;username=&amp;password=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Progeny of Balalajka]&lt;/ref&gt;  His full sister Arfa was the dam of Argos, who was an important sire in Great Britain for Patricia Lindsay.&lt;ref name=Archer44&gt;Archer ''The Arabian Horse'' p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; His full sister Bandola was a mare of significance known as "the Queen of Poland", and was the dam of Bandos, by Negatiw.&lt;ref name=Albigowa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/bandos Pedigree of Bandos]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bask's 3/4 sister Bachantka (by Wielki Szlem) had been imported to the United States in 1961 by [[Sheila Varian|Varian Arabians]], where she was a Top Ten champion and major foundation [[mare (horse)|mare]] for the Varian program.

Bask's name was chosen by Roman Pankiewicz,&lt;ref name=Pankiewicz&gt;[http://www.polskiearaby.com/?page=ludzie_i_konie&amp;lang=en&amp;id=51 Luft, Monika. "There's no recipe for breeding" (Interview with Roman Pankiewicz). Polskiearaby.com.  October 22,2010.  Web site accessed December 10.2010]&lt;/ref&gt; who was deputy manager of Albigowa at the time.&lt;ref name=Albigowa&gt;[http://www.albigowa.com.pl/stadnina/ang/1944_66.php "History of the Stud in Years 1944–1956" Stud Farm Albigowa.  Web site accessed December 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pankiewicz stated, "I always tried to give horses short, nice names, easy to translate – because their export had already begun in those times. And Bask [in Polish] is a courageous inhabitant of the Basque Country in Spain...the Basques are hard-working people. And so the horse became Bask. That name suited him like no other."&lt;ref name=Pankiewicz/&gt;

==Accomplishments in Poland and America==
Having [[horse racing|raced]] extensively in Poland, (4/40, 8/7/7)  Bask was not evaluated as breeding stock until he was six.  He never was put to stud in Poland, because the [[Janów Podlaski]] stud already stood a number of Witraz sons.  For this reason, the Poles were also willing to sell him.&lt;ref name="Legacy"&gt;[http://www.ahlegacy.com/baskbiography.htm Bask Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043027/http://www.ahlegacy.com/baskbiography.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}, web site accessed October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was actually scheduled to be [[gelding|gelded]] upon his return from the track, but instead was purchased for the relatively modest sum of $3000 by Dr. LaCroix, who initially intended to resell him to a Swedish breeder, but when that sale fell through, took the horse to America.&lt;ref name=Pankiewicz/&gt;

Upon arrival in the United States, after a very rough journey by ship, Bask was put to stud and retrained for the show ring.   Bask earned his Legion of Merit from the International Arabian Horse Association (now [[Arabian Horse Association]]), and was the 1964 United States National Champion [[Halter (horse show)|Halter]] stallion and the 1965 United States National [[Saddle seat#Show Classes|Park horse]] Champion, one of only four Arabian stallions to ever win national championships in both halter and performance. He was also 1967 reserve national champion in the [[driving (horse)|harness driving]] equivalent of park, formal driving.&lt;ref name="Legacy"/&gt;  He is the only horse to have ever won dual national championships in halter and park.&lt;ref name=KHP&gt;[http://www.kyhorsepark.com/attractions-activities/sculpture-of-the-park/ "Sculptures of the Park" Kentucky Horse Park.  Accessed December 10, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810020221/http://www.kyhorsepark.com/attractions-activities/sculpture-of-the-park/ |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on American breeding==
Bask sired 1050 [[purebred]] Arabian [[foals]], most in the time before [[artificial insemination]] was widespread in the horse industry, and 196 of these were United States or Canadian National Champions.&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; His impact on American Arabian horse breeding has been described as "colossal".&lt;ref name=Archer80&gt;Archer ''The Arabian Horse'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Bask died on July 24, 1979 from [[horse colic|colic]].&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; His body is now interred at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in its Champions Cemetery, and he is honored with a bronze statue in the lobby of the [[International Museum of the Horse]].&lt;ref name=KHP/&gt;

'''Boleslaus, son of Děpolt''' (Czech: Boleslav Děpoltovic) (1182 or 1183 – April 9 1241 at [[Battle of Legnica]]) also known as '''"Szepiołka"'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poczet.com/przemyslidzi.htm# „Królewska” linia Przemyślidów].&lt;/ref&gt; was a Moravian Prince. He was the son of [[Děpolt III]], and brother to Děpolt IV, Soběslav I, and Otto of the {{ill|Děpolt family|cs|Děpoltici}} (a [[cadet branch]] of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]). He died as a childless bachelor. 
[[File:Warszawa summer 2015 070.JPG|left|thumb|300px|''Klęska Legnicka'' by Jan Matejko, a royal funeral depicting the bodies of the fallen of Legnica; '''Boleslaus Děpolt''' is on the first left catafalque. ]]

== Life ==
In 1202, he was banished by the king [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]], and he later returned in 1204. For the second time he was exiled in 1233 or 1234 by the king [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]]. At that time, he went to the court  [[Henryk I Brodaty]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Maroń]]: ''Koczownicy i rycerze. Najazd Mongołów na Polskę w 1241 roku na tle sztuki wojennej Europy XII i XIII w.'', Wodzisław Śląski 2011, [[Wydawnictwo Templum]], s. 116–117, {{ISBN|978-83-932793-2-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Polish medieval chronicles referred to him as the "[[Margrave of Moravia]]" but this title had no merit because Bohemia and Moravia were ruled at that time jointly by one king, [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]]. Boleslaus styled himself as ''Dux Boemiae'' ("[[Duke of Bohemia]]").  

== Legnica ==
He commanded volunteer [[Bavaria|Bavarian]] miners from Goldberg ([[Złotoryja]]) and a Moravian detachment at the [[Battle of Legnica]], alongside the Poles. During the battle he was shot by an arrow hitting below his ear.

'''Cleopatra Tawo''', known more commonly as '''Cleo Tao''' (died 1 December 2017) was a radio host at Planet FM 101.1 in [[Uyo, Akwa Ibom State]], [[Nigeria]]. She was the host of the radio shows ''DayBreak on Planet'' and ''AutoMania''. Before joining Planet FM, Tawo worked at [[Rhythm FM 93.7]] in [[Port Harcourt]], [[Rivers State]], where she hosted shows such as ''Morning Drive'', ''Afternoon Drive'', ''Sunday at the Rhythm'' and ''Midnight Caller''.&lt;ref name="Planetfm"/&gt;

==Early life==
Tawo was raised in [[Port Harcourt]], the capital of [[Rivers State]], Nigeria. She grew up in a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] family originally from [[Boki, Nigeria|Boki]], though her parents were enlightened [[wikt:liberal|liberals]] who encouraged entertainment in their home.&lt;ref name="Planetfm"/&gt;

==Career==
Tawo was trained as a lawyer before venturing into [[radio broadcasting]] in 2000. Her first professional employment as a radio host was at [[Silverbird Group|Silverbird]]'s [[Rhythm FM 93.7]] in Port Harcourt. There, she hosted several shows including ''Morning Drive'', ''Afternoon Drive'', ''Sunday at the Rhythm'' and ''Midnight Caller''. She was later employed at Planet FM 101.1 Uyo, where she hosted shows like ''Daybreak on Planet'' and ''AutoMania''. Tawo was also the station's Head Of Programmes.&lt;ref name="Planetfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planet101fm.ng/team/cleo-cleopatra-tawo/|title=Cleo (Cleopatra Tawo)|website=Planet101fm.ng|date=|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
On 19 December 2005, she was arrested along with colleague Klem Ofuokwu by agents of the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] (SSS). They were charged with airing fabricated news about a bridge failure on [[Rhythm 93.7 FM Port Harcourt]].&lt;ref name="MFWA"&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=ALERTE Nigeria : Deux journalistes taxés de faux reportage et mis en détention|url=http://www.mfwa.org/fr/alerte-nigeria-deux-journalistes-taxes-de-faux-reportage-et-mis-en-detention/|language=French|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[:de:Media Foundation for West Africa|Mfwa.org]]|date=23 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamji"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamji.com/article5000/NEWS5770.htm|title=Peter Odili: Fears For A Rainmaker!|website=Gamji|date=|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rivers State Attorney General]] [[Henry Ajumogobia]] withdrew the charges on 2 February 2006.

== Description ==
Complicated [[grief]] is considered when an individual’s ability to resume normal activities and responsibilities is continually disrupted beyond six months of bereavement. Six months is considered to be the appropriate point of CGD consideration, since studies show that most people are able to integrate bereavement into their lives by this time.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Bonanno GA, Wortman CB, Lehman DR, et al.

=== Symptoms ===
The symptoms of complicated grief are mentioned in the most-recently proposed diagnostic criteria; they include maladaptive thoughts and behaviors related to the death or the deceased, continuous emotional dysregulation about the death, social isolation and [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

=== Causes and predictors ===
Although more research is needed to determine the multiple pathways to complicated grief disorder, preexisting conditions (such as major depression, PTSD, and [[sleep disorders]]) are thought to exacerbate the interruption of the natural healing process.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

There are some known predictive characteristics for CGD.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; An individual is at increased risk for CGD if they are:

Untreated CGD has clinically significant consequences.

== Proposed diagnostic criteria ==
According to Shear et al. (2011):&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;
*The person has been bereaved (i.e. experienced the death of a loved one) for at least six months
*At least one of the following symptoms of persistent, intense, acute grief has been present for a period longer than is expected by others in the person’s social (or cultural) environment:
**Persistent intense yearning or longing for the person who died
**Frequent intense feelings of loneliness, or that life is empty or meaningless without the person who died
**Recurrent thoughts that it is unfair, meaningless or unbearable to live when a loved one has died, or a recurrent urge to die in order to find (or join) the deceased
**Frequent preoccupying thoughts about the person who died; e.g. thoughts or images of the person intrude on activities or interfere with functioning
*At least two of the following symptoms are present for at least one month:
**Frequent, troubling rumination about the circumstances (or consequences) of the death (concerns about how or why the person died, about not being able to manage without their loved one, thoughts of having let the deceased person down, etc.)
**Recurrent feeling of disbelief or inability to accept the death
**Persistent feeling of shock; feeling stunned, dazed or emotionally numb since the death
**Recurrent feelings of anger or bitterness related to the death
**Persistent difficulty trusting or caring about other people, or envy of others who have not experienced a similar loss
**Frequently experiencing pain (or other symptoms) that the deceased person had, hearing the voice of (or seeing) the deceased person
**Experiencing intense emotional or physiological reactivity to memories of the person who died or to reminders of the loss
**Changes in behavior due to avoidance (or its opposite, excessive proximity-seeking—refraining from going places, doing things, or having contact with things that are reminders of the loss; feeling drawn to reminders of the person—wanting to see, touch, hear or smell things to feel close to the person who died). Both symptoms may coexist in the same individual.
*Duration of symptoms and impairment of at least one month
*Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other major areas of functioning, where impairment is not explicable as a culturally appropriate response

== Incidence ==
CGD is an atypical grief response, occurring only in a minority of the bereaved population.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twentytwo" /&gt;  It is considered more common in those experiencing disasters,&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fortyone"&gt;Ghaffari-Nejad A, Ahmadi-Mousavi M, Gandomkar M, Reihani-Kermani H.

== {{anchor|CGD and Bereavement Related Adjustment Disorder}}CGD and bereavement-related adjustment disorder==
Although the DSM-5 work groups have suggested using "adjustment disorder, specified as bereavement-related" to diagnose complicated grief, opposing opinions contend that this does not fit the nature of CGD and is an inappropriate diagnosis for those suffering from CGD.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventyone"&gt;Shear, M. K. (2011). BEREAVEMENT AND THE DSM5. Omega-Journal of Death and Dying, 64(2), 101-118. doi:10.2190&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Ethical Considerations}}Ethical considerations ==
=== {{anchor|Pathologizing or misdiagnosing normal grief}}Medicalizing (or misdiagnosing) normal grief ===
Following the DSM-5 work groups’ recommendation to remove the bereavement-exclusionary criteria,&lt;ref name="seventy"&gt;Wakefield and First, 2012 Wakefield JC, First MB. Validity of the bereavement exclusion to major depression: does the empirical evidence support the proposal to eliminate the exclusion in DSM-5?. World Psychiatry 2012; 11: 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; there is some concern that the addition of CGD may increase the possibility of [[Medicalization|medicalizing]] the grieving process. However, proponents of CGD claim that with proper clinical assessment only those with abnormally incapacitating levels of grief will receive this diagnosis and benefit from treatment. Furthermore, despite the possibility of diagnosis-related stigma the clinical necessity for treatment is a priority for those suffering from CGD.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

=== Cultural norms for grief ===
An individual’s culture plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is necessary to consider cultural norms before reaching a CGD diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; There are cultural differences in expected emotional levels, their expression and duration; the external symptoms of grief differ in non-Western cultures, presenting increased [[somatization]].&lt;ref name="seventythree"&gt;Horwitz, A.

The hypothesis was supported by a 1998 study of 1700 [[University of Pennsylvania]] alumni over a period of 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1035–41 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199804093381506 |title=Aging, Health Risks, and Cumulative Disability |year=1998 |last1=Vita |first1=Anthony J. |last2=Terry |first2=Richard B. |last3=Hubert |first3=Helen B. |last4=Fries |first4=James F. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=338 |issue=15 |pmid=9535669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fries' hypothesis is that the burden of lifetime illness may be compressed into a shorter period before the time of death, if the age of onset of the first chronic infirmity can be postponed.&lt;ref name="Fries"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1163–6 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.135731 |pmc=2424092 |title=James Fries: Healthy Aging Pioneer |year=2008 |last1=Swartz |first1=Aimee |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=98 |issue=7 |pmid=18511711}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis contrasts to the view that as the age of countries' populations tends to increase over time, they will become increasingly infirm and consume an ever-larger proportion of the national budget in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;"The compression of morbidity was prophetic in the sense that Jim looked at the reduction of morbidity and disability at a time when most gerontologists and epidemiologists thought we would see a pandemic of disability." —Richard Suzman, quoted in {{harvnb|Swartz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fries posited that if the hypothesis is confirmed, healthcare costs and patient health overall will be improved.&lt;ref name="Fries"/&gt; In order to confirm this hypothesis, the evidence must show that it is possible to delay the onset of infirmity, and that corresponding increases in longevity will at least be modest. The evidence is at best mixed.  Vincent Mor's "The Compression of Morbidity Hypothesis: A Review of Research and Prospects for the Future" argues that "Cross-national evidence for the validity of the compression of morbidity hypothesis originally proposed by Fries is generally accepted. Generational improvements in education and the increased availability of adaptive technologies and even medical treatments that enhance quality of life have facilitated continued independence of older persons in the industrialized world. Whether this trend continues may depend upon the effect of the obesity epidemic on the next generation of older people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53496.x|title=The Compression of Morbidity Hypothesis: A Review of Research and Prospects for the Future|last=Mor|first=Vincent|date=2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also "Mortality and Morbidity Trends: Is There Compression of Morbidity?" for recent evidence against the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crimmins|first=Eileen M.|last2=Beltrán-Sánchez|first2=Hiram|date=2011-01-01|title=Mortality and Morbidity Trends: Is There Compression of Morbidity?|url=https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/66B/1/75/583170/Mortality-and-Morbidity-Trends-Is-There|journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series B|volume=66B|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1093/geronb/gbq088|issn=1079-5014|pmc=3001754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1982, [[Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev]], the third [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) and the fifth [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]], died aged 75, a month before his 76th birthday after suffering a [[heart attack]] following years of serious ailments. His death was officially acknowledged on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television. After five days of national mourning, Brezhnev was given a [[state funeral]] and then [[Burial|buried]] in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. [[Yuri Andropov]], Brezhnev's eventual successor as general secretary, was chairman of the committee in charge of managing Brezhnev's funeral, held on 15 November 1982, five days after his death.

The funeral was attended by 32 [[heads of state]], 15 [[heads of government]], 14 [[foreign ministers]] and four [[prince]]s; U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] sent [[George H. W. Bush]], the [[Vice President of the United States]]. Eulogies were delivered by Yuri Andropov, [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], [[Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov|Anatoly Alexandrov]], and a factory worker.

==Death and declaration==
{{Leonid Brezhnev series}}
Brezhnev had struggled with several ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, [[leukemia]], jaw [[cancer]], [[emphysema]] and circulatory disease, all of which had been exacerbated by his heavy smoking and obesity. There had been rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s; he had been absent from important meetings demanded by [[protocol (politics)|protocol]] and it was rumoured that his health was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Blake, Patricia|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955024,00.html | title = The Soviets: A Mix of Caution and Opportunism | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the [[Soviet Government]] insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a [[heart attack]].{{sfn|Service|2009|p=426}} He was honored with a state funeral in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] on the [[Red Square]] after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.&lt;ref name="rumours"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/10/newsid_2516000/2516417.stm | title = 1982: Brezhnev rumours sweep Moscow | publisher = [[BBC Online]] | date= 10 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first hint of his death to the [[Soviet people]] came at 7:15 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]] [[Moscow Time]], when the usual television programs were altered and a pop music concert was replaced by a documentary on [[Vladimir Lenin]]. On ''[[Vremya]]'', the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal [[dress code]]. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an [[ice hockey]] game on [[Channel Two (Russia)|Channel Two]] with [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Pathétique'' symphony]]. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by [[Soviet radio]] and [[Television in the Soviet Union|television]] hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The television announcement was read by [[Igor Kirillov]] with tears in his eyes at 11 [[24-hour clock|a.m.]] Moscow Time.{{sfn|Schmidt-Häuer|1986|p=80}}

[[First World]] commentators had already speculated that Brezhnev had died when he failed to sign a message of congratulations to [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], the [[President of Angola]], for the Angolan [[Public holidays in Angola|Independence Day]]. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the [[Soviet leadership]] over who would succeed him. [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was seen as the most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.&lt;ref name="rumours"/&gt;

==Funeral service==
On 11 November [[Yuri Andropov]] was elected chairman of the committee in charge of managing Brezhnev's funeral. This election marked the beginning of Brezhnev's funeral. The occasion was seen as a sign by [[First World]] commentators that Andropov was the most likely candidate for the position of general secretary.{{sfn|White|2000||p=211}}

During the funerals of Soviet leaders there was a custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin.&lt;ref name ="Pravda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/07-09-2009/109122-funeral-0/|title= Most Pompous Funeral Ceremonies of All Times Were Held in Soviet Union|work=[[Pravda]]|accessdate= 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it.&lt;ref name ="Pravda"/&gt; However, as Brezhnev had more than two hundred decorations, several were placed on each cushion.&lt;ref name ="Pravda"/&gt; Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.&lt;ref name ="Pravda"/&gt;

[[Galina Brezhneva]], Brezhnev's disgraced daughter, was constantly followed by two burly guards. Andropov, Brezhnev's successor as general secretary, embraced [[Viktoria Brezhneva]] but allegedly turned his back to Galina.{{sfn|Nikolaevna|1994|p=211}} This claim has been disputed, with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article dating back to 1982 claiming that Andropov embraced both, and not just Viktoria.&lt;ref name="TimeTwo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, during Andropov's fifteen-month rule Galina stopped appearing in public.{{sfn|Nikolaevna|1994|p=211}} At the funeral, Andropov praised Brezhnev for his "struggle for the relaxation of international tensions and for delivering mankind from the threat of nuclear war" and his [[détente]] policy.{{sfn|Raymond|1994|p=86}} Andrei Kirilenko, a leading [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] member, burst into tears when confronting Viktoria at the funeral.&lt;ref name="TimeTwo"/&gt;

The Moscow ''[[militsiya]]'' sealed off downtown Moscow&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt; during the funeral on 15 November.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=398}} Large avenues were tightly guarded by the police and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who stood in front of the [[House of the Unions]], wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous [[red flag (politics)|red flags]] and other [[communist symbolism|communist symbols]].&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt; Brezhnev's body [[Lying in state|lay in state]] for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green [[BRDM-2]] armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the [[Lenin Mausoleum]] on the [[Red Square]], where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence]] [[Dmitriy Ustinov]]; [[Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov|Anatoly Alexandrov]], the President of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union|Academy of Sciences]]; and a factory worker.&lt;ref name="ATimeOne"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Blake, Patricia |author2=Amfitheatrof, Erik |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955078,00.html | title = Soviet Union: The Andropov Era Begins | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 29 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and [[Nikolai Tikhonov]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Soviet national anthem]].&lt;ref name="ATimeTwo"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Blake, Patricia |author2=Amfitheatrof, Erik |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955078-2,00.html | title = Soviet Union: The Andropov Era Begins | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 29 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Time'' magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of [[Soviet people|Soviets]].&lt;ref name="TimeThree"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057-3,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brezhnev's body reportedly sustained two falls. As the coffin was lifted into place for the lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole.{{sfn|Bacon, Edward; Sandle, Mark|2002|p=3}} This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he was asked by the Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.lv/story/10231.html|script-title=ru:Прощание с Великими |publisher=Gazeta 2.0|language=Russian|accessdate= 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign dignitaries==
The funeral was attended by 32 [[heads of state]], 15 [[heads of government]], 14 [[foreign ministers]] and four [[prince]]s.&lt;ref name="ATimeTwo"/&gt; Among the foreign dignitaries to attend the funeral were [[List of heads of state of Cambodia|President]] and [[Cambodian People's Party#Party leaders|General Secretary]] [[Heng Samrin]] of [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Kampuchea]], [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Mauroy]] of [[France]],&lt;ref name="TimeFour"/&gt; [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] of [[India]], [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Babrak Karmal]] of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]], [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Minister]] [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]] of [[China]], [[Yasser Arafat]] of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Polish United Workers' Party#Party leaders|First Secretary]] and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] of [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[President of Ethiopia|President]] [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] of [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[President of Mali|President]] [[Moussa Traoré]] of [[Mali]], [[Leadership of East Germany|State Chairman]] and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#General Secretaries of the Central Committee of the SED|General Secretary]] [[Erich Honecker]] of [[East Germany]],  [[President of Romania|President]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[President of Syria|President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] of [[Syria]], among others.&lt;ref name="ATimeTwo" /&gt;  Assad declared seven days of mourning in Syria when Brezhnev's death was announced.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=398}} Also in attendance was [[Pierre Trudeau]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]], who brought along his son and future Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Trudeau, Justin | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2014/10/17/justin_trudeaus_memoir_my_father_was_never_the_same_man.html | title = Justin Trudeau's memoir: 'My father was never the same man’ | work = [[Toronto Star]] | date= 17 October 2014 | accessdate = 2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[President of the United States]], did not attend but sent a delegation headed by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.

[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[George Shultz]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Director [[William Casey]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[William P. Clark]] tried to persuade Reagan to attend the funeral. Reagan rejected the idea; furthermore, he stated that he had no intention to alter US policy towards the Soviet Union because of Brezhnev's death.&lt;ref name="TimeFour"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057-4,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condolences==
Among notable condolences was one from [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[President of the United States]], who woke up at 3:35&amp;nbsp;a.m. to write a two-paragraph message about Brezhnev. Reagan called Brezhnev "one of the world's most important figures for nearly two decades" and expressed hopes for the improvement of [[Soviet Union–United States relations|Soviet–US relations]].&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] promised "a particular thought for the memory of the illustrious departed one",&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt; while former [[West German]] [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Schmidt]] said Brezhnev's death would "be painfully felt".&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt; The [[government of the People's Republic of China|government]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) expressed "deep condolences" and [[Indira Gandhi]], the [[Prime Minister of India]], said "he [Brezhnev] stood by us in our moment of need".&lt;ref name="TimeThree"/&gt;

The '''European Calcium Society''' is a non-profit society that aims to develop relationships between different generations of scientists in Europe working in the field of [[calcium signaling]] and the [[protein]]s involved in the Calcium Toolkit.

== Origin ==

The First European Symposium took place in 1989 and covered [[Calcium metabolism|calcium binding proteins]] in normal and transformed cells. The symposium resulted from a 30 month gestation.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The symposium filled a gap given the lack of European fora in which young European researchers could participate (the International Symposium was held in [[Asilomar State Beach|Asilomar, CA]] 1986, in [[Nagoya]] in 1988, in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff, Canada]], etc.)

A [[European Union]] grant called Stimulation Action was awarded to [[Roland Pochet]] in November 1986. Long discussions in 1988 between Pochet and Jacques Haiech at [[Mont Sainte-Odile]] who pointed out the importance of European researchers in calcium binding proteins (Hamoir, Liége,1955,&lt;ref name=Hamoir1955&gt;

==History==

1997 was important because the “European Calcium Society” was registered under E.U. guidelines, which had earlier rejected a proposal to finance the fourth symposium because of lack of structure. In 1997 they created the group's first ECS Web site,&lt;ref&gt;[http://calciumsociety.eu Official ECS website]&lt;/ref&gt; logo, newsletter and a set of statutes published in the “Moniteur belge” as an “Arrêté Royal du 22 septembre 1997” signed by [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv/tsvf.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1998-2005 ==

1998-2005 was a consolidation period. Since 2000, ECS has been selected as an EU High-level Scientific Conference allowing it to offer grants to young European researchers. The board was enlarged to include Volker Gerke and Steve Moss. ECS provided posters, prizes and recently special grants for young researchers.

== Youth emphasis ==
Since its creation, 30 to 35% of the participants at ECS symposia were young researchers (below 35 years old). Encouraging young researchers to participate has always been one of the main objectives.

==Publication==

Since 1992 Heizmann has sponsored the publication of significant articles in the scientific journal [[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]]. A newsletter is also produced twice a year (May and November).

==Workshops==

In 2007, ECS launched its first workshop, in [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]] (France). The second took place in June 2009 in [[Smolenice]] (Slovakia).

The '''exposome''' encompasses the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]s from conception onwards, complementing the [[genome]],  first proposed in 2005 by a [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]]. As of 2016 it may not be possible to measure or model.

==Definition==
The exposome was first proposed in 2005 by  [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]] Christopher Paul Wild in an article entitled "Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wild |first=CP |title= Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology |journal= Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention |date= Aug 2005 |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=1847–50 |pmid= 16103423 |doi= 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Rappaport SM, Smith MT |year=2010 |title= Epidemiology.

In his 2005 article, Wild stated, "At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course [[environmental exposure]]s (including [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors), from the [[prenatal]] period onwards." The concept was first proposed to draw attention to the need for better and more complete environmental exposure data for causal research, in order to balance the investment in genetics. According to Wild,  even incomplete versions of the exposome could be useful to [[epidemiology]]. In 2012, Wild outlined methods, including personal sensors, [[biomarker]]s, and '[[omics]]' technologies, to better define the exposome.&lt;ref name="Wild 24–32"/&gt; He described three overlapping domains within the exposome:
# a general [[external environment]] including the [[urban environment]], [[education]], [[climate]] factors, [[social capital]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]],
# a specific external environment with specific [[contaminant]]s, [[radiation]],  [[infection]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors (e.g. [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]]), [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[physical activity]], etc.
# an internal environment to include internal biological factors such as [[metabolic]] factors, [[hormones]], [[gut microflora]], [[inflammation]], [[oxidative stress]].
In late 2013, this definition was explained in greater depth in the first book on the exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Gary Miller |isbn= 978-0124172173
|date= 2 December 2013 |pages=118 |title= The Exposome: A Primer |publisher= Elsevier |url= https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-exposome/miller/978-0-12-417217-3|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G x E = ?| url=http://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/g-x-e/|author= Gary Miller|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Elsevier|work=Sci Connect|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2014, the same author revised the definition to include the body's response with its endogenous metabolic processes which alter the processing of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Miller Gary W. |author2=Jones Dean P. |date= January 2014 |title= The Nature of Nurture: Refining the Definition of the Exposome |journal= [[Toxicological Sciences]] |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages= 1–2 |pmid= 24213143 |doi= 10.1093/toxsci/kft251 | pmc=3871934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
For complex disorders, specific genetic causes appear to account for only 10-30% of the disease incidence, but there has been no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of [[diabetes]] have demonstrated that "environment-wide association studies" (EWAS, or exposome-wide association studies) may be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Bhattacharya, J |author3=Butte, AJ |title=An Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on type 2 diabetes mellitus.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=May 20, 2010| volume=5| issue=5| pages=e10746| pmid=20505766|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010746|pmc=2873978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Chen, R |author3=Kodama, K |author4=Ioannidis, JP |author5= Butte, AJ |title=Systematic identification of interaction effects between genome- and environment-wide associations in type 2 diabetes mellitus| url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/676/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00439-012-1258-z.pdf?auth66=1425526047_d503d7888be4f8f7c25b85cac0e83d09&amp;ext=.pdf | journal=Human Genetics| date=20 January 2013| pmid=23334806|accessdate=4 March 2015 |doi=10.1007/s00439-012-1258-z |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=495–508 |pmc=3625410}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of "E".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith Martyn T. |author2=Rappaport Stephen M. | date = August 2009 | title = Building Exposure Biology Centers to Put the E into "G × E" Interaction Studies | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 117 | issue = 8| pages = A334–A335 | pmc=2721881 | pmid=19672377 | doi=10.1289/ehp.12812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research initiatives==
As of 2016, it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, but several European projects have started to make first attempts.
In 2012, the [[European Commission]] awarded two large grants to pursue exposome-related research.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/daily-dose-of-toxics-to-be-tracked-1.11901 |title=Daily dose of toxics to be tracked |journal=Nature |volume=491 |issue=7426 |pages=647 |last1=Callaway|first1=  Ewen |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2013|doi=10.1038/491647a |pmid=23192121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HELIX project at the [[Barcelona]]-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology was launched around 2014, and aimed to develop an early-life exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrijheid |first1=M |last2=Slama |first2=R |last3=Robinson |first3=O |last4=Chatzi |first4=L |last5=Coen |first5=M |last6=van den Hazel |first6=P |last7=Thomsen |first7=C |last8=Wright |first8=J |last9=Athersuch |first9=TJ |last10=Avellana |first10=N |last11=Basagaña |first11=X |last12=Brochot |first12=C |last13=Bucchini |first13=L |last14=Bustamante |first14=M |last15=Carracedo |first15=A |last16=Casas |first16=M |last17=Estivill |first17=X |last18=Fairley |first18=L |last19=van Gent |first19=D |last20=Gonzalez |first20=JR |last21=Granum |first21=B |last22=Gražulevičienė |first22=R |last23=Gutzkow |first23=KB |last24=Julvez |first24=J |last25=Keun |first25=HC |last26=Kogevinas |first26=M |last27=McEachan |first27=RR |last28=Meltzer |first28=HM |last29=Sabidó |first29=E |last30=Schwarze |first30=PE |last31=Siroux |first31=V |last32=Sunyer |first32=J |last33=Want |first33=EJ |last34=Zeman |first34=F |last35=Nieuwenhuijsen |first35=MJ |title=The human early-life exposome (HELIX): project rationale and design. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=June 2014 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=535–44 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307204 |pmid=24610234 |pmc=4048258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A second project, Exposomics, based at [[Imperial College London]], launched in 2012, aimed to use smartphones utilizine GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exposomicsproject.eu/ About Exposomics] EU&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In late 2013, a major initiative called the "Health and Environment-Wide Associations based on Large Scale population Surveys" or HEALS, began. Touted as the largest environmental health-related study in Europe, HEALS proposes to adopt a paradigm defined by interactions between DNA sequence, epigenetic DNA modifications, gene expression, and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALS-EU.|url=http://www.heals-eu.eu/|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] hosted a meeting entitled "Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academy of Sciences meeting|url=http://nas-sites.org/emergingscience/meetings/exposome/|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] overview,  "Exposome and Exposomics", outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) has invested in technologies supporting exposome-related research including biosensors, and supports research on [[gene-environment interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIEHS Gene-Environment studies|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/gene-env/index.cfm|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genes and Environment Initiative|url=http://www.genome.gov/19518663|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP)==

The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the [[Human Genome Project]], has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but as of 2017, no such project exists. Given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud, Celia Henry (16 August 2010).

The concept of the exposome has contributed to the 2010 proposal of a new [[paradigm]] in disease [[phenotype]], "the unique disease principle": Every individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual, considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic processes including alterations in the [[interactome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, et al | year = 2013 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease | url = | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2012.214 | pmid=23307060 | pmc=3637979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as "the unique tumor principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes?

M. Esfandiary / FM-2030 Papers : 1943-2000|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change==
In the mid-1970s F.M. Esfandiary legally&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; changed his name to FM-2030 for two main reasons. Firstly, to reflect the hope and belief that he would live to celebrate his 100th birthday in 2030; secondly, and more importantly, to break free of the widespread practice of [[naming conventions]] that he saw as rooted in a [[collectivist]] mentality, and existing only as a relic of humankind's tribalistic past. He viewed traditional names as almost always stamping a label of [[collective identity]]—varying from [[gender]] to nationality—on the individual, thereby existing as prima facie elements of thought processes in the human cultural fabric, that tended to degenerate into stereotyping, factionalism, and discrimination. In his own words, "Conventional names define a person's past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [...] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time. In 2030 we will be [[ageless]] and everyone will have an excellent chance to live forever. 2030 is a dream and a goal."&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1076532 |title=Fm-2030 |publisher=NPR |date=2000-07-11 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was a lifelong vegetarian and said he would not eat anything that had a mother.&lt;ref name="cryonics 2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics2000-4.pdf |title=A Tribute to FM-2030 |access-date=2009-08-25 |last= Chamberlain|first= Fred|date=Winter 2000 |publisher=Alcor Life Extension Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; FM-2030 once said, "I am a 21st century person who was accidentally launched in the 20th. I have a deep nostalgia for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greenwich Village Gazette (A New1.com Publication) |url=http://www.nycny.com/columns/nichols/nichols09-15-00.html |title=Greenwich Village Gazette: Columns: Gay Today: Jack Nichols |publisher=Nycny.com |date= |access-date=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215926/http://www.nycny.com/columns/nichols/nichols09-15-00.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at [[The New School]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and [[Florida International University]].&lt;ref name="nytimes obituary"/&gt; He worked as a corporate consultant for [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[J. C. Penney]].&lt;ref name="nytimes obituary"/&gt; He was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Esfandiary, F.M. Upwingers: A Futurist Manifesto. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On July 8, 2000, FM-2030 died from [[pancreatic cancer]] and was placed in [[cryonic suspension]] at the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona, where his body remains today. He did not yet have remote standby arrangements, so no Alcor team member was present at his death, but FM-2030 was the first person to be [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrified]], rather than simply frozen as previous [[cryonics]] patients had been.&lt;ref name="cryonics 2000"/&gt; FM-2030 was survived by four sisters and one brother.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Higher-order theories are distinguished from other [[Cognition|cognitive]]/representational accounts of consciousness which suggest that merely first-order mentality of certain sorts constitutes consciousness.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

==Motivation==

Higher-order theory can account for the distinction between unconscious and conscious brain processing. Both types of mental operations involve first-order manipulations, and according to higher-order theory, what makes cognition conscious is a higher-order observation of the first-order processing.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

In [[neuroscience]] terms, higher-order theory is motivated by the distinction between first-order information in early sensory regions versus higher-order representations in [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortices]].&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|365–66}}

==Types==

===Higher-order perception theory===

Also called '''inner-sense theory''', this version of higher-order theory proposes that phenomenal consciousness consists not in immediate sensations but in higher-level sensing of those [[Sensation (psychology)|sensations]]. Or put another way:
: A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with analog/non-conceptual [[Intentionality|intentional]] content, which is in turn the target of a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the operations of a faculty of 'inner sense'.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
One motivation for this approach is that it accounts for phenomenal consciousness absent beliefs or behaviors associated with those experiences—so that, e.g., someone could feel pain without necessarily exhibiting functional reactions to pain.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Actualist higher-order thought theory===

[[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]] is a foremost advocate of this view. It claims that a mental state is conscious when it's the subject of a '''higher-order thought''' (HOT). Phenomenal consciousness in particular corresponds to certain kinds of mental states (e.g., visual inputs) that are the subjects of HOTs. Rosenthal excludes the special case in which one learns about one's lower-order states by conscious deduction. For instance, if [[psychoanalysis]] could reveal one's unconscious motives, this would not suddenly make them conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Dispositionalist higher-order thought theory===

The dispositionalist mirrors the actualist view except that the first-order mental state needn't actually be thought about—it only needs to be available to potentially be thought about.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

While actualist accounts would seem to require immense higher-order computation on all first-order percepts, dispositionalist accounts do not; they merely require ''availability'' of first-order information. Such availability could come from, e.g., global broadcasting as in the [[Global Workspace Theory]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Self-representational higher-order theories===

Self-representational higher-order theories consider the higher-order state to be ''constitutive'' or ''internal'' to its first-order state.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; This may be either because
# the first-order and higher-order states are identical, with the same state serving two different roles, or
# the first-order and higher-order states are part of the same whole, and the whole complex is what becomes conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
An example of the second, "part-whole" self-representational theory is Vincent Picciuto's "quotational theory of consciousness" in which consciousness consists of "mentally quoting" a first-order perception.&lt;ref name=Picciuto2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Picciuto|first1=Vincent|title=Consciousness and Mental Quotation: An intrinsic higher-order approach|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903/15231|website=Digital Repository at the University of Maryland|accessdate=31 August 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher-order statistical inference view===

In this theory, higher-level processing determines that a first-order representation is reliable.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

===Radical plasticity thesis===

Similar to a HOT view, this theory proposes that the brain "learns" when there exists a trustworthy lower-level representation.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

==Scientific perspectives==

Higher-order theories originated in philosophy, but they have also gained some scientific defenders.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hakwan Lau|author2=David Rosenthal|title=Empirical support for higher-order theories of conscious awareness|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=Aug 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=365–373|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.05.009|url=http://www.summer12.isc.uqam.ca/page/docs/readings/Lau-Hakwan/Lau-Rosenthal-Empirical-support-for-higher-order-theories-of-conscious-awareness.pdf|pmid=21737339}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|365}} Here are some examples of evidence supporting higher-order views:
* Reporting of conscious experience seems in some studies to occur serially following unconscious processing rather than in parallel with it.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Unconscious processing is quite powerful on its own, so it's not obvious that task performance requires consciousness. Higher-order views agree with this, unlike, e.g., global-workspace views.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Impairments to the prefrontal cortex may impair subjective reports without affecting task performance. If the prefrontal cortex were mainly serving an attentional role, performance should degrade along with reportability.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|369}}
* Some interpretations of certain disorders of consciousness suggest that they operate by affecting the prefrontal cortex, where higher-order thoughts are assumed to take place.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370–71}}

[[Edmund Rolls]] defends a higher-order account of consciousness. He argues that consciousness consists in higher-order thoughts allowing one to monitor and correct errors and "that the brain systems that are required for consciousness and language are similar."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edmund T. Rolls|title=Emotion Explained|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198570035}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|404–05}} [[Qualia]] like pain become conscious when "they enter into a specialized linguistic symbol-manipulation system, which is part of a higher-order thought system" that helps with, inter alia, "flexible planning of actions."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005 /&gt;{{rp|407}}

==Criticisms==

===Against inner-sense and actualist HOT views===

Scott Sturgeon argues against inner-sense theory on the grounds that it could give rise to disorders in which, e.g., one has a first-order perception of red which mis-triggers a second-order sense of "looks orange". But we don't see any such disorders in [[neurology]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturgeon2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgeon|first1=Scott|title=Matters of Mind: Consciousness, Reason and Nature|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, inner-sense and actualist views face the "targetless higher-order representation problem" in which there might be, e.g., a higher-order experience/thought about perceiving red without a corresponding first-order redness percept.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; One reply is that this is no more a problem for higher-order theories than for other neuroscientific theories of consciousness, which also involve many layers of processing that could theoretically be inconsistent.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370}}

[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] points out that inner sense of or actualist HOTs about first-order percepts might greatly increase the computing power required to consciously process stimuli, for not only does one need to have a perception, but one then needs to have another (perhaps highly detailed) perception or thought about that perception.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carruthers2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Peter|title=Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against any higher-order view===

The "rock objection" notes that thinking about a rock doesn't cause the rock to "light up" with consciousness, so why does thinking about a first-order percept cause it to light up? Higher-order theorists reply that first-order states need to be mental states, which rocks are not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4521">'''Industrial forensics''' is a holistic-based analytical and consultative response to problems encountered at any stage in the industrial [[manufacturing process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intertek.com/forensics/industrial/|title=Industrial Forensic Science|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from a traditional analytical approach that routinely identifies a problem and then reports the data in that its goal is to understand the problem, interpret the data and use those elements to prevent the problem from recurring. It is both [[prognostic]] and [[diagnostic]]. In its broadest sense, it is a holistic approach that examines each step in the product life cycle from initial R&amp;D through final product and beyond to predict, identify, prevent and resolve manufacturing issues.

== Independent industrial forensics laboratory ==

A professional services laboratory that practices industrial forensics is an extension of the client's scientific organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcl-inc.com/services/industrial-forensics/|title=Forensics - Materials &amp; Chemistry Laboratory, Inc.|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies with the client's process and collaborates in the three areas that encompass all of the steps in the product life cycle: research and development (R&amp;D), [[environmental health]] and safety (EH&amp;S) and [[quality control]] (QA/QC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rjlg.com/industrial-forensics-services.aspx|title=Industrial Forensics Services - RJ Lee Group|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining each step in the manufacturing process in light of one or more of these areas, the laboratory obtains the data it needs to support the manufacturer's materials, processes and product before development, during the process and in the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factoidz.com/basic-steps-in-manufacturing-processes/|title=Basic Steps in Manufacturing Processes|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial forensic laboratory uses all available resources including bridging non-traditional expertise and technology and using standard approved methods as well as defining new procedures.

=== Research and development (R&amp;D) ===

An industrial forensics laboratory works either as an R&amp;D partner or an independent contractor selected for specific expertise. When working as an industrial partner, the laboratory becomes involved at the earliest stage of product development offering advice on raw materials selection and specifications. In the role of an outside expert, laboratory personnel and resources are made available to supplement the client's in-house capabilities. As an integral part of the R&amp;D service provided, an industrial forensics laboratory is capable of determining [[root cause]] of [[Failure_analysis|failure]] at any step of the process in industries that range from [[nanotechnology]] to steel manufacturing.

=== Environmental health and safety (EH&amp;S) ===

An industrial forensics laboratory assists industry in interpreting and applying government guidelines and regulations throughout the manufacturing process. The laboratory recommends measures needed to handle environmental concerns to both workers and product. The laboratory can also determine sources of pollutants during the manufacturing process that may affect the working environment and can design sampling and collection plans to monitor that process.

=== Quality assessment and quality control (QA/QC) ===

The industrial forensics laboratory works with the manufacturer to proactively address quality issues during the manufacturing process as well as post-production issues related to [[product recall]], warranty claims or [[product liability]]. The laboratory has the resources to provide litigation support.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">The '''International Violence Against Women Act of 2015''' ('''I-VAWA''') is proposed legislation to address [[violence against women]] through [[United States]] foreign policy.  The legislation was introduced in the [[114th United States Congress]] in March, 2015. Similar legislation was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress]] but was not passed into law.

==Background==
At least 1 in 3 women around the world are subject to [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[physical abuse|physical]] or other [[abuse]] during their life, per estimates by the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]].  Not only does violence against women prevent mothers from raising healthy children, it also affects the economic progress and stability within the country in which they live.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/ivawa_ib2.pdf ''The International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA) (S.2982, HR. 4594)''.] [[Amnesty International]] Issue Brief No. 2. March 2010. Retrieved November 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Violence Against Women Act of 2015==
The International Violence Against Women Act of 2015 (I-VAWA) (S.713, HR. 1340) was introduced to ensure that addressing violence against women is included in the nation's foreign policy, with best practices for  preventing violence, protecting victims and prosecuting offenders.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The legislation was the result of efforts by:
* [[Amnesty International USA]]
* [[Family Violence Prevention Fund]]
* [[Women Thrive Worldwide]].&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

Experts in related fields from 40 international and 150 U.S. groups provided input for the legislation.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The House of Representatives Bill (HR. 1340) was brought before the [[114th_United_States_Congress|114th Congress]], sponsored by Representative [[Jan_Schakowsky|Janice Schakowsky]], [[Illinois's 9th congressional district]]. The Senate Bill (S.713), was introduced by Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] of [[California]].

==Criticism==
I-VAWA has been criticized on the grounds that it would discriminate against male victims and impose Western values upon other societies.  According to [[Wendy McElroy]], a research fellow at [[The Independent Institute]], the Act "constitutes a 5-year redirection of foreign aid funds in order to insert politically-correct feminism into the structure of other nations" and "revictimizes every male victim by denying his existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/197947-i-vawas-global-lie|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=I-VAWA's global lie|journal=The Hill|date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Many organizations support the I-VAWA Act, some of which are:
* [[Amnesty International USA]]
* [[American Jewish World Service]]
* [[Human Rights Watch]]
* [[International Center for Research on Women]]
* [[International Rescue Committee]]
* [[Refugees International]]
* [[Vital Voices]]
* [[Women's Refugee Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenthrive.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=436&amp;Itemid=152 ''International Violence Against Women Act Organizational Supporters.''] Women Thrive Worldwide. Retrieved November 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirti Sri Raja Singha''' was the second [[Nayaks of Kandy|Nayaka]] king of [[Kandy]].  He was a prince from the [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty]] and the brother-in-law of [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Sri Lanka|Sri Vijaya Raja Singha]]. He succeeded his brother-in-law to the throne in 1751.

The king is credited for the revival of Buddhism and literature in Sri Lanka. Under the guidance and influence of [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]],  with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] assistance, king Kirti Sri Raja Singha successfully invited [[Bhikku]]s from [[Siam]] ([[Thailand]]) to revive the higher ordination of Buddhist monks in [[Sri Lanka]].

He also built the existing inner temple of the [[Sacred Tooth Relic]] and  Raja Maha Vihara (Gangarama) in [[Kandy]]. During his reign the [[Mahavamsa]] [[chronicle]] was continued from the time of [[Parakramabahu IV of Dambadeniya]]. He also rebuilt the [[Munneswaram temple]] close to [[Chilaw]].

==Attack on Dutch Forts==
In 1761 King Kirti Sri Rajasinha attacked the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[garrisons]] and [[forts]] at [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]], [[Katuwana]], [[Tangalle]], [[Marakade]] and [[Urubokke]], completely destroying them, and killing Dutch while some surrendered and ended up as prisoners.

In order to revenge the humiliation, the new Dutch governor Van Eck had immediate plans to attack [[Kandy]], but the weakness in fortification and garrison forbade the Dutch. Later they did attack in 1764 and in 1765. Hence, in the early part of 1763 the Dutch were only consolidating their positions and gradually expelling Kandyans from the territories taken over from Dutch. Throughout 1763 the King continually sought peace and sent his envoys to discuss terms. The Governor wished the King to cede the three four and seven Korales and Puttlam and hand over the entire coastline of island to the Dutch. The king was not agreeable to any demand that diminished his sovereignty and was deliberately delaying a settlement hoping for help from the [[England|English]] in [[Madras]] after his discussion and negotiations with John Pybus 1762.

==Meeting with the British==
The King in mid-1762 sought help from [[George Pigot]], Governor of [[Fort St George]] [[Madras]] for assistance. The British eager to obtain the monopoly of trading in cinnamon, pepper, betel nut (puwak) from the Kandyan Kings also wanted to expel the Dutch from the coasts. A reason to call on the British for assistance by the Kandyan King in 1762 was that after the treaty of [[Paris]], the Dutch poured troops into [[Sri Lanka]]. They were bent on capturing [[Kandy]] from six directions (1764). Anticipating such a scenario the King sent an envoy to the English [[Governor]] of [[Madras]] to assist him in expelling the Dutch. This envoy, a junior Kandyan Official in the military made a clandestine trip to Madras Fort, and the English responded by sending their councilor Mr Pybus.

John Pybus, a writer of the [[British East India Company]], sailed to Kandy with a backup of five ships and about 200 armed men. A British vessel brought Pybus to [[Trincomalee]] on 5 May 1762. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] knew of the arrival of Pybus through their spies and they were kept informed of his movements. Pybus took an exhausting covert trip to meet the King on 24 May 1762. After several talks without any conclusive decisions Pybus left after a month. The King gave him a [[#Ring (finger)|ring]], [[sword]], a [[gold]] chain with breast jewels and left the country crossing the river at Puttalam pass while the Dissawa who accompanied Pybus presented the ships commander [[Vice-Admiral Samuel Cornish|Samuel Cornish]] a [[gold]] chain and a ring in the name of King ''"Keerthi Sri Rajasinha ".''

John Pybus in his notes described the King as a man of tolerable stature, reddish in complexion and very brisk in his movements. Pybus was amazed as to how the Kandyans had managed to fight a war with Dutch and had captured Matara Dutch Fort. He wrote that "They had put every European to the sword except two officers who are now prisoners of the country."

==Marriage==
He married the daughter of one Nadukattu Sami Nayakkar in 1749. He further married three more Nayakkar queens from [[Madurai]], but had no children. He also married two daughters of Vijaya Manna Naicker who was the grandson of [[Tanjore Nayak#Vijaya Raghava Nayak|Vijaya Raghava Nayak]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Ceylon. (1956). ''University of Ceylon review'', Volumes 14-16, p.129 states: ''Kirti Sri in turn married two daughters of Vijaya Manan Naicker, the grandson of a former king of Tanjore named Raja Vijaya Ragheva Naicker '' [https://books.google.com/books?ei=aPlNTtq8Ls_irAe2q4jEAw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=SP7QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=University+of+Ceylon+review%2C+Volumes+14-16&amp;q=%22kirti+sri+in+turn+married%22#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt; He had six daughters and two sons by his favorite Sinhala lady (Yakada Doli), daughter of the late [[Dissava]] (Headman) of Bintenna, granddaughter of the blind and aged Mampitiya Dissave. Both his sons survived the king and his daughters married Nayakkar relatives of the king. Mampitiya’s sons claim for the throne was overlooked and the choice fell on the king’s brother who was living in court.

The king died on January 2, 1782, of the injuries caused two months before by a fall from his [[horse]] after a reign of 35 years which the people saw as a great religious revival, and had a sentimental attachment to the King.

There are very many life-size portraits of King Kirti Sri Raja Singha in all  the temples he renovated and built. But the most famous are the four life sized wooden statues of the king today, two of them can be seen at [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla temple]] and at [[Malwatta temple]] in [[Kandy]].

This '''list of unsolved deaths''' includes notable cases where victims have been [[murder]]ed or have [[death|died]] under unsolved circumstances, including murders committed by unknown [[serial killer]]s. The mysteriously-deceased are listed chronologically by year. (For "[[serial killer]] cases" which span multiple years, entries are listed under the year the first murder took place.)

===Before 1800===
*[[Caesarion]]&amp;nbsp;(17), (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar), 30 BC; the son of&amp;nbsp;Cleopatra&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;Caesar, and as such the last king of the&amp;nbsp;Ptolemaic dynasty&amp;nbsp;of Egypt, ruling alone for eleven days whose death at the orders of&amp;nbsp;Augustus&amp;nbsp;(while still Octavian) is accepted in 30 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancientpages.com/2016/06/25/little-caesar-forgotten-king-of-kings-who-died-very-young/|title='Little Caesar': Forgotten 'King Of Kings' – Who Died Very Young {{!}} Ancient Pages|date=2016-06-25|work=Ancient Pages|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;and yet the exact circumstances of his death and the location of his body are not documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/research/monetary-history-of-the-world/caesarion/|title=Caesarion {{!}} Armstrong Economics|website=www.armstrongeconomics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dagobert II]], 679; he was one of the last kings of the [[Merovingian]] line, murdered by persons unknown in the [[Ardennes]] Forest on December 23.
* [[Mummy Juanita|Momia Juanita]], also known as the ''Inca Ice Maiden'' and ''Lady of Ampato'', is the [[mummy|well-preserved frozen body]] of an [[Inca Empire|Inca]] girl,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-480514/Preserved-mummy-500-year-old-Inca-Ice-Maiden-wows-visitors.html|title=Preserved mummy of 500-year-old Inca 'Ice Maiden' wows visitors|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered as an offering to the Inca gods sometime between 1450 and 1480 when she was approximately 12–15 years old, by persons unknown. She was discovered on [[Mount Ampato]] (part of the [[Andes]] [[cordillera]]) in southern [[Peru]] in September 1995 by [[anthropologist]] [[Johan Reinhard]] and his Peruvian climbing partner, Miguel Zárate.
* [[Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia]], 1497; his body was recovered in the [[Tiber]] with his throat slit and about nine stab wounds on his torso. His father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], launched an investigation only for it to end abruptly a week later. Theories range from the [[Orsini family]] to his own brothers, [[Cesare Borgia]] and [[Gioffre Borgia]], having committed the crime.
* [[Moctezuma II]], 1520, [[Aztec]] emperor; according to Spanish accounts he was killed by his own people; according to Aztec accounts he was murdered by the Spanish.
* [[Robert Pakington]], 1536, likely to have been the first person murdered with a handgun in London.
* Expatriate [[Cavalier|English Royalists]] are believed to have ambushed and murdered [[Isaac Dorislaus]] in 1649, then a diplomat representing the interests of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] to the Dutch government at [[The Hague]], in retaliation for [[List of regicides of Charles I|his role in the trial and execution of Charles I]]. But no suspects were ever identified, although some Royalists later boasted of having taken part.
* [[Edmund Berry Godfrey|Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]] (56), in 1678; he was found impaled on his own sword and strangled at [[Primrose Hill]], London. Three men were hanged, but later the witness statement was found to be perjured.
* [[Alessandro Stradella]], 1682, composer; he was stabbed to death at the Piazza Banchi of Genoa. His infidelities were well known, and a nobleman of the Lomellini family may have hired the killer; but this was never proven and the identity of the killer was never discovered.
* [[Jean-Marie Leclair]], 1764, violinist and composer; he was found stabbed in his Paris home. Although the murder remains a mystery, his nephew, Guillaume-François Vial, and Leclair's ex-wife were considered main suspects at the time.
* Although the colonial authorities in [[Pennsylvania]] at the time investigated the two December 1764 [[Paxton Boys]] massacres of defenseless [[Conestoga (people)|Conestoga]] communities near present-day [[Millersville, Pennsylvania|Millersville]] as a criminal mass murder, they were never able to identify the perpetrators, and historians have not been able to, either.

* [[Mary Rogers]] (21–22), also known as the "Beautiful Cigar Girl"; her body was found in the [[Hudson River]] on 28 July 1841. The story became a national sensation and inspired [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to  write "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]" (1842).
* [[Charles de Choiseul-Praslin|Fanny de Choiseul-Praslin]], wife of French duke Charles de Choiseul-Praslin; she died shortly after a beating and stabbing in the family's Paris apartment on 17 August 1847. Her husband was arrested, but committed suicide during trial, protesting his innocence all along. No other suspect has ever been identified. The scandal caused by the case helped to provoke the [[French Revolution of 1848]].
* [[Thomas C. Hindman]], an American politician assassinated by one or more unknown assailants on 27 September 1868. The assassins fired through his parlor window while he was reading his newspaper with his children in [[Helena, Arkansas]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HINDMAN, Thomas Carmichael | url =http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000628 | work =Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alexander Boyd (county solicitor)|Alexander Boyd]] was the county solicitor of Greene County, Alabama, who was lynched by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] on March 31, 1870. His murderers were never brought to justice.
* [[Robert V. Richardson]] (49), an ex-Confederate General officer was killed in 1870 by a shotgun blast outside a tavern he was staying in at [[Clarkton, Missouri]]. The Identity of his assailant and motive are unknown. 
* [[Benjamin Nathan]] (56), a financier turned philanthropist; he was found beaten to death in his New York City home on 28 July 1870. Several suspects were identified, including Nathan's profligate son Washington, who discovered the body along with his brother. None were ever indicted, and the case remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Nathan murder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Benjamin|title=A Death in the Family|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/23461/a-death-in-the-family|newspaper=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Juan Prim]], a Spanish general and statesman; in December 1870, he was shot through the windows of his carriage by several unknown assailants and died two days later. In 2012, his body was exhumed; the ensuing autopsy showed he may have been strangled in his deathbed, but results were deemed inconclusive.
* [[Sharon Tyndale]], former [[Illinois Secretary of State]], was robbed and shot fatally as he walked from his house in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to the train station nearby early on the morning of 29 April 1871. No suspect was ever found.&lt;ref name="Sharon Tyndale"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Double Crime |url=http://www.ilstatehouse.com/1871.htm |newspaper=Illinois State Register |date=April 29, 1871 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104232846/http://www.ilstatehouse.com/1871.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Henry Weston Smith]] (49), a minister, was found dead on the road between his home in [[Crook City, South Dakota]], and [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], where he was going to give a sermon, on August 20, 1876. While he was not robbed, it has never been established who was responsible for his death, and what their motives were.
* [[George Colvocoresses]], [[Greek American]] naval commander and explorer, died of a gunshot wound while returning to a ferryboat on 3 June 1872, in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. The insurance company claimed it was suicide, and while it eventually settled with his family the case has never been solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/01/12/an-obscure-exit/ |title=An Obscure Exit |first=Greg |last=Ross  |work=futilitycloset.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Martin DeFoor]] (73), an early settler of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], was along with his wife the victim of an unsolved axe murder on their farm on 25 July 1879.
* Two trials in Canada's [[Black Donnellys]] massacre, in which five members of a family of Irish immigrants were found murdered in the ashes of their Ontario farm after an angry mob attacked it on 4 February 1880, allegedly as a result of feuds with their neighbors, resulted in all the suspects being acquitted.
* [[John Henry Blake]] (74), agent for one of Ireland's more despised British landlords, was shot and killed along with his driver on their way to Mass outside [[Loughrea]] on 29 June 1882. The case received considerable attention at the time because Blake's boss, [[Hubert de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde]], was a nobleman. Although his wife survived the attack, she was unable to help identify any suspects, and the case remains unsolved.
* The [[Whitehall Mystery]] In 1888, the dismembered remains of a woman were discovered at three different sites in the centre of London, including the future site of [[Scotland Yard]].
* [[Print Matthews]] (43), a [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]-era supporter of civil rights and former sheriff of [[Copiah County, Mississippi]], was shot and killed by a neighbor as he attempted to vote on November 6, 1883, in defiance of threats against his life. The neighbor was subsequently acquitted by an all-white jury.
* [[John M. Clayton (Arkansas)|John M. Clayton]], American politician, shot and killed instantly by an unknown assailant on the evening of 29 January 1889 in [[Plumerville, Arkansas]], after starting an investigation into the possible fraud of an election he took part in. After his death he was declared the winner of the election but his assassin was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Middleton Clayton (1840–1889) | url =http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1620 | work =Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew Jackson Borden]] and Abby Durfee Borden, father and stepmother of [[Lizzie Borden]], both killed in their family house in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] on the morning of 4 August 1892, by blows from a hatchet. In the case of Andrew Borden, the hatchet blows not only crushed his skull but cleanly split his left eyeball. Lizzie was later arrested and charged for the murders. She was the only one in the house at the time of the killing of Mrs. Borden. Lizzie and the maid, Bridget Sullivan, were the only ones in the home when Mr. Borden was killed. She was acquitted by a jury in the following year of 1893 and the case remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =The Trial of Lizzie Borden | url =http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/LizzieBorden/bordenhome.html | work =[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] School of Law | accessdate =2008-10-06 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081009093131/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/LizzieBorden/bordenhome.html | archivedate =2008-10-09 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Gatton murders]] occurred {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the rural Australian town of [[Gatton, Queensland]], on 26 December 1898. Siblings Michael, Norah and Ellen Murphy were found deceased the morning after they left home to attend a dance in the town hall which had been cancelled. The bodies were arranged with the feet pointing west and both women had their hands tied with handkerchiefs. This [[signature aspect]] has never been repeated in Australian crime and to date remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Whiticker, Alan J. (2005).

* [[William Goebel]], an American politician who was shot and mortally wounded on the morning of 30 January 1900 by an unknown assailant in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], one day before being sworn in as [[Governor of Kentucky]]. The next day the dying Goebel was sworn in and, despite the best efforts of eighteen physicians attending him, died on the afternoon of 3 February 1900. Goebel remains the only state governor in the United States to die by assassination while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

*[[Murder of Bertha Schippan|Bertha Shippan]] (14), resided in the South Australian town of [[Towitta, South Australia|Towitta]] and was murdered on the night of 1 January 1902. Her 25-year-old sister Mary Schippan was prosecuted for the crime, but was acquitted. Despite various theories, the case remains unsolved.
* [[Rose Harsent]], a six-months-pregnant maid who was stabbed to death on 1 June 1902 in [[Suffolk, England]] by an unknown assailant. At the time it was alleged that the murderer was a preacher of the [[Primitive Methodist]] Chapel named William Gardiner, who was having an affair with the victim. Gardiner was tried twice for the murder but each time the jury failed to reach a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Church | title=Murder in East Anglia: A New Look at Notorious Cases | publisher=Robert Hale | year=1987 | isbn=0-7090-2963-2 | pages=57–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edwin | last=Packer | title=The Peasenhall Murder | publisher=Yoxford Publications | year=1980 | isbn=0-907265-01-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case has been investigated in BBC One's ''[[Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder|Julian Fellowes Investigates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fellowes | first = Julian | authorlink = Julian Fellowes |author2=[[Tina Pepler]]  | title = A Most Mysterious Murder | publisher = RDF Media, Touchpaper Television for BBC | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56938-827-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Al Swearengen]] (59), operator of the [[Gem Theater]] brothel in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], was found dead in a Denver street of a massive wound to his head on 15 November 1904. No suspects were ever named.
* [[Elsie Sigel]] (20), found strangled inside a trunk in an apartment in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|New York City's Chinatown]] on 18 June 1909, nine days after she had last been seen. The resident of the apartment, who had been having a love affair with her, was considered the prime suspect but was never arrested.
* [[Elsie Paroubek]] (5), a daughter of Czech immigrants, is thought to have either wandered away from her home or beern kidnapped in Chicago on 8 April 1911. Her disappearance was the subject of intense police investigation over three states, with massive newspaper coverage. Her body was found a month later. Elsie, under the name "Annie Aronburg" became one of the principal characters in [[Henry Darger]]'s immense novel ''The Story of the Vivian Girls in the Realms of the Unreal''.
* [[Lintz Green railway station|Joseph Wilson]] (60,) a stationmaster who was shot dead at Lintz Green railway station in the Northeast of England on 7 October 1911. His murder sparked one of the largest murder investigations in northeastern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpears.org.uk/Misc/Crime/LintzGreen.html |title=The Lintz Green Murder |work=bpears.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923012036/http://bpears.org.uk/Misc/Crime/LintzGreen.html |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One suspect in the [[Villisca Axe Murders]], which claimed eight lives in [[Villisca, Iowa|the Iowa town]] on the night of June 9–10, 1912, was tried twice and ultimately acquitted. Other suspects have been considered, but history has largely exonerated them as well.
* [[Daisy Grace]] was accused in 1912 of drugging her husband, Eugene H. Grace and then shooting him for his insurance money in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Legal Fight Begins for Policies on the Life of Rich Georgian Strangely Shot. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1912/03/09/archives/grace-dying-sues-wife-he-accuses-legal-fight-begins-for-policies-on.html |quote=Daisy Grace drugged her husband and then shot him.

* The body of [[Leo Frank#Murder of Mary Phagan|Mary Phagan]] (13), was found strangled and raped early on 27 April 1913 at the [[Atlanta, Georgia]], pencil factory where she worked. Suspicion eventually fell on [[Leo Frank]], manager of the factory, who was convicted of the murder later that year. When his death sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to life in 1915, Frank was abducted from prison and [[lynching|lynched]], in what is considered one of the worst episodes of [[antisemitism in the United States]]. Historians have come to believe he was wrongly convicted, and in 1986 he was pardoned. It is believed that a janitor who testified against Frank and served a year in prison as an [[accessory after the fact]] was the real killer.
* Chinese journalist [[Huang Yuanyong]] (30), was shot and killed in [[San Francisco]] on 25 December 1915. No arrests were ever made. Most theories about the responsible parties suggest that it was a political assassination, since Huang had increasingly been in conflict with the government of the newly established [[Republic of China (1912–1949)]] after initially supporting it.
* John Bamford was considered the prime suspect in the 1917 [[Wonnangatta murders]] in [[East Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]; however, his body was found early the following year. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. Several theories have been advanced, but no suspects have ever been identified. In the late 1970s, Barclay's son, who later worked for a mutual friend of the two who had been an early suspect, made a statement suggesting he knew who the murderers were as well but declining to identify them.
* [[De La Haye scandal|De La Haye]], principal of the Newington House school in [[Madras]], India, was shot dead in his bed at the school on 15 March 1919. One defendant was acquitted after a highly publicized trial; no others have ever been identified.
* [[James Colosimo]] (42), gangster who led a precursor to the [[Chicago Outfit]]. He was shot and killed at his café on 11 May 1920. No one was ever charged with the killing; it is believed that [[Al Capone]], then one of Colosimo's henchmen, was involved.
* [[Joseph Bowne Elwell]] (46), a bridge player, was shot and killed inside his locked house on 11 June 1920. One clearly false confession the next year was discarded, and no other suspects ever were identified. The intense media interest in the case inspired the development of the [[Locked room mystery|locked-room murder]] subgenre of detective fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jonathan-goodman-2/the-slaying-of-joseph-bowne-elwell "The Slaying of Joseph Bowne Elwell by Jonathan Goodman"]. ''Kirkus Reviews''. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Italian anarchists were suspected in the [[Wall Street bombing]] of 16 September 1920, which killed 38, making it the deadliest terrorist act in U.S. history at that point. Despite a number of arrests, no one was ever charged. One likely suspect, who was never arrested, fled to Italy shortly afterwards and never returned to the U.S.
* [[Chrissie Venn]] (13), a girl who was murdered on or around 21 February 1921 near the township of North Motton, near [[Ulverstone, Tasmania]]; her body was found in a hollow tree. George William King, who claimed the incriminating marks on his hands were from injuries sustained during the three-day search for Venn, was acquitted after a trial which was the first [[change of venue]] ever granted in Tasmania. No other suspects were ever named.
* "[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (murder victim)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]", an unidentified boy who was murdered in late 1920 or early 1921 and was found on 8 March 1921. He was killed by a blow to the head and drowning after being dropped into a quarry in Waukesha, Wisconsin, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 1377UMWI|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1377umwi.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anthony D'Andrea]] (48), an early Chicago Mafia boss, was shot and killed while entering his apartment on 11 May 1921, near the end of the city's [[aldermen's wars]]. No one was ever charged or named as a suspect.
* Professional golfer [[James Douglas Edgar]] (36), whose book ''The Gate to Golf'' changed the sport considerably, died shortly after he was found on an Atlanta street late at night on 8 August 1921, with a leg wound. Reports that this was the consequence of his involvement in a [[love triangle]] have never led to any suspects being identified.
* [[William Desmond Taylor]], a popular Irish-born American actor and director of silent movies. Killed by a shot in the back on 1 February 1922 inside his bungalow. His murder, along with other Hollywood scandals, such as the [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] trial, led to a frenzy of sensational and often fabricated newspaper reports, and a deathbed confession of dubious veracity.
* The [[Hinterkaifeck murders]]. Hinterkaifeck, a small farmstead between the Bavarian towns of Ingolstadt and Schrobenhausen (approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km north of Munich), was the scene of one of the most puzzling crimes in German history. On the evening of 31 March 1922, the six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a pickaxe, and the murder is still unsolved.
* [[Hall–Mills murder case|Edward Hall and Eleanor Mills]], both of [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], were found dead of gunshot wounds in a field in nearby [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey|Franklin Township]] on 16 September 1922. Hall, an Episcopalian priest, had apparently been having an extramarital affair with Mills, who sang in the church choir. His wife and her brothers were charged with the crime. After one of the first trials to attract heavy media interest, they were acquitted of all charges. No other suspects were ever identified.
* The plane crash that killed early aviator [[B. H. DeLay]] (31), a pioneering [[stunt pilot]], on 4 July 1923 in [[Venice, California]], was found to have been the result of sabotage to the aircraft. No one was ever formally charged or identified as a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;''Police Investigating First Aerial Murder: B. H. De Lay'', The Coshocton Tribune, July 15, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sheriff Suspects Aerial Murder (of B. H. DeLay, Well Known Stunt Aviator),'' The Indianapolis Star, July 7, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Rites for De Lay Tomorrow: Services for Famous Flyer Have Been Arranged for at Los Angeles Crematory,'' Los Angeles Times, July 6, 1923. ("DeLay was nationally known for his daring stunts in the air.")&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Lava Lake murders]] occurred in January 1924 near [[Little Lava Lake]] in Central [[Oregon]]. The victims were Edward Nickols, 50, Roy Wilson, 35, and Dewey Morris, 25. The three were working as [[fur trapping|fur trappers]] and staying in a private cabin while trapping animals over the winter. Their bodies were discovered in April 1924 in [[Lava Lake (Oregon)|Big Lava Lake]], where they had been placed under the ice sometime shortly after [[Christmas]] 1923. The men had been bludgeoned with a claw hammer and shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After 37 years, Lava Lake case unsolved|work=The Bend Bulletin|date=August 2, 1961|page=9|author=LeBlanc, Suzi|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19610802&amp;id=glZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kvcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1348,749744}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Father Hubert Dahme, a popular local Catholic priest, was shot dead at an intersection in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], on 4 February 1924. A local vagrant, [[Harold Israel]], was arrested and charged with the crime; but at trial prosecutor [[Homer Stille Cummings]], later U.S. Attorney General, not only dropped the case but discredited the evidence the city's police department had collected against Israel. No other suspects have ever been named; thirty years later a witness to the killing said it was not Israel but refused to identify the real killer out of fear for their life.
* The [[Janet Smith case]]. On 26 July 1924, the 22-year-old Scottish nursemaid was found dead of a gunshot wound to the temple in a home in an exclusive neighborhood of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. Although she was initially labeled a suicide (despite much evidence to the contrary), her friends were able to get the case reopened and deemed a murder. The initial suspect, Chinese houseboy Wong Foon Sing, was kidnapped and tortured for weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to extract a confession, causing a major scandal when it was discovered that various police officials and respected members of society were directly involved. Wong was eventually tried and acquitted for lack of evidence. A law was proposed, banning the employment of Asians and white women in the same household, but failed to pass.
* Responsibility for the 29 October 1924, bombing of a [[Canadian Pacific]] train in [[British Columbia]] that killed Russian émigré [[Peter Verigin]] (65), leader of the pacifist [[Doukhobor]]s, along with seven others including a member of the provincial legislature. Government investigators believed the culprits were Verigin's rivals among the Doukhobors, while the remaining members of the sect accused the government of committing the crime. No suspects have ever been officially named.

===1925–1949===
* The [[killing of Lizzie O'Neill]] in [[Dublin]] was the June 1925 shooting of a sex worker who was also known as Honour Bright. Two suspects were brought to trial, but were acquitted.
* The [[Milaflores Massacre]]: Three Detroit gangsters were shot down in the Milaflores Apartments on March 28, 1927. The killings are widely believed to have been a revenge attack by members of [[The Purple Gang]]; two members were arrested the next day but never charged.
* Morduch Halsman, a [[Latvian Jewish]] dentist, was hiking with his son [[Philippe Halsman|Philippe]] in Austria's [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] on 10 September 1928, when he slipped and fell down a ravine. He survived the fall, but when Philippe returned with assistance, he had been [[Halsman murder case|beaten to death and robbed]]. Philippe was convicted of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to four years in prison in a trial marked by the [[antisemitism in Austria|antisemitism]] prevalent in Austria at the time. After prominent Jews of the time, including [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] drew attention to the case, Halsmann was pardoned and emigrated to France to begin his career as a photographer. No other suspect in his father's murder has ever been identified.
* [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish gangster]] [[Arnold Rothstein]] (46), an avid gambler best remembered for his alleged role [[Black Sox scandal|fixing]] the [[1919 World Series]], died on 6 November 1928, of gunshot wounds inflicted the day before during a New York City business meeting. He refused to identify his killer to police. A fellow gambler who was believed to have ordered the hit as retaliation for Rothstein's failure to pay a large debt from a recent poker game (Rothstein in turn claimed it had been fixed) was tried and acquitted. No other suspects have ever emerged.
* It is historically accepted that [[Al Capone]] ordered the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre|St. Valentine's Day massacre]] of seven other gangsters in Chicago on 14 February 1929. But neither he nor any of the suspected gunmen (many of whom were dead themselves within a few years) were ever formally prosecuted for the crime.
* [[William Herbert Wallace|The Wallace Case]] was the unsolved murder of [[Liverpool]] housewife Julia Wallace on 20 January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|0-881-84855-7}} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband, William Herbert Wallace, was convicted and sentenced to hang, but the verdict was overturned on appeal&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|0-881-84855-7}} p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; – the first such instance in British legal history. The chess-like quality of the puzzle has attracted a host of crime writers. [[Raymond Chandler]] said, 'The Wallace case is the nonpareil of all murder mysteries ... I call it the impossible murder because Wallace couldn't have done it, and neither could anyone else. ... The Wallace case is unbeatable; it will always be unbeatable.' In 2018, author Antony Matthew Brown surveyed all the published theories, both evidentially and logically, in his book ''Move to Murder'',&lt;ref&gt;Antony M Brown, Move to Murder, Mirror Books, {{ISBN|978-1-907324-73-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; before rejecting them all, and concluding that a previously-unpublished theory "is the best explanation for one of the most puzzling murder cases in British criminal history."
* [[Harry C. Beasley]] (42), a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient who later became a [[Newark, Ohio]], police officer, died after being shot while confronting robbers on July 2, 1931. No one was ever identified as a suspect.
* On 12 September 1931, [[Arthur Brennan]] (50), a [[World War I]] veteran and early [[Australian rules football]] player, was shot and killed while struggling with a burglar he was trying to apprehend on a neighbour's property. After investigating for three months, police announced they could not find a suspect. No arrests were ever made.
* The [[Vera Page case|murder of Vera Page]] occurred on 14 December 1931. Page was a 10-year-old schoolgirl from [[Notting Hill]], [[London]], who was last seen walking towards her own house, having visited her aunt to show her new swimming certificates she had been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|0-881-84855-7}} p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Her raped and strangled body was found two days later.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|0-881-84855-7}} p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong [[circumstantial evidence]] linking a local man named Percy Rush to the crime, a jury recorded an open verdict of "Murder by person or persons unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19320211&amp;id=W_BYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YKUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1852,5430481|title=Open Verdict|date=Feb 11, 1932|work=The Glasgow Herald|page=3|via= Google News Archive Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Legs Diamond|Jack "Legs" Diamond]] (34), American gangster, was found shot to death in the [[Albany, New York]], apartment of his mistress on the morning of December 18, 1931. While he had many enemies among the underworld who wanted him dead, [[Daniel P. O'Connell]], boss of the city's [[political machine]], claimed in an interview with author [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]] four decades later that he had ordered the killing after Diamond ignored police warnings to stay out of the city's rackets. The case remains officially unsolved.
* [[Atlas Vampire|Vampire Murder Case]] is the nickname given to the case of an unknown assailant who committed the unsolved murder of Lilly Lindeström, a prostitute, who was found dead with a crushed skull in her apartment on 4 May 1932 in Stockholm, Sweden. Police noted that someone had drunk her blood.
* The body of [[Erik Jan Hanussen]] (43), an [[Austrian Jewish]] publicist who claimed to have psychic powers and was a confidant of Hitler, was found in a field in [[Zossen]], Germany, outside Berlin in late April 1933, a month after he had last been seen on 25 March in the city. He had been [[execution-style killing|shot execution-style]], twice, in the back of the head at close range. No one was ever charged with the crime, although it is believed that it may have been carried out by [[Sturmabteilung|stormtroopers]]. Possible motives range from resentment of Hanussen's relationship with Hitler to a desire to keep secret inside information on the [[Reichstag fire]], which Hanussen claimed to have foreseen. 
* Left-wing [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader [[Haim Arlosoroff]] [[Assassination of Haim Arlosoroff|was shot and killed]] late on the night of 16 June 1933, while walking with his wife on the beach of [[Tel Aviv]] in what is now [[Israel]] but was at the time [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]]. Three men belonging to a rival political faction were arrested and tried; all were ultimately acquitted. Theories as to who was really responsible have ranged from the Soviets or Nazis to a failed attempt to rape Arlosoroff's wife.
* Welsh journalist [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]] (29), was killed by bandits who had been holding him for ransom near what is now [[Zhangjiakou]], China, on 12 April 1935. A fellow journalist with him had been released two weeks earlier, ostensibly to collect the money demanded. Since Jones had two years before been banned from the [[Soviet Union]] for life after being the first journalist to report on the [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|1932–33 Ukrainian famine]], it has been believed that the Soviet [[NKVD]] had him killed in retaliation, as some of those connected to the kidnapping were its agents. No suspects have ever been identified.&lt;ref name="Gareth Jones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Prior|first=Neil|title=Journalist Gareth Jones' 1935 murder examined by BBC Four|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-18691109|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American journalist [[Walter Liggett]] (49), was shot in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], on 9 December 1935, while investigating connections between that state's governor and organized crime. No suspects were ever identified.
* The body of [[Murder of Pamela Werner|Pamela Werner]] (19), only daughter of British China scholar [[E.T.C. Werner]], was found near the [[Beijing city fortifications#Dongbianmen|Fox Tower]] in [[Beijing]] on the morning of 8 January 1937; she had last been seen alive leaving an ice skating rink nearby the night before. After being killed by several blows to the head, her body had been severely mutilated, with several internal organs removed, among them her heart, by someone with professional skills, and sexually violated. An unusual joint British-Chinese investigation found some possible suspects among the city's foreign community, where she was socially prominent, but was unable to develop any evidence to the point of arrest before the coroner officially concluded that the killers were probably Chinese and closed the case; after the [[Japanese occupation of Beijing|Japanese occupied the city]] a few months later there would be no further official investigations. E.T.C. Werner funded an unofficial investigation which identified an American dentist as the killer; his conclusion was endorsed by ''[[Midnight in Peking]]'', [[Paul French (author)|Paul French]]'s 2011 book about the case.&lt;ref name="Pamela Werner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=Midnight in Peking by Paul French - review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/midnight-in-peking-paul-french-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However. some of the dentists' descendants have strongly disputed that finding. Other theories of the case suggest Japanese revenge for the death of two army officers allegedly at British hands the summer before, [[mistaken identity]] by [[Blue Shirts Society|Blue Shirts]] intending to kill [[Helen Foster Snow]], or a local serial killer.&lt;ref name="NYT Pamela Werner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane Perlez|title=

* Russian banker and politician [[Dimitri Navachine]] (47), was stabbed to death while walking his dog in Paris's [[Bois de Boulogne]] on the morning of 25 January 1937. No suspects have ever been identified, although theories as to who might be responsible suggest the Soviet NKVD, as while he had initially worked with the communists despite not sharing their ideology he had broken with them under Stalin and was reportedly about to reveal evidence which would have shown that some prominent political prisoners were in fact innocent of the crimes with which they had been charged. Another theory implicates the French fascist organization [[La Cagoule]], which did not like a Jew closely advising the French government on economic matters and supposedly hoped that his death would be blamed on communist operatives, appearing to strengthen La Cagoule's claims of foreign Communists operating in France.
* On 16 May 1937, [[Murder of Laetitia Toureaux|Laetitia Toureaux]] (29), was found fatally stabbed in an empty first-class car on the [[Paris Métro]] when it stopped at [[Porte Dorée (Paris Métro)|Porte Dorée]]. The crime received considerable media attention as not only was it the first homicide on the Métro, Toureaux had boarded the train at the previous station, meaning the crime had to have been committed in just minutes. Further investigation found that she was leading a double life, working a factory job during the day under her own name but then at a dance hall at night under another name, and making frequent if discreet visits to the Italian embassy. Eventually it was revealed that she was a spy, infiltrating La Cagoule, who it is believed may have discovered this and killed her. The onset of World War II two years later put a stop to the investigation before any suspects were identified; it has not been reopened. 
* [[Murder of Margaret Martin|Margaret Martin]] (19), of [[Kingston, Pennsylvania]] went missing on 17 December 1938, and was found dead in [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania]], several days later on 21 December 1938. Many suspects were investigated, but nobody was ever convicted.
* [[Pete Panto]] (28), a labor leader who had fought Mafia control of the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] local on the Brooklyn docks, was found in a [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]] lime pit in January 1941. He had not been seen since leaving his house on July 14, 1939. No one was ever arrested in the case; one suspect who was questioned was found dead a month later.
* On 24 March 1941, [[Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll]] (39), was found shot dead behind the wheel of his car at a crossroads in [[Kenya]]. Reporting on the murder investigation outraged the British public with its accounts of carousing and partying by Lord Erroll and fellow members of the [[Happy Valley set]] while the homefront endured the hardships of World War II. Sir [[Jock Delves Broughton]], another peer in Happy Valley who Hay might have cuckolded, was acquitted after being tried with a weak case later that year; he committed suicide the following year. No other suspects have ever been named. The crime has inspired several dramatisations, most notably the 1987 film ''[[White Mischief (film)|White Mischief]]'', which have attempted to offer solutions.
* [[Carlo Tresca]] (63), an [[Italian American]] labor leader who led opposition to [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]], [[Stalinism]] and Mafia control of unions, was shot dead at a Manhattan intersection on the night of 11 January 1943. Given the enemies he had made and their propensity for violence, the list of potential suspects was long; however, the investigation was incomplete and no one was ever officially named. Historians believe the most likely suspect was mobster [[Carmine Galante]], later acting boss of the [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno family]], seen fleeing the scene, who had likely acted on the orders of a Bonanno underboss and Fascist sympathizer Tresca had threatened to expose.&lt;ref name="Carlo Tresca"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who Hired the Assassin? |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DE173AF931A35753C1A96E948260|work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 2, 1988 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 | first=Alfred | last=Kazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The beaten and partially burnt body of Sir [[Harry Oakes]] (68), an American-born British gold-mine owner and philanthropist, was found in his mansion in [[Nassau, Bahamas]] on 8 July 1943. His son-in-law, Count [[Alfred de Marigny]], was arrested shortly afterwards based on evidence allegedly uncovered by two [[Miami]] police detectives brought in to work the case, who had upset their Bahamanian counterparts by completely taking over the investigation. However, weaknesses in the case led to de Marigny's acquittal; no one else has ever been tried. The murder became the subject of worldwide press coverage at the time as well as several books, films, and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jason | last=Bennetto | title= Great unsolved crimes: The ex-King, the conman and a millionaire's murder | date=19 January 2006 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/great-unsolved-crimes-the-exking-the-conman-and-a-millionaires-murder-523634.html | work =The Independent | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Actor [[David Bacon (actor)|David Bacon]], best known for playing Bob Barton in the ''[[The Masked Marvel|Masked Marvel]]'' serials of the 1930s, died shortly after crashing his car in [[Santa Monica, California]] on 12 September 1943. Afterwards he was found to have been suffering from a stab wound to the chest; no suspect has ever been identified.
* [[Georgette Bauerdorf]] (20), an heiress who was found face down in a bathtub in her home at West Hollywood, California, on 12 October 1944. She had been strangled with a piece of towel stuffed down her throat, and although there was a large roll of $2 bills and thousands of dollars worth of sterling silver lying in an open trunk, Bauerdorf's jewelry and other valuables were not stolen. The police believe her murderer had unscrewed an automatic night light over the outside entrance of the apartment so it would not come on and lain in wait for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Miss Bauerdorf, Oil Man's Daughter, Slain By Strangler in Her Hollywood Apartment | date=14 October 1944 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E3DC1038E33BBC4C52DFB667838F659EDE | work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tamil film critic [[Lakshmikanthan murder case|C.N. Lakshmikanthan]] was stabbed while riding back to his [[Madras]], India, home on 8 November 1944; he died in hospital the next day having been able to describe the attack to police but not identify the assailants. Six men, all film actors whom he had feuded with, were arrested; three were tried and two convicted. Their convictions were overturned on appeal three years later but their film careers were ruined. No other suspects have ever been identified.
* [[Charles Walton (murder victim)|Charles Walton]] was found dead at a farm at Meon Hill, Warwickshire, on 14 February 1945. He had been beaten over the head with his own stick, his neck had been cut open with a slash hook and he had been pinned to the ground by his neck with a pitchfork. His employer, Alfred John Potter, was suspected of the murder but never charged. The case attracted notoriety because of suspicions the murder had been related to [[witchcraft]], and because of its similarities to the murder of a local woman, [[Charles Walton (murder victim)#Myths|Ann Tennant]] in 1875, who was also killed with a pitchfork by a man accusing her of witchcraft.
* [[Ernst Dehmel]] (30), a decorated officer in the German [[Waffen-SS]], was allegedly beaten to death by French soldiers who had him in their custody at Remscheid-Lüttringhausen on 7 August 1945. No charges have ever been brought.
* [[Carteron murders|The Carterons]], a French family of three and a foster child who lived with them, as well as their family dog, were all found shot execution-style face down on the floor of their [[Bommiers]] farmhouse on 25 July 1946, several days after signs of their apparent inattention to their farming duties had been noted by a neighbor. Robbery was seen as an unlikely motive since the family was very poor, and there were no signs of a struggle. The investigation was hampered by the still chaotic nature of French society barely a year after the end of the war; not until two years later was it established that the weapon used to kill the four was a [[Sten]], a submachine gun commonly used by the [[French Resistance]], giving rise to theories that the killings had something to do with it. A friend of Kléber Carteron said he had been claiming he was being followed the previous winter. No suspects have ever been named, although most residents of the area believe the killer was someone local who had a dispute with the family.
* [[Black Dahlia|The Black Dahlia]] (Elizabeth Short), a 22-year-old woman who was found severely mutilated and her body cut in half in Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California on 15 January 1947. Her unsolved murder has been the source of several books, films, and widespread speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Dahlia case on America's Most Wanted |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=40390#case |work=America's Most Wanted |accessdate=2008-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707192311/http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=40390 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 20 June 1947, gangster [[Bugsy Siegel]], known for making [[Las Vegas]] into a gambling destination, was shot several times with an M-1 carbine from outside as he read the newspaper at a friend's house in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. There are many suspects. Police believe he was killed by his own associates, but have never put together enough evidence against any one of them to declare the case solved.&lt;ref name="Bugsy Siegel"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Ann|title=Who Killed Bugsy Siegel? 50 Years Later, Still a Mystery|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-20/local/me-5334_1_bugsy-siegel|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Tamam Shud case]], an unidentified man was found dead on [[Somerton Park, South Australia|Somerton]] beach in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the morning of 1 December 1948 at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Also known as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, this case is considered "one of Australia's most profound mysteries", and no suspects have been named nor has the man ever been identified despite the best efforts of many world agencies. He was killed by an unknown poison with a piece of paper in his pocket that reads "Tamám Shud", meaning "The End".
* [[Emily Armstrong]], found in a dry cleaner's shop in [[London]], England on 14 April 1949, about an hour after she had been murdered. An autopsy showed she was beaten to death and her skull shattered by at least 22 blows from a blunt object, believed to be a [[claw hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Newton | first = Michael | title = The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes | publisher = Facts On File Inc. | year = 2004 | location = New York | isbn = 0-8160-4980-7|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three people died when [[Matsukawa derailment|a train derailed near Matsukawa, Japan]] on 17 August 1949. Investigators found that the track had been sabotaged going into a curve and arrested 20 people; all of whom were initially convicted and, in several cases, [[Capital punishment in Japan|sentenced to death]]. However, during the appeals process, it eventually emerged that prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory evidence, and after all the defendants were released in 1970 the case was closed. No other suspects have ever been identified.

===1950s===
* [[Murder of Harry and Harriette Moore|Harry and Harriette Moore]] (45), and (49), were severely injured by a bomb that exploded underneath the bedroom of their [[Mims, Florida]], home on 25 December 1951. Harry died in the ambulance on the way to the nearest hospital that would treat [[African American]]s; his wife succumbed to her injuries nine days later, after his funeral. They had both been active in the local [[civil rights movement]], and investigations have concluded that was the motive for the bombing, making them not only one of the earliest martyrs to that cause but the only married couple killed for their activism in it. By the time four suspects, all senior members of the central Florida [[Ku Klux Klan]], were identified, they had all died, and the case was closed in 1991 with no arrests.
* [[Arnold Schuster]] (24), a clothing salesman who had provided the tip that led to the capture of legendary bank robber [[Willie Sutton]], was shot dead outside his Brooklyn home a month afterwards, on 8 March 1952. Police interviewed 300 people but never identified any as a suspect, although they came to believe the killing was carried out by either the Mafia or Sutton's associates. A lawsuit against the city by his family led to a landmark state-court ruling that the state has a duty to protect anyone who cooperates with the police to the extent that they seek.
* [[Jack Burris]] (35), [[Mayes County, Oklahoma]], [[county attorney]], was killed with a shotgun blast just outside his house in June 1952. Investigators were unable to obtain a tape that purported to be the killer's confession later in the decade; there have been no suspects since then.
* [[John Acropolis]] (43), a New York labor leader with organized crime connections, was shot by an unknown assailant in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] on 26 August 1952.
* The severely beaten body of [[Murder of Betty Shanks|Betty Shanks]] (22), was found in a [[Grange, Queensland]], garden on the morning of 19 September 1952. The largest criminal investigation in the state's history yielded no solid suspects or leads; the case remains open.
* [[Babes in the Wood murders (Stanley Park)]] – two unidentified boys located on 14 January 1953 in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They were likely murdered in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;

* On 9 April 1953, the body of [[Wilma Montesi]] (21), washed up on a beach at [[Torvaianica]], Italy, near Rome. The investigation delved into accounts of orgies and drug use in Roman society, but no one was ever charged.
[[File:Kyllikki Saari ja siskot.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Kyllikki Saari]] (back right), murdered in [[Isojoki]], 1953. Her case remains one of Finland's major unsolved murder cases]]
* The body of [[Kyllikki Saari]] (17), of [[Isojoki]], [[Finland]], was found on 11 October 1953, almost five months after she was last seen. Several suspects have been considered but no one has ever been prosecuted. The case remains one of the country's best-known mysteries.
* [[Alma Preinkert]] (58), registrar of the [[University of Maryland]], was stabbed by an intruder in her Washington home on February 28, 1954, and died shortly afterwards. No suspect has ever been named.
* Marilyn Reese Sheppard, pregnant wife of [[Sam Sheppard]], attacked and killed in their home in [[Bay Village, Ohio]], United States, on 4 July 1954. Sam Sheppard was convicted of killing her, but this was overturned in 1966, and he was acquitted in a new trial. He claimed his wife was killed by a bushy-haired man who also attacked him and knocked him unconscious twice. Their son slept through the night, just down the hall from the bedroom in which his mother was murdered. The trial of Sam Sheppard received extensive publicity and was called "carnival atmosphere" by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=384&amp;invol=333 Sheppard v. Maxwell]'', 384 U.S. 333, 358 (1964) (U.S. Supreme Court)&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheppard case was a large part of the inspiration for the 1960s television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' and the [[The Fugitive (1993 film)|1993 movie of the same name]].
* [[Carolyn Wasilewski]] (14), was found dead in a rail yard near her [[Baltimore, Maryland]] home on 9 November 1954. The case generated nationwide media attention, and police still get calls about the case. However, no suspects have ever been named. Filmmaker [[John Waters]] says the case and the media frenzy over some aspects of Baltimore's youth culture of the time inspired his film ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', later adapted into a [[Cry-Baby (musical)|Broadway musical]].
* [[Serge Rubinstein]] (46), a stock swindler and international playboy was found strangled in his Manhattan mansion on 27 January 1955. Because of his notoriety, there were numerous suspects but the murder remained unsolved. The following year, the film "[[Death of a Scoundrel]], loosely based on Rubinstein's life, was released.
* Early [[civil rights movement]] leader [[George W. Lee]] (51), was killed by an assailant who drove up alongside his car and shot him several times on 7 May 1955, in [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. After local and state authorities insisted that the death was a traffic accident, U.S. Attorney General [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]] ordered a federal investigation which was able to prove it was a homicide; however, although some suspects were identified but never named publicly no arrests were made since witnesses were afraid to testify.
* Another Mississippi African American civil rights activist, [[Lamar Smith (activist)|Lamar Smith]] (63), was shot and killed on August 13, 1955, outside the [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Lincoln County]] courthouse in [[Brookhaven, Mississippi|Brookhaven]], where he had been helping other African American registered voters fill out [[absentee ballot]]s for an upcoming primary to avoid attempts to intimidate them at the polls. Dozens of witnesses reportedly saw the killing, and three men were arrested, but an all-white grand jury refused to indict them. 
* [[William Morris Bioff]] (55), a labor leader with organized-crime ties, was killed by a bomb that detonated when he started his car on the morning of 4 November 1955, outside his Illinois home. No suspects have ever been named.
* [[Grimes sisters|Barbara and Patricia Grimes]] disappeared on 28 December 1956, in Chicago, Illinois after going to a cinema to view a screening of the [[Elvis Presley]] film ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes of the Centuries: Notorious Crimes, Criminals, and Criminal Trials in American History'' {{ISBN|978-1-610-69594-7}} p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Their disappearance launched one of the biggest missing-persons hunts in Chicago history. However, police were not able to determine what happened to the Grimes sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Elvis Urges Missing Girls To Go Home | date=20 December 1957 | publisher=Newspaperarchive.com | url =http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0022/2888907/15291980_clean.html | work =Hammond Times | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January 1957 their naked bodies were found off a road near [[Willow Springs, Illinois]]. The corpses contained various bruises and marks (for example puncture wounds in the chest that may have come from an ice pick) that were never fully explained.
* Discovered in a box in the Fox Chase section of Philadelphia, PA, 25 February 1957, was a young boy. Known as [[Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)|"The Boy in the Box"]] and "America's Unknown Child", to this day his homicide, as well as his identity, remains unsolved.
* Mafia boss [[Albert Anastasia]] (55), was shot to death while being shaved at a Manhattan barbershop on 25 October 1957. The list of suspects includes many other organized-crime figures of the era; no one has ever been officially named although authorities think the actual assassins were members of the Boston-based Patriarca crime family, in keeping with the mob's practice of hiring for such major hits from out of town.
* [[Rosemarie Nitribitt]] (24), a prostitute, was found dead in her luxury apartment in Frankfurt, Germany, on 1 November 1957. She had been strangled and beaten; the investigation established that this had happened three days beforehand. Police arrested Heinz Pohlmann, a businessman and friend of Nitribitt's who had visited her that day. He was tried and eventually acquitted due to questions about whether the time of death had been accurately established. No other suspects have ever been identified; the case has inspired novels, films and plays.
* Dancer [[Pearl Eaton]] (60), was found dead in her [[Manhattan Beach, California]], apartment on 10 September 1958. The police called the death a homicide, but never solved the case.
* [[Gus Greenbaum]] (62), another Chicago Outfit figure, was stabbed and beaten to death along with his wife in their [[Phoenix, Arizona]], house on 3 December 1958, supposedly as punishment for his continued [[Skimming (casinos)|skimming]] of casino profits. No suspects were ever identified.
* [[Lynne Harper]] (12), was last seen alive on 9 June 1959 riding on the handlebars of her friend [[Steven Truscott]]'s bike near an air force base which is now [[Vanastra, Ontario]], Canada. Two days later her body was discovered in a nearby farm woodlot. She had been raped and strangled with her own blouse. Fourteen-year-old Steven Murray Truscott was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder, becoming Canada's youngest person to be sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life in prison. Truscott was held in custody for 10 years: in 2007, his conviction was ruled a miscarriage of justice, although he was not declared innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Victim's family stunned by Truscott compensation | date=8 July 2008 | url =http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/07/08/truscott-reaction.html | work =CBC News | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After a friend of Dutch prostitute [[Blonde Dolly]] (32), born Sybille Niemans, found her shades drawn and the door locked on the morning of November 2, 1959, police in [[The Hague]] found her body upstairs. She was determined to have been strangled two days before, but in the years since no suspects have ever been identified.
* Almost 600 possible suspects have been considered in the [[Walker family murders]] of 12 December 1959, in which two children and their parents were shot by intruders at their [[Osprey, Florida]], farmhouse. Among them are the two men executed by Kansas for the Clutter family murders, which formed the basis for [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[In Cold Blood]]''.

===1960s===

* All 34 passengers and crew aboard [[National Airlines Flight 2511]] from New York to Miami were killed on 6 January 1960, when a bomb exploded aboard the plane in mid-flight. The FBI is still investigating the case and no suspects have been named.&lt;ref name="National Flight 2511"&gt;{{cite news|title=50 years later, locals recall mysterious circumstances of NAL Flight 2511 plane crash|last=Steelman|first=Ben|date=January 5, 2010|newspaper=Wilmington Star-News|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20100105/ARTICLES/1054003/0/VIDEO?p=all&amp;tc=pgall&amp;tc=ar|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Lake Bodom murders]] were a multiple homicide that took place in Finland on 5 June 1960. That night four teenagers were camping on the shores of the Finnish lake when between 4 am and 6 am, they were attacked by an unknown individual or individuals with a knife and a blunt object. Three of them died, and the fourth one was wounded but survived. Although the sole survivor became a suspect for some time in 2004, the case remains unsolved and the killer(s) unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man remanded on suspicion of infamous unsolved triple murder from 1960 |date=5 April 2004 |url=http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7 |work=Helsingin Sanomat |accessdate=2008-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112643/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7 |archivedate=10 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paul Guihard]] (31), an [[Agence France-Presse]] reporter covering the [[Ole Miss Riot of 1962]], was found dead near a building of what turned out to be a gunshot wound. He was the only journalist killed during the [[civil rights movement]]; his killer has never been identified.
* The body of [[Murder of William Lewis Moore|William Lewis Moore]], 35, was found on the side of [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] near [[Attalla, Alabama]], on April 23, 1963; he was in the middle of a one-man civil rights protest in which he was marching from his home in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to the [[Mississippi Governor's Mansion]] to deliver a letter supporting racial equality and desegregation to that state's governor, [[Ross Barnett]]. He had been shot twice with a rifle shortly after giving an interview to a local TV station; the gun's owner was identified but neither he nor anyone else was ever charged.
* [[Murder of Louis Allen|Louis Allen]] (44), was shot dead on 31 January 1964, on his [[Liberty, Mississippi]], farm. An [[African American]] who had attempted to register to vote and reportedly was willing to talk to federal investigators about a 1961 murder of another black Liberty resident by a white state legislator, Allen had faced increasing harassment and was to move to Wisconsin the next day. The sheriff at the time, Daniel Jones, has long been suspected of involvement; in a 2011 television interview he denied it. No one has ever been prosecuted.
* [[Mary S. Sherman]] (51), an orthopedic surgeon, was found dead of stab wounds and burns in her [[New Orleans]] apartment on 21 July 1964. No suspects have ever been named.
* [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]] (43), a socialite from [[Washington, D.C.]] who had been married to [[CIA]] Director of Operations [[Cord Meyer]], and [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of U.S. President John F. Kennedy,&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohn |first=George Childs |year=1989 |orig-year=2000 |chapter=Kennedy-Meyer Affair |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzdWTBytwAIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage |title=The New Encyclopedia of American Scandal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzdWTBytwAIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |location=New York |edition=Revised |publisher=Facts On File/Infobase Publishing |pages=220–221 |isbn=9781438130224 |access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 1964, Meyer was shot once in the head and once in the chest by an assailant while walking along the [[towpath]] of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].&lt;ref name="Kohn"/&gt; A witness identified the assailant as Raymond Crump Jr., but without hard evidence, Crump was tried, acquitted, and released.&lt;ref name="Kohn"/&gt;
* The bodies of [[Wanda Beach murders|Marianne Schmidt and Christine Sharrock]], both 15, were found beaten and stabbed on [[Wanda Beach]] near Sydney on the morning of 11 January 1965, having last been seen on the beach the previous evening; the killer had apparently also attempted to rape them. Several suspects have been identified over the years, but none ever formally charged; a DNA sample was taken from the preserved blood and semen at the scene but it is not known if a match has been made.
* [[James Reeb]] (38), a Unitarian minister from Philadelphia, died on 11 March 1965, in a [[Birmingham, Alabama]], hospital of injuries sustained during a beating at a restaurant outside Selma four days earlier, where he was dining with other civil rights activists. Four men were indicted for the crime; three were acquitted and one fled the state. The FBI reopened the case in 2007 only to close it four years later as the only living suspect was among those acquitted.
* On 25 March 1965, [[Viola Liuzzo]] (39), a civil rights activist from Michigan, was shot and killed after a car driven by four local [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]] ran hers off an Alabama highway outside [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]]. The four Klansmen were arrested, but prosecutions were complicated since one was an FBI informant. The other three were convicted on broad federal civil rights charges, but the only suspect to face trial on the murder charge was acquitted despite a strong circumstantial case brought by prosecutors.
* No suspects have ever been identified in the 8 July 1965, bombing of [[Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 21]] above [[British Columbia]], which killed all 52 aboard.
* Similarly, the bombing that killed all 66 passengers and crew of [[Cyprus Airways Flight 284]] over the Mediterranean between Greece and Cyprus on 12 October 1965 remains unsolved.
* [[Sammy Younge Jr.]] (21), was shot and killed 3 January 1966, by a [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], gas station attendant with whom he had been arguing while trying to use a bathroom reserved for whites. He had been a member of the [[Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee]], which decided three days later to start opposing the [[Vietnam War]] because his death. The attendant's trial was moved to a neighboring, whiter county, where he was acquitted by an all-white jury in December.
* Early in the morning of 17 June 1966, two black men walked into a [[Paterson, New Jersey]], bar and began shooting. The bartender and one patron died at the scene; a female customer died of her wounds a month later. Former professional boxer [[Rubin Carter]] and a friend, John Artis, were charged with the crime and convicted the following year, despite their own alibi, weak evidence and alleged racial bias by police and prosecutors. They always protested their innocence, and their case became a ''cause celebre'', inspiring [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)|Hurricane]]". In 1978, they won a second trial but were convicted again; after another ''[[habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' petition was granted in 1985, the state declined to retry them. No other suspects have ever been identified.
* Valerie Percy (21), was stabbed and beaten to death by an intruder who broke into her family's lakeside house in [[Kenilworth, Illinois]] before dawn on 18 September 1966. Despite some evidence left behind, and a sketch of the suspect that was widely distributed, no arrests were ever made. Her father, [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]], was elected to the U.S. Senate several weeks later. In 1973, an award-winning series in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' suggested the murder was a botched robbery committed by a gang with organized-crime connections; however, nothing was taken from the house and investigators today believe the motive was personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chuck |last=Goudie |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=investigative&amp;id=4563621 |title=Percy Killing: The Forty Year File 9/15/06 |work=[[WLS-TV|abc7chicago]] |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171951/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news&amp;id=4563621 |archivedate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Cook County, Illinois]], deputy sheriff Ralph Probst (30), was shot and killed in the kitchen of his [[Hometown, Illinois|Hometown]] home from outside on 10 April 1967. In the weeks before he had told family and coworkers that he was investigating "something big" that would lead to his promotion. Since he had been working in the organized-crime unit, suspects, including [[Silas Jayne]], have been named, but none ever charged.&lt;ref name="Ralph Probst"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Ray|title=Still A Mystery, 20 Years Later|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-05/news/8701180015_1_police-office-canine-unit-unsolved-homicide|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 5, 1987|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 25 August 1967 two men dressed as road maintenance workers stopped [[Hong Kong]] radio commentator [[Lam Bun]], 37, as he drove home, then poured petrol all over him, a cousin who was with him, and his car, all of which they then set aflame. Both Lam and his cousin died; it is believed that the killers may have been associated with the leftist groups that Bun often ridiculed on air during that year's ongoing [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist riots|leftist riots]], since many of the latter have refused to condemn the killing. While public outrage over the killing led the government to finally suppress the protests and riots, no arrests have ever been made.
* All six members of the [[Robison family murders|Robison family]] were found shot in the head in their [[Good Hart, Michigan]], vacation cabin on 22 July 1968; investigators established that the killings had taken place on 25 June. A lengthy investigation led police to Joseph Scolaro, an employee of Richard Robison's who may also have been embezzling from him. There was much circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime, but it was not sufficient enough to charge him with it. Four years later the case was reopened in the Robisons' county of residence, and when Scolaro learned that he was about to be charged this time he killed himself, leaving behind a typed suicide note in which he confessed to previous thefts and swindles but protested his innocence of the Robison killings. The case remains officially open.
* On 1 October 1968, the body of [[Stevan Marković (bodyguard)|Stevan Marković]] (31), Serbian-born bodyguard to French film star [[Alain Delon]], was found in a garbage dump on the western outskirts of Paris. Possible nude photographs of the wife of French president [[Georges Pompidou]] were found in his car shortly afterwards, leading to [[Markovic affair|a political scandal]] around allegations of blackmail and Marković's connections to Corsican organized crime. The murder officially remains unsolved.
* [[Barbara Ann Hackmann Taylor]]'s body was found alongside a road near [[Georgetown, Kentucky]], on 17 December 1968. Until her identification in 1998, she was known only as "Tent Girl". Her husband was suspected at the time, but is now deceased.
* [[Edwin T. Pratt]] (38), then director of the Seattle [[Urban League]], was shot and killed outside his [[Shoreline, Washington]], home on 26 January 1969. Despite an extensive investigation, no arrests were ever made. Later research by area newspapers has identified three likely suspects, all of whom have since died.&lt;ref name="Edwin Pratt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Rick|title=He Killed Edwin Pratt|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2011-05-25/news/he-killed-edwin-pratt/|newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Clarence 13X]] (41), founder of [[Five-Percent Nation]] (splinter group of the [[Nation of Islam]]), was fatally shot by a group of attackers in the lobby of his wife's [[Harlem]] apartment building on the morning of 13 June 1969. One suspect was arrested two months later; charges were dropped. New York police believe the murder was related to an extortion attempt; no other suspects have ever been named.
* [[Betsy Aardsma]] (22), from [[Holland, Michigan]] was a graduate student at Penn State University. She was stabbed to death in the stacks of Pattee Library on Penn State's campus on 28 November 1969. She was stabbed a single time through the heart with a single-edged small knife. Approximately one minute later two men told a desk clerk, "Somebody better help that girl," and then left the library. The men were never identified. 25–35 minutes later she was pronounced dead at the hospital. She had been wearing a red dress, and since there was only a small amount of blood visible, no one realized immediately that she had been stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Police on Lookout For 2 in Coed Case | publisher=Google newspaper Archive | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GEYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=betsy%20aardsma&amp;sjid=2WwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6132%2C279330 | work =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
* On 3 January 1970 the body of Sister [[Murder of Catherine Cesnik|Catherine Cesnik]] (27), a nun and teacher at a local Catholic high school for girls, was found in a garbage dump in [[Lansdowne, Maryland]], just outside [[Baltimore]], dead from the internal bleeding after a strong blow to the head fractured her skull. She had been missing for almost two months. While the case remains unsolved, later journalistic investigation has raised the possibility she had become aware of [[Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States|sexual abuse allegations against two priests]] who worked at the school and was planning to bring those allegations to authorities at the time she disappeared. The case is the basis for the 2017 [[Netflix]] documentary series ''[[The Keepers]]''.
* [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]] Black Student Union cofounder [[Melvin X]] (22), was found fatally shot in the driver's seat of a borrowed car outside [[Mira Loma, California]], on June 7, 1970; he had last been seen the previous evening. A suspect who was arrested four months later on unrelated charges in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] was released after passing a lie detector test along with two other persons of interest. The case remains open.
* [[Leon Jordan]] (65), an African-American [[civil rights movement]] leader in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], was shot dead outside a tavern he owned on July 15, 1970. Three men, connected with local organized crime, were arrested and charged with the crime; one was acquitted and charges were dropped against the other two. In 2010, the case was reopened after the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' uncovered evidence that had gone missing during the original investigation; it uncovered more definite evidence that the killing was a mob hit but by then all the suspects had died.
* The bodies of [[Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]], 28 and 30 respectively, were found in New Zealand's [[Waikato River]] near their [[Pukekawa]] farm in August and September 1970 respectively. They had been reported missing on 22 June of that year, five days after last being seen. Both had been shot with a rifle. After a short investigation, police arrested Arthur Thomas, another farmer, later that year. He was tried and convicted twice, but there was evidence that police had fabricated key evidence against him. This led to an inquiring commission that severely criticized two of the lead investigators without holding them accountable otherwise, and Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] pardoned Thomas in 1979. Authorities have never identified any other suspects, although two journalists have written books proposing alternative theories of the case.
* Investigations have strongly suggested that Italian journalist [[Mauro De Mauro]] (disappeared 16 September 1970) (49), was killed by the Mafia to prevent him from completing his own inquiry into the death of [[Enrico Mattei]] after he was kidnapped while returning from work in [[Palermo]]. However, it has never been clear which of several possible motives led to his death, and his body has never been found. In 2011, the only living suspect was tried and acquitted; the prosecution continues to appeal.

* [[Joe Gallo]] (43), was shot to death in [[Umberto's Clam House|a Manhattan clamhouse]] on 7 April 1972, as part of a war between New York City Mafia families. The investigation identified no suspects, although [[Frank Sheeran]] claimed shortly before his death 31 years later that he was the lone gunman.
* On 20 April 1972, New York City police officer Philip Cardillo, 32, died in the hospital of a gunshot wound inflicted six days earlier during an [[1972 Harlem mosque incident|incident at a Harlem mosque]]. Another officer involved said he had seen one of the mosque's congregants, Louis 17X Dupree, standing over Cardillo with a gun pointed at his chest. Due to political complications resulting from the incident, suspects who had been in custody were not identified before being released and evidence was not collected at the scene. The detective in charge of investigating the shooting later claimed interference from senior officers impeded his efforts and procedures were ignored. Two years later, Dupree's first trial, based largely on the testimony of an informant, resulted in a [[hung jury]] and his second in an acquittal. He later served a prison sentence in North Carolina on drug charges and is currently in a Georgia prison on another charge. A later police informant in another case identified another suspect; he was never tried. Detectives who continue to investigate the case have complained that the FBI, which also had informants within the mosque, lied about what it knew in the past and is still withholding relevant information.&lt;ref name="Harlem mosque incident"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gendar |first=Alison |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-03-21/news/17919176_1_mosque-nypd-fbi-surveillance |title=Nation of Islam mosque killing of NYPD cop still a mystery, 37 years later – New York Daily News |publisher=Articles.nydailynews.com |date=March 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parts of [[Dolores Della Penna]]'s body were found in two separate [[South Jersey]] locations in July 1972. The Philadelphia 17-year-old had last been seen leaving her house in the city's [[Tacony, Philadelphia|Tacony]] neighborhood on 11 July. Her fingertips had been removed from her hands to prevent fingerprint identification and her head has never been found. In the mid-1990s police identified several suspects and claimed the motive had been revenge against her boyfriend for stealing drugs from some local dealers; however, most of them were dead by that time and the living ones were not charged.

It has been speculated that he was killed over unpaid debts, but no one has ever been charged.
* [[Jeannette DePalma]] (16), is believed to have been killed on or around 7 August 1972 in Springfield Township, New Jersey.
* [[Yosef Alon]] (43), a military attaché at the Israeli embassy in Washington, was shot fatally in his [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]] driveway as he and his wife returned from a party shortly after midnight on 1 July 1973.

* [[Arlis Perry]] (19), was found dead in [[Stanford Memorial Church]], where she had gone the previous night after an argument with her husband, on the campus of [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], early on 13 October 1974. She had been beaten and sexually assaulted before her death but not raped; an ice pick found lodged into the base of her skull during the autopsy turned out to be the murder weapon.

* [[Murder of Betty Van Patter|Betty van Patter]] (52), bookkeeper for the [[Black Panther Party]], was last seen leaving a [[San Francisco]] tavern on 13 December 1974. A few weeks later her beaten corpse was pulled out of [[San Francisco Bay]]. It has been believed that members of the party were behind her death, as she had reportedly uncovered financial irregularities that pointed toward criminal activity, but authorities have never named any suspects.&lt;ref name="Betty Van Patter"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=recDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT28#v=onepage Frank Browning.

* A car bomb on 18 March 1975 in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], killed [[Herbert Chitepo]], 51, the first black lawyer in [[Rhodesia]], a bodyguard and, later, Chitepo's neighbour. No suspects have ever been named. A 2001 investigation blamed infighting among members of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), which Chitepo had helped found, but a memoir by a former member of Rhodesian intelligence says instead that his agencies were behind it and planted evidence to implicate ZANU.
* Gold prospectors in southern [[Oregon]] discovered four decaying bodies near a creek in the [[Siskiyou Mountains]] on 12 April 1975; these were identified through dental records as the [[Cowden family murders|Cowden family]] of [[White City, Oregon|White City]], who had disappeared from their campsite, where there was some evidence of a struggle, near [[Copper, Jackson County, Oregon|Copper]] the previous year's [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] weekend. One of the original searchers said the bodies had not been where they were found; police find his story credible. Dwain Lee Little, of nearby [[Ruch, Oregon|Ruch]], who was on parole from a previous rape and murder conviction at the time and is currently serving consecutive life sentences for an attempted murder of a mother and her infant child, is considered a suspect due to circumstantial evidence but it has not been enough to support charging him with the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19900903&amp;id=i1BTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FocDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4819,7100233|via=Google News|title=Killings still haunt Applegate Valley|date=September 3, 1990|accessdate=October 1, 2018|work=The Bulletin|p=A5|location=Bend, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; True-crime writer [[Ann Rule]]'s 2009 book about Little, ''But I Trusted You'', goes into the case.
* [[Sam Giancana]] (67), a longtime leader of the Chicago Outfit, was shot and killed in his kitchen on 19 June 1975, shortly before he was to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating possible CIA and Mafia collaboration in plots to assassinate [[John F. Kennedy]] over a decade earlier. This has led to much speculation as to who wanted him dead, with the actual shooter believed to be someone Giancana knew well. However, no charges have ever been brought in the case.
* On 23 June 1975, the body of brothel keeper [[Shirley Finn]] was found shot dead in a parked car in [[City of South Perth|South Perth]], Australia. No suspects have ever been identified; the investigation is continuing.
* [[Juanita Nielsen]] was last seen on 4 July 1975 in [[Sydney, Australia]] after a meeting in a club owned by a major figure of organized crime. She was a publisher, activist for conservation and community issues, particularly anti-development campaigns, which may have led to her death.
* [[Barbara Colby]] and James Kiernan, American actors, were shot to death while walking to his car in [[Venice, California]] on 24 July 1975. Colby died instantly but Kiernan was able to describe the shooting to the police before he also died from his wounds. He said the shooting occurred without reason or provocation and said that there were two gunmen whom he did not recognize.

* The [[1975 LaGuardia Airport bombing]] occurred on the evening of December 29, 1975, at the TWA baggage claim at New York's [[LaGuardia Airport]], killing 11. It has been suspected that [[Croatia]]n nationalists were behind it, due to a similar bomb found at [[Grand Central Terminal]] a year later, but the group responsible for that event has denied responsibility for the earlier attack. Officially it remains unsolved.
* All 81 aboard died on 1 January 1976 when a bomb exploded on [[Middle East Airlines Flight 438]]. No suspects were ever identified.
* [[Joseph Barboza]] (43), a former operative with Boston's [[Patriarca crime family]], was killed by four shotgun blasts at close range on February 11, 1976, while walking back to his car after visiting a friend's [[San Francisco]] apartment.

* Priscilla Childers maintained to her 2001 death that her former husband, oil heir [[T. Cullen Davis]], entered her house disguised with a wig on 2 August 1976 and fatally shot her 12-year-old daughter Andrea Wilborn, then ambushed her and her boyfriend Stan Farr as they returned home, also killing Farr. A judge had just granted her an increase in the support payments Davis owed her. He was indicted only in Wilborn's death, making him was the wealthiest person to ever be tried for murder in the United States; at trial he was acquitted although Farr's children settled a [[wrongful death]] suit they brought against him. A few years later Davis was also tried and acquitted on charges he had conspired to have Childers and the judge murdered. Both cases have been the subject of books.&lt;ref name="T.

* [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] police officer Robert W. Wood, 27, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in the early hours of 28 November 1976. Randall Dale Adams was initially convicted of the murder and almost executed. [[Errol Morris]]'s 1988 documentary film ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' re-examined the case and suggested that another Texas inmate, David Harris, who had testified against Adams, was the more likely suspect after a taped statement from Harris at the end of the film that implicated him. Harris recanted his trial testimony at Adams's ''[[habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' hearing, which resulted in the charges against Adams being dropped, freeing him. But Harris never explicitly confessed to the crime before his own execution for another murder in 2004, leaving the killing officially unsolved.&lt;ref name="Wood ODMP page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Officer Robert William Wood|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/14460-officer-robert-william-wood|publisher=Officer Down Memorial Page|date=1996–2016|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The stabbing deaths of [[Easey Street murders|Suzanne Armstrong and Susan Bartlett]] occurred on 10 January 1977 in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], Australia. These murders have been linked to the disappearance of a [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]] woman two years earlier. However, no suspect has ever been named.
* [[Frank Bompensiero]] (71), a longtime Mafia contract killer, was himself shot and killed on 1 February 1977, while making a phone call in the [[Pacific Beach, San Diego|Pacific Beach]] neighborhood of [[San Diego, California]].

* Australian wallpaper designer [[Florence Broadhurst]] (78), was found bludgeoned to death in her [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] studio on 15 October 1977. No one has ever been officially named as a suspect; speculation has ranged from serial killer [[John Wayne Glover]] to an acquaintance (the evidence suggests she knew her killer, and s/he was familiar with the layout of her studio).
* South African [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] politician [[Robert Smit (politician)|Robert Smit]] and his wife were found shot and stabbed in their home in a Pretoria suburb on 22 November 1977. The words "RAU TEM" were spray painted on the walls and cupboards of the house. Their meaning remains unknown, as does the identity of the perpetrators.
* On 8 January 1978, a shot through the window of his home in a suburb of the South African city of [[Durban]] killed anti-apartheid South African philosopher [[Rick Turner (philosopher)|Rick Turner]] (35). An extensive investigation at the time turned up no suspects, and none have been named since, although it is widely believed that he was murdered by the security forces due to his activism.
* [[Murder of Denise McGregor|Denise McGregor]] (12), was abducted on her way back from doing errands in the [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] suburb of [[Pascoe Vale]] on the evening of 20 March 1978. Her body was found the next day, raped and with injuries so brutal the pathologist likened them to those suffered by victims of plane crashes. Robert Arthur Selby Lowe, convicted of the 1991 [[murder of Sheree Beasley]], was suspected until DNA evidence eliminated him. The case remains open.
* The [[Pemiscot County Does]] were found murdered on 17 June 1978.

* The [[Burger Chef murders]] of four employees of that restaurant outside [[Speedway, Indiana]], on 17 November 1978, have never been solved despite extensive investigation.
* Ten guests, mostly visiting Canadians, died in a 26 November 1978 [[1978 Holiday Inn fire|fire]] at a [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Greece, New York]], outside [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. Investigators found that it was set but were not able to make progress until 2014, when after a three-year reinvestigation of the case they announced they had one, but did not identify that person.
* Shortly after a private meeting with Cambodian dictator [[Pol Pot]] on 22 December 1978, British Marxist academic [[Malcolm Caldwell]] (47), was shot and killed by unknown assailants at the [[Phnom Penh]] guest house where he was staying with two Western journalists, the first allowed to visit the country since Pot's [[Khmer Rouge]] had taken power three years before. Three days later, [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnam invaded Cambodia]], forcing the Khmer Rouge from power and exposing their [[Cambodian genocide|genocide]], reports of which Caldwell had been one of the most forceful deniers of in the West. His killing is believed to have been an inside job since he and his companions were under heavy guard the whole time they were in the country. It is believed that either Pot had him killed over a disagreement (although he reportedly returned from the meeting in very high spirits) or that anti-regime subversives did it in preparation for the Vietnamese invasion, in order to eliminate one of the Khmer Rouge's most passionate defenders abroad.
* On 6 January 1979, [[Geylang Bahru Family Murders|the bodies of the four Tan children]] were found in their family's apartment in the [[Singapore]] neighborhood of [[Geylang Bahru]], stacked on top of each other after they had been extensively stabbed and slashed with a knife and chopper. Police believe the killer or killers had planned the crime for some time and knew the family, as a [[Chinese New Year]] card sent a month after the crime used personal nicknames and seemed aware that the couple could not have more children. However, no suspects have ever been identified.
* [[Adolph Dubs]] (58), then [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan]], who had been kidnapped by militants, was found to have been shot in the head at close range on February 14, 1979, after an abortive rescue attempt by Afghan police. The investigation of the crime was perfunctory; who the kidnappers were, and which of them killed Dubs, has never been determined. U.S. authorities came to believe that the Soviet [[KGB]] was behind the murder, and documents released from the [[Vasili Mitrokhin|Mitrokhin]] archive in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, have lent some support to these allegations; the Soviets in turn accused the [[CIA]] of having done it to discredit them. In the wake of the killing the U.S. began disengaging from Afghanistan and more openly supporting opponents of the government, setting the stage for the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of the country]] later that year.&lt;ref name="Adolph Dubs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman|first=Mark|title=Mystery of Envoy's Slaying in Kabul May Yield Secrets : Afghanistan: President offers an open inquiry into 1979 kidnap-murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-28/news/mn-4287_1_adolph-dubs|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 28, 1992|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OPP investigators believed initially that McIntyre had been killed as revenge by convicted bank robber Rex Yates from whom he'd obtained a confession while undercover as a fellow inmate; however, they could not find any evidence to support that theory and, after Yates' own death in a 1990 boating accident, a witness claimed McIntyre had been seen alive later than police thought he had been killed, seemingly ruling Yates out as he had an alibi. The OPP continues to believe McIntyre's death was related to his work. In 2004, it was also reported that McIntyre might have been killed by fellow OPP officers to prevent him from [[coming out]] as gay and revealing their homosexuality as well.

* After an anonymous caller to the house of [[Murder of Grégory Villemin|Grégory Villemin]] (4), of [[Lépanges-sur-Vologne]], France, told his family on 16 October 1984 he had taken the boy, who had been playing unsupervised in front of the house, a search found Grégory's body, bound and gagged, in the [[Vologne]] River {{convert|7|km}} away, where he had apparently been drowned (although the autopsy suggested the drowning had occurred in a different body of water). This began a case that has continued to receive extensive national media attention. An anonymous note suggesting the writer had killed the boy led to the arrest of Bernard Laroche, a Villemin cousin, who was now suspected of having written a long string of threatening anonymous letters to members of the family, socially and economically prominent in that area of the [[Vosges]]. Grégory's father, Jean-Marie, shot and killed Laroche several months later; he would serve several years in prison as a result. Handwriting experts then linked Grégory's mother to the notes; she was charged with the murders but, after seven years and two trials, acquitted. Efforts to recover DNA from the principal evidence in the early 21st century failed, but in 2017 three of Grégory's other relatives were charged, although police say they do not yet know who actually killed him.

* Dutch mathematician [[Willem Klein]] (73), was found dead of stab wounds in his Amsterdam apartment on 1 August 1986. A young man was arrested shortly afterwards but released. No other suspects have ever been named.
* Police in [[East Orange, New Jersey]], initially believed that the March 8, 1987, death of 79-year-old [[Harry Dudkin]], former judge, Congressional candidate and clerk of the [[New Jersey General Assembly|state Assembly]], was due to a fall in his family's stationery store. But the autopsy revealed a bullet lodged in his brain, and on further investigation discovered the store's receipts for that day were missing. The case remains open.
* A body found 11 June 1987, in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], field turned out to be that of [[Peggy Hettrick murder case|Peggy Hettrick]] (37). She had been stabbed and "sexually mutilated." Police initially suspected Timothy Masters, a teenage boy who lived nearby, and eventually arrested him a decade later. His 1999 conviction was vacated in 2008 when physical evidence that had been withheld from the defense at his original trial was found to rule him out as a suspect. Two other individuals, one of whom took his own life in 1995, have been described as possible suspects. The case remains open.
* On 17 November 1987, police found the beaten bodies of [[Dardeen family homicides|Elaine Dardeen (30), and her son Peter, 3]], as well as a newborn female infant she had apparently given birth to prematurely during the attack, tucked into bed in the family [[mobile home]] south of [[Ina, Illinois]]. Her husband Keith, 29, was the prime suspect until his body was found in a nearby wheat field the next day. After shooting him, the killer had cut his penis off. Nothing of value was taken from the home and Elaine had not been raped, nor were police able to find any other evidence that might have suggested a motive. In 2000, serial killer [[Tommy Lynn Sells]] confessed to the crime; however, he was never charged as there were doubts about his confession and authorities in Texas, where he was imprisoned, would not allow him to be taken to Illinois in order to resolve them before he was executed in 2014. No other suspects have ever been named.

* The decomposing body of [[Murder of Deanna Criswell|Deanna Criswell]] (16), was found off [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] near [[Tucson, Arizona]], on 23 November 1987. She had been there for any time from several days to several weeks. She remained unidentified for 28 years until DNA tests matched her with her family in [[Spokane, Washington]]; they had not reported her disappearance at the time because she habitually ran away only to return later. Another DNA profile at the scene matched that of the main suspect in her death, William Ross Knight, a local criminal who had died in 2005.
* Several motorcyclists opened fire on [[Punjab]]i singer [[Amar Singh Chamkila]] (27), and his wife as they got out of a car before a performance in [[Mehsampur]] on 8 March 1988. The couple and two of Chamkila's musicians were killed. Several theories as to who might have been responsible for the killings have been floated since then, but no suspects have ever been officially identified.
* [[Brian Spencer]] (39), who played for several [[National Hockey League]] teams during a 10-year career that ended in 1979, was shot during a robbery after allegedly buying cocaine in [[Riviera Beach, Florida]], on 2 June 1988. He died the next day. The year before, Spencer had been acquitted of a 1982 murder and kidnapping. Despite not entirely believing the story told them by Spencer's companion that night, police said he was not a suspect.

Both had been shot in the head. Local rumor at the time connected the killings to a supposed [[Satanic cult]] the two had been involved in and were trying to get out of, but no arrests were ever made. In 2017, a drug arrest led police to identify a local [[person of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/sally-mcnelly-shane-stewart|work=Unsolved.com|publisher=ABC Networks|title=Sally McNelly &amp; Shane Stewart: Is a satanic cult to blame for the murder of two Texas teens?|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother and adoptive father were charged with her murder; she was acquitted and he was convicted, a verdict later overturned on appeal due to lack of evidence. No other suspects have been named since then.

* Canadian-American weapons designer [[Gerald Bull]] (62), died in [[Brussels, Belgium]], on 22 March 1990, two days after being shot several times near his apartment. It has long been believed that the [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] was behind his death, as they believed his work for [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq might allow that country to develop weapons that could be used against their country, after he had refused to work with Israel.

* [[Frog Boys|Five boys aged 9 through 13]] went to the woods around [[South Korea]]'s Mount Waryong on 26 March 1991, to hunt for frogs and never returned. Despite a massive search of the mountain and surroundings, their bodies were not found until 2002, after an anonymous phone call led police to an area that had already been searched near the boys' village. At first it was theorized that they had died of exposure, a conclusion disputed by their families since the boys knew that area well and their clothes had been tied in knots. An autopsy showed that four had died of blows to the head and the other killed with a shotgun. Although the [[statute of limitations]] on the case expired in 2006, police continue to investigate for historical reasons.

* A [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]] drove a truck filled with explosives into [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|the Israeli embassy in Argentina]] on 17 March 1992, killing 29 in the deadliest attack ever on an Israeli diplomatic mission. Argentinian officials said they strongly believed Iran was behind the attack. They have not formally prosecuted any suspects, though they suspected [[Imad Mughniyah]] was involved in both this attack and the deadlier [[AMIA bombing]] two years later.
* Exiled Iranian dissident [[Fereydoun Farrokhzad]] (53), was found dead of multiple stab wounds in his house in [[Bonn]], Germany, on 13 August 1992. The autopsy established that he had been killed five days earlier.

* [[Piotr Jaroszewicz]] (82), a former Prime Minister of Communist Poland, was found murdered along with his wife Alicja Solska at their home in the [[Warsaw]] suburb of [[Anin]] on 3 September 1992. He had been strangled with a belt, which was still around his neck, after being beaten (and bandaged); she had been shot several times with one of the couple's hunting rifles after her hands were tied behind her back. She may have injured one of their attackers, who apparently also tried to kill the couple's dog with poison gas, while fighting back. A safe was left open and documents were taken from it while valuables were left behind. The killings were found to have occurred two days before; friends and family say that Jaroszewicz, who was obsessed with security to begin with, had been acting extremely paranoid in the days before the murders.

It is believed by law enforcement and those who knew him that he was killed by the Montreal Mafia over his successful cigarette smuggling business. Officially no suspects have ever been identified.
* [[Colin Ridgway]] (56), the first Australian to play in the [[National Football League]], was murdered in his [[University Park, Texas]], home on 13 May 1993.

* David Cullen Bain of [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, was initially convicted of the 20 June 1994 [[Bain family murders|murder of his parents and three siblings]] at their home. Prosecutors claimed he had staged the crime to look like his father had committed a [[murder-suicide]] of his family while David was out delivering papers; his defence claimed that murder-suicide was exactly what had happened. With help from former rugby star [[Joe Karam]], David pursued appeals and was eventually acquitted after a 2009 retrial.

* The 18 July 1994 [[AMIA bombing|suicide bombing of a Jewish organization's building in Buenos Aires]] killed 85, surpassing the similar attack on the Israeli embassy two years earlier as Argentina's deadliest terror attack. Five suspects, four of whom were local police officers, were acquitted in a 2004 trial; the investigating judge was removed from the case and later impeached after it was disclosed that he had paid for evidence. British authorities arrested an Iranian suspect named by Argentina in 2003 but declined to extradite him due to weak evidence. No other suspects have been named although investigations continue, one of which has since led to the unsolved death of [[Alberto Nisman]], the investigating prosecutor.
* The day after that bombing, another suicide bomber brought down [[Alas Chiricanas Flight 901|a plane in Panama]], killing 21, 12 of whom were Jews. While an apparently fictitious Arab terrorist organization claimed responsibility, no suspects have ever been identified.
* Irish crime boss [[Martin Cahill|Martin "The General" Cahill]] (45), was shot and killed at a Dublin intersection on 18 August 1994. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] claimed responsibility, citing Cahill's dealings with the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]]; however, it has also been reported that the IRA took exception to this only after being paid by two of Cahill's subordinates who were not eager to share profits from a drug operation with him. No arrests have ever been made.
* [[Johan Heyns]] (66), an [[Afrikaner Calvinism|Afrikaner Calvinist]] [[theology|theologian]], was shot and killed from outside his house in [[Pretoria]], South Africa's capital, while playing cards with his wife and grandchildren on 5 November 1994. While no suspects have ever been identified, it is widely believed the killing was the work of radical white supremacists unhappy with Heyns' increasingly liberal political views, which in addition to opposition to [[apartheid]] had also called for tolerance of homosexuals.
* [[Murder of Melanie Carpenter|Melanie Carpenter]] (23), Canadian woman who was abducted and murdered in [[Surrey, British Columbia]], on 6 January 1995. Carpenter was taken from her workplace and found dead in the Fraser Canyon several weeks later, and the prime suspect, Fernand Auger committed suicide before arrest.
* [[Deanna Cremin]] (17), teenage girl from [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], United States, was murdered on March 30, 1995. Her body was found behind a senior housing complex. An autopsy revealed she had been strangled. She was last seen alive by her boyfriend who, unlike on other occasions when he would walk her to the door, walked her only halfway and she continued on her own toward her house. Her murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Megan | last=Tench | title=A mother's renewed hope for justice | date=30 March 2005 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/03/30/a_mothers_renewed_hope_for_justice/ | work =Boston Globe | accessdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Nigg was a friend of [[Ronald Goldman]], with whom he had worked, and seemed to live quite well for someone in his position, leading to some reports that he was involved in drug trafficking, his death has been used to support theories that [[O. J. Simpson murder case|the murders of Goldman and O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole]] the year before were drug-related as well.
* Mitchell Bates, a sleeping-car attendant for [[Amtrak]], was killed when the ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' [[1995 Palo Verde, Arizona derailment|derailed]] on 9 October 1995, near [[Palo Verde, Arizona]]. Investigators later found notes from a group identified as the "Sons of the Gestapo", supposedly angry over the [[Waco siege]] earlier that year. The tracks were found to have been tampered with in a way that circumvented safety warning systems, suggesting a perpetrator with knowledge of rail operations. No suspects have ever been identified, however, although the FBI believes the real plan was to rob a passing freight and there were no terrorist motivations.
* Rapper Randy Walker, 27, better known as [[Stretch (rapper)|Stretch]], was shot and killed by the occupants of a vehicle passing his minivan in [[Queens Village]], New York, shortly after midnight on 30 November 1995. No suspects have ever been identified, but it is often believed to be somehow related to [[Tupac Shakur]]'s later death, since it took place exactly one year after [[Tupac Shakur#1994 Attack at Quad Recording Studios|an apparent robbery attempt]] in which Shakur had been seriously injured.

* On the morning of 13 August 1996 Indonesian journalist [[Murder of Udin|Udin]] was beaten to death at his home with a metal rod by two men who gained entry by claiming they wanted to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping; they then fled on that motorcycle. The investigation became a political issue with opponents of the [[Suharto]] regime claiming the dictator himself or other government officials were behind it as retaliation for his reporting on their misdeeds, while the government and police suggested it had been the work of a jealous husband. A suspect arrested on the latter theory was later acquitted, protesting his innocence as his trial revealed that he had been pressured to confess and other investigative shortcomings. The police have declined to investigate the case further, saying their responsibility was fulfilled when they arrested the original suspect.  
* Nigerian businesswoman [[Bisoye Tejuoso]] (80), daughter of a former [[Egba people|Egba]] tribal chief, was assassinated on September 19, 1996, during a dispute over the tribe's [[Oba (ruler)|obaship]]. The killers have never been identified.

Former French President [[Jacques Chirac]] was a friend of the couple and gave the case national attention. The main suspect, Ian Bailey, has been questioned twice by the Irish authorities in relation to the murder, but the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) decided not to prosecute. In early April 2010 the French authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Bailey. Later that month the Gardaí in Ireland arrested Ian Bailey and brought him in front of the High Court in Dublin to appeal his extradition.

* [[JonBenét Ramsey]] (6), American girl who had competed in child beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her parents' home in [[Boulder, Colorado]], on 26 December 1996, nearly eight hours after a ransom note was apparently found and she was reported missing. The coroner listed cause of death as "[[asphyxia]] due to strangulation, associated with" a broken skull and concussion. Police suspected the parents of staging the ransom note and strangulation to cover up an accidental killing by either the mother or nine-year-old brother.

* On 1 January 1998, the body of Australian 14-month-old [[Murder of Jaidyn Leskie|Jaidyn Leskie]] was found in a lake far from his home. He had been kidnapped the previous June. Greg Domaszczewicz, acquitted of the murder charge after a 1998 trial, was nevertheless found by a 2006 inquest to have had at least a contributing role in the crime, including the disposal of the body. However, current [[double jeopardy]] laws in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] do not allow the state to try him again, and the case is still officially unsolved.
* Australian organized-crime boss [[Alphonse Gangitano]] (40), the "Black Prince of [[Lygon Street]]", was found in his home dead from gunshot wounds shortly before midnight 16 January 1998, the first of the [[Melbourne gangland killings]]. [[Graham Kinniburgh]] and Jason Moran, both of whom were believed to have been in Gangitano's home that night, were suspected. They were both murdered later themselves. No arrests have been made.
* [[Murder of Stephanie Crowe|Stephanie Crowe]] (12), was found stabbed to death in her [[Escondido, California]] bedroom on the morning of January 21, 1998. Since there were no signs of forced entry, police focused on and eventually arrested her older brother Michael and two friends; however, charges against them were abruptly dismissed when later lab tests found several drops of Crowe's blood on a local transient. He was tried and convicted, but that was overturned on appeal and a 2013 retrial acquitted him.

Police suspected a former owner of the house who had also run a dye company that used the drum. He had reportedly been having an affair with Marroquin. The day after police interviewed him in Florida and told him they would get a court order to produce a DNA sample, he killed himself. DNA tests later showed he had fathered the fetus. Police consider him their main suspect, but as he is dead himself he cannot be charged and the case remains officially open.

While the [[Progressive Unionist Party]] later admitted that the UVF, its military wing, had carried out the killings in reprisal for an attack on it by members of Coulter's rival [[Ulster Defence Association]], no suspects have ever been named. It is believed the real target may have been [[Jackie Mahood|Mahood's brother, Jackie]], whom the killers may have mistaken him for; Coulter and Bobby Mahood were reportedly trying to broker an end to [[Loyalist feud#2000|Loyalist feud]] that claimed both their lives.

* Five people died as a result of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in autumn of that year; however, no one has ever been arrested in the case. Biowarfare researcher [[Bruce Edwards Ivins]] killed himself in 2008 just before he was supposedly to be charged; he was the FBI's prime suspect. Others, including some of the targets of the attacks, have disputed that conclusion or believed he may not have been acting alone.
* Kent Heitholt, 48, sports editor of Missouri's ''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]'', was found beaten and strangled in his car at the newspaper's parking lot early on 1 November 2001. [[Ryan W.

* The body of [[Chandra Levy]] (24), an [[internship|intern]] at the [[U.S. Bureau of Prisons]], was found in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Rock Creek Park]] on 22 May 2002, slightly over a year after she had been reported missing; her death was ruled a homicide although the medical examiner could not identify the exact means. Since investigations had revealed she and California congressman [[Gary Condit]] were having an affair, speculation at first had focused on him as a possible killer but police later cleared him; he was defeated for renomination in a [[primary election]] the next year with his behavior in the case cited as a contributing factor. In 2009, a [[El Salvador|Salvadorean]] [[illegal immigrant]], [[Ingmar Guandique]], was arrested and charged with the murder on the theory that he had bound Levy and left her to die there. His conviction at trial the next year was overturned on appeal in 2012 due to questions about tainted evidence from a jailhouse informant; a new trial at which the defense planned to introduce new evidence was ordered for 2015. Before it could take place, in July 2016, prosecutors dropped the charges against Guandique, saying they no longer believed they could prove their case, and instead began proceedings to have him [[deportation|deported]].

* South African businessman [[Brett Kebble]] (41), was fatally shot in his car on 27 September 2005 while driving along Johannesburg's [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] motorway to a dinner engagement. The bullets used were a special low-powered type normally used by bodyguards and security personnel to reduce the likelihood of injuries to people other than those targeted. Another South African businessman, [[Glenn Agliotti]], was charged with the crime a year later but acquitted in 2010 when the court hearing the case ruled that the state had not presented a case against him strong enough to require trial. No other suspects have ever been named.
* [[Mario Condello]] (53), a member of the Australian Mafia, was fatally shot in the driveway of his [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]] home on 6 February 2006, the day before he was to stand trial for plotting to murder another mob boss, [[Carl Williams (criminal)|Carl Williams]].&lt;ref name="Mario Condello"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silvester|first1=John|last2=Evans|first2=Chris|title=Condello gunned down in Brighton|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/condello-gunned-down/2006/02/06/1139074172355.html|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=7 February 2006|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Williams would later be convicted of in turn conspiring to have Condello murdered, and police believe the killer was a hit man currently in prison for another killing, the murder officially remains unsolved.
* [[Murder of Robert Eric Wone|Robert Wone]] (32), was murdered on 2 August 2006, in his friend's Washington, D.C., apartment. He was "restrained, incapacitated, and sexually assaulted" prior to his death. The only individuals present in the apartment at the time were its three residents, all friends of Wone. They have denied involvement and insisted that an intruder committed the crime. Authorities claim that there was no evidence of a break-in: the apartment appeared to be washed and cleaned, the three residents appeared freshly showered, and the evidence was not consistent with the residents' accounts. In addition, the residents tampered with the crime scene, waited an inordinate amount of time to call 911, and exhibited strange behavior when paramedics and police arrived. Authorities believe that either some or all of the three house-mates murdered Wone and engaged in a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/31/AR2009053102510.html|title= The Robert Wone Stabbing: Anatomy of a Murder Case Part 1 | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Duggan | date=1 June 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/01/AR2009060103472_5.html|title= The Robert Wone Stabbing: Anatomy of a Murder Case Part 2 | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Duggan | date=2 June 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially his death was thought to be from natural causes, and Hamas, in a public statement, attributed it to cancer, but later investigation showed that he had been injected with [[suxamethonium chloride]] to paralyze him and then suffocated with a pillow. The Dubai police circulated pictures of 20 guests and visitors believed to have been associated with the killing, whom they suggested were operatives of Israel's foreign intelligence service, the [[Mossad]]. Many had entered the [[United Arab Emirates]] on forged passports from other Western countries; the disclosures caused diplomatic tensions between those countries and Israel but did not lead to any public arrests or identifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGregor-Wood|first=Simon|title=Dubai Hit: Police Say They Know How Mahmoud al-Mabhouh Was Killed|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/dubai-hit-police-mahmoud-al-mabhouh-killed/story?id=9973592|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The badly decomposed body of former NBA player [[Lorenzen Wright]] (34), was found in woods near his [[Collierville, Tennessee]], home on 28 July 2010, ten days after he had last been seen, with several gunshot wounds.

It was determined that the three had been killed the previous evening. After [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] was killed by police following the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] a year and a half later, which his brother [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] was later convicted of perpetrating, it was disclosed that he had been suspected of involvement in the Waltham murders, due in part to his acquaintanceship with one of the victims.

* [[John Bodkin Adams]], a physician suspected of being a serial killer in England. One alleged victim, [[Gertrude Hullett]], was found to have committed suicide at the inquest in 1956, but Dr. Adams was indicted for her murder the following year. The case was then dropped by the prosecution via a [[nolle prosequi]], an action described by the judge as an "abuse of process".

==Other unsolved deaths==

===Before 1899===
* [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (100) 100 AD, a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosopher]] from the town of [[Tyana]] in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Cappadocia]] in [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/world/med/me-pruyn.htm|title="Apollonius of Tyana -- An Adept to Remember" by Fred A.

*[[Margaret Hanmer]] (49–50), 1420, was the wife of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fisher, ''Princesses of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have died, yet her death was never recorded and her body was never found.
* A mummified man found high in the Alps at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991, later named [[Ötzi]], is believed to have died in the 31st–32nd centuries B.C. For ten years after the discovery his death was attributed to [[hypothermia]]; however later X-rays found an arrowhead lodged in his shoulder, matching a small tear on his coat. The wound would likely have been fatal even today, but the body shows evidence of other blunt force trauma, including a blow to the head which most likely killed him. The blood of four other individuals was also found on his effects. Theories of his death now include murder, battle, or [[euthanasia|a mercy killing]] when his injuries proved untreatable. It has also been suggested that his body was moved there after his death, or after the injuries.
* [[Death of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great]] died in 323 B.C. after a short illness. Exactly what the illness was is a subject of debate; some{{Weasel inline|date=July 2018}} historians believe there is a possibility he was poisoned.
* King [[William II of England]], 1100, killed by an arrow while hunting; it may not have been an accident.
* [[Colorado]] rancher [[Gottlieb Fluhmann]] (55), was last seen alive in 1892. His disappearance was not resolved until his bones were found in a secluded [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]] cave in 1944; the cause of his death could not be determined.

===1900–1924===
* Death of [[Rudolf Diesel]], 1913, the place is unknown and many theories are given about Diesel's death. He disappeared in the [[English Channel]] and was found dead at sea ten days later.
* [[Silent film]] actress [[Virginia Rappe]] (26), was found to have died of [[peritonitis]] due to a [[Urinary bladder disease#ruptured bladder|ruptured bladder]] following her death on September 9, 1921. While this could have been the result of some of her ongoing health problems, such as [[cystitis]], or complications from a recent abortion (illegal at the time and thus very dangerous), Maude Delmont, an acquaintance, told San Francisco police that star film comedian [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] had sexually assaulted Rappe during a [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] party in his suite at the [[St. Francis Hotel]], another possible cause of the ruptured bladder. Arbuckle was charged with rape and [[involuntary manslaughter]]. Delmont did not testify against him at trial due to her criminal background; some prosecution witnesses admitted on the stand they had been pressured to change their testimony, and Arbuckle's defense also brought to light Rappe's health issues and history of promiscuity and alcohol consumption. After two hung juries, he was acquitted; however, his career was effectively ended by the negative publicity the case attracted. Whether Rappe's death was the result of nonconsensual sexual activity is still a matter of historical debate.

===1925–1949===
* [[Rudolf Steiner]], Austrian [[esotericist]] who developed [[anthroposophy]] and [[Waldorf education]], died from illness on 30 March 1925, but the nature of the illness was never confirmed and remains controversial, with theories suggesting [[cancer]] or [[poisoning]] as the most probable causes.
* [[Ottavio Bottecchia]], 1927, Italian cyclist, was found by the side of a road, covered with bruises and with a serious skull fracture. His bicycle was undamaged, propped against a nearby tree. He was taken to a hospital but died soon afterwards. An official inquiry concluded accidental death but many{{Who|date=June 2018}}{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}} suspected that he had run afoul of the powerful and growing fascist movement in [[Italy]] at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
*[[Cuban rumba]] dancer José Rosario Oviedo, known as [[Malanga (dancer)|Malanga]], died at the age of 42 in 1927. The exact circumstances under which he died have never been known for certain. One common account has it that he was murdered after a dance contest through broken glass hidden in his food, but no death certificate was ever filed and the location of his grave is unknown.
* [[Death of Starr Faithfull|Starr Faithfull]], 1931, a [[Greenwich Village]] [[flapper]], was found drowned on the beach at [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], [[Nassau County, New York]] on 8 June. Although Faithfull had left a suicide note, her family contended that she was murdered by wealthy politician [[Andrew James Peters]], former [[Mayor of Boston]], who had allegedly [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] Faithfull for years beginning when she was 11 years old and paid the Faithfulls to keep silent about it. Despite a lengthy investigation, it was never determined whether Faithfull's death was homicide, suicide, or accident.
* The body of [[Princeton University]] undergraduate [[Jay Ferdinand Towner]] (23), was found on campus shortly after a 11 November 1933, football game. He had suffered broken wrists and severe internal injuries. His death was variously attributed to a fall suffered in the stands during the game or a car accident amid conflicting accounts of his whereabouts prior to his death; its exact cause has never been determined.
* Early [[blues]] guitarist [[Robert Johnson]] (27), died on 16 August 1938, near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. The cause was not officially recorded. He was reportedly in extreme pain and suffering from [[convulsion]]s; this has led to theories he had been [[strychnine poisoning|poisoned with strychnine]] by a jealous husband; however, the alleged poisoning is said to have taken place several days earlier and most strychnine deaths take place within hours of ingestion. Another report claims he died of [[syphilis]] or [[pneumonia]]. The uncertain location of his gravesite has made it impossible to exhume his body for further investigation.
* King [[Ananda Mahidol]] of Thailand, 1946. Died of gunshot wounds; suicide, accident or assassination.
* [[Władysław Sikorski's death controversy|Władysław Sikorski]] (62), prime minister of the [[Polish Government in exile]], was among 16 people killed 4 July 1943 when [[1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash|their plane crashed into the sea]] shortly after taking off from a British base in [[Gibraltar]]. The plane had not managed to gain sufficient altitude due to its [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] being prevented from working properly; British investigators found the cause was most likely an accident while their Polish counterparts called it undetermined.&lt;ref name="Sikorski death conclusions"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Alfred Peszke|title=The Polish Underground Army, The Western Allies, And The Failure Of Strategic Unity in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhb2doihL1wC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=8 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786420094|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of Sikorski's daughter, chief of staff and other key aides purportedly on the plane were never found,&lt;ref name="Sikorski anomalies"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=71300 Baliszewski, Dawid, "Bransoletka Zofii" ("Zofia's Bracelet"), ''Tygodnik Wprost'', no. 1152 (December 31, 2004)] Retrieved on March 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the plane's only survivor, the pilot, had uncharacteristically worn his life preserver in the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polityka.pl/historia/280647,1,mitomani-i-maniacy.read |title=Mitomani i maniacy|language=Polish|publisher=Polityka.pl|date=October 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabotage and a possible assassination have been suspected, with the Nazis, Soviets, British or even rival factions in the Polish government in exile theorized to have been involved.

* The [[Trow Ghyll skeleton]], discovered in a cave in rural north [[Yorkshire]], England in 1947, remains unidentified. The death probably occurred in 1941; the fact that the body was discovered with a glass bottle of cyanide has led to speculation that it was someone connected with espionage.
* [[Jan Masaryk]], 1948, son of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]; Czech diplomat, politician and Foreign Minister of [[Czechoslovakia]], was found dead in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry below his bathroom window. The initial investigation concluded that he committed suicide by jumping out of the window, although many are convinced that he was pushed.
* [[Shimoyama incident|Sadanori Shimoyama]], 1948, first director of [[Japanese National Railways]], was last seen leaving his official car to go into a department store on his way to work the morning of July 5 of that year. Others reported seeing him at various train stations, and walking along one line, that afternoon. His dismembered body was found at noon the next day on the [[Jōban Line]]. It had indisputably gotten that way as a result of being struck by a train, but the autopsy suggested he had died before being struck. That conclusion has been disputed, and whether his death was a suicide or murder remains undetermined.

===1950–1974===
* Indian politician [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] (52), died in a prison hospital 23 June 1953 one and a half months after his arrest for attempting to enter [[Jammu and Kashmir]] without a permit. The exact cause of death has never been disclosed; Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], whose government Mukherjee had resigned from in protest over Nehru's decision to normalise relations with [[Pakistan]] despite that country's treatment of its Hindu population, said at the time he made inquiries and was satisfied that his former minister's death was due to natural causes; speculation has continued that Mukherjee was actually murdered due to some unusual circumstances of his arrest and treatment.
* The [[Dyatlov Pass incident]] was the death of nine hikers on the [[Kholat Syakhl]] mountain in the northern [[Ural Mountains]] range on 2 February 1959; all the bodies were not recovered until that May. While most of the victims were found to have died of [[hypothermia]] after apparently abandoning their tent high on an exposed mountainside, two had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing her tongue. After testing, the clothing of some of the victims was found to be highly radioactive. There were no witnesses or survivors to provide any testimony, and the cause of death was listed as a "compelling natural force", most likely an [[avalanche]], by Soviet investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/25093 |title=Mysterious Deaths of 9 Skiers Still Unresolved |author=Svetlana Osadchuk |date=February 19, 2008 |publisher=The St. Petersburg Times |issue=1349 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226101529/http://www.sptimes.ru/story/25093 |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bogle–Chandler case|Dr Gilbert Stanley Bogle, 39, and Margaret Olive Chandler, 29]], were found dead, both partially undressed, near the banks of the [[Lane Cove River]] in [[Sydney, Australia]], on 1 January 1963. Their bluish pallor and the presence of vomit and excrement led to a finding that they had been poisoned, but the coroner was unable to determine what the toxin was. It was suspected they had been murdered (possibly by Chandler's husband) although no suspect has ever been identified. [[Who Killed Dr Bogle and Mrs Chandler?|A 2006 TV documentary]] suggested their deaths were not due to foul play but the result of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas leaking from the river bed and reaching dangerously high concentrations in the low-lying depressions where their bodies were found.
* [[Lead Masks Case]] in [[Niterói]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], 1966.
* [[Oakland, California]], police officer [[Huey P. Newton#Fatal shooting of John Frey|John Frey]] was fatally shot on the morning of October 28, 1969, during a traffic stop where he had pulled over [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] leader [[Huey P. Newton]], who was wounded in the shootout and convicted of [[voluntary manslaughter]] the following year. The gun Newton purportedly used was never found, and following two hung juries after the conviction was [[People v. Newton|overturned on appeal]] in 1970 the district attorney's office announced it would not try him a fourth time. Newton suggested that Frey may have been shot by his partner; there has been no new investigation to determine whether this was the case and whether this was an accident.
* [[Death of Joan Robinson Hill|Joan Robinson Hill]], 1969, Texas socialite. At first ruled to have died of [[influenza]] following a brief hospitalization on March 19, suspicions were aroused when her body was released to the funeral home and embalmed before a legally required autopsy could be carried out. Despite the compromised evidence, three autopsies, all with their own irregularities, were performed and her husband John eventually became the only person indicted by a Texas grand jury for murder by omission, or failing to take proper action in the face of a life-threatening situation. The first attempt to prosecute him ended in a mistrial in 1972; he was murdered before he could be retried and the gunman who was suspected of his murder died in a police shootout. Two other alleged accomplices were later convicted.
*The [[:de:Brandanschlag auf das Altenheim der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde in München|arson attack on the retirement home of the Jewish Community of Munich]] on February 13, 1970 killed seven Jewish residents, among them two [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] survivors. Several indications and assumptions of the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Federal Prosecutor]] that a [[Left-wing terrorism|left-wing radical group]] committed the act could not be proven, leaving the attack unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/kriminalitaet/id_84072686/ungeklaerte-kriminalfaelle-wer-veruebte-den-anschlag-auf-die-juedische-gemeinde-muenchen-.html|title=Wer verübte den Anschlag auf die Jüdische Gemeinde in München?|work=www.t-online.de|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ronald Hughes]] was an American attorney who disappeared while on a camping trip in November 1970. His body was found in March 1971, but his cause of death could not be determined.
* [[Isdal Woman]], a partially charred unidentified corpse found on 29 November 1970, hidden off a [[hiking]] trail near [[Bergen, Norway]].The official conclusion that her death was a [[suicide]] has not been widely accepted, since some believed she was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tønder|first=Finn Bjørn|title=Viktig nyhet om Isdalskvinnen|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Viktig-nyhet-om-Isdalskvinnen-2405382.html|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Bergens tidende|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her identity remains unknown and is considered one of Norway's most profound mysteries, the case has been the subject of intense speculation for many years.&lt;ref name=BT&gt;{{cite news|last=Tønder|first=Finn Bjørn|title=Viktig nyhet om Isdalskvinnen |trans-title=Important news about Isdal Woman |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Viktig-nyhet-om-Isdalskvinnen-2405382.html |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Bergens Tidende|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple investigations point to the possibility that she was a [[Espionage|spy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39369429|title=The mystery death haunting Norway for 46 years|last=Cheung|first=Helier|date=2017-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], who had during the 1950s published the smuggled manuscript of [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' but later became a left-wing militant during Italy's [[Years of Lead]], was found dead at the base of a power-line transmission tower outside [[Segrate]], near his native [[Milan]], on 15 March 1972. It was believed that he had died when a bomb he was attempting to plant on the tower went off, and later testimony by other members of the [[Red Brigades]] supported this. However, the death was always viewed suspiciously, and in the 2010s forensic reports surfaced that suggested he had been tied to the tower before the bomb went off, with various intelligence agencies insides and outside of Italy suspected of responsibility.
* Nuclear power whistleblower [[Karen Silkwood]] died in a car accident on 13 November 1974, while driving to a meeting with a ''New York Times'' reporter in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]. Whether that accident involved another vehicle, which may even have deliberately run her off the road, or resulted from her own fatigue remains a matter of debate.

===1975–1999===
* [[Marcia Moore]] (50), a writer on [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] and [[astrology]], disappeared near her home in the [[Seattle, Washington]], area during winter 1979. Her skeletal remains were found in nearby woods in 1981. It has been presumed in the absence of any evidence that would more conclusively establish a cause of death, that she died of [[hypothermia]] while wandering the woods under the influence of [[ketamine]], a drug whose use she had promoted. However, true-crime writer [[Anne Rule]], a friend, says what appeared to be a bullet hole was found in her jawbone, although authorities said it could just as easily have been a result of the bone decaying during the cold winters. Officially the cause of Moore's death remains undetermined.
* On November 29 1981, actress [[Natalie Wood]] (43), who had been boating with her husband [[Robert Wagner]] and fellow actor [[Christopher Walken]], was found drowned near [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]], California. While that has always been accepted as the direct cause of her death, the circumstances under which she went into the water have never been clear, and after reopening the investigation in 2012 the coroner changed the cause of death from "accident" to "undetermined", based on cuts and bruises on her body that may or may not have been suffered before her death.&lt;ref name="Natalie Wood"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goffard|first1=Christopher|last2=Mather|first2=Kate|last3=Winton|first3=Richard|title=L.A.

* [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], 1982, president of [[Chile]] from 1964 to 1970. {{as of|2005}}, his death is being investigated because of allegations that he was poisoned.
* On 7 March 1983, [[East Germany|East German]] [[Association football|football]] player [[Lutz Eigendorf]] died after being involved in a suspicious car accident two days earlier in [[Braunschweig]]. The circumstances of his death remain controversial as there is speculation that he was assassinated by the [[Stasi]]. Apparently, a large truck had blinded him by turning on its main headlights just as Eigendorf was approaching a curve, causing him to crash his car into a tree. Eigendorf had [[Republikflucht|fled]] to [[West Germany]] by escaping from the rest of the team of his then club [[Berliner FC Dynamo|BFC Dynamo]] in West Germany in 1979 and started playing for [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] before joining [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] in 1982. After the [[German reunification]], the [[public prosecutor's office]] in [[Berlin]] started an investigation into the possible murder of Lutz Eigendorf, but in 2004, the case was closed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/die-politische-brisanz-falsch-eingeschaetzt.1346.de.html?dram:article_id=239224|title=- Die politische Brisanz falsch eingeschätzt|work=Deutschlandfunk|access-date=2018-10-13|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2010, a former East German spy revealed that the Stasi had ordered him to kill Eigendorf, which he claimed not to have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/ich-hatte-den-mordauftrag-von-der-stasi-11413998.bild.html|title=Der Fall Lutz Eigendorf: Ich hatte den Mordauftrag von der Stasi|work=bild.de|access-date=2018-05-24|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the public prosecutor's office refused to reopen the case because it did not see any evidence of any third party involvement, leaving the case unsolved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The cause of death of the baby born to Joanne Hayes in Ireland's 1984 [[Kerry Babies case]] was never established. 
* On 11 October 1987, German politician [[Uwe Barschel]] ([[CDU/CSU|CDU]]) was found dead in a bathtub filled with water in his room at the Hotel [[Beau-Rivage Geneva|Beau-Rivage]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. He was fully clothed. Among others, the drug [[Lorazepam]] was found in his system. Until today, the cause of his death remains undetermined and controversial, with both suicide and murder considered possible explanations and the case still being investigated in both directions.
* Whether [[Death and state funeral of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|the 17 August 1988 plane crash that killed]] Pakistani president [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], 64, the country's longest-serving leader, and 30 others including the country's top military leaders and the U.S. ambassador, was an accident or deliberate, the result of sabotage or a shootdown, is a matter of debate. American investigators came to the former conclusion, while their Pakistani counterparts produced a report reaching the latter. Theories as to responsibility if it were an act of malice have put the blame on a number of domestic and foreign actors.
* [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] former president of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], died in 1993 from circumstances that remain very unclear. It is known that he died in the village of Khibula in the [[Samegrelo]] region of western Georgia.
* On 1 May 1994, [[Brazil]]ian three times [[Formula One]] champion [[Ayrton Senna]] [[Death of Ayrton Senna|died]] by crashing into a concrete barrier during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]], but the exact circumstances of his death as to why and how it happened were never fully established and remain controversial, with theories suggesting either technical failure due to a broken steering column, low tyre pressure or material fatigue, construction defects in his car or a driver error. It is also unproven if he died on impact or later in hospital.
* Screenwriter [[Gary DeVore]] (55), left [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], on 28 June 1997, for Hollywood to drop off his final draft of the script for a remake of ''[[The Big Steal]]'', a 1949 film about, in part, a man who stages his own disappearance. He never arrived, and was considered missing for a year until his body was found in his car in the [[California Aqueduct]]. Its hands were missing, and it did not appear from the position in which it was found that the car had gone into the waterway after an accident. No cause of death has been conclusively established.
* [[Godard family disappearance|Yves Godard]] was a French doctor who disappeared from a sailing boat with his two children in 1999. Several years later{{When|date=July 2018}}, bones belonging to Dr Godard and his daughter were discovered in the [[English Channel]]. No trace of his son or his wife (the latter did not go on the sailing trip) has ever been found, nor has any trace of the boat. Prosecutors believe Dr Godard probably murdered his family before committing [[suicide]] at sea, but they also acknowledge that they are not certain of this.

===2000–2010===
* [[Rodney Marks]] (32), an Australian [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], died of a sudden illness on 12 May 2000 at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] in [[Antarctica]]. It was not possible for his body to be flown to [[New Zealand]] and autopsied until after the Antarctic winter ended six months later; the cause of death was found to have been [[methanol]] poisoning. Suicide was ruled out as he did not seem to have a motive and had readily sought treatment for his apparent illness, nor did an accidental overdose seem likely either as there was plenty of alcoholic drink available for consumption at the base should he have wanted it. The New Zealand police believed instead that the methanol had been "unknowingly" introduced into Marks' system, but could not conclusively call the case a homicide. Further investigation has been frustrated by the refusal of American agencies to share their findings, the global dispersal of researchers and personnel at the base that winter, the 2006 disappearance of the doctor who treated Marks, and the loss of any possible crime-scene evidence during the winter after Marks' death.
* On 11 August 2001, British musician [[Paul Cunniffe]] (40), formerly of the bands [[Blaze X]] and the [[Saw Doctors]], died in a fall in the London neighborhood of [[Whitechapel]]. The circumstances that led to the fall, or even exactly where it occurred, however, remain unknown. His is one of several deaths among friends and acquaintances of [[Pete Doherty]].&lt;ref name="Paul Cunniffe"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/31/pete-doherty-blanco-whitehead | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Pete Doherty: the gifted artists who pay a fatal price after entering his orbit | first=Jamie | last=Doward | date=January 31, 2010 | accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Abu Nidal]] (65), Palestinian terrorist leader behind the 1985 [[Rome and Vienna airport attacks]], already suffering from [[leukemia]], was reported to have died from a gunshot wound in [[Baghdad]] on 16 August 2002. Iraq's government at the time claimed his death was a suicide;&lt;ref name="Fisk Abu Nidal death"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisk|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fisk|title=Abu Nidal, notorious Palestinian mercenary, 'was a US spy' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/abu-nidal-notorious-palestinian-mercenary-was-a-us-spy-972812.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=25 October 2008|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Palestinians believe he was assassinated on [[Saddam Hussein]]'s orders to prevent his possible capture during the [[Invasion of Iraq|American invasion of Iraq]] that began six months later.&lt;ref name="Guardian Abu Nidal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Whitaker|title=Mystery of Abu Nidal's death deepens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/22/iraq.israel|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 August 2002|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Death of Jeremiah Duggan|Jeremiah Duggan]] (23), a British student studying in Paris, was found dead on a highway in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, early on 27 March 2003. The initial investigation concluded he had committed suicide by running into traffic. However, his mother, noting that he had called her in great distress over his involvement with the [[LaRouche movement]], who may have discovered that he was British and Jewish, within an hour of his death, never accepted that theory, and a later investigation found evidence that the accident may have been staged to cover an earlier beating. The case was reopened in 2012 after extensive litigation in England, resulting in a change of the cause of death to "unexplained", with the note that Duggan may have been involved in some sort of "altercation" beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Merry. [http://justiceforjeremiah.yolasite.com/coroner-verdict-2015.php "Coroner rejects suicide at inquest into British student found dead in Germany"], press release, Leigh Day, 22 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jürgen Möllemann]] (57), German politician ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]), died on 5 June 2003 in a [[parachuting]] incident at [[Marl, Germany|Marl-Lohmühle]]. His death was investigated by the Essen district attorney's office, which published a final report on 9 July 2003. While outside interference was ruled out, no definite verdict was reached on whether Möllemann committed [[suicide]] or had an accident. Shortly before his death, Möllemann, a passionate and experienced skydiver, had been confronted with allegations he had been involved in illegal arms deals and evaded taxes on millions of euros he allegedly earned from those activities. To enable a full investigation on these charges, the [[Bundestag]] lifted his [[parliamentary immunity]] on 5 June 2003 at 12:28, 22 minutes before his death. The tax evasion charges were dropped after his death.
* Singer-songwriter [[Elliott Smith]] (34), died of stab wounds inflicted in his [[Echo Park, California]], home on October 21, 2003. His girlfriend claims she got out of the shower after an argument, having heard him scream, to find him with the knife sticking out of his chest, and found a short suicide note on a [[Post-It]] shortly thereafter. While he did indeed have a history of depression and addiction, friends say he was actively working to finish an album at the time and seemed optimistic. The coroner found the stab wounds were inconsistent with a suicide attempt but could not say it was a homicide either; the cause of the stabbing remains undetermined and has not been further investigated.&lt;ref name="Elliott Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/rockers-autopsy-doesnt-rule-out-homicide |title=Rocker's Autopsy Doesn't Rule Out Homicide |date=January 8, 2004 |website=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jonathan Luna]] (38), an assistant U.S. attorney from Baltimore, was found dead of multiple stab wounds inflicted with his own penknife in [[Denver, Pennsylvania]], on the morning of December 4, 2003, in a stream underneath his car, which had been driven there overnight from Baltimore. The FBI, which has jurisdiction over the possible murder of any U.S. federal employee, found that Luna had mounting financial problems and was facing an investigation over missing money at his office, considered it a suicide or botched attempt at staging a kidnapping. However, the [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] coroner's office, pointing to evidence suggesting he had been abducted and someone else was driving for at least the final stage of his drive, ruled it a homicide and considers the case open.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Luna"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitt|first=Bill|title=Who Killed Jonathan Luna?|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149007,00.html|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=December 22, 2003|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The coroner investigating the death of [[Richard Lancelyn Green]], 51, a British [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] scholar who was found [[garrotte]]d with a shoelace on his bed in his home on 27 April 2004, returned an open verdict. Many of his friends and family suspected homicide as he had complained of someone following him in his efforts to stop the auction of a cache of Doyle's personal papers that he believed to have been wrongfully acquired. However, despite suicide by garrotte being unusual and difficult, some investigators believed that he had followed the example of one of Doyle's [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories in which a woman stages her suicide to look like a murder.
* On October 4, 2006, the skeletonized remains of [[Murder of Frauke Liebs|Frauke Liebs]] (21), a student nurse, were found off a road near [[Lichtenau, Westphalia|Lichtenau]], Germany. She had last been seen leaving a bar on 20 June, and called her roommate several times in the days afterwards indicating she would come home but was being vague about when or how. Police now believe she was being held against her will and might have been murdered, although the body was too decomposed to establish a cause of death.
* Three years after the body of 44-year-old [[Death of Corryn Rayney|Corryn Rayney]] was found in the [[Perth, Australia|Perth]] suburb of [[Kings Park, Western Australia]] a week after her 7 August 2007 disappearance, her husband Lloyd was charged in her murder even though a cause of death had not been determined. A judge acquitted him at his 2012 trial, finding the largely circumstantial case was further compromised by police misconduct. The verdict was upheld on appeal the following year; Rayney and his lawyers have called for two known sex criminals to be investigated as well.
* [[Pearl Lady|Barbara Precht]]'s body was found on 29 November 2006 in Cincinnati, Ohio. She remained unidentified until November 2014. Her husband was located later on and is considered a person of interest in her death, which has unknown circumstances.&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alter |first1=Maxim |title=Mystery of 'Pearl Lady:' Arrest of dead woman's husband leads to break in bizarre case |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/crime/barbara-hess-james-precht-pearl-lady-mystery-arrest-of-dead-womans-husband-leads-to-break-in-case |accessdate=19 November 2014 |agency=WCPO Cincinnati |publisher=CBS |date=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117021543/http://www.wcpo.com/news/crime/barbara-hess-james-precht-pearl-lady-mystery-arrest-of-dead-womans-husband-leads-to-break-in-case |archivedate=17 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Joyce Carol Vincent]] (38), was found dead in her London flat in January 2006, two years after she had died, by which time the body had decomposed so much as to make identifying a cause of death impossible; her story was profiled in the 2011 documentary ''Dreams of a Life''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/09/joyce-vincent-death-mystery-documentary Joyce Carol Vincent: How could this young woman lie dead and undiscovered for almost three years?] Carol Morley, [[The Guardian]], Sunday 9 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two-year-old [[Death of Caylee Anthony|Caylee Anthony]], of [[Orlando, Florida]], was reported missing by her grandmother in the summer of 2008, when she learned that her daughter Casey had not seen her in over a month. Casey claimed the girl had been kidnapped by a nanny and [[circumstantial evidence]] led to her arrest on murder charges that fall. A tip that could have led to the body's discovery in August was not fully acted upon until December; by then the body was so decomposed that it was impossible to establish how Caylee had died, although the coroner ruled it homicide. Casey Anthony, despite public sentiment strongly against her, was acquitted of the murder and child-abuse charges (but convicted of the lesser charges of lying to the police) after a heavily covered trial in 2011, where her lawyer claimed that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family pool and Casey's domineering father had led a cover-up. Later, her father came forward with his own explanation: Casey had allegedly been known to drug Caylee to entice her to sleep so Casey could leave Caylee home alone and go out with friends for the evening. He alleges Casey or a friend accidentally overdosed Caylee, killing her, and in a panic, made up the kidnapping story as a cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-caseyanthony/casey-anthony-dad-says-caylee-died-of-drug-overdose-idUSTRE78E02G20110915|title=Casey Anthony dad says Caylee died of drug overdose|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 18 March 2007, [[Bob Woolmer]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]]'s national [[cricket]] coach, was found dead in his hotel room after losing in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Investigators at first ruled the death a suicide, but the jury that heard the inquest was not so sure and returned an open verdict.
* On 3 September 2008, [[:de:Jenny Böken|Jenny Böken]], an 18-year-old female [[German Navy]] officer candidate, went overboard from the German Navy schooling ship [[Gorch Fock (1958)|Gorch Fock]] and fell into the [[North Sea]] north of [[Norderney]]. Her body was discovered 11 days later near [[Heligoland]]. The circumstances of her death were never fully determined and remain controversial, with accidental death, murder or suicide all considered possible explanations. It was known that she had health restrictions, but it could not be determined whether they contributed to her death. The autopsy found no water in her lungs, suggesting that the cause of death was not drowning. In September 2018, a new witness suggested that she was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/kriminalitaet/id_84442316/fall-jenny-boeken-wurde-die-gorch-fock-kadettin-ermordet-.html|title=Wurde die "Gorch Fock"-Kadettin ermordet?|work=www.t-online.de|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
* Skeletal remains found in a dry creek bed in California's [[Malibu Canyon]] on 9 August 2010, turned out to be those of [[Death of Mitrice Richardson|Mitrice Richardson]], 25. She had last been seen on the night of 16 September 2009 in the backyard of a former local television news anchor, after being arrested for marijuana possession and failure to pay the bill at a local restaurant where she had been acting strangely, behavior that investigating officers did not believe was caused by alcohol or drugs. The coroner has said her death did not appear to be a homicide, but the body was too decayed to determine the exact cause of death.&lt;ref name="Mitrice Richardson"&gt;{{cite news| author = Duke, Alan | title =Remains Found in Malibu Canyon Identified as Mitrice Richardson| publisher =[[CNN]]| date = August 13, 2010| url =http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/08/12/california.remains.found/| accessdate =June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 23 August 2010, the partially decomposed body of [[Death of Gareth Williams|Gareth Williams]] (32), a Welsh mathematician who worked for British intelligence GCHQ, but who was seconded to MI6 at the time of his death, was found in a padlocked bag in the bathroom of a [[safe house]] in the London neighbourhood of [[Pimlico]]. It was determined he had been dead for about a week. Due to the nature of his work, the investigation had to withhold details of it and some other aspects from any material made public; his family and friends allege that the [[Metropolitan Police]] compromised and mishandled key forensic evidence in the early stages of their response. An initial investigation by the coroner's office concluded that the death was a homicide; a later re-investigation by the police claimed that it was instead an accident.
* British citizen [[Lee Bradley Brown]] (39), was arrested by [[Dubai Police Force|Dubai police]] while on holiday there 6 April 2011 and charged with assault after an incident between him and a hotel maid; accounts of the circumstances differ. Held without bail, he died in custody six days later after, police claimed, being beaten by cellmates; later they said he had "thrown himself on the ground repeatedly." An autopsy, however, found instead that Brown had, under the influence of [[hashish]], choked on his own vomit. British officials who were allowed to examine the body disputed that conclusion, saying they saw no evidence of choking or [[blunt force trauma]]; Dubai authorities have declined repeated requests to share evidence such as CCTV footage from the original incident and the police station that might clarify matters. A coroner's inquest in the UK that considered only the autopsy report and the diplomats' reports returned an open verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fresh doubts over Briton Lee Bradley Brown's death in Dubai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/fresh-doubts-over-briton-lee-bradley-browns-death-in-dubai-8595547.htmll=[[The Independent]]|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exiled [[Russian oligarch]] [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] (67), was found dead in his home near [[Ascot, Berkshire]] on 23 March 2013. At first glance he had hanged himself; he had recently lost what remained of his fortune, and some other close friends had unexpectedly died, which had left him despondent. The police soon ruled the case a suicide, but at the inquest, Berezovsky's daughter, who believes her father was murdered at the behest of the [[Russian government]], introduced a report by a German pathologist that cast enough doubt for the coroner to return an open verdict.&lt;ref name="Boris Berezovsky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duffin|first=Claire|title=Billionaire critic of Putin may have been murdered, rules coroner|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10728908/Billionaire-critic-of-Putin-may-have-been-murdered-rules-coroner.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 15–16, 2013, skeletal remains of two adults and child were found in a field outside [[Red Oak, Oklahoma]]. A year later they were identified as the [[Jamison family deaths|Jamison family]], who had gone missing in 2009 while looking into some land they wanted to purchase. Their abandoned pickup truck was three miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) from where their bodies were found. No cause of death has been determined.
* The decomposing remains of Canadian journalist [[Death of Dave Walker|Dave Walker]] (57), were found in [[Cambodia]]'s [[Angkor]] temple complex on May 1, 2014, ending a search that began shortly after he failed to return to his hotel's guest house on the night of 14 February. While the medical examiner concluded that he had died weeks earlier, the cause of Walker's death could not be determined.
* Bone fragments found along the Rio Culebra near [[Boquete]], [[Panama]], in late June 2014 were matched to [[Deaths of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon|Lisanne Froon, 21, and Kristin Kremers, 22]], of [[Amersfoort]], the Netherlands. The two had last been seen alive on 1 April when they went for a hike on the popular Pianista trail. The women's cell phones, recovered along with their remains, showed that they had repeatedly attempted to contact emergency numbers shortly after taking pictures of themselves at the [[Continental Divide]]. Those calls had continued over several days, and the phones also contained almost a hundred photographs taken during the next 10 days, most of which were completely dark but some of which showed plants and rock formations in closeup. It was impossible to determine from the remains that were found how exactly they had died. Local officials believe the girls suffered an accidental injury shortly after getting lost in a network of trails in the region's [[cloud forest]]s and got lost in the wilderness around [[Volcán Barú]]; however, Panamanian lawyers for their families have pointed to failings of the investigation and suggested that foul play might have been responsible.&lt;ref name="Froon and Kremers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/21/the-lost-girls-of-panama-the-full-story.html|title=The Lost Girls of Panama: The Full Story|date=21 August 2016|publisher=The Daily Beast|first=Jeremy|last=Kryt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 27 June 2014, the body of 20-year-old [[Death of Andrew Sadek|Andrew Sadek]] was recovered from the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] near [[Breckenridge, Minnesota]], with a small-caliber gunshot wound and a backpack full of rocks. He had last been seen by a security camera leaving his dorm at [[North Dakota State College of Science]] in [[Wahpeton, North Dakota|Wahpeton]] around 2 a.m. on 1 May. At the time of his disappearance he had been working as a [[confidential informant]] for local police as a result of his own arrest for selling marijuana on campus, which could otherwise have resulted in a long prison sentence. It has not been determined yet whether his death was suicide or murder. Like [[Rachel Hoffman]]'s death, the case has been used as an example of the mishandling of youthful CIs by police.&lt;ref name="High Times story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simunek|first=Chris|title=Andrew Sadek: A Life Lost Over 4.5 Grams|url=http://hightimes.com/read/andrew-sadek-life-lost-over-45-grams|work=[[High Times]]|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418102336/http://hightimes.com/read/andrew-sadek-life-lost-over-45-grams|archivedate=April 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deaths of John and Joyce Sheridan|John Sheridan]] (72), formerly [[New Jersey Department of Transportation#NJDOT Commissioners|New Jersey's Transportation Commissioner]], was found dead in his [[Skillman, New Jersey|Skillman]] home along with his wife Joyce on the morning of September 28, 2014. The bodies were in an upstairs bedroom where a fire had been set; they were found with multiple stab wounds. An original ruling of [[murder-suicide]] was changed to undetermined in 2017 after a court challenge by the couple's sons, motivated by complaints of mishandled evidence and some evidence suggesting the couple had been attacked by an intruder. The sons are currently calling for the investigation to be reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=S.P.|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Dave|title=State medical examiner reverses suicide ruling in John Sheridan case|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/01/state_medical_examiner_changes_death_ruling_for.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=January 13, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Death of Alberto Nisman|Alberto Nisman]] (51), an Argentine federal prosecutor, was found dead in his apartment of a single gunshot wound to the head on 18 January 2015. He had been investigating the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]], Argentina's deadliest terror attack, and had publicly accused President [[Cristina Kirchner]] and other high officials close to her of covering up for suspects in the case for foreign-policy reasons; he was scheduled to present these allegations to Congress the next day. While some of the circumstances of his death are consistent with an early statement that he committed suicide, friends and relatives say that he was eagerly looking ahead to his appearance before Congress and did not seem depressed or despondent at all. Kirchner has suggested the country's intelligence services were behind the killing, since he was about to expose their attempts to bring her down, and called for them to be dismantled. The case remains under investigation.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Nisman story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Adam|title=The Extremely Suspicious Death of Victim #86|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 April 2015, the body of [[Death of Ambrose Ball|Ambrose Ball]] (30), of London, was recovered from the [[River Lea]] in [[Tottenham]]. He had last been seen leaving his vehicle following a single-car accident early on the morning of 24 January after visiting a local pub with friends. The body was too decomposed to determine a cause of death; police requested an adjournment of the inquest in order to further investigate, implying a murder charge was in the works. No charges were ever filed, and threats were later made against Ball's friends and family after they set up a [[Facebook]] page appealing for help from the public and questioning the conduct of the investigation.

==Date of death disputed==
* [[Raoul Wallenberg]], a Swedish humanitarian who worked in Budapest, Hungary, was most likely executed in Russia in or around 1947 after being captured by the Red Army in 1945. His death is dated by Soviet authorities as 16 July 1947, but this is disputed, and the case remains unsolved.
* In 1948, a German court ruled that [[Hans Kammler]] (43), an engineer and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander who oversaw many Nazi construction projects including concentration camps and, later, the [[V-2]] missile program, died on 9 May 1945 of what was later claimed to be suicide by cyanide poisoning. Some other accounts, however, have him being killed by his own side to prevent his capture during an attack by Czech resistance fighters; others suggest those accounts of his death were put out to cover his surrender to American forces, in whose custody he supposedly hanged himself two years later.

{{homicide}}
{{Criminal law}}

'''Manslaughter''' is a [[common law]] legal term for [[homicide]] considered by law as less [[Culpability|culpable]] than [[murder]]. The distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said to have first been made by the ancient Athenian lawmaker [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrenberg |first=Victor |authorlink=Victor Ehrenberg (historian) |title=From Solon to Socrates: Greek History and Civilization During the 6th and 5th Centuries BC |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V2hAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=31 December 2015 |edition=Second |year=1973 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-04024-2 |page=57 |orig-year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of manslaughter differs among legal [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]].

==General==

===Voluntary manslaughter===
{{main article|Voluntary manslaughter}}
In voluntary manslaughter, the offender had no prior intent to kill and acted "in the moment" under circumstances that could cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed. Examples could include a defender killing a home invader without being placed in a life or death situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Jack K.|title=Some Provoking Aspects of Voluntary Manslaughter Law|journal=Anglo-American Law Review|date=1 July 1981|volume=10|page=159|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/147377958101000302?journalCode=clwa|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are mitigating circumstances that reduce culpability, such as when the defendant kills only with an intent to cause serious bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=Textbook on Criminal Law|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, U.K.|isbn=9780199669295|edition=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaScAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary manslaughter in some jurisdictions is a [[lesser included offense]] of murder. The traditional mitigating factor was [[provocation (legal)|provocation]]; however, others have been added in various jurisdictions.

The most common type of voluntary manslaughter occurs when a defendant is provoked to commit homicide. This is sometimes described as a [[crime of passion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dressler|first1=Joshua|title=Rethinking heat of passion: A defense in search of a rationale|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|date=Summer 1982|volume=73|issue=2|page=421|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6302&amp;context=jclc|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911024403/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6302&amp;context=jclc|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the provocation must induce rage or anger in the defendant, although some cases have held that fright, terror, or desperation will suffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barkan|first1=Steven E.|last2=Bryjak|first2=George J.|title=Myths and Realities of Crime and Justice: What Every American Should Know|date=2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Massachusetts|isbn=9780763755744|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNIWv8-WfAEC|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assisted suicide====
{{Main article|Assisted suicide}}
Assisted suicide is suicide committed with the aid of another person, sometimes a physician.

In some places, including parts of the United States,&lt;ref name="prcas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patients Rights Council|url=http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/|website=Assisted Suicide Laws in the United States|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=6 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025119/http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[assisted suicide]] is punishable as manslaughter. 
In other countries such as Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarchet|first1=Penny|title=Tourism to Switzerland for assisted suicide is growing, often for nonfatal diseases|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/tourism-to-switzerland-for-assisted-suicide-is-growing-often-for-nonfatal-diseases/2014/09/22/3b9de644-2a14-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=22 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911031138/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/tourism-to-switzerland-for-assisted-suicide-is-growing-often-for-nonfatal-diseases/2014/09/22/3b9de644-2a14-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted Suicide|url=http://eol.law.dal.ca/?page_id=236|website=End of Life Law &amp; Policy in Canada|publisher=Health Law Institute, Dalhousie University|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911024543/http://eol.law.dal.ca/?page_id=236|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some U.S. states,&lt;ref name="prcas"/&gt; as long as legal safeguards are observed, assisted suicide is legal.

===Involuntary manslaughter===
''Involuntary manslaughter'' is the homicide of a human being without intent of doing so, either expressed or implied. It is distinguished from voluntary manslaughter by the absence of intention. It is normally divided into two categories, constructive manslaughter and criminally negligent manslaughter, both of which involve criminal liability.

====Constructive manslaughter====
Constructive manslaughter is also referred to as "unlawful act" manslaughter. It is based on the doctrine of constructive malice, whereby the malicious intent inherent in the commission of a crime is considered to apply to the consequences of that crime. It occurs when someone kills, without intent, in the course of committing an unlawful act. The malice involved in the crime is transferred to the killing, resulting in a charge of manslaughter.

For example, a person who fails to stop at a red traffic light while driving a vehicle and hits someone crossing the street could be found to intend or be reckless as to assault or criminal damage (see ''DPP v Newbury''&lt;ref&gt;[1977] AC 500&lt;/ref&gt;). There is no intent to kill, and a resulting death would not be considered murder, but would be considered involuntary manslaughter. The accused's responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act. Reckless driving or reckless handling of a potentially lethal weapon may result in a death that is deemed manslaughter.

Involuntary manslaughter may be distinguished from accidental death. A person who is driving carefully, but whose car nevertheless hits a child darting out into the street, has not committed manslaughter. A person who pushes off an aggressive drunk, who then falls and dies, has probably not committed manslaughter, although in some jurisdictions it may depend whether "excessive force" was used or other factors.

As manslaughter is not defined by legislation in Australia, common law decisions provide the basis for determining whether an act resulting in death amounts to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.&lt;ref name="Lane v R"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|317|2013|litigants=Lane v R |pinpoint=[46] |courtname=auto |date-}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To be found guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, the accused must be shown to have committed an unlawful act which is contrary to the criminal law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 per Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ at [2] |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known that by their act, they were exposing the victim to an ‘appreciable risk of serious injury’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 per Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at [48] |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminally negligent manslaughter====
Criminally negligent manslaughter is variously referred to as [[criminally negligent]] homicide in the [[United States]], and [[gross negligence]] manslaughter in [[England and Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations]] jurisdictions the offence of [[culpable homicide]] might apply.

It occurs where death results from serious [[criminal negligence|negligence]], or, in some jurisdictions, serious [[Recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. A high degree of negligence is required to warrant criminal liability.&lt;ref name="R v Lavender"/&gt; A related concept is that of [[willful blindness]], which is where a defendant intentionally puts themself in a position where the defendant will be unaware of facts which would render them liable.

Criminally negligent manslaughter occurs where there is an omission to act when there is a duty to do so, or a failure to perform a duty owed, which leads to a death. The existence of the duty is essential because the law does not impose criminal liability for a failure to act unless a specific duty is owed to the victim. It is most common in the case of professionals who are grossly negligent in the course of their employment. An example is where a doctor fails to notice a patient's oxygen supply has disconnected and the patient dies (''R v Adomako'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=UKHL |year=1994 |num=6 |litigants=R v Adomako |parallelcite=[1994] 3 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 288 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be leaving a child locked in a car on a hot day.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====Vehicular or intoxication manslaughter====
In some jurisdictions, such as some U.S. States,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec. 125.13. Vehicular manslaughter in the first degree.|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.13|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025304/https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.13|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=California Penal Code, Sec. 192(c)|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=192.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California Legislature|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912005131/https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=192.|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=Wisconsin Statutes, Sec. 940.09.

An equivalent in Canada is [[Criminal negligence#Canada|causing death by criminal negligence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c.

==Regional differences==

The definition of manslaughter differs from one [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] to another.

The law generally differentiates between levels of criminal culpability based on the ''[[mens rea]]'', or state of mind, or the circumstances under which the killing occurred ([[mitigating factor]]s). Manslaughter is usually broken down into two distinct categories: ''[[#Voluntary manslaughter|voluntary manslaughter]]'' and ''[[#Involuntary manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manslaughter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/manslaughter|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=29 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025453/https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/manslaughter|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is not the case in all jurisdictions, for example, in the U.S. state of Florida.&lt;ref name="FL-782"&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statutes, Sec. 782.07. Manslaughter|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0782/Sections/0782.07.html|website=Online Sunshine|publisher=State of Florida|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911024521/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799%2F0782%2FSections%2F0782.07.html|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian law===
In Australia, specifically New South Wales, manslaughter is referred to, however not defined, in the ''Crimes Act 1900'' (NSW).&lt;ref name="s18 Crimes Act 1900 NSW"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|18}} Murder and manslaughter defined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manslaughter exists in two forms in New South Wales: Voluntary or Involuntary Manslaughter. In New South Wales, in cases of voluntary manslaughter, both the ''[[actus reus]]'' (literally [[wiktionary:actus reus|guilty act]]) and ''[[mens rea]]'' (literally [[wiktionary:mens rea|guilty mind]]) for murder are proven but the defendant has a partial defence, such as extreme provocation or diminished responsibility.&lt;ref name="s23 Crimes Act 1900 NSW"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|23}} and {{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082/23a.html|23A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane v R"/&gt;{{rp|[51]–[65]}} In cases of involuntary manslaughter, the ''actus reus'' for murder is present but there is insufficient ''mens rea'' to establish such a charge.

There are two categories of involuntary manslaughter at common law: manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and manslaughter by criminal negligence. The authority for the ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' of involuntary manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act is the High Court of Australia case of ''Wilson v R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1992|litigants=Wilson v R |parallelcite=(1992) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 313 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This case determined that the act that caused the death must breach the criminal law and that the act must carry an appreciable risk of serious injury (''actus reus''). Regarding the ''mens rea'', the court held that the accused must intend to commit the unlawful act and that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised or recognised that the act carried an appreciable risk of serious injury. Manslaughter by criminal negligence, on the other hand, finds its authority in the Victorian case of ''Nydam v R'',&lt;ref name="Nydam v R"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|50|1977|litigants=Nydam v R |parallelcite=[1977] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 430 |courtname=auto |date=17 December 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed by the High Court of Australia in ''[[R v Lavender]]''&lt;ref name="R v Lavender"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|2005|litigants=[[R v Lavender]] |parallelcite=(2005) 222 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 67 at [17], [60], [72], [136] |courtname=auto |date=4 August 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Burns v R''.&lt;ref name="Burns v R"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|2012|litigants=Burns v R |parallelcite=(2012) 246 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 334 per French CJ at [19] |courtname=auto |date=14 September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Nydam v R'',&lt;ref name="Nydam v R" /&gt; the Court described the office at [445] in the following terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.&lt;ref name="Nydam v R" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Canadian law===
Canadian law distinguishes between justifiable, accidental and culpable homicide. If a death is deemed a culpable homicide, it generally falls under one of four categories (first-degree murder, second-degree murder, manslaughter, and infanticide).

Canadian law defines manslaughter as "a homicide committed without the intention to cause death, although there may have been an intention to cause harm". There are two broad categories of manslaughter: unlawful act, and criminal negligence.

Unlawful act is when a person commits a crime that unintentionally results in the death of another person.

Criminal negligence is when the homicide was the result of an act that showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives of others.&lt;ref name="canadalaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder vs. Manslaughter|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/murder-vs-manslaughter-1.1155132|website=CBC News|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=27 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912233043/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/murder-vs-manslaughter-1.1155132|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English law===
{{Main article|Manslaughter in English law}}
In [[English law]], manslaughter is a less serious offence than [[murder in English law|murder]]. In [[England and Wales]], the usual practice is to prefer a charge of murder, with the [[judge]] or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option (see [[lesser included offence]]). The [[jury]] then decides whether the [[defendant]] is guilty or not guilty of either murder or manslaughter. Manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary, depending on whether the accused has the required ''mens rea'' for murder.

The [[Homicide Act 1957]]  and [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]] are relevant acts.

Voluntary manslaughter occurs when the defendant avails themself of the three statutory defenses described in the Homicide Act 1957 (provocation, diminished responsibility, and a suicide pact).

Involuntary manslaughter occurs when the agent has no intention (mens rea) of committing murder, but caused the death of another through [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] or [[criminal negligence]]. The crime of involuntary manslaughter can be subdivided into two main categories: constructive manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter.

===United States law===
{{Main article|Manslaughter (United States law)}}
Manslaughter is a crime in the [[United States]]. Definitions can vary among jurisdictions, but the U.S. follows the general principle that manslaughter involves causing the death of another person in a manner less [[culpable]] than [[murder]], and observes the distinction between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref name="uslaw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=17 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910041250/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Law===
[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]] jurisdictions, such as the [[Code pénal (France)|French Code]], use "murder" or "involuntary homicide" to cover the crime of manslaughter, and reserve "assassination" for the crime of [[premeditated murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminal Code of the French Republic |date=2005 |url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205072708/http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/30 |archivedate=2018-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Flora Bell''' (born 26 May 1957) is an English woman who, as a child aged 10–11 in 1968, strangled to death two young boys in [[Scotswood]], an inner-city suburb in the West End district of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. She was convicted in December 1968 of the [[manslaughter]] of Martin Brown (aged 4) and Brian Howe (aged 3).&lt;ref name="BBCNews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/17/newsid_3261000/3261087.stm|title=17 December: 1968: Mary Bell found guilty of double killing|work=BBC On This Day|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2010|date=17 December 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her release from prison in 1980, she has lived under a series of pseudonyms. Her identity has been protected by a court order, which has also been extended to protect the identity of her daughter. In 1998, Bell collaborated with [[Gitta Sereny]] on an account of her life, in which she details the abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her mother{{snd}}a prostitute{{snd}}and her mother's clients.
==Early life==
Bell's mother Betty (née McCrickett) was a prostitute who was often absent from the family home, travelling to [[Glasgow]] to work. Mary (nicknamed May)&lt;ref name="BBCNews1"/&gt; was her first child, born when Betty was 17 years old. It is not known who Mary's biological father was. For most of her life she believed it to be Billy Bell, a habitual criminal who was later arrested for armed robbery, but Bell married McCrickett when Mary was a baby.&lt;ref name="Cries1"/&gt;

Independent accounts from family members strongly suggest that Betty had more than once attempted to kill Mary and make her death look accidental during the first few years of her life. Her family was suspicious when Mary "fell" from a window, and when she "accidentally" consumed sleeping pills. On one such occasion, an independent witness saw Betty giving the pills to her daughter as sweets.&lt;ref name="Cries1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sereny |first=Gitta |title=Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell |publisher=Macmillan |year=1998 |location=London |isbn=0-333-73524-2|pages=330–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary herself says she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse, her mother forcing her from the age of four to engage in sexual acts with men.&lt;ref name="Cries Unheard2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sereny |first=Gitta |title=Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell |publisher=Macmillan |year=1998 |location=London|pages=334–36|isbn=0-333-73524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported after this "fall" that Mary experienced, that she had suffered from brain damage. At the time this was reported as a result of the fall, however we now know this may be due to the abuse she has experienced as a child, from her own mother. Mary had damage to her prefrontal cortex, an are associated with voluntary movements and decision-making.&lt;ref name="Cries Unheard2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sereny |first=Gitta |title=Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell |publisher=Macmillan |year=1998 |location=London|pages=334–36|isbn=0-333-73524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings==
On 25 May 1968, the day before her 11th birthday, Mary Bell strangled 4-year-old Martin Brown in a derelict house.&lt;ref name="BBCNews1"/&gt; She was believed to have committed this crime alone. Between that time and a second killing, she and a friend, '''Norma Joyce Bell''' (1955–1989; no relation), aged 13, broke into and vandalised a nursery in Scotswood, leaving notes that claimed responsibility for the killing. The police dismissed this incident as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;''The Case of Mary Bell: A Portrait of a Child Who Murdered'', page 115, Gitta Sereny, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 1968, the two girls took part in the death, again by strangulation, of 3-year-old Brian Howe, in a wasteland in the same Scotswood area.&lt;ref name="BBCNews1"/&gt; Police reports concluded that Mary Bell had later returned to his body to carve an "M" into the boy's stomach. Mary Bell also used a pair of scissors to cut off some of Howe's hair, scratch his legs, and mutilate his penis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Case Of Mary Bell: A Portrait of a Child Who Murdered''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and imprisonment==
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle [[Assizes]], Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of [[Diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]], the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of [[psychopathy]]". The judge, Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children".&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=SMITH|first1=JOAN|title=For ever a child-killer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/for-ever-a-child-killer-1161689.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Digital News and Media Ltd.|date=3 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to be detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]], effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to [[Red Bank secure unit]] in [[Newton-Le-Willows]], [[Lancashire]] – the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]]'s killers, 25 years later.&lt;ref name="BBCNews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owlcation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monacelli|first1=Antonia|title=Murderous Children: 11-Year-Old Serial Killer Mary Bell|url=https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Murderous-Children-Mary-Bell|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Owlcation|publisher=[[HubPages Inc.]]|date=23 May 2016|location=Scotswood, England|language=en|quote=Mary Bell, The Tyneside Strangler: "I Murder So That I May Come Back"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly escaped from Moor Court [[open prison]], where she had been held since her transfer from a [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution|young offenders institution]] to an adult prison a year earlier.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Lorraine|last2=Alderson|first2=Andrew|title=How a 'terrified' Mary Bell walked back into the world|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1312518/How-a-terrified-Mary-Bell-walked-back-into-the-world.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=24 June 2001|quote=Bell, who had briefly escaped from prison in 1977, was in Styal prison in Cheshire when the Parole Board decided that she should be freed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1976-2000/1977.html |title=Street parties for the Queen |work=Our Century |publisher=Express &amp; Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in [[South Norwood]] (in a house built by Victorian inventor [[William Stanley (inventor)|William Stanley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akpan|first=Eloïse|title=''The Story of William Stanley – A Self-made Man|publisher=Eloïse Akpan|location=London|year=2000|pages=40|isbn=0-9538577-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-lcc_4&amp;cid=8-18#8-18 |title=Cumberlow lodge, approved school and remand home south Norwood; General LCC/CH/D/CUM/1 [n.d.] |publisher=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after prison==
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from [[Askham Grange]] open prison after having served 12 years and was granted anonymity (including a new name), allowing her to start a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Short and Brutal Timeline|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/mary-bell/timeline|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Crime + Investigation|publisher=AETN UK|date=29 June 2017|language=en|quote=1980 - Mary Bell is released from prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984. Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.

Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Early|first1=Chas|title=December 17, 1968: Britain in shock as Mary Bell, 11, is found guilty of toddler murders|url=http://home.bt.com/news/on-this-day/december-17-1968-11-year-old-mary-bell-found-guilty-of-killing-toddlers-11364029165478|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=BT.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order".&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Jeff|title=Shocked to the core: 10 crimes that shook Britain|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/10-crimes-that-shook-britain-817163|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=mirror|publisher=MGN Limited|date=6 May 2012|language=en|quote=... a plea to a court that her identity should not be revealed by the media was accepted by the High Court under what became known as the Mary Bell law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books about the case==
Bell is the subject of two books by [[Gitta Sereny]]: ''The Case of Mary Bell'' (1972), an account of the killings and trial, and ''Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell'' (1998),&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Understanding The Root Of Evil|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/understanding-the-root-of-evil/|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=CBSNews.com staff|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=21 October 1999|language=en|quote=Sereny contends Mary used evil conduct as a cry to be rescued from a horrific childhood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; an in-depth biography based on interviews with Bell and relatives, friends and professionals who knew her during and after her imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Cries Unheard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sereny |first=Gitta |title=Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell |publisher=Macmillan |year=1998 |location=London |isbn=0-333-73524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second book was the first to detail Bell's account of sexual abuse at the hands of her mother, a prostitute who specialised as a [[dominatrix]], and her mother's clients.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=KOTLOWITZ|first1=ALEX|title=A Bad Seed?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/reviews/990418.18kotlowt.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=www.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=18 April 1999|language=en|quote=... and that Betty, a prostitute, used her daughter as a sexual prop in some of her sadomasochistic encounters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Cries Unheard'' was controversial because Bell received payment for her participation.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=The hounding of Mary Bell|url=http://www.economist.com/node/125568|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=30 April 1998|quote=Inflamed by the publication of a new book on the case—and by the fact that Miss Bell accepted a substantial sum of money from its author, Gitta Sereny—Britain's tabloids have eagerly pursued their new quarry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The payment was criticised by the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press, and [[Tony Blair]]'s government attempted to find a legal means to prevent its publication on the grounds that a criminal should not profit from his or her crimes, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

Bell is one of thirteen child killers reported on in the book ''Children Who Kill: Profiles of Pre-teen and Teenage Killers'' by author Carol&amp;nbsp;Anne Davis, published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Anne Davis|title=Children who kill : Profiles of Pre-teen and Teenage Killers|date=2004|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London|isbn=9780749006938|url=https://www.worldofbooks.com/children-who-kill-profiles-of-pre-teen-and-teenage-killers-by-carol-anne-davis-gor001318318.html|accessdate=26 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">'''Operational continuity''' refers to the ability of a system to continue working despite damages, losses or critical events. In the Human Resources and Organizational domain, including IT, it implies the need to determine the level of [[Resilience_(organizational)|resilience]] of the system, its ability to recover after an event, and build a system that resists to external and internal events or is able to recover after an event without losing its external [[performance management]] capability. Organizational Continuity is achieved only with specific corporate planning.&lt;ref&gt;Argenti, John (1974). Systematic Corporate Planning. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the material domain, it determines the need to adopt redundant systems, performance monitoring systems, and can even imply the practice to cannibalize or to remove serviceable assemblies, sub-assemblies or components from a repairable or serviceable item of equipment in order to install them on another, in order to keep the external system performance active.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
Operational continuity may be referred to single systems, single individuals, up to teams or entire complex systems such as IT infrastructures, implying the ability of an organization or system to continue to provide its mission.

{{Capitalism}}
Throughout [[modern history]], a variety of perspectives on [[capitalism]] have evolved based on different [[School of thought|schools of thought]].

==Overview==
[[Adam Smith]] was one of the first influential writers on the topic with his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', which is generally considered to be the start of [[classical economics]] which emerged in the 18th century. To the contrary, [[Karl Marx]] considered [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] and considered capitalism a phase of economic development that would pass and be replaced by [[Communist society|pure communism]]. In conjunction with his [[criticism of capitalism]] was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a [[social revolution]] to a [[Socialist economics|socialist-style economy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheen, Francis ''Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital''. 1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] or the [[bourgeoisie]] becomes the basis of [[class struggle]].

This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit. [[Max Weber]] considered [[Market (economics)|market]] [[trade|exchange]] rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises was their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]]; a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]].

Meanwhile [[institutional economics]], once the main [[school of economic thought]] in the United States, holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. In the late 19th century, the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]] of economics diverged with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the [[creative destruction]] of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change.

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[Planned economy|planned economies]]. Among Mises's arguments were the [[economic calculation problem]], which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek.&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book |title= Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=2008-09-08|last= Von Mises|first= Ludwig |authorlink= Ludwig von Mises|year= 1990|format= pdf|publisher= [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url= https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A.

''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] in an economy. The [[free market]] solution is the [[price mechanism]], wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.

Partially opposed to that view, the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued in his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'' that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]]. Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx’s problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that [[regulation]] can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive [[Economic expansion|expansions]] and [[Recession|recessions]] that Marx disliked.

These changes sought to create more stability in the [[business cycle]] and reduce the abuses of [[laborers]]. [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Erhardt III 2008"&gt;Erhardt III, Erwin.

[[Supply-side economics]] developed during the 1970s in response to Keynesian economic policy and in particular the failure of [[demand management]] to [[stabilization policy|stabilize]] Western economies during the [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]] in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]].&lt;ref name="case_780"&gt;Case, Karl E. &amp; Fair, Ray C.

Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[Labour economics|labor markets]]; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'', where he claims that the social responsibility of business is "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud". This is similar to Smith’s argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Milton 1970"&gt;Friedman, Milton. "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits." The New York Times Magazine 13 Sep. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the supply-side economics of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable [[laissez-faire|if left to themselves]] and [[Depression (economics)|depressions]] result only from government intervention.&lt;ref name="Felderer, Bernhard"&gt;{{cite book |title=Macroeconomics and New Macroeconomics|author=Felderer, Bernhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical political economy==

{{main|Classical economics|Classical liberalism}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
The [[classical economics|classical school of economic thought]] emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] published analyses of the production, distribution and exchange of goods in a [[Market (economics)|market]] that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists.

In France, [[Physiocrats]] like [[François Quesnay]] promoted [[free trade]] based on a conception that wealth originated from land. Quesnay's ''Tableau Économique'' (1759) described the economy analytically and laid the foundation of the Physiocrats' economic theory, followed by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] who opposed tariffs and [[customs duties]] and advocated [[free trade]]. [[Richard Cantillon]] defined long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income and argued that the [[supply and demand]] mechanism around land influenced short-term prices.

Smith's attack on [[mercantilism]] and his reasoning for "the system of natural liberty" in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today, particularly his theory of the "[[invisible hand]]" of the market, through which the pursuit of individual self-interest unintentionally produces a collective good for society. It was necessary for Smith to be so forceful in his argument in favor of free markets because he had to overcome the popular mercantilist sentiment of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Degen, Robert. ''The Triumph of Capitalism''. 1st ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Among civilized and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a great number of people do no labor at all, many of whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labour than the greater part of those who work; yet the produce of the whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly supplied, and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire. — [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''|sign=|source=}}
He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by David Ricardo, second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hunt, E.K.|title=History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2002|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation|The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' (1817), Ricardo developed the law of [[comparative advantage]], which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for free trade. Ricardo was a supporter of [[Say's law]] and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1991|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that [[inflation]] is closely related to changes in quantity of money and [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and was a proponent of the law of [[diminishing returns]], which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output.&lt;ref name="Skousen2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Skousen, Mark|title=The Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers|publisher=M.E.

The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy, though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of a few basic [[public goods]].&lt;ref name="aaron2003"&gt;Eric Aaron, ''What's Right?''

==Marxist political economy==
{{main|Marxian economics}}
{{see also|Socialism|Communism}}
{{Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] considered capitalism to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding [[social relations of production|social relations]] between individuals based on their connection with the process of production).&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or "[[bourgeois]] society" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity—on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]]." — [[Leon Trotsky]], "Marxism in our Time", 1939: "Inevitability of Socialism" [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]] in 1875]]
Following [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. According to Marx, [[capital (economics)|capital]] is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism because the exchange value of labor power—as reflected in the wage—is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.

He argues this difference in values constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital. v. 3. Chapter 47: Genesis of capitalist ground rent|author=Karl Marx |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent and must instead be compelled to survive to sell their labor for a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx.

{{quote|The commodity is first of all, an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind. The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach, or the imagination, makes no difference.

In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution to a socialist-style economy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of [[class struggle]]. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit.

{{quote|Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature.

The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. — [[Karl Marx]], ''[[Grundrisse]]''|sign=|source=}}
In ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916), [[Vladimir Lenin]] modified [[Classical Marxism|classic Marxist theory]] and argued that capitalism necessarily induced [[monopoly capitalism]]—which he also called "imperialism"—to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm|title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=26 February 2008|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century [[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the works of Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff.&lt;/ref&gt;

To these thinkers, capitalist class processes are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of [[surplus value]], usable as capital whiles other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes are predominant. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ste. Croix |author2=G. E. M. de |title=The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World|year=1982|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] extends Marxian thinking through which he theorizes the differential production of place, space and political activism under capitalism. He uses Marx’s theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its "fixes", but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be.

This idea of fix is suggestive and could mean fix as in stabilize, heal or solve, or as in a junky needing a fix—the idea of preventing feeling worse in order to feel better. In ''Limits to Capital'' (1982), Harvey outlines an overdetermined, spatially restless capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and its resolution. Furthermore, his work has been central for understanding the contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows.&lt;ref name="Lawson, Victoria 2007"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. Making Development Geography (Human Geography in the Making). New York: A Hodder Arnold Publication, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay, "Notes towards a theory of uneven geographical development", Harvey examines the causes of the extreme volatility in contemporary political economic fortunes across and between spaces of the world economy. He bases this uneven development on four conditionalities, being the material embedding of capital accumulation processes in the web of socio-ecological life; accumulation by dispossession; the law-like character of capital accumulation in space and time; and political, social and "class" struggles at a variety of geographical scales.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David.

==Weberian political sociology==
[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Max Weber]] in 1917]]
In some [[social science]]s, the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by 19th century German social theorist [[Max Weber]]. Weber considered [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Trade|exchange]] rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises are characterized by their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l10.html|title=Max Weber: On Capitalism |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Macquarie University|author=Kilcullen, John|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904–1905), Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern Western capitalism. For Weber, the spirit of capitalism was in general that of ascetic Protestantism—this ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital: this was sufficient then to create "self-mediating capital" as conceived by Marx.

This is pictured in Proverbs 22:29 "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings" and in Colossians 3:23 "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men". In the ''Protestant Ethic'', Weber further stated that "moneymaking—provided it is done legally—is, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one’s calling" and "If God show you a way in which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends of your calling, and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requireth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin" (p.&amp;nbsp;108).

Most generally for Weber, Western capitalism was the "rational organization of formally free labor". The idea of the "formally free" laborer meant in the double sense of Marx that the laborer was both free to own property and free of the ability to reproduce his labor power, i.e. was the victim of expropriation of his means of production. It is only on these conditions, still abundantly obvious in the modern world of Weber, that Western capitalism is able to exist.

For Weber, modern Western capitalism represented the order "now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt" (p.&amp;nbsp;123).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economyandsociety.com/events/Ethic&amp;SpiritCapsm_Conf_Agenda2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Conference Agenda|publisher=Economy and Society|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further seen in his criticism of "specialists without spirit, [[Hedonism|hedonists]] without a heart" that were developing in his opinion with the fading of the original [[Puritan]] "spirit" associated with capitalism.&lt;ref name="minerva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grytten|first=Ola H.|title=Protestantisk etikk og entreprenørskapets ånd|journal=[[Minerva (Norwegian periodical)|Minerva]]|year=2010|volume=86|issue=4|authorlink=Ola Honningdal Grytten|page=70|trans-title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Entrepreneurship|publisher=[[Conservative Students' Association (Norway)|Conservative Students' Association]]|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|issn=0805-7842|oclc=477895639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional economics==
{{main|Institutional economics}}
{{see also|New institutional economics}}
[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Thorstein Veblen]]]]
Once the main school of economic thought in the United States, institutional economics holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. It emphasizes the legal foundations of capitalism (see [[John R. Commons]]) and the evolutionary, habituated and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see [[John Dewey]], [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Daniel Bromley]]).

One key figure in institutional economics was [[Thorstein Veblen]] who in his book ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899) analyzed the motivations of wealthy people in capitalism who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success. The concept of [[conspicuous consumption]] was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.

In ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904), Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power.

==German Historical School and Austrian School==
{{main|Historical school of economics|Austrian School}}
From the perspective of the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]], capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and money lends it different focus.&lt;ref name="Burnham"/&gt; For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern [[monetary system|monetary economy]] combined with an emphasis on the [[profit motive]].

[[File:MisesLibrary.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]
In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the "[[creative destruction]]" of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change.

At any moment of time, posits Schumpeter, there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter and many contemporary economists influenced by his work argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change.

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[planned economies]]. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.

{{quote|The effect of the people's agreeing that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing where they want to go; with the result that they may all have to make a journey which most of them do not want at all. — [[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''|sign=|source=}}
Among their arguments were the [[economic calculation problem]], which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek.&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Hayek, 1935 pp. 1-40"/&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] in an economy. The [[free market]] solution is the [[price mechanism]], wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. The price conveys embedded information about the [[Supply and demand|abundance of resources as well as their desirability]] which in turn allows corrections that prevent [[Economic shortage|shortages]] and [[Economic surplus|surpluses]] on the basis of individual consensual decisions.

Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution and without the information provided by market prices socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. Mises argued in a famous 1920 article "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned or controlled the [[means of production]], then no rational prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not "objects of exchange", unlike final goods, therefore they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt; This led him to declare "that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt; Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis]]''.

Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, asserted Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within [[supply-side economics]] built on the work of the Austrian School and particularly emphasize [[Say's law]] that "supply creates its own demand". To this school, capitalism is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers.

Austrian economists claim that Marx failed to make the distinction between [[capitalism]] and [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name="rothbard"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Future of Peace and Capitalism |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray N.

In his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'', the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]].

Essentially rejecting [[Say's law]], he argued that some people may have a [[liquidity preference]] that would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the [[Great Depression]] would not end without what he termed in the ''General Theory'' "a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment".

[[Keynesian economics]] challenged the notion that ''laissez-faire'' capitalist economics could operate well on their own without state intervention used to promote [[aggregate demand]], fighting high unemployment and [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended "[[Deficit spending|pump-priming]]" the economy to avoid [[recession]]: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of [[inflation]] to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch01.htm |title=Marx and Keynes: the limits of the mixed economy |author=Paul Mattick |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx’s problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked. These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Erhardt III 2008"/&gt; However, the premises of Keynes’s work have since been challenged by neoclassical and [[supply-side economics]] and the Austrian School.

Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague [[Piero Sraffa]] and subsequently from the [[Neo-Ricardianism|Neo-Ricardian school]] that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest [[rate of profit]] causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations.

==Supply-side economics==
{{main|Supply-side economics}}
Supply-side economics is a school of [[macroeconomic]] thought that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting [[income tax]] and [[capital gains tax]] rates and by allowing greater flexibility by reducing regulation. Consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices.

The term "supply-side economics" was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist [[Jude Wanniski]] in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson's ''Supply-Side Follies''&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Robert D. Supply-side Follies: Why Conservative Economics Fails, Liberal Economics Falters, and Innovation Economics Is the Answer. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "supply side" ("supply-side fiscalists") was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein (a former economic adviser to President Nixon) and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. Its use connotes the ideas of economists [[Robert Mundell]] and [[Arthur Laffer]]. Today, supply-side economics is often conflated with the politically rhetorical term "[[trickle-down economics]]", but as Jude Wanniski points out in his book ''The Way The World Works'' trickle-down economics is conservative Keynesianism associated with the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Jude Wanniski, 69, Journalist Who Coined the Term 'Supply-Side Economics,' Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/business/31wanniski.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|What the welfare system and other kinds of governmental programs are doing is paying people to fail. In so far as they fail, they receive the money; in so far as they succeed, even to a moderate extent, the money is taken away. — [[Thomas Sowell]] during a discussion in [[Milton Friedman]]'s "[[Free to Choose]]" television series in 1980|sign=|source=}}
Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economics are lower [[marginal tax rate]]s and less regulation.&lt;ref name="Wanniski 1978"/&gt; Maximum benefits from taxation policy are achieved by optimizing the marginal tax rates to spur growth, although it is a common misunderstanding that supply side economics is concerned only with taxation policy when it is about removing barriers to production more generally.&lt;ref name="Brownlee"/&gt;

Many early proponents argued that the size of the economic growth would be significant enough that the increased government revenue from a faster-growing economy would be sufficient to compensate completely for the short-term costs of a tax cut and that tax cuts could in fact cause overall revenue to increase.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Bartlett |title=How Supply-Side Economics Trickled Down |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/opinion/06bartlett.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassical economics and the Chicago School==
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}
{{see also|Monetarism|Chicago school (economics)}}
Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[labor market]]s; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times'', where he claims that the social responsibility of business is "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud". This is similar to Smith’s argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Milton 1970"/&gt; Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].

The [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable [[laissez-faire|if left to themselves]] and depressions result only from government intervention.&lt;ref name="Felderer, Bernhard"/&gt;

{{quote|One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. — [[Milton Friedman]], interview with [[Richard Heffner]] on ''[[The Open Mind (TV series)|The Open Mind]]'' (7 December 1975)|sign=|source=}}
Friedman argued that the [[Great Depression]] was result of a contraction of the money supply controlled by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] and not by the lack of investment as [[John Maynard Keynes]]: "There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman (1967) p.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bernanke]], former Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke  |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|accessdate=26 February 2008|date=8 November 2002|author=Ben Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists, today the majority of economists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yonary, Yuval P.|title=The Struggle Over the Soul of Economics|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03419-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider value to be subjective, varying from person to person and for the same person at different times and thus reject the labor theory of value. [[Marginalism]] is the theory that economic value results from marginal utility and [[marginal cost]] (the [[marginal concepts]]). These economists see capitalists as earning profits by forgoing current consumption, by taking risks, and by organizing production.

==Mainstream economics==
{{main|Mainstream economics}}
{{see also|Neoclassical synthesis|econophysics|behavioral economics|evolutionary economics}}
[[Mainstream economics]] is a loose term used to refer to the non-[[heterodox economics]] taught in prominent universities. It is most closely associated with [[neoclassical economics]],&lt;ref&gt;David C. Colander, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IESEfQVI1vgC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Complexity and History of Economic Thought''], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; or more precisely by the [[neoclassical synthesis]], which combines neoclassical approach to microeconomics with [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian approach]] to macroeconomics.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary orthodox [[schools of economics|economic schools of thought]] are the "[[saltwater and freshwater economics|saltwater and freshwater schools]]". The saltwater schools consist of the [[universities]] and other institutions located near the East and West Coast of the [[United States]], such as [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Stanford]] and [[Yale]]. Freshwater schools include the [[University of Chicago]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[University of Minnesota]]. They were referred to as the "freshwater school" since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester and Minneapolis are located nearer to the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon: Productivity ... "four universities placed on or near bodies of fresh water, Carnegie-Mellon, Chicago, Minnesota and Rochester"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saltwater school is associated with Keynesian ideas of government intervention into the [[free market]] while the Freshwater schools are skeptical of the benefits of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kilborn PT. (1988). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DB1338F930A15754C0A96E948260 'Fresh water' Economists Gain]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream economists do not in general identify themselves as members of a particular school, but they may be associated with approaches within a field such as the [[rational expectations|rational-expectations]] approach to [[macroeconomics]].

'''''Porphyromonas gingivalis''''' belongs to the phylum [[Bacteroidetes]] and is a nonmotile, [[Gram-negative]], rod-shaped, [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[pathogen]]ic [[bacterium]]. It forms black colonies on [[blood agar]].

It is found in the oral cavity, where it is implicated in certain forms of [[periodontal disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Naito M, Hirakawa H, Yamashita A, etal |title=Determination of the Genome Sequence of Porphyromonas gingivalis Strain ATCC 33277 and Genomic Comparison with Strain W83 Revealed Extensive Genome Rearrangements in P. gingivalis |journal=DNA Res. |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=215–25 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18524787 |doi=10.1093/dnares/dsn013 |url=http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18524787 |pmc=2575886}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the upper [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[respiratory tract]], and the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].

High levels of specific antibodies can be detected in patients harboring ''P. gingivalis''.

In addition, ''P. gingivalis'' has been linked to [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. It contains the enzyme [[peptidyl-arginine deiminase]], which is involved in [[citrullination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors = Wegner, N, Wait R, Sroka A, Eick S, Nguyen KA, Lundberg K, Kinloch A, Culshaw S, Potempa J, Venables PJ |title=Peptidylarginine deiminase from Porphyromonas gingivalis citrullinates human fibrinogen and α-enolase: Implications for autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis |journal=[[Arthritis Rheum.]] |volume=62 |pages=2662–2672 |date=September 2010 |doi=10.1002/art.27552|issue=9|pmc=2941529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased incidence of periodontal disease,&lt;ref name="pmid20646949"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Berthelot JM, Le Goff B |title = Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease |journal = Joint Bone Spine |volume = 77 |issue = 6 |pages = 537–41 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20646949 |doi = 10.1016/j.jbspin.2010.04.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; antibodies against the bacterium are significantly more common in these patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogrendik M, Kokino S, Ozdemir F, Bird PS, Hamlet S |title=Serum Antibodies to Oral Anaerobic Bacteria in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis |journal=MedGenMed |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=2 |year=2005 |pmid=16369381 |pmc=1681585 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/505458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. gingivalis'' is divided into K-[[serotype]]s based upon [[bacterial capsule|capsular]] [[antigenicity]] of the various types.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Periodontology 2010 In-Service Exam, question A-85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genome ==
The genome of ''P. gingivalis'' has been described in 2003 and revealed 1,990 [[open reading frame]]s (i.e. protein-coding sequences), encoded by 2,343,479 bp, with an average G+C content of 48.3%.&lt;ref name="pmid12949112"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson KE, Fleischmann RD, DeBoy RT, Paulsen IT, Fouts DE, Eisen JA, Daugherty SC, Dodson RJ, Durkin AS, Gwinn M, Haft DH, Kolonay JF, Nelson WC, Mason T, Tallon L, Gray J, Granger D, Tettelin H, Dong H, Galvin JL, Duncan MJ, Dewhirst FE, Fraser CM |title=Complete genome sequence of the oral pathogenic Bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83 |journal=J.

== Virulence factors ==

=== Gingipain===
Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and lys-gingipain (Kgp) are secreted by ''P. gingivalis.'' These [[gingipain]]s serve many functions for the organism, which contributes to its survival and virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheets|first=S|author2=Robles-Price, A. |author3=Mckenzie, R. |title=Gingipain-dependent interactions with the host are important for survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis|journal=Front. Biosci.|year=2012|volume=13|issue=13|pages=3215–3238|pmid=18508429|pmc=3403687|doi=10.2741/2922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arg-gingipains have been found to play a key role in the collection of nutrients for ''P. gingivalis'' survival. Rgp degrades large peptides of the host organism to provide the bacterium with an abundant nitrogen and carbon source from human albumin serum.&lt;ref name=Grenier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=D|author2=Imbeault, S |author3=Plamondon, P. |author4=Grenier, G. |author5=Nakayama, K. |author6= Mayrand, D. |title=Role of gingipains in growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the presence of human serum albumin|journal=Infect Immun|year=2001|volume=69|issue=8|pages=5166–5172|doi=10.1128/IAI.69.8.5166-5172.2001|pmid=11447200|pmc=98614}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. gingivalis'' can also degrade [[transferrin]] within host cells which provides the organism with an abundant iron source needed to perform multiple cellular functions.&lt;ref name=Furuta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furuta|first=N|author2=Takeuchi, H. |author3=Amano, A |title=Entry of Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles into epithelial cells causes cellular functional impairment|journal=Infect Immun|year=2009|volume=77|pages=4761–70|doi=10.1128/IAI.00841-09|pmid=19737899|issue=11|pmc=2772519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gingipains are also responsible for a number of necessary functions related to host invasion and colonization. Rgp gingipains are necessary for adhesion and invasion as they processed precursor proteins of long fimbriae.&lt;ref name=Furuta /&gt; The ''P. gingivalis'' genes encoding RgpA, Kgp, and hemagglutinin A (HagA) were strongly expressed after incubation with ''T. denticola''. The hemagglutinin adhesion domain-containing proteins act to increase adhesive capacities of ''P. gingivalis'' with other bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meuric V, Martin B, Guyodo H, Rouillon A, Tamanai-Shacoori Z, Barloy-Hubler F, Bonnaure-Mallet M | year = 2013 | title = ''Treponema denticola'' improves adhesive capacities of ''Porphyromonas gingivalis'' | url = | journal = Mol Oral Microbiol | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 40–53 | doi=10.1111/omi.12004| pmid = 23194417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also associated with coordinating the integrity of the biofilm in the developing and maturation phase.&lt;ref name=Kubinowa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kubinowa|first=M|author2=Hasagawa, Y. |author3=Mao, S |title=P. gingivalis accelerates gingivial epithelial cell progression through the cell cycle|journal=Microbes Infect|year=2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=122–128|doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2007.10.011|pmid=18280195|pmc=2311419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lys- gingipains (Kgp) can bind to immobilized matrix proteins [[fibrinogen]] and [[fibronectin]] and may have a role in host colonization.&lt;ref name=McAlister&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAlister|first=A.D. |author2=Sroka, A |author3=Fitzpatrick, R. E |author4=Quinsey, N.S |author5=Travis, J. |author6=Potempa, J |author7=Pike, R.N|title=Gingipain enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis preferentially bind immobilized extracellular proteins: a mechanism favouring colonization?|journal=J.

Gingipains also have the ability to degrade multiple signals of the host immune response. They have the ability to cleave subclass 1 and 3 [[IgG antibodies]]&lt;ref name="Vincents"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vincents |first1=Bjarne |last2=Guentsch |first2=Arndt |last3=Kostolowska |first3=Dominika |last4=von Pawel-Rammingen |first4=Ulrich |last5=Eick |first5=Sigrun |last6=Potempa |first6=Jan |last7=Abrahamson |first7=Magnus |title=Cleavage of IgG1 and IgG3 by gingipain K from Porphyromonas gingivalis may compromise host defense in progressive periodontitis |journal=FASEB Journal |date=October 2011 |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=3741–3750 |doi=10.1096/fj.11-187799 |pmid=21768393 |pmc=3177567}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as pro[[Cytokines|inflammatory cytokines]] such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-8 in regions of high ''P. gingivalis'' concentration.,&lt;ref name=Tanabe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=D|author2=Tanabe, S|title=Porphyromonas gingivalis Gingipains Trigger a Proinflammatory Response in Human Monocyte-derived Macrophages Through the p38alpha Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signal Transduction Pathway|journal=Toxins (Basel)|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=341–52|doi=10.3390/toxins2030341}}&lt;/ref&gt; which impairs host immune response function. Rgp can inhibit IL-2 accumulation in [[T-cells]], which enables it to evade the host adaptive immune response, by modulating T-cell communication and proliferation.&lt;ref name="Khalaf"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaf |first1=Hazem |last2=Bengtsson |first2=Torbjörn |editor1-last=Das |editor1-first=Gobardhan |title=Altered T-Cell Responses by the Periodontal Pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis |journal=PLOS One |year=2012 |volume=7 |issue=9 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...745192K |pages=45192 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingipains are key factors in tissue damage symptoms of [[periodontitis]], which results from the degradation of [[Metalloproteins|matrix metalloproteins]], [[collagen]], and [[fibronectin]].&lt;ref name=Furuta /&gt; Degradation of these substrates interferes with interactions between host cells and the [[extracellular matrix]], therefore impeding wound healing and causing destruction of periodontal tissues.&lt;ref name=Furuta /&gt; Rgp is responsible for eliciting the host inflammatory response via the p38α [[MAPK]] transduction pathway. This response likely contributes to the inflammatory nature of periodontitis and is involved in tissue and bone destruction.&lt;ref name=Grenier /&gt;

=== Capsular polysaccharide ===

The encapsulated strain of ''P. gingivalis'' is much more virulent than the nonencapsulated strain in a mouse abscess model.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=A|author2=Wyant, T |title=The capsule of Porphyromonas gingivalis leads to a reduction in the host inflammatory response, evasion of phagocytosis, and increase in virulence|journal=Infect Immun|year=2011|volume=79|issue=11|pages=4533–4542|doi=10.1128/IAI.05016-11|pmid=21911459|pmc=3257911|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capsule is a capsular polysaccharide and when present down regulates [[cytokine]] production especially proinflammatory [[cytokines]] IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and [[TNF-α]], indicating host evasion responses.&lt;ref name=Tanabe /&gt;&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt; However, other studies have found the CPS to elicit host immune responses like [[Polymorphonuclear neutrophil|PMN]] migration and dose and time dependent expression of cell migration [[chemokines]] like MCP-1, KC, MIP-2 and RANTES in CPS-challenged murine peritoneal macrophages. These conditions are likely to contribute to the inflammatory lesions observed in [[periodontitis]].&lt;ref name="D'Empaire"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Empaire|first=G|author2=Baer, M.T |title=The K1 serotype capsular polysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis elicits chemokine production from murine macrophages that facilitates cell migration|journal=Infect Immun|year=2006|volume=74|issue=11|doi=10.1128/IAI.00519-06|pages=6236–43|pmid=16940143|pmc=1695525|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaccines made from ''P. gingivalis'' CPS apparently impair oral bone loss in murine models. These vaccines have been able to elicit potent immune responses such as increased [[IgM]] and [[IgG]] responses that recognize whole ''P. gingivalis'' organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=D|author2=Tzianabos, A.O. |title=Immunization with Porphyromonas gingivalis Capsular Polysaccharide Prevents P. gingivalis-Elicited Oral Bone Loss in a Murine Model|journal=Infection and Immunity|year=2003|volume=71|issue=4|pages=2283–2287|doi=10.1128/IAI.71.4.2283-2287.2003|pmid=12654858|pmc=152101|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fimbriae ===
[[Fimbria (bacteriology)|Fimbriae]] are appendages involved in cellular attachment and greatly contribute to virulence and are found on many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.

''P. gingivalis'' virulence is heavily associated with fimbriae as they have been characterized to be key factors in adhesion, invasion, and colonization. Fimbriae are also responsible for invasion of membrane vesicles into host cells.&lt;ref name=Furuta /&gt; They were found to bind to cellular α5β1 [[integrins]], which mediated adherence and impaired the homeostatic controls of host cells.&lt;ref name=Tsuda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsuda|first=K|author2=Amano, A |title=Molecular dissection of internalization of Porphyromonas gingivalis by cells using fluorescent beads coated with bacterial membrane vesicle|journal=Cell Struct Funct.|year=2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=81–91|doi=10.1247/csf.30.81|pmid=16428861|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fimbriae were also found to be associated with modulating β2 integrin adhesive activity for uptake by [[monocytes]] using the [[CD14]]/[[TLR2]]/[[PI3K]] signaling complex, which may contribute to intracellular evasion tactics by ''P. gingivalis''.&lt;ref name=Hajishengallis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajishengallis|first=G|author2=Wang, M. |title=Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae proactively modulate beta2 integrin adhesive activity and promote binding to and internalization by macrophages|journal=Infect. Immun. |year=2006|volume=74|issue=10|pages=5658–5666|doi=10.1128/IAI.00784-06|pmid=16988241|pmc=1594907|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. gingivalis'' has long fimbriae, short fimbriae, and accessory components, each of which have distinct functions.&lt;ref name=Kubinowa /&gt;

==== Long fimbriae ====
Long fimbriae (FimA), also known as major fimbriae, are long, peritrichous, filamentous components.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=X|author2=Wu, J. |title=Porphyromonas gingivalis minor fimbriae are required for cell-cell interactions|journal=Infect Immun|year=2006|volume=74|issue=10|pages=6011–6015|doi=10.1128/IAI.00797-06|pmid=16988281|pmc=1594877|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a role in initial attachment and organization of biofilms, as they act as adhesins that mediate invasion and colonization of host cells contributing to ''P. gingivalis'' virulence.&lt;ref name=Kubinowa /&gt;

==== Short fimbriae ====
Short fimbriae (Mfa1), also known as minor fimbriae, have distinct roles from long fimbriae and are characterized to be essential for cell-cell auto aggregation and recruitment for [[microcolony]] formation.&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; Short fimbriae are involved in cell-cell adhesion with other dental commensals. It was found to coadhere and develop biofilm in conjunction with ''[[Streptococcus gordonii]]'' by interaction with SspB streptococcal surface polypeptide.&lt;ref name=Park&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Y|author2=Simionato, M|title=Short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis and their role in coadhesion with Streptococcus gordonii|journal=Infect Immun|year=2005|volume=73|issue=7|doi=10.1128/IAI.73.7.3983-3989.2005|pages=3983–9|pmid=15972485|pmc=1168573|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction may be essential in the invasion of dentinal tubules by ''P. gingivalis''.&lt;ref name=Love&gt;{{cite journal|last=Love|first=R|author2=McMillan, M.|title=Coinvasion of Dentinal Tubules byPorphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii Depends upon Binding Specificity of Streptococcal Antigen I/II Adhesin|journal=Infect.

==== Accessory fimbriae ====
Fim C, D, and E accessory components associate with the main FimA protein and have a role in binding with matrix proteins and interaction with CXC-chemokine receptor 4. Loss of function experiments have confirmed that ''P. gingivalis'' mutants deficient for Fim C, D, or E have drastically attenuated virulence.&lt;ref name=Pierce&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=D.L|author2=Nishiyama, S.|title=Host adhesive activities and virulence of novel fimbrial proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis|journal=Infect.

=== Evasion of host defenses and immune responses ===
''P. gingivalis'' has many ways of evading host immune responses which affects its virulence. It does this by using a combination of gingipain proteases, a capsular polysaccharide, induction of host cell proliferation, and the cleavage of chemokines responsible for neutrophil recruitment.&lt;ref name=Vincents /&gt;&lt;ref name=Liang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajishengallis|first=G|author2=Liang, S.|title=A Low-Abundance Biofilm Species Orchestrats Inflammatory Periodontal Disease through the Commensal Microbiota and the Complement Pathway|journal=Cell Host Microbe|year=2011|volume=10|issue=5|pages=497–506|doi=10.1016/j.chom.2011.10.006|pmid=22036469|pmc=3221781|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virulent ''P. gingivalis'' further modulates leukocyte recruitment by proteolysis of [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]] that are secreted by the host cells. The arg-gingipain and lys-gingipains are responsible for this proteolysis. In a study using a mouse model, ''P. gingivalis'' was specifically found to down-regulate [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] induction, causing delayed [[neutrophil]] recruitment. Prevention of neutrophil recruitment may inhibit the clearance of the bacterium from the site of infection allowing for colonization.&lt;ref name=Liang /&gt;''P. gingivalis'' is able to evade opsonophagocytosis from [[Granulocyte|PMN]]’s by using Gingipain K (Kgp) to cleave [[IgG]] 1 and 3. This further modulates immune response by impairing signaling.&lt;ref name= Vincents /&gt; Other studies have found that ''P. gingivalis'' can subvert the [[Complement system|complement]] pathway through C5αR and C3αR, which modulates the killing capacity of leukocytes, allowing for uncontrolled bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=Liang /&gt;&lt;ref name=WangLiang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Wang M, Liang S, Hosur KB, Domon H, Yoshimura F, Amano A, Hajishengallis G |title = Differential virulence and innate immune interactions of Type I and II fimbrial genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis |journal=Oral Microbiol.

[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|200px|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the [[Hippocratic oath]].]]
'''Professional ethics'''  encompass the personal, and corporate standards of behavior expected by [[professional]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf Royal Institute of British Architects - Code of professional conduct] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618044002/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By at least the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: [[Divinity]], [[Law]], and [[Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.co.wise.tx.us/constable/Downloads/Professionalism%20and%20Ethics.pdf|title = Professionalism and Ethics|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time.

Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Chadwick (1998). Professional Ethics. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved October 20, 2006, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/professional-ethics/v-1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Whitbeck, "Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research" Cambridge University Press, 1998 page 40&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the [[Hippocratic oath]] to which medical [[physician|doctors]] still adhere to this day.

==Components==
Some professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF RICS- MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216090731/http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF |date=2011-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically these include:
*[[Honesty]]
*[[Integrity]]
*[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]]
*[[Accountability]]
*[[Confidentiality]]
*[[Objectivity (journalism)|Objectivity]]
*[[Respect]]
*[[Legal|Obedience to the law]]
*[[Loyalty]]

==Implementation==
Most professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent [[wikt:exploitation|exploitation]] of the client and to preserve the integrity of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public’s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.

===Internal regulation===
In cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members.  This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Brazier, ‘’Medicine, Patients and the Law’’, Penguin, 1987 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory regulation==
In many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the [[statutory body|statutory bodies]] that regulate [[nursing]] and [[midwife]]ry in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729062133/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.

==Examples==
For example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a [[car crash]] victim because they could not give an appropriate [[emergency treatment]]. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct [[diagnosis]] and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as [[negligent]] and [[unethical]]. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be [[wikt:egregious|egregious]] repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the [[Good Samaritan law|"Good Samaritan" laws]] if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.

A business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrupulous scrupulous] engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a [[bribe]], thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis, ‘Thinking like an Engineer’ in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separatism===
On a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society.&lt;ref name=Gewirth&gt;{{cite journal
 | last =Gewirth
 | first =Alan
 | title =Professional Ethics: The Separatist Thesis
 | journal =Ethics
 | volume =96
 | issue =2
 | pages =282–300
 | date =Jan 1986
 | jstor =2381378
 | doi=10.1086/292747}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282}} For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be [[detrimental]] to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's [[autonomy]], as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contravene contravene] other moral demands in order to meet this goal.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|284}} Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see [[moral relativism]]). If [[moral universalism]] is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|285}}.

==Student ethics==
As attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, [[colleges]] and [[universities]] are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students.  Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Colleges Preparing Students For The Workplace|url=http://www.thecollegesolution.com/are-colleges-preparing-students-for-the-workplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College.

===Codes of conduct===
Codes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SXU Code of Conduct|url=http://www.sxu.edu/academics/resources/cie/conduct.asp|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling.

Not only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Conduct|url=http://handbook.sxu.edu/Student/Code_Conduct/student_conduct.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rh disease''' (also known as '''rhesus isoimmunisation''', '''Rh (D) disease''', '''rhesus incompatibility''', '''rhesus disease''', '''RhD''' '''hemolytic disease of the newborn''', '''rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn''' or '''RhD HDN''') is a type of [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (HDN).  The disease ranges from mild to severe, and typically occurs only in some second or subsequent pregnancies of [[Rh blood group system|Rh negative]] women where the fetus's father is Rh positive, leading to a Rh+ pregnancy. During birth, the mother may be exposed to the infant's blood, and this causes the development of antibodies, which may affect the health of subsequent Rh+ pregnancies.  In mild cases, the fetus may have mild [[anaemia]] with [[reticulocytosis]]. In moderate or severe cases the fetus may have a more marked anaemia and erythroblastosis fetalis ([[erythroblastosis fetalis|hemolytic disease of the newborn]]).  When the disease is very severe it may cause [[hydrops fetalis]] or [[stillbirth]].

Rh disease is generally preventable by treating the mother during pregnancy or soon after delivery with an [[intramuscular injection]] of anti-RhD immunoglobulin ([[Rho(D) immune globulin]]). The RhD protein is coded by the [[RHD (gene)|RHD]] gene.

== Serology ==

During any pregnancy a small amount of the baby's [[blood]] can enter the mother's circulation. If the mother is Rh negative and the baby is Rh positive, the mother produces [[Antibody|antibodies]] (including [[IgG]]) against the [[rhesus blood group system|rhesus D]] [[antigen]] on her baby's [[red blood cell]]s.  During this and subsequent pregnancies the IgG is able to pass through the [[placenta]] into the [[fetus]] and if the level of it is sufficient, it will cause destruction of rhesus D positive fetal red blood cells leading to the development of Rh disease. It may thus be regarded as insufficient [[immune tolerance in pregnancy]]. Generally rhesus disease becomes worse with each additional rhesus incompatible pregnancy.

The main and most frequent sensitizing event is child birth (about 86% of sensitized cases), but fetal blood may pass into the maternal circulation earlier during the pregnancy (about 14% of sensitized cases).&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowman |first=J. |first2=B. |last2=Chown |first3=M. |last3=Lewis |first4=J. M. |last4=Pollock |title=Rh-immunization during pregnancy: antenatal prophylaxis |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |year=1978 |pages=623–7 |volume=118 |issue=6 |doi= |pmc=1818025 |pmid=77714}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensitizing events during pregnancy include [[c-section]], [[miscarriage]], [[therapeutic abortion]], [[amniocentesis]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], abdominal trauma and [[external cephalic version]]. However, in many cases there was no apparent sensitizing event.

The incidence of Rh disease in a population depends on the proportion that are rhesus negative.  Many non-Caucasian peoples have a very low proportion who are rhesus negative, so the incidence of Rh disease is very low in these populations. In Caucasian populations about 1 in 10 of all pregnancies are of a rhesus negative woman with a rhesus positive baby.  It is very rare for the first rhesus positive baby of a rhesus negative woman to be affected by Rh disease.  The first pregnancy with a rhesus positive baby is significant for a rhesus negative woman because she can be sensitized to the Rh positive antigen. In Caucasian populations about 13% of rhesus negative mothers are sensitized by their first pregnancy with a rhesus positive baby.  Without modern prevention and treatment, about 5% of the second rhesus positive infants of rhesus negative women would result in stillbirths or extremely sick babies.  Many babies who managed to survive would be severely ill.  Even higher disease rates would occur in the third and subsequent rhesus positive infants of rhesus negative women. By using anti-RhD immunoglobulin (Rho(D) immune globulin) the incidence is massively reduced.

Rh disease sensitization is about 10 times more likely to occur if the fetus is ABO compatible with the mother than if the mother and fetus are ABO incompatible.

== Diagnosis ==

;Maternal blood
*The [[Kleihauer–Betke test]] or [[flow cytometry]] on a postnatal maternal blood sample can confirm that fetal blood has passed into the maternal circulation and can also be used to estimate the amount of fetal blood that has passed into the maternal circulation.
*The indirect [[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|Coombs test]] is used to screen blood from antenatal women for [[IgG]] [[antibodies]] that may pass through the placenta and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn.
*Cell-free DNA can be run on certain antigens. Blood is taken from the mother, and using PCR, can detect the K, C, c, D, and E alleles of fetal DNA. This blood test is non-invasive to the fetus and is an easy way of checking antigen status and risk of HDN. Testing has proven very accurate and is routinely done in the UK at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01437.x |pmid=17958542 |title=Fetal genotyping for the K (Kell) and Rh C, c, and E blood groups on cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma |journal=Transfusion |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=2126–33 |year=2007 |last1=Finning |first1=Kirstin |last2=Martin |first2=Peter |last3=Summers |first3=Joanna |last4=Daniels |first4=Geoff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanquin laboratory in Amsterdam, Netherlands also performs this test. For US patients, blood may be sent to either of the labs. In the US, Sensigene is done by Sequenome to determine fetal D status. Sequenome does not accept insurance in the US, but US and Canadian patients have had insurance cover the testing done overseas.

;Paternal Blood 
Blood is generally drawn from the father to help determine fetal antigen status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03028.x |pmid=21668766 |title=Noninvasive fetal blood group genotyping of rhesus D, c, E and of K in alloimmunised pregnant women: Evaluation of a 7-year clinical experience |journal=BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=118 |issue=11 |pages=1340–8 |year=2011 |last1=Scheffer |first1=PG |last2=Van Der Schoot |first2=CE |last3=Page-Christiaens |first3=Gcml |last4=De Haas |first4=M }}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen.&lt;ref&gt;Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis: Clinical and Laboratory Aspects {{ISBN|978-0-12-397788-5}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test can help with knowledge for the current baby, as well as aid in the decision about future pregnancies. With RhD, the test is called the RhD genotype. With RhCE, and Kell antigen it is called an antigen phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/march/molecular-typing-for-red-blood-cell-antigens{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fetal blood (or umbilical cord blood)
*The direct [[Coombs test#Direct Coombs test|Coombs test]] is used to confirm that the fetus or neonate has an immune mediated [[hemolytic anemia]].

*Newborn Screening Tests - Transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the Newborn Screening Tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions.

== Prevention ==

Most Rh disease can be prevented by treating the mother during pregnancy or promptly (within 72 hours) after childbirth.  The mother has an intramuscular injection of anti-Rh antibodies ([[Rho(D) immune globulin]]).  This is done so that the fetal rhesus D positive erythrocytes are destroyed before the immune system of the mother can discover them and become sensitized.  This is passive immunity and the effect of the immunity will wear off after about 4 to 6 weeks (or longer depending on injected dose) as the anti-Rh antibodies gradually decline to zero in the maternal blood.

It is part of modern antenatal care to give all rhesus D negative pregnant women an anti-RhD IgG immunoglobulin injection at about 28 weeks gestation (with or without a booster at 34 weeks gestation).  This reduces the effect of the vast majority of sensitizing events which mostly occur after 28 weeks gestation.  Giving Anti-D to all Rhesus negative pregnant women can mean giving it to mothers who do not need it (because her baby is Rhesus negative or their blood did not mix).&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBain|first1=RD|last2=Crowther|first2=CA|last3=Middleton|first3=P|title=Anti-D administration in pregnancy for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=3 September 2015|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD000020|pmid=26334436|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000020.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries routinely give Anti-D to Rhesus D negative women in pregnancy. In other countries, stocks of Anti-D can run short or even run out.&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"/&gt; Before Anti-D is made routine in these countries, stocks should be readily available so that it is available for women who need Anti-D in an emergency situation.&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"/&gt;

A recent review found research into giving Anti-D to all Rhesus D negative pregnant women is of low quality.&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"/&gt; However the research did suggest that the risk of the mother producing antibodies to attack Rhesus D positive fetal cells was lower in mothers who had the Anti-D in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"/&gt; There were also fewer mothers with a positive [[Kleihauer–Betke test]] (which shows if the mother’s and unborn baby’s blood has mixed).&lt;ref name="pmid26334436"/&gt;
Anti-RhD immunoglobulin is also given to non-sensitized rhesus negative women immediately (within 72 hours—the sooner the better) after potentially sensitizing events that occur earlier in pregnancy.

The discovery of cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma has allowed for the non-invasive determination of the fetal RHD genotype.  In May 2017, the Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology of Canada is now recommending that the optimal management of the D-negative pregnant woman is based on the prediction of the fetal D-blood group by cell-free DNA in maternal plasma with targeted antenatal anti-D prophylaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Routine Non-invasive Prenatal Prediction of Fetal RHD Genotype in Canada: The Time is Here|journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Can|date=2017|volume=39|issue=5|pages=366–373|doi=10.1016/j.jogc.2016.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides the optimal care for D-negative pregnant women and has been adopted as the standard approach in a growing number of countries around the world.  It is no longer considered appropriate to treat all D-negative pregnant women with human plasma derivatives when there are no benefits to her or to the fetus in a substantial percentage of cases.

== Management ==

;Antenatal
* Serial Ultrasound and Doppler examinations—to detect signs of fetal anemia such as increased blood flow velocities and monitor [[hydrops fetalis]]
*Quantitative analysis of maternal anti-RhD antibodies—an increasing level is a sign of fetal Rh disease
*Intrauterine blood transfusion
**Intraperitoneal transfusion—blood transfused into fetal abdomen
**Intravascular transfusion—blood transfused into fetal [[umbilical vein]]—This is the method of choice since the late 1980s, and more effective than intraperitoneal transfusion. A sample of fetal blood can be taken from the umbilical vein prior to the transfusion.
*Early delivery (usually after about 36 weeks gestation)

;Postnatal
*Phototherapy for [[neonatal jaundice]] in mild disease
*[[Exchange transfusion]] if the neonate has moderate or severe disease (the blood for transfusion must be less than a week old, Rh negative, ABO compatible with both the fetus and the mother, and be cross matched against the mothers serum)
*IVIG has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20092394 |year=2010 |author1=Onesimo |first1=R |title=Intravenous Immunoglobulin therapy for anti-E hemolytic disease in the newborn |journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1059–61 |last2=Rizzo |first2=D |last3=Ruggiero |first3=A |last4=Valentini |first4=P |doi=10.3109/14767050903544751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/fn.88.1.F6 |pmid=12496219 |pmc=1755998 |title=Systematic review of intravenous immunoglobulin in haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=F6–10 |year=2003 |last1=Gottstein |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP recommends "In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level . If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms).

== History  ==

The [[Rh blood group system|rhesus]] blood type was first discovered in 1937 by [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Alexander S. Wiener]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3181/00379727-43-11151 |title=An Agglutinable Factor in Human Blood Recognized by Immune Sera for Rhesus Blood |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |volume=43 |pages=223 |year=1940 |last1=Landsteiner |first1=K. |last2=Wiener |first2=A. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who listed it in and alongside [[ABO blood group system|their tables]] for [[Blood type|blood-typing]] and cross-matching.

In 1939 [[Philip Levine (physician)|Philip Levine]] and [[Rufus E. Stetson]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1967/11/15/archives/rufus-e-stetson-surgeon-is-dead-hematologist-81-active-in-rh-factor.html&lt;/ref&gt; published their findings about a family who had a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] baby who died of [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1939.72800270002007a |title=An Unusual Case of Intra-Group Agglutination |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=126–7 |year=1939 |last1=Levine |first1=Philip |last2=Stetson |first2=Rufus E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mother was aged 25 and it was her second [[pregnancy]] and she suffered blood loss at the delivery.  Both parents were blood group O and the husband's blood was used to give the mother a [[blood transfusion]], but the mother suffered a severe [[transfusion reaction]].  They investigated this transfusion reaction.  Since the mother and the father were both [[blood group]] O, they concluded that there must be a previously undiscovered [[blood group]] [[antigen]] that was present on the husband's RBCs (red blood cells) but was not present on the mother's RBCs and that the mother had formed [[antibodies]] against the new blood group antigen.  This suggested for the ''first time'' that a mother could make blood group antibodies because of immune sensitization to her [[fetus]]'s RBCs.  They did not name this blood group antigen, but it was subsequently found to be the rhesus factor.

In 1941, Group O: a patient of Dr. Paul in [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington, NJ,]] delivered a normal infant in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97115362/bernard-charles-schlegel|title=Rev Bernard Charles “Bernie” Schlegel (1930-1991)...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;: this pregnancy was followed by a long period of sterility. The second pregnancy (April, 1941) resulted in an infant suffering icterus gravis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Philip|last2=Burnham|first2=Lyman|last3=Katzin|first3=E.M.|last4=Vogel|first4=Peter|date=1941-12|title=The role of iso-immunization in the pathogenesis of erythroblastosis fetalis|url=https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(41)90260-0/abstract|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|language=English|volume=42|issue=6|pages=925–937|doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(41)90260-0|issn=0002-9378}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1941,  the third anti-Rh serum (M.S.) of Group O became available. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Philip|last2=Burnham|first2=Lyman|last3=Katzin|first3=E.M.|last4=Vogel|first4=Peter|date=1941-12|title=The role of iso-immunization in the pathogenesis of erythroblastosis fetalis|url=https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(41)90260-0/references|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|language=English|volume=42|issue=6|pages=925–937|doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(41)90260-0|issn=0002-9378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first treatment for Rh disease was an [[exchange transfusion]], which was invented by [[Alexander S. Wiener]].  That procedure was further refined by Harry Wallerstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.103.2680.583 |pmid=21026828 |title=Treatment of Severe Erythroblastosis by Simultaneous Removal and Replacement of the Blood of the Newborn Infant |journal=Science |volume=103 |issue=2680 |pages=583 |year=1946 |last1=Wallerstein |first1=H. |bibcode=1946Sci...103..583W }}&lt;/ref&gt; a transfusionist.  Although the most effective method of treating the problem at the time, it was only partially ameliorative in cases where damage to the neonate had already been done.  Children with severe motor damage and/or retardation could result.  However, it is estimated that in the two decades it was used approximately 200,000 lives were saved, and the great majority were not brain damaged.

[[Ronald Finn]], in [[Liverpool]], England applied a microscopic technique for detecting fetal cells in the mother's blood. It led him to propose that the disease might be prevented by injecting the at-risk mother with an antibody against fetal red blood cells. He proposed this for the first time to the public on February 18, 1960. A few months later, he proposed at a meeting of the British Genetical Society that the antibody be anti-RhD.

Nearly simultaneously with him, William Pollack, then of [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical|Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation]], and researchers John Gorman and Vincent Freda of New York City's [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freda |first=V. |last2=Gorman |first2=J. |last3=Pollack |first3=W. |year=1964 |title=Successful Prevention of Experimental Rh Sensitization in Man with an Anti-Rh Gamma&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Globulin Antibody Preparation: A Preliminary Report |journal=Transfusion |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1964.tb02824.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; having come to the same realization, set out to prove it by injecting a group of male prisoners at [[Sing Sing Correctional Facility]] with antibody provided by Ortho, obtained by a fractionation technique developed by Pollack (who also provided Finn with several vials of antibody during a visit by Finn to Ortho).

Animal studies had previously been conducted by William Pollack, using a rabbit model of Rh. This model, named the rabbit HgA-F system, was a perfect animal model of human Rh, and enabled Pollack's team to gain experience in preventing hemolytic disease in rabbits by giving specific HgA antibody, as was later done with Rh-negative mothers. One of the needs was a dosing experiment that could be used to determine the level of circulating Rh-positive cells in an Rh-negative pregnant female derived from her Rh-positive fetus. This was first done in the rabbit system, but subsequent human tests at the University of Manitoba conducted under Pollack's direction confirmed that this result matched the human dosing perfectly. The dose is 20 µG of antibody for 1mL of Rh-positive red cells.

[[William Liley|Sir William Liley]] performed the first successful intrauterine transfusion in 1972.

Gorman's sister-in-law was the first at risk woman to receive a prophylactic injection on January 31, 1964. Clinical trials set up by Pollack in 42 clinical centers in the US, Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Italy, and Australia confirmed their hypothesis, and the vaccine was finally approved in England and the United States in 1968. The FDA approved the drug under the name RhoGAM, with a fixed dose of 300 µG, to be given within three days postpartum. There being no known harm done by delaying the dosage for a week or more after birth, Ortho asked the FDA to grant permission for it to be given without a postpartum time restriction. In addition, John M. Bowman, one of the researchers at the University of Manitoba, and Freda pushed to allow antepartum use. All of this was subsequently granted. Within a year or so, the antibody had been injected with great success into more than 500,000 women. Time magazine picked it as one of the top ten medical achievements of the 1960s. By 1973, it was estimated that in the US alone, over 50,000 babies' lives had been saved. The use of Rh immune globulin to prevent the disease in babies of Rh negative mothers has become standard practice, and the disease, which used to claim the lives of 10,000 babies each year in the US alone, has been virtually eradicated in the developed world. The achievement was made almost entirely without support from the [[NIH]], who rejected the New York group's proposal twice.  The group got instead only a small grant ($329,765 over 10 years) from the City of New York. The total cost of the effort was only a couple of million dollars, which is about the cost of the life-time care of a half-dozen irreparably brain-damaged children.  In 1980, [[Cyril Clarke]], [[Ronald Finn]], John Gorman, Vincent Freda, and William Pollack each received an [[Albert Lasker Award]] for Clinical Medical Research for their work on rhesus blood types and the prevention of Rh disease.

Two of the Canadian researchers from the [[University of Manitoba]], [[Bruce Chown]], John M. Bowman and under the leadership of the President of the Winnipeg Rh Institute, Albert D. Friesen, PhD, licensed a version of the vaccine, known as WinRho, in 1980. The drug is sold in 35 countries by the Manitoba-based research firm Cangene, listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] with worth of about $175 million.{{when|date=November 2013}} Cangene was purchased by the Winnipeg Rh Institute, a facility founded by Chown and Bowman and dedicated to conducting research into blood related diseases. Chown is honored by the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]] for his lifelong work with erythroblastosis fetalis.

[[James Harrison (blood donor)|James Harrison]], OAM, also known as the Man with the golden arm, is a blood plasma donor from Australia. He has made over 1000 donations throughout his lifetime, and these donations are estimated to have saved over two million unborn babies from the condition. Up to 2015, every batch of anti-D in Australia was made from his blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/09/health/james-harrison-golden-arm-blood-rhesus/index.html This man's blood has saved the lives of two million babies], Samantha Bresnahan, CNN, June 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfusion reaction==
Once a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a transfusion reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000154811 |pmid=21512623 |pmc=3076326 |title=Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions |journal=Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=346–53 |year=2008 |last1=Strobel |first1=Erwin }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors of her antibody status.

The '''search for extraterrestrial intelligence''' ('''SETI''') is a collective term for scientific searches for intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]], for example, monitoring [[electromagnetic radiation]] for signs of [[interstellar communication|transmissions]] from [[civilization]]s on other planets.&lt;ref name="Schenkel_2006"&gt;{{cite web | title=SETI Requires a Skeptical Reappraisal | last=Schenkel | first=Peter | publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |date=May 2006 | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/seti_requires_a_skeptical_reappraisal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Why SETI is science and UFOlogy is not | last=Moldwin | first=Mark | publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |date=November 2004 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T.

== History ==

===Early work===

In 1960, [[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Frank Drake]] performed the first modern SETI experiment, named "[[Project Ozma]]", after the [[Princess Ozma|Queen of Oz]] in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy books.&lt;ref&gt;"Science: Project Ozma," [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874057,00.html ''Time,'' April 18, 1960] (web version accessed 17 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Drake used a radio telescope {{convert|26|m}} in diameter at [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], to examine the stars [[Tau Ceti]] and [[Epsilon Eridani]] near the 1.420 [[hertz#SI multiples|gigahertz]] marker frequency, a region of the radio spectrum dubbed the "[[Water hole (radio)|water hole]]" due to its proximity to the [[hydrogen]] and [[hydroxyl radical]] spectral lines. A 400 kilohertz band around the marker frequency was scanned, using a single-channel receiver with a bandwidth of 100 hertz. He found nothing of interest.

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists took a strong interest in SETI during the 1960s and performed a number of searches with [[omnidirectional antenna]]s in the hope of picking up powerful radio signals. Soviet astronomer [[Iosif Shklovsky]] wrote the pioneering book in the field, ''Universe, Life, Intelligence'' (1962), which was expanded upon by American astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] as the best-selling book ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'' (1966).&lt;ref name="sagan_shklovskii"&gt;{{cite book | first = Carl | last = Sagan | author2=Iosif Shklovskii | title = Intelligent Life in the Universe | date = 1966 | isbn = 978-0-330-25125-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wow signal.jpg|thumb|left|The Wow! Signal&lt;br /&gt;Credit: The Ohio State University Radio Observatory and the North American AstroPhysical Observatory (NAAPO).]]
In the March 1955 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John D. Kraus]] described an idea to scan the [[cosmos]] for natural radio signals using a flat-plane radio telescope equipped with a parabolic [[reflector (antenna)|reflector]]. Within two years, his concept was approved for construction by [[Ohio State University]]. With a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]71,000 in grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], construction began on an {{convert|20|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip|0}} plot in [[Delaware, Ohio]]. This [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] telescope was called "Big Ear". Later, it began the world's first continuous SETI program, called the Ohio State University SETI program.

In 1971, [[NASA]] funded a SETI study that involved Drake, Bernard M. Oliver of [[Hewlett-Packard]] Corporation, and others. The resulting report proposed the construction of an Earth-based radio telescope array with 1,500 dishes known as "[[Project Cyclops]]". The price tag for the Cyclops array was US$10 billion. Cyclops was not built, but the report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Project Cyclops: A Design Study of a System for Detecting Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life | publisher=NASA | date=1971 | accessdate=October 12, 2014 | url=https://seti.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/19730010095_1973010095.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920204912/https://seti.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/19730010095_1973010095.pdf | archivedate=September 20, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis of much SETI work that followed.

The Ohio State SETI program gained fame on August 15, 1977, when [[Jerry Ehman]], a project volunteer, witnessed a startlingly strong signal received by the telescope. He quickly circled the indication on a printout and scribbled the exclamation "Wow!" in the margin. Dubbed the ''[[Wow! signal]]'', it is considered by some to be the best candidate for a radio signal from an artificial, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] source ever discovered, but it has not been detected again in several additional searches.&lt;ref name="gray_2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert H. Gray |year=2012 |title=The Elusive WOW: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |publisher=Palmer Square Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9839584-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentinel, META, and BETA===
In 1980, [[Carl Sagan]], [[Bruce C. Murray|Bruce Murray]], and [[Louis Friedman]] founded the U.S. [[The Planetary Society|Planetary Society]], partly as a vehicle for SETI studies.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628" /&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Harvard University]] physicist [[Paul Horowitz]] took the next step and proposed the design of a [[spectrum analyzer]] specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. Traditional desktop spectrum analyzers were of little use for this job, as they sampled frequencies using banks of analog filters and so were restricted in the number of channels they could acquire. However, modern integrated-circuit [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) technology could be used to build [[autocorrelation]] receivers to check far more channels. This work led in 1981 to a portable spectrum analyzer named "Suitcase SETI" that had a capacity of 131,000 narrow band channels. After field tests that lasted into 1982, Suitcase SETI was put into use in 1983 with the {{convert|26|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} Harvard/Smithsonian radio telescope at [[Oak Ridge Observatory]] in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]]. This project was named "Sentinel" and continued into 1985.

Even 131,000 channels were not enough to search the sky in detail at a fast rate, so Suitcase SETI was followed in 1985 by Project "META", for "Megachannel Extra-Terrestrial Assay". The META spectrum analyzer had a capacity of 8.4 million channels and a channel resolution of 0.05 hertz. An important feature of META was its use of frequency [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] to distinguish between signals of terrestrial and extraterrestrial origin. The project was led by Horowitz with the help of the Planetary Society, and was partly funded by movie maker [[Steven Spielberg]]. A second such effort, META II, was begun in [[Argentina]] in 1990, to search the southern sky. META II is still in operation, after an equipment upgrade in 1996.

The follow-on to META was named "BETA", for "Billion-channel Extraterrestrial Assay", and it commenced observation on October 30, 1995. The heart of BETA's processing capability consisted of 63 dedicated [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) engines, each capable of performing a 2&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;-point [[Complex number#Signal analysis|complex]] FFTs in two seconds, and 21 general-purpose [[IBM PC compatible|personal computers]] equipped with custom [[digital signal processing]] boards. This allowed BETA to receive 250 million simultaneous channels with a resolution of 0.5 hertz per channel. It scanned through the microwave [[spectrum]] from 1.400 to 1.720 gigahertz in eight hops, with two seconds of observation per hop. An important capability of the BETA search was rapid and automatic re-observation of candidate signals, achieved by observing the sky with two adjacent beams, one slightly to the east and the other slightly to the west. A successful candidate signal would first transit the east beam, and then the west beam and do so with a speed consistent with [[Earth]]'s [[sidereal time|sidereal]] rotation rate. A third receiver observed the horizon to veto signals of obvious terrestrial origin. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/seti/3304561.html |title=SETI Searches Today |author=Alan M. MacRobert  |date=29 March 2009|publisher=Sky and Telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forced the BETA project to cease operation.

In 1978, the NASA SETI program had been heavily criticized by Senator [[William Proxmire]], and funding for SETI research was removed from the NASA budget by Congress in 1981;&lt;ref name="garber"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1999JBIS...52....3G|title=Searching for Good Science - the Cancellation of NASA's SETI Program|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=52|issue=1|pages=3|author1=Garber|first1=S. J.|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, funding was restored in 1982, after [[Carl Sagan]] talked with Proxmire and convinced him of the program's value.&lt;ref name="garber" /&gt;  In 1992, the U.S. government funded an operational SETI program, in the form of the NASA Microwave Observing Program (MOP). MOP was planned as a long-term effort to conduct a general survey of the sky and also carry out targeted searches of 800 specific nearby stars. MOP was to be performed by radio antennas associated with the [[NASA Deep Space Network]], as well as the {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} radio telescope of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] at Green Bank, West Virginia and the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} radio telescope at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico. The signals were to be analyzed by spectrum analyzers, each with a capacity of 15 million channels. These spectrum analyzers could be grouped together to obtain greater capacity. Those used in the targeted search had a bandwidth of 1 hertz per channel, while those used in the sky survey had a bandwidth of 30 hertz per channel.

MOP drew the attention of the [[United States Congress]], where the program was ridiculed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/us/ear-to-the-universe-is-plugged-by-budget-cutters.html?pagewanted=1/ | work=The New York Times | title=Ear to the Universe Is Plugged by Budget Cutters | date=October 7, 1993 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and canceled one year after its start.&lt;ref name="garber" /&gt; SETI advocates continued without government funding, and in 1995 the nonprofit SETI Institute of [[Mountain View, California]] resurrected the MOP program under the name of Project "Phoenix", backed by private sources of funding. [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]], under the direction of [[Jill Tarter]], is a continuation of the targeted search program from MOP and studies roughly 1,000 nearby [[Sun]]-like stars. From 1995 through March 2004, Phoenix conducted observations at the {{convert|64|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes radio telescope]] in [[Australia]], the {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} radio telescope of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The project observed the equivalent of 800 stars over the available channels in the frequency range from 1200 to 3000&amp;nbsp;MHz. The search was sensitive enough to pick up transmitters with 1&amp;nbsp;GW [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power|EIRP]] to a distance of about 200 [[light-year]]s. According to Prof. Tarter, in 2012 it costs around "$2 million per year to keep SETI research going at the SETI Institute" and approximately 10 times that to support "all kinds of SETI activity around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/15803-jill-tarter-seti-search-retirement-qanda.html| work=Space.com | title=Searching for Intelligent Aliens: Q&amp;A with SETI Astronomer Jill Tarter | date=May 22, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many radio frequencies penetrate Earth's atmosphere quite well, and this led to [[radio telescope]]s that investigate the cosmos using large radio antennas. Furthermore, human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation as a byproduct of communications such as television and radio. These signals would be easy to recognize as artificial due to their repetitive nature and narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]]. If this is typical, one way of discovering an extraterrestrial civilization might be to detect artificial radio emissions from a location outside the [[Solar System]].

Many international radio telescopes are currently being used for radio SETI searches, including the [[Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR) in Europe, the [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA) in Australia, and the [[Lovell Telescope]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="SR-20150929"&gt;{{cite web |last=Siemion |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Siemion |title=Prepared Statement by Andrew Siemion - Hearing on Astrobiology Status Report - House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=47887 |date=September 29, 2015 |work=SpaceRef.com |accessdate=October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allen Telescope Array===
{{Main|Allen Telescope Array}}
The SETI Institute collaborated with the [[Radio Astronomy Laboratory]] at the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] to develop a specialized radio telescope array for SETI studies, something like a mini-cyclops array. Formerly known as the One Hectare Telescope (1HT), the concept was renamed the "Allen Telescope Array" (ATA) after the project's benefactor [[Paul Allen]]. Its sensitivity would be equivalent to a single large dish more than 100 meters in diameter if completed. Presently, the array under construction has 42 dishes at the [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]] in rural northern California.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&amp;b=179146 | title = Allen Telescope Array General Overview | publisher = [[SETI Institute]] | accessdate = 2006-06-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060428102322/http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&amp;b=179146 |archivedate = 2006-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=Jack |display-authors=etal.|title=The Allen Telescope Array: The First Widefield, Panchromatic, Snapshot Radio Camera for Radio Astronomy and SETI|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=August 2009|volume=97|issue=8|pages=1438–1447|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2009.2017103|bibcode=2009IEEEP..97.1438W |arxiv = 0904.0762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full array (ATA-350) is planned to consist of 350 or more offset-[[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian]] radio dishes, each {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. These dishes are the largest producible with commercially available satellite television dish technology. The ATA was planned for a 2007 completion date, at a very modest cost of US$25 million. The SETI Institute provided money for building the ATA while University of California, Berkeley designed the telescope and provided operational funding. The first portion of the array (ATA-42) became operational in October 2007 with 42 antennas. The DSP system planned for ATA-350 is extremely ambitious. Completion of the full 350 element array will depend on funding and the technical results from ATA-42.

ATA-42 (ATA) is designed to allow multiple observers simultaneous access to the interferometer output at the same time. Typically, the ATA snapshot imager (used for astronomical surveys and SETI) is run in parallel with the beam forming system (used primarily for SETI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.857860 |arxiv=1010.1567|chapter=Commensal observing with the Allen Telescope array: Software command and control |title=Proceedings of the SPIE|volume=7740|pages=77400Z|series=Software and Cyberinfrastructure for Astronomy|year=2010|last1=Gutierrez-Kraybill|first1=Colby |display-authors=etal.|bibcode=2010SPIE.7740E..0ZG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ATA also supports observations in multiple synthesized pencil beams at once, through a technique known as "multibeaming".

From 2007-2015, ATA has identified hundreds of millions of technological signals.

{{Main|SERENDIP}}
SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) is a SETI program launched in 1979 by the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]].&lt;ref name="SERENDIP"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://seti.berkeley.edu/SERENDIP.html | title = SERENDIP | publisher = [[UC Berkeley]] | accessdate = 2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; SERENDIP takes advantage of ongoing "mainstream" [[radio telescope]] observations as a "[[wikt:piggybacking|piggy-back]]" or "[[commensal]]" program, using large radio telescopes including the NRAO 90m telescope at Green Bank and the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo 305m telescope]]. Rather than having its own observation program, SERENDIP analyzes [[Deep Sky|deep space]] radio telescope data that it obtains while other [[astronomer]]s are using the telescopes.

The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP V.v, was installed at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in June 2009 and is currently operational. The digital back-end instrument is an [[FPGA]]-based 128 million-channel digital spectrometer covering 200&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth.  It takes data commensally with the seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naic.edu/alfa/|title=ALFA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ALFA). The program has found around 400 suspicious signals, but there is not enough data to prove that they belong to [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnfm1.sai.msu.ru/SETI/koi/articles/lmg%20seti%20poisk/1.9.htm|title=Л.

== Community SETI projects ==

=== SETI@home ===
{{Main|SETI@home}}

SETI@home was conceived by David Gedye along with Craig Kasnoff and is a popular volunteer [[distributed computing]] project that was launched by the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in May 1999. It was originally funded by [[The Planetary Society]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], and later by the state of [[California]]. The project is run by director [[David P. Anderson]] and chief scientist [[Dan Werthimer]]. Any individual can become involved with SETI research by downloading the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) software program, attaching to the SETI@home project, and allowing the program to run as a background process that uses idle computer power. The SETI@home program itself runs signal analysis on a "work unit" of data recorded from the central 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide band of the SERENDIP IV instrument. After computation on the work unit is complete, the results are then automatically reported back to SETI@home [[Server (computing)|server]]s at University of California, Berkeley. By June 28, 2009, the SETI@home project had over 180,000 active participants volunteering a total of over 290,000 computers. These computers give SETI@home an average computational power of 617 [[FLOPS|teraFLOPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SETI@home&amp;nbsp;— Credit Overview | last=de Zutter | first=Willy | publisher=BOINCstats | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=sah | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215135415/http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=sah | archivedate=December 15, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 [[radio source SHGb02+14a]] set off speculation in the media that a signal had been detected but researchers noted the frequency drifted rapidly and the detection on three SETI@home computers fell within [[random chance]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |publisher = [[BBC News]] |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3621608.stm |title = Astronomers deny ET signal report |date = 2004-09-02 |first = David |last = Whitehouse |accessdate = 24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher = [[The Planetary Society]] |title = SETI@home Leaders Deny Reports of Likely Extraterrestrial Signal |url = http://planetary.org/news/2004/0902_SETIhome_Leaders_Deny_Reports_of.html |date = 2004-09-02 |last = Alexander |first = Amir |accessdate = 2006-06-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074250/http://planetary.org/news/2004/0902_SETIhome_Leaders_Deny_Reports_of.html |archivedate = 2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, after 10 years of data collection, SETI@home has listened to that one frequency at every point of over 67 percent of the sky observable from Arecibo with at least three scans (out of the goal of nine scans), which covers about 20 percent of the full celestial sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M.

===SETI Net===
SETI Net is a private search system created by a single individual. It is closely affiliated with the SETI League and is one of the project Argus stations (DM12jw).

The SETI Net station consists of off-the-shelf, consumer-grade electronics to minimize cost and to allow this design to be replicated as simply as possible. It has a 3-meter parabolic antenna that can be directed in azimuth and elevation, an LNA that covers the 1420&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum, a receiver to reproduce the wideband audio, and a standard [[personal computer]] as the control device and for deploying the detection algorithms.

The antenna can be pointed and locked to one sky location, enabling the system to integrate on it for long periods. Currently the [[Wow! signal|Wow!]] signal area is being monitored when it is above the horizon. All search data are collected and made available on the Internet archive.

SETI Net started operation in the early 1980s as a way to learn about the science of the search, and has developed several software packages for the amateur SETI community. It has provided an astronomical clock, a file manager to keep track of SETI data files, a spectrum analyzer optimized for amateur SETI, remote control of the station from the Internet, and other packages.

=== The SETI League and Project Argus ===
Founded in 1994 in response to the United States Congress cancellation of the NASA SETI program, The SETI League, Inc. is a membership-supported nonprofit organization with 1,500 members in 62 countries. This grass-roots alliance of amateur and professional radio astronomers is headed by executive director emeritus [[H. Paul Shuch]], the engineer credited with developing the world's first commercial home satellite TV receiver. Many SETI League members are licensed radio amateurs and microwave experimenters. Others are digital signal processing experts and computer enthusiasts.

The SETI League pioneered the conversion of backyard satellite TV dishes {{convert|abbr=on|3|to(-)|5|m|ft|0}} in diameter into research-grade radio telescopes of modest sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Chown 28"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chown |first=Marcus |journal=New Scientist |title=The Alien Spotters |date=April 1997 |page=28 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420784.500-the-alien-spotters.html |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization concentrates on coordinating a global network of small, amateur-built radio telescopes under Project Argus, an all-sky survey seeking to achieve real-time coverage of the entire sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/argus/|title=The SETI League, Inc.: Project Argus|author=H. Paul Shuch |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Argus was conceived as a continuation of the all-sky survey component of the late NASA SETI program (the targeted search having been continued by the SETI Institute's Project Phoenix). There are currently 143 Project Argus radio telescopes operating in 27 countries. Project Argus instruments typically exhibit sensitivity on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; Watts/square metre, or roughly equivalent to that achieved by the Ohio State University Big Ear radio telescope in 1977, when it detected the landmark "Wow!" candidate signal.

The name "Argus" derives from the [[Argus Panoptes|mythical Greek guard-beast]] who had 100 eyes, and could see in all directions at once. In the SETI context, the name has been used for radio telescopes in fiction (Arthur C. Clarke, ''"[[Imperial Earth]]"''; Carl Sagan, ''"[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]"''), was the name initially used for the NASA study ultimately known as "Cyclops," and is the name given to an omnidirectional radio telescope design being developed at the Ohio State University.

==Optical experiments==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermi paradox]] --&gt;
While most SETI sky searches have studied the radio spectrum, some SETI researchers have considered the possibility that alien civilizations might be using powerful [[laser]]s for interstellar communications at optical wavelengths. The idea was first suggested by R. N. Schwartz and [[Charles Hard Townes]] in a 1961 paper published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "Interstellar and Interplanetary Communication by Optical Masers". However, the 1971 Cyclops study discounted the possibility of optical SETI, reasoning that construction of a laser system that could outshine the bright central star of a remote star system would be too difficult. In 1983, Townes published a detailed study of the idea in the United States journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'',&lt;ref name="Townes1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townes|first1=C. H.|title=At what wavelengths should we search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=80|issue=4|year=1983|pages=1147–1151|doi=10.1073/pnas.80.4.1147|pmid=16593279|bibcode = 1983PNAS...80.1147T |pmc=393547}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with widespread agreement by the SETI community.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

There are two problems with optical SETI.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The first problem is that lasers are highly "monochromatic", that is, they emit light only on one frequency, making it troublesome to figure out what frequency to look for. However, emitting light in narrow pulses results in a broad spectrum of emission; the spread in frequency becomes higher as the pulse width becomes narrower, making it easier to detect an emission.

The other problem is that while radio transmissions can be broadcast in all directions, lasers are highly directional. Interstellar gas and dust is almost transparent to near infrared, so these signals can be seen from greater distances, but the extraterrestrial laser signals would need to be transmitted in the direction of Earth in order to be detected.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2015-03-extraterrestrial-intelligence-realms.html Search for extraterrestrial intelligence extends to new realms]. University of California. Published by ''PhysOrg''. 20 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical SETI supporters have conducted paper studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Exers, Ronald| editor2 = D. Cullers| editor3 = J. Billingham| editor4 = L. Scheffer | title = SETI 2020: A Roadmap for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence | date = 2003 | publisher = SETI Press | isbn = 978-0-9666335-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the effectiveness of using contemporary high-energy lasers and a ten-meter diameter mirror as an interstellar beacon. The analysis shows that an infrared pulse from a laser, focused into a narrow beam by such a mirror, would appear thousands of times brighter than the Sun to a distant civilization in the beam's line of fire. The Cyclops study proved incorrect in suggesting a laser beam would be inherently hard to see.

Such a system could be made to automatically steer itself through a target list, sending a pulse to each target at a constant rate. This would allow targeting of all Sun-like stars within a distance of 100 light-years. The studies have also described an automatic laser pulse detector system with a low-cost, two-meter mirror made of carbon composite materials, focusing on an array of light detectors. This automatic detector system could perform sky surveys to detect laser flashes from civilizations attempting contact.

Several optical SETI experiments are now in progress. A Harvard-Smithsonian group that includes Paul Horowitz designed a laser detector and mounted it on Harvard's {{convert|155|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} optical telescope. This telescope is currently being used for a more conventional star survey, and the optical SETI survey is "[[wikt:piggyback|piggyback]]ing" on that effort. Between October 1998 and November 1999, the survey inspected about 2,500 stars. Nothing that resembled an intentional laser signal was detected, but efforts continue. The Harvard-Smithsonian group is now working with [[Princeton University]] to mount a similar detector system on Princeton's 91-centimeter (36-inch) telescope. The Harvard and Princeton telescopes will be "ganged" to track the same targets at the same time, with the intent being to detect the same signal in both locations as a means of reducing errors from detector noise.

The Harvard-Smithsonian SETI group led by Professor [[Paul Horowitz]] built a dedicated all-sky optical survey system along the lines of that described above, featuring a 1.8-meter (72-inch) telescope. The new optical SETI survey telescope is being set up at the [[Oak Ridge Observatory]] in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]].

The University of California, Berkeley, home of [[SERENDIP]] and [[SETI@home]], is also conducting optical SETI searches and collaborates with the [[NIROSETI]] program. The optical SETI program at Breakthrough Listen is being directed by [[Geoffrey Marcy]], an extrasolar planet hunter, and it involves examination of records of spectra taken during [[extrasolar planet]] hunts for a continuous, rather than pulsed, laser signal. This survey uses the [[Automated Planet Finder]] 2.4-m telescope at the [[Lick Observatory]], situated on the summit of Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose, California, USA.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;Steven S. Vogt et al., ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6684 APF - The Lick Observatory Automated Planet Finder]'', 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other Berkeley optical SETI effort is being pursued by the Harvard-Smithsonian group and is being directed by [[Dan Werthimer]] of Berkeley, who built the laser detector for the Harvard-Smithsonian group. This survey uses a 76-centimeter (30-inch) automated telescope at [[Leuschner Observatory]] and an older laser detector built by Werthimer.

In May 2017, astronomers reported studies related to laser light emissions from stars, as a way of detecting technology-related signals from an [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|alien civilization]]. The reported studies included [[KIC 8462852]], an oddly dimming star in which its unusual starlight fluctuations may be the result of interference by an artificial megastructure, such as a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], made by such a civilization. No evidence was found for technology-related signals from KIC 8462852 in the studies.&lt;ref name="ATL-20170417"&gt;{{cite web |last=Koren |first=Marina |title=Searching the Skies for Alien Laser Beams - A new study scanned 5,600 stars for tiny emissions of light, which may be the best way for an extraterrestrial civilization to signal its existence. |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/04/laser-seti-extraterrestrial/523104/ |date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=3 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AXV-201704"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tellis |first1=Nathaniel K. |last2=Marcy |first2=Geoffrey W. |title=A Search for Laser Emission with Megawatt Thresholds from 5600 FGKM Stars |date=April 2017 |arxiv=1704.02535 |doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa6d12 |volume=153 |issue=6 |journal=The Astronomical Journal |page=251|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TAJ-201770512"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tellis |first1=Nathaniel K. |last2=Marcy |first2=Geoffrey W. |title=A Search for Laser Emission with Megawatt Thresholds from 5600 FGKM Stars |date=12 May 2017 |journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume=153 |number=6 |doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa6d12 |page=251|arxiv = 1704.02535 |bibcode = 2017AJ....153..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamma-ray bursts==
[[Gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) are candidates for extraterrestrial communication. These high-energy bursts are observed about once per day and originate throughout the observable universe. SETI currently omits gamma ray frequencies in their monitoring and analysis because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and difficult to detect with ground-based receivers. In addition, the wide burst bandwidths pose a serious analysis challenge for modern digital signal processing systems. Still, the continued mysteries surrounding gamma-ray bursts have encouraged hypotheses invoking extraterrestrials. John A. Ball from the MIT [[Haystack Observatory]] suggests that an advanced civilization that has reached a [[technological singularity]] would be capable of transmitting a two-millisecond pulse encoding {{val|1|e=18}} bits of information. This is "comparable to the estimated total information content of Earth's biosystem—[[gene]]s and [[meme]]s and including all libraries and computer media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ball, J.A. | date = 1995 | title = Gamma-Ray Bursts: The ETI Hypothesis | url = http://www.haystack.mit.edu/hay/staff/jball/grbeti.ps |format=PostScript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for extraterrestrial artifacts==
The possibility of using interstellar messenger probes in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was first suggested by [[Ronald N. Bracewell]] in 1960 (see [[Bracewell probe]]), and the technical feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the British Interplanetary Society's starship study [[Project Daedalus]] in 1978. Starting in 1979, [[Robert Freitas]] advanced arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Interstellar probes&amp;nbsp;— A new approach to SETI | last=Freitas Jr. | first=Robert A. | date=1980 |accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/InterstellarProbesJBIS1980.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Debunking the Myths of Interstellar Probes | last=Freitas Jr. | first=Robert A | date=1983 | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ProbeMyths1983.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Case for Interstellar Probes | last=Freitas Jr. | first=Robert A. | date=1983 |accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the proposition that physical space-probes are a superior mode of interstellar communication to radio signals. See [[Voyager Golden Record]].

In recognition that any sufficiently advanced interstellar probe in the vicinity of Earth could easily monitor the terrestrial [[Internet]], [[Invitation to ETI]] was established by Prof. [[Allen Tough]] in 1996, as a Web-based SETI experiment inviting such spacefaring probes to establish contact with humanity. The project's 100 Signatories includes prominent physical, biological, and social scientists, as well as artists, educators, entertainers, philosophers and futurists. Prof. [[H. Paul Shuch]], executive director emeritus of [[The SETI League]], serves as the project's Principal Investigator.

Inscribing a message in matter and transporting it to an interstellar destination can be enormously more energy efficient than communication using electromagnetic waves if delays larger than light transit time can be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~crose/papers/nature.pdf |title=Inscribed matter as an energy efficient means of communication with an extraterrestrial civilization |author=C.

Much like the "preferred frequency" concept in SETI radio beacon theory, the Earth-Moon or Sun-Earth [[libration]] orbits&lt;ref name="Earth-Moon"/&gt; might therefore constitute the most universally convenient parking places for automated extraterrestrial spacecraft exploring arbitrary stellar systems. A viable long-term SETI program may be founded upon a search for these objects.

In 1979, Freitas and Valdes conducted a photographic search of the vicinity of the Earth-Moon triangular libration points {{L4}} and {{L5}}, and of the solar-synchronized positions in the associated halo orbits, seeking possible orbiting extraterrestrial interstellar probes, but found nothing to a detection limit of about 14th magnitude.&lt;ref name="Earth-Moon"&gt;{{cite web | title=A Search for Natural or Artificial Objects Located at the Earth-Moon Libration Points | last1=Freitas Jr. | first1=Robert A | last2=Valdes | first2=Francisco | date=1980 | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SearchIcarus1980.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conducted a second, more comprehensive photographic search for probes in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Search for Objects near the Earth-Moon Lagrangian Points | last1=Valdes | first1=Francisco | last2=Freitas Jr. | first2=Robert A | date=1983 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SearchIcarus1983.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; that examined the five Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian positions]] and included the solar-synchronized positions in the stable L4/L5 libration orbits, the potentially stable nonplanar orbits near L1/L2, Earth-Moon {{L3}}, and also {{L2}} in the Sun-Earth system. Again no extraterrestrial probes were found to limiting magnitudes of 17–19th magnitude near L3/L4/L5, 10–18th magnitude for {{L1}}/{{L2}}, and 14–16th magnitude for Sun-Earth {{L2}}.

In June 1983, Valdes and Freitas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Search for the Tritium Hyperfine Line from Nearby Stars | last1=Valdes | first1=Francisco | last2=Freitas Jr. | first2=Robert A | date=1986 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TritiumSearch1986.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the 26 m radiotelescope at Hat Creek Radio Observatory to search for the tritium hyperfine line at 1516&amp;nbsp;MHz from 108 assorted astronomical objects, with emphasis on 53 nearby stars including all visible stars within a 20 light-year radius. The tritium frequency was deemed highly attractive for SETI work because (1) the isotope is cosmically rare, (2) the tritium hyperfine line is centered in the SETI [[waterhole region]] of the terrestrial microwave window, and (3) in addition to beacon signals, tritium hyperfine emission may occur as a byproduct of extensive [[nuclear fusion]] energy production by extraterrestrial civilizations. The wideband- and narrowband-channel observations achieved sensitivities of 5–14 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; W/m²/channel and 0.7-2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; W/m²/channel, respectively, but no detections were made.

==Technosignatures==
{{see also|Technosignature|Megascale engineering}}
Technosignatures, including all signs of technology with the exception of the interstellar radio messages that define traditional SETI, are a recent avenue in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628" /&gt; Technosignatures may originate from various sources, from megastructures such as [[Dyson sphere]]s and [[Space mirror (geoengineering)|space mirrors]] or [[Space sunshade|space shaders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korpela |first=Eric |arxiv=1505.07399 |title=Modeling Indications of Technology in Planetary Transit Light Curves -- Dark-side illumination |date=2015 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/809/2/139 |bibcode=2015ApJ...809..139K |volume=809 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the atmospheric contamination created by an industrial civilization,&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}&lt;/ref&gt; or city lights on extrasolar planets, and may be detectable in the future with large [[hypertelescope]]s.&lt;ref name=colossus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21480-extraterrestrial-civilization-heat-seeking-telescope.html |title=Heat-Seeking, Alien-Hunting Telescope Could Be Ready In 5 Years |publisher=Space.com |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technosignatures can be divided into three broad categories: [[astroengineering]] projects, signals of planetary origin, and spacecraft within and outside the [[Solar System]].

An astroengineering installation such as a [[Dyson sphere]], designed to convert all of the incident radiation of its host star into energy, could be detected through the observation of an infrared excess from a [[solar analog]] star,&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date= 1960|url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM|title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= Freemann J.

Another hypothetical form of astroengineering, the [[Shkadov thruster]], moves its host star by reflecting some of the star's light back on itself, and would be detected by observing if its [[transit (astronomy)|transit]]s across the star abruptly end with the thruster in front.&lt;ref name=Villard2013&gt;{{Cite web | title = Alien 'Star Engine' Detectable in Exoplanet Data? | url = http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/planet-searches-might-stumble-across-an-alien-stellar-engine-130625.htm | date = 2013 | author = Villard, Ray | accessdate = 2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asteroid mining]] within the Solar System is also a detectable technosignature of the first kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1103.5369|author1=Duncan Forgan|author2=Martin Elvis|title=Extrasolar Asteroid Mining as Forensic Evidence for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=307|date=2011|doi=10.1017/S1473550411000127|bibcode=2011IJAsB..10..307F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual extrasolar planets can be analyzed for signs of technology. [[Avi Loeb]] of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] has proposed that persistent light signals on the night side of an exoplanet can be an indication of the presence of cities and an advanced civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2011/11/03/SETI-search-urged-to-look-for-city-lights/UPI-89301320361336/#ixzz2HRkOcctY |title=SETI search urged to look for city lights |publisher=UPI.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Planets: Formation, Detection and Dynamics Rudolf Dvorak, page 14 John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the excess infrared radiation&lt;ref name=colossus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Povich |first=Matthew |url=http://astrobiology.com/2014/08/infrared-search-for-extraterrestrial-civilizations-with-large-energy-supplies.html |title=Infrared Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations with Large Energy Supplies |work=astro-ph.GA |publisher=Astrobiology Web |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and chemicals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Satellite_sniffs_out_chemical_traces_of_atmospheric_pollution |title=Satellite sniffs out chemical traces of atmospheric pollution / Observing the Earth / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21470-saturn-moon-titan-haze-cassini.html |title=Haze on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Similar to Earth's Pollution |publisher=Space.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by various industrial processes or [[terraforming]] efforts&lt;ref name=choi-2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/18624-alien-life-search-hairspray.html |title=Alien Hairspray May Help Us Find E.T. |publisher=Space.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; may point to intelligence.

Light and heat detected from planets need to be distinguished from natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of civilization on a planet. However, as argued by the Colossus team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-colossus.com/press/2013_06_Astronomy_ETC |title=How to Find ET with Infrared Light |publisher=Astronomy.com |date=June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190959/http://www.the-colossus.com/press/2013_06_Astronomy_ETC |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
a civilization heat signature should be within a "comfortable" temperature range, like terrestrial [[urban heat islands]], i.e. only a few degrees warmer than the planet itself. In contrast, such natural sources as wild fires, volcanoes, etc. are significantly hotter, so they will be well distinguished by their maximum flux at a different wavelength.

Extraterrestrial craft are another target in the search for technosignatures. [[Magnetic sail]] [[interstellar spacecraft]] should be detectable over thousands of light-years of distance through the [[synchrotron radiation]] they would produce through interaction with the [[interstellar medium]]; other interstellar spacecraft designs may be detectable at more modest distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Detection of Extraterrestrial Civilizations via the Spectral Signature of Advanced Interstellar Spacecraft | publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | author=Zubrin, Robert | editor=Shostak, Seth | booktitle=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | date=1995 | conference=Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | pages=487&amp;ndash;496 | bibcode=1995ASPC...74..487Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, robotic probes within the Solar System are also being sought out with optical and radio searches.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998 |url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a sufficiently advanced civilization, hyper energetic neutrinos from Planck scale accelerators should be detectable at a distance of many Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1503.01509|title=SETI at Planck Energy: When Particle Physicists Become Cosmic Engineers|author=Brian C. Lacki|year=2015|class=(astro-ph.HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermi paradox==
{{Main|Fermi paradox}}
Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] suggested in the 1950s that if technologically advanced civilizations are common in the universe, then they should be detectable in one way or another. (According to those who were there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Where is everybody?", An account of Fermi's question | last=Jones | first=Eric | publisher=Los Alamas National Laboratory |date=March 1985 | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/la-10311-ms.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi either asked "Where are they?" or "Where is everybody?")

The Fermi paradox is commonly understood as asking why extraterrestrials have not visited Earth,&lt;ref name=Zuckerman&gt;Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart (editors), ''Extraterrestrials: Where Are They?''  Elsevier Science &amp; Technology Books (1982), {{ISBN|9780080263427}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the same reasoning applies to the question of why signals from extraterrestrials have not been heard.  The SETI version of the question is sometimes referred to as "the Great Silence".

The Fermi paradox can be stated more completely as follows:
{{quote |The size and age of the universe incline us to believe that many technologically advanced civilizations must exist. However, this belief seems logically inconsistent with our lack of observational evidence to support it. Either (1) the initial assumption is incorrect and technologically advanced intelligent life is much rarer than we believe, or (2) our current observations are incomplete and we simply have not detected them yet, or (3) our search methodologies are flawed and we are not searching for the correct indicators.}}

There are multiple explanations proposed for the Fermi paradox,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Webb, ''Where is Everybody? Fifty Solutions to Fermi's Paradox,'' Copernicus, 2002 edition, 978-0387955018&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from analyses suggesting that intelligent life is rare (the "[[Rare Earth hypothesis]]"), to analyses suggesting that although extraterrestrial civilizations may be common, they would not communicate, or would not travel across interstellar distances.

Science writer [[Timothy Ferris]] has posited that since galactic societies are most likely only transitory, an obvious solution is an interstellar communications network, or a type of library consisting mostly of automated systems. They would store the cumulative knowledge of vanished civilizations and communicate that knowledge through the galaxy. Ferris calls this the "Interstellar Internet", with the various automated systems acting as network "servers".  If such an Interstellar Internet exists, the hypothesis states, communications between servers are mostly through narrow-band, highly directional radio or laser links. Intercepting such signals is, as discussed earlier, very difficult. However, the network could maintain some broadcast nodes in hopes of making contact with new civilizations.

Although somewhat dated in terms of "information culture" arguments, not to mention the obvious technological problems of a system that could work effectively for billions of years and requires multiple lifeforms agreeing on certain basics of communications technologies, this hypothesis is actually testable (see below).

A significant problem is the vastness of space. Despite piggybacking on the world's most sensitive radio telescope, [[Charles Stuart Bowyer]] said, the instrument could not detect random radio noise emanating from a civilization like ours, which has been leaking radio and TV signals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eavesdropping on the Earth | publisher=astrosociety.org | date=1979 | url=https://visns.neocities.org/EotE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for less than 100 years. For [[SERENDIP]] and most other SETI projects to detect a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization, the civilization would have to be beaming a powerful signal directly at us. It also means that Earth civilization will only be detectable within a distance of 100 light-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SETI Insentitive To Earth-like Signals | publisher=spacedaily.com | date=1998 | accessdate=February 8, 2013 | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/seti-98a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post detection disclosure protocol==
The [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA) has a long-standing SETI Permanent Study Group (SPSG, formerly called the IAA SETI Committee), which addresses matters of SETI [[science]], [[technology]], and [[International relations|international policy]]. The SPSG meets in conjunction with the [[International Astronautical Congress|International Astronautical Congress (IAC)]] held annually at different locations around the world, and sponsors two SETI Symposia at each IAC. In 2005, the IAA established the SETI: Post-Detection Science and Technology Taskgroup (Chairman, Professor [[Paul Davies]]) "to act as a Standing Committee to be available to be called on at any time to advise and consult on questions stemming from the discovery of a putative signal of extraterrestrial intelligent (ETI) origin."

However, the protocols mentioned apply only to radio SETI rather than for METI ([[Active SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Nick [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39675346/ns/technology_and_science/t/what-do-if-we-find-extraterrestrial-life/#.TsthMz3z3BI What to do if we find extraterrestrial life? Who gets notified? Do we reply? Experts are already arguing] msnbc.com 10/18/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The intention for METI is covered under the SETI charter "Declaration of Principles Concerning Sending Communications with Extraterrestrial Intelligence".

On October 2000 astronomers [[Iván Almár]] and [[Jill Tarter]] presented a paper to The SETI Permanent Study Group in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]] which proposed a scale (modelled after the [[Torino scale]]) which is an ordinal scale between zero and ten that quantifies the impact of any public announcement regarding evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence;&lt;ref name="Rio scale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avsport.org/IAA/rioscale.htm | title=The Rio Scale | publisher=International Academy of Astronautics | accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Rio scale''' has since inspired the 2005 [[San Marino Scale]] (in regard to the risks of transmissions from Earth) and the 2010 [[London Scale]] (in regard to the detection of extraterrestrial life)&lt;ref name="The London Scale"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576511001810 | title=SETI and Astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale | date=November–December 2011 | accessdate=2016-08-29 | author=Iván Almár | doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036 | bibcode=2011AcAau..69..899A | volume=69 | issue=9–10 | journal=Acta Astronautica | pages=899–904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rio Scale itself was revised in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-scientists-rio-scale-alien-encounters.html Scientists revise the Rio Scale for reported alien encounters.

The SETI Institute does not officially recognize the [[Wow! signal]] as of extraterrestrial origin (as it was unable to be verified). The SETI Institute has also publicly denied that the candidate signal [[Radio source SHGb02+14a]] is of extraterrestrial origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[The Planetary Society]] | title = SETI@home Leaders Deny Reports of Likely Extraterrestrial Signal | url = http://planetary.org/news/2004/0902_SETIhome_Leaders_Deny_Reports_of.html | date = 2004-09-02 | last = Alexander | first = Amir | accessdate = 2006-06-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074250/http://planetary.org/news/2004/0902_SETIhome_Leaders_Deny_Reports_of.html | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3621608.stm | title = Astronomers deny ET signal report | date = 2004-09-02 | first = David | last = Whitehouse | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though full details of the signal, such as its exact location have never been disclosed to the public.{{speculation inline}} Although other volunteering projects such as [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] credit users for discoveries, there is currently no crediting or early notification by [[SETI@Home]] following the discovery of a signal.

Some people, including [[Steven M. Greer]],&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Ashlee [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/31/signals_seti/ SETI urged to fess up over alien signals] The Register 31 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed cynicism that the general public might not be informed in the event of a genuine discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence due to significant vested interests. Some, such as [[Bruce Jakosky]]&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Lee [The Meaning of Life http://nai.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_print.cfm?ID=138] NASA July 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; have also argued that the official disclosure of extraterrestrial life may have far reaching and as yet undetermined implications for society, particularly for the world's [[religion]]s.

== Active SETI ==
{{main|Active SETI}}
[[Active SETI]], also known as messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI), consists of sending signals into space in the hope that they will be picked up by an alien intelligence.

=== Realized interstellar radio message projects ===
In November 1974, a largely symbolic attempt was made at the Arecibo Observatory to send a message to other worlds. Known as the [[Arecibo Message]], it was sent towards the [[globular cluster]] [[Messier 13|M13]], which is 25,000 light-years from Earth. Further IRMs [[Cosmic Call]], [[Teen Age Message]], [[Cosmic Call 2]], and [[A Message From Earth]] were transmitted in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2008 from the [[Evpatoria]] Planetary Radar.

=== Debate ===
{{see also |Active SETI#Potential risk}}
Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], in his book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', suggests that "alerting" extraterrestrial intelligences to our existence is foolhardy, citing mankind's history of treating his fellow man harshly in meetings of civilizations with a significant technology gap. He suggests, in view of this history, that we "lay low". In one response to Hawking, in September 2016, astronomer [[Seth Shostak]], allays such concerns.&lt;ref name="TG-20160927"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shostak |first=Seth |authorlink=Seth Shostak |title=Why Stephen Hawking is light years from the truth about ‘dangerous aliens’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/stephen-hawking-light-years-dangerous-aliens |date=27 September 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=28 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Jill Tarter]] also disagrees with Hawking, arguing that aliens developed and long-lived enough to communicate and travel across interstellar distances would have evolved a cooperative and less violent intelligence. She does think it is too soon for humans to attempt active SETI and that humans should be more advanced technologically first but keep listening in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orwig|first1=Jessica|title=A world leading scientist on the search for extraterrestrials pointed out a flaw in Stephen Hawking's fear of finding intelligent aliens|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jill-tarter-says-stephen-hawking-is-wrong-about-aliens-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern over METI was raised by the science journal ''Nature'' in an editorial in October 2006, which commented on a recent meeting of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] SETI study group. The editor said, "It is not obvious that all extraterrestrial civilizations will be benign, or that contact with even a benign one would not have serious repercussions" (Nature Vol 443 12 October 06 p 606). Astronomer and science fiction author [[David Brin]] has expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shouting at the Cosmos | last=Brin | first=David | publisher=Lifeboat Foundation |date=June 2006 | accessdate=June 28, 2009 | url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/shouting.at.the.cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Carrigan, a [[particle physicist]] at the [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] near [[Chicago, Illinois]], suggested that passive SETI could also be dangerous and that a signal released onto the Internet could act as a [[computer virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Do potential SETI signals need to be decontaminated? | last=Carrigan Jr. | first=Robert A. |date=June 2006 | publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory | url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/SETI/SETI_Hacker_AC-03-IAA-8-3-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer security expert [[Bruce Schneier]] dismissed this possibility as a "bizarre movie-plot threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Science-Fiction Movie-Plot Threat | accessdate=March 13, 2011 | url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/a_sciencefictio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To lend a quantitative basis to discussions of the risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics adopted in 2007 a new analytical tool, the [[San Marino Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The San Marino Scale: A new analytical tool for assessing transmission risk |journal=Acta Astronautica |author=Iván Almára and H.Paul Shuch |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=January 2007 |pages=57–59 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506001858 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.04.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by Prof. [[Ivan Almar]] and Prof. [[H. Paul Shuch]], the scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content. Its adoption suggests that not all such transmissions are equal, and each must be evaluated separately before establishing blanket international policy regarding active SETI.

However, some scientists consider these fears about the dangers of METI as panic and irrational superstition; see, for example, [[Alexander L.

=== Breakthrough Message ===
The [[Breakthrough Initiatives#Breakthrough Message|Breakthrough Message]] program is an open competition announced in July 2015 to design a digital message that could be transmitted from Earth to an extraterrestrial civilization, with a US$1,000,000 prize pool. The message should be "representative of humanity and planet Earth". The program pledges "not to transmit any message until there has been a wide-ranging debate at high levels of science and politics on the risks and rewards of contacting advanced civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Breakthrough Initiatives|url = http://www.breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/2|website = www.breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{for |criticism of [[Active SETI]]|Search for extraterrestrial intelligence#Debate}}
As various SETI projects have progressed, some have criticized early claims by researchers as being too "euphoric". For example, Peter Schenkel, while remaining a supporter of SETI projects, wrote in 2006 that
: "[i]n light of new findings and insights, it seems appropriate to put excessive euphoria to rest and to take a more down-to-earth view ... We should quietly admit that the early estimates—that there may be a million, a hundred thousand, or ten thousand advanced extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy—may no longer be tenable."&lt;ref name="Schenkel_2006"/&gt;

SETI has also occasionally been the target of criticism by those who suggest that it is a form of [[pseudoscience]].{{citation needed|reason= 13 December 2017: Citation Needed for pseudoscience allegation |date=December 2017}} In particular, critics allege that no observed phenomena suggest the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence,{{citation needed|reason= 13 December 2017: Citation Needed for 'no observed phenomena suggest' (as it's not self-evident, given what may be suggested by the observations of our existence and of the existence of zillions of other stars)|date=December 2017}} and furthermore that the assertion of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence has no good [[Karl Popper|Popperian]] criteria for [[falsifiability]], as explained in a 2009 [[editorial]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which said:
: "Seti ... has always sat at the edge of mainstream astronomy. This is partly because, no matter how scientifically rigorous its practitioners try to be, SETI can't escape an association with UFO believers and other such crackpots. But it is also because SETI is arguably not a falsifiable experiment. Regardless of how exhaustively the Galaxy is searched, the null result of radio silence doesn't rule out the existence of alien civilizations. It means only that those civilizations might not be using radio to communicate."&lt;ref name="SETI at 50"/&gt;

''Nature'' added that SETI was "marked by a hope, bordering on faith" that aliens were aiming signals at us, that a hypothetical alien SETI project looking at Earth with "similar faith" would be "sorely disappointed" (despite our many untargeted radar and TV signals, and our few targeted Active SETI radio signals denounced by those fearing aliens), and that it had difficulties attracting even sympathetic working scientists and Government funding because it was "an effort so likely to turn up nothing".&lt;ref name="SETI at 50"/&gt;

However ''Nature'' also added that "Nonetheless, a small SETI effort is well worth supporting, especially given the enormous implications if it did succeed"  and that "happily, a handful of wealthy technologists and other private donors have proved willing to provide that support".&lt;ref name="SETI at 50"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/461316a|title=SETI at 50 |doi=10.1038/461316a |pmid=19759575 |journal=Nature |date=2009 |volume=416|bibcode = 2009Natur.461..316.|issue=7262|pages=316|quote=Indeed, SETI is marked by a hope, bordering on faith, that not only are there civilizations broadcasting out there, but that they are somehow intent on beaming their signals at Earth. An alien SETI project relying on a similar faith in Earth would be sorely disappointed. It's true that a random mix of radar and television signals has been expanding outwards from Earth at the speed of light for the past 70 years. But there have been only a few short-lived attempts to target radio messages at other stars — with each attempt arousing concerns over alien reprisals. Understandably, many scientists who support SETI in spirit have instead pursued astronomical targets more likely to offer positive data — and tenure. Governments have also been averse to funding an effort so likely to turn up nothing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual repression''' is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing their own [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]], being associated with sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. McClintock, ''Sexual Shame: An Urgent Call to Healing'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, MN. ({{ISBN|0800632389}}) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes sexual repression is subjective and can vary greatly between cultures and moral systems. Many [[Religion and sexuality|religions]]{{which|date=November 2018}} have been accused of fostering sexual repression{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

Some ideologies{{which|date=November 2018}} seek to repress certain forms of sexual expression, such as [[homosexuality]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}, and some cultures{{which|date=November 2018}} even use [[violence|violent practices]] such as [[genital modification and mutilation]], [[honor killings]], or [[stoning]], in an attempt to regulate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]].

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to use the term widely, and argued that it was one of the roots of many problems in [[Western world|Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilf Hey. [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 "Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis and Sexual Repression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033909/http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 |date=2008-05-18 }}, vision.org&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html B. Apfelbaum. "Sexual Reality and How We Dismiss It."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704081455/http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods of Indian history [[anaphrodisiac]]s were utilised in order to lower libidos.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBVNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;dq="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1_bPRrdLUAhXsLcAKHXCoCY0Q6AEILTAD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Further|Religion and sexuality}}

Most forms of Christianity [[opposition to homosexuality|strongly discourage homosexual behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PPEyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1827,2290931&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en liberal media] Free Lance-Star retrieved 27 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of Islam have strict sexual codes which include banning homosexuality, demanding virginity before marriage accompanied by a ban on fornication, and can require modest dress-codes for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csX0f7AVM3gC&amp;pg=PA722 Sex and Society] Volume 3 - Page 722&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{Further|Child marriage}}
Marriage has been seen as a means of controlling sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1885/&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of marriage, such as [[child marriage]], are often practiced as a means of regulating the sexuality of girls, by ensuring they do not have several partners, thus preserving their [[virginity]] for the future husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090804/http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[BBC World Service]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=Article 16: Right to marriage and family and to equal rights of men and women during and after marriage|publisher=[[BBC World Service]]|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In some cases, parents willingly marry off their young girls in order to increase the family income or protect the girl from the risk of unwanted sexual advances or even [[promiscuity]].}}

==Female genital mutilation==
[[File:Fgm_map.gif|200px|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision, "comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa as well as Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen and Indonesia; and more than 125 million girls and women today are estimated to have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM does not have any health benefits, and has serious negative effects on health; including complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM is used as a way of controlling [[female sexuality]]; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

{{quote|FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital [[virginity]] and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist "illicit" sexual acts.}}

FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male circumcision==
{{Main|Circumcision}}
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|300px|Male circumcision [[prevalence]] by country according to a World Health Organization's 2007 review.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male circumcision has been practiced as a surgical means of sexual repression in some cultures, although it may be practiced for various reasons, with the World Health Organization recommending it as a means of reducing [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision is also a religious tradition in Judaism and Islam. According to medieval Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides, the "reason" for male circumcision is "the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late-nineteenth century, circumcision of the penis was prescribed by John Harvey Kellogg as a "cure" for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm#chapi133&lt;/ref&gt; William Acton, a leading authority on sexuality in mid-Victorian Britain, advocated male circumcision in order to prevent "undue excitement of the sexual desires … which it is our object to repress."&lt;ref&gt;Willliam Acton. The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life, Considered in their Physiological, Social, and Moral Relations. Third Edition. London: Churchill, 1862, pp. 5–6. https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cVX7PaDkzGYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A "biocultural analysis" of male circumcision supports the hypothesis "that a practical consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority figures."&lt;ref&gt;Immerman, Ronald S. &amp; Wade C. Mackey (1997) "A biocultural analysis of circumcision." Social Biology 44: 3–4, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor killings==
{{Main|Honor killing}}
An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having [[sex outside marriage]], becoming the victim of [[rape]], dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN Expert Group Meeting on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices against women:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [honor killings] stem from the deeply-rooted social belief that male family members (in some cases, mothers and other women are involved in planning or carrying out honor crimes) should control the sexuality of or protect the reputation of women in the family, and that they may contain their movements or kill them for blemishing family honor, even when rumors or false gossip are the reason for public suspicion.}}

==Same-sex sexual activity==
{{Further|Sodomy law}}
Various cultures attempt to repress homosexual sexual expression. As of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by prison in 70 countries, and in five other countries and in parts of two others, homosexuality is punishable with the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from criminal prosecution, LGBT individuals may also face social stigmatization and serious violence (see [[violence against LGBT people]]).

==Studies==
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} have hypothesized a relationship between sexual repression and [[rape]]. However, they have been unable to find any support for this hypothesis - whether the tremendous difficulty of measuring sexual repression is to blame, or whether the theory is simply false, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA93 Mary E. Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, ''Confronting rape and sexual assault'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual repression is often viewed as a key issue within [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[feminist views on sexuality]] vary widely.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', neither refutes nor confirms what he calls the "repressive hypothesis." Instead, he says sexuality has become an important topic to understand and manipulate for the purpose of nation building. Through categorization of sexuality, the idea of repression was born. While he agrees sexuality has become much more controlled, he equates it to necessity. Furthermore, it is through [[psychiatric]] and medical discourse on sexuality that it has become repressed.

Foucault argues that religious confession as well as psychiatric procedure codify confession within as a means of extracting [[truth]]. Because the mechanisms of sex were obscure, it was elusive by nature and its mechanisms escaped observation. By integrating it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth century altered the scope of confession. Confession tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide but with what was hidden from himself. It had to be extracted by force, since it involved something that tried to stay hidden. This relationship of truth scientifically validated the view of the confessed which could assimilate, record, and verify this obscure truth.&lt;ref name="Foucault1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The history of sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mbc5eMjLpoC|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-72469-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression in various countries==
{{Incomplete section|date=May 2017}}
Many countries{{which|date=November 2018}} have developed a much more liberal attitude{{cn|date=November 2018}} towards sexuality, but in some{{which|date=November 2018}} it has become less so{{cn|date=November 2018}}:

===China===
Reproduction-based sex was urged by [[Mao Zedong]], but later politicians instituted a [[one-child policy]]. In a country where atheism is popular, the restriction cannot be ascribed to religion but to nationalist motives.&lt;ref name="Body &amp; Society"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Sexual Repression in Maoist China: Ideology, Structure and the Ownership of the Body |journal=[[Body &amp; Society]] |date=September 2005 |last=Yuehong Zhang |first=Everett |volume=11 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/1357034X05056188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sna large.png|thumb|250px|A drawing of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which each person is represented by a dot called a [[node (graph theory)|node]] and the friendship relationship is represented by a line called an edge]]

[[File:Social graph.gif|250px|thumb|This animation shows the different types of relations between social objects. User '''Eva''' is a friend of '''Adam''' and '''Kate''', though '''Adam''' and '''Kate''' are not friends themselves. '''Peter's''' photo was "liked" by many users, including '''Eva'''. Also '''Eva''' listened to the '''[[Last.fm]]''' radio and watched the video from '''[[YouTube]]'''.]]

The '''social graph''' in the [[Internet]] context is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that depicts personal relations of internet users. In short, it is a model or representation of a [[social network]], where the word '''graph''' has been taken from [[graph theory]]. The social graph has been referred to as "the global mapping of everybody and how they're related".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/21/tech/main6418458.shtml "Facebook: One Social Graph to Rule Them All?"]. CBS News. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularized at the [[Facebook F8]] conference on May 24, 2007, when it was used to explain how the newly introduced [[Facebook Platform]] would take advantage of the relationships between individuals to offer a richer online experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2007/05/facebook-unveils-platform-for-developers-of-social-applications/ "Facebook Unveils Platform for Developers of Social Applications"]. Facebook. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition has been expanded to refer to a social graph of all Internet users.

Since explaining the concept of the social graph, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], one of the founders of Facebook, has often touted Facebook's goal of offering the website's social graph to other websites so that a user's relationships can be put to use on websites outside Facebook's control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/facebooks-zuckerberg-uncorks-the-social-graph/5156 "Facebook's Zuckerberg uncorks the social graph"]. ZDNet. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Several issues have come forward regarding the existing implementation of the social graph owned by Facebook. For example, currently, a social networking service is unaware of the relationships forged between individuals on a different service. This creates an online experience that is not seamless, and instead provides for a fragmented experience due to the lack of an openly available graph between services. In addition, existing services define relationships differently.

{{As of|2010}}, Facebook's social graph is the largest [[social network]] dataset in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/one-graph-to-rule-them-all.html "One Graph To Rule Them All?"]. A VC. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains the largest number of defined relationships between the largest number of people among all websites because it is the most widely used social networking service in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2008/tc20080812_853725.htm "Facebook: No. 1 Globally"]. ''BusinessWeek''. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern has focused on the fact that Facebook's social graph is owned by the company and is not shared with other services, giving it a major advantage over other services and preventing its users from taking their graph with them to other services when they wish to do so, such as when a user is dissatisfied with Facebook. [[Google]] has attempted to offer a solution to this problem by creating the Social Graph API, released in January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206102122 "Google Launches Social Graph API"]. ''InformationWeek''.

== Open Graph == 
{{further|Facebook Platform#Open Graph protocol}}
Facebook's Graph API allows websites to draw information about more objects than simply people, including photos, events, and pages, and their relationships between each other. This expands the social graph concept to more than just relationships between individuals and instead applies it to virtual non-human objects between individuals, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api "Graph API"].

==Family==
Medullinus was the brother of [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus]], consul in 472 BC. The ''[[cognomina]]'' ''Medullinus Fusus'' has been reconstructed from multiple sources.&lt;ref name=Broughton34&gt;{{harvnb|Broughton|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] gives the ''[[praenomen]]'' ''Servius'' in place of ''Spurius''.&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'', IX. 63.2&lt;/ref&gt; Medullinus was the father of [[Lucius Furius Medullinus (consular tribune)|Lucius Furius Medullinus]] ([[Tribuni militum consulari potestate|military tribune with consular power]] in 432, 425, and 420 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broughton|1951|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 464 BC, he was elected consul with [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis (consul 464 BC)|Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis]].&lt;ref name=Broughton34/&gt; The two consuls led separate campaigns against the [[Aequi]], Medullinus in [[Hernici]]an territory.&lt;ref name=Broughton34/&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'', IX. 62-66&lt;/ref&gt; In an initial battle the Aequi were victorious, and the Roman forces led by Furius were besieged in their camp.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Furius led his troops in a sortie.  They burst forth from their besieged camp and attacked the Aequi.  The Roman attack initially succeeded, however the consul's brother [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus|Publius]], (who had been consul in 472 BC and was serving as a [[legatus]] under his brother's command) led his forces too far from the main Roman force, and was cut off and killed.  This led the consul to pursue him, and Spurius Furius himself was wounded, and only just rescued from the enemy.  The Aequi besieged the Romans in their camp once again, and displayed the head of the consul's brother.  But then the proconsul [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]] arrived with [[Latin League|Latin]] and Hernican forces, and attacked the Aequian army.  The besieged Roman army again broke forth from the camp, and the Aequian army was soundly defeated.  The Roman forces led by Quinctius and Furius then assisted the other consul Postumius in driving a separate Aequian force from Roman territory.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 453 BC a pestilence ravaged Rome. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Spurius Fusus (probably the consul of 464 BC), was made consul suffect to replace the consul [[Sextus Quinctilius Varus]], who died from the pestilence.&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'', X. 53.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Livy]], ''Roman History'', 3.32.4&lt;/ref&gt; Medullinus also died of the pestilence later that year.&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'', X. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broughton|1951|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''statue menhir''' is a type of carved [[standing stone]] created during the later [[Europe]]an [[Neolithic]].

The statues consist of a vertical slab or pillar with a stylised design of a human figure cut into it, sometimes with hints of clothing or weapons visible.

==Locations==
They are most commonly found in southern and western [[France]], [[Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canovelles.cat/fitxer/12350/10menhir.pdf Estàtua-menhir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155014/http://www.canovelles.cat/fitxer/12350/10menhir.pdf |date=2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]] and the [[Alps]]. A group from the [[Iron Age]] also is known in [[Liguria]] and [[Lunigiana]].

There are two in [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=287103092|title=Le Dehus - Burial Chamber (Dolmen)|work=The Megalithic Portal|last=Evendon|first=J|accessdate=2008-09-16|date=2001-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Gran' Mère du Chimquière'' ('the Grandmother of the Cemetery'), a highly detailed example in the churchyard of [[St Martin's, Guernsey|Parish of Saint Martin]], and another known simply as ''La Gran' Mère'' in the Parish of [[Castel, Guernsey|Castel]]. The latter is an earlier, less detailed example found buried underneath the porch of the parish church.

'''''The Cat Lady''''' is an [[Indie game|indie]] [[psychological horror]] [[graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]] [[video game]] developed by Harvester Games for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]].

== Overview ==
The protagonist is Susan Ashworth, a chronically depressed, middle-aged woman with no friends. She hates [[flower]]s, and her only companions are stray cats, whom she summons to her flat by playing her [[piano]]. She is known in her neighborhood as the [[cat lady]].

One night, Susan decides to take her own life, but this leads her to explore a strange place in death where she encounters the Queen of Maggots, who grants her [[immortality]] and gives her the task of ridding the world of five [[psychopathy|psychopaths]] referred to as the "parasites".

Susan then returns to the world of the living to wake up in a hospital bed and is soon forced to carry out her task. She meets Liz in the [[hospital]], a friendly [[nurse]] unhappy with her job, who tells Susan her "daughter" saved her; much to the chagrin and annoyance of Susan, who has no daughter. Annoyed by the hospital's constant [[drug]]gings and wanting to get home, Susan attempts to escape, only to be stopped by Doctor X - the hospitals' [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. She reveals her feelings and past to Doctor X, and tells him how Liz killed herself the night before. Doctor X, knowing Susan is aware of Liz's death, traps and kills Susan. She awakes later in some kind of hidden [[torture]] basement to the screams of another victim. Upon searching around, she discovers that Doctor X kills his patients to reform them as [[artwork]]. Susan then leaves, possibly after killing Doctor X.

She returns to her house, attempting to return to her normal life. Whilst summoning the cats, she receives an angry complaint from a neighbour, who threatens to call [[pest control]]. After this, she meets Mitzi, a young, homeless woman willing to be her new roommate. She had lied about being Susan's daughter merely to save her life. When Susan sees the Queen of Maggots behind Mitzi, she realises she is close to death, leading Mitzi to reveal she has cancer. Susan learns that Mitzi had a boyfriend named Jack who was driven to insanity upon learning of her [[cancer]]. He stumbled upon a [[suicide]] forum online, in which a [[internet troll|troll]] called the "Eye of Adam" lured people to kill themselves using a mixture of two household [[chemical]]s. Jack has attempted to persuade her into it, though Mitzi had refused, leaving Jack to kill himself. Mitzi insists that she just wants to find the person, who is in the flat, to "talk" with them before she dies. Soon after, Susan investigates outside after hearing the cats howling outside, only to be kidnapped by the pest controller.
 
Susan awakes in the pest controllers' house, tied to a table. The man reveals he is sexually attracted to Susan, and had previously sought after other women, though his wife then interrupts and pours [[bleach]] over Susan's face. The pest controller, seeing Susan so [[blood]]ied, loses interest in her and abandons her with a gun, unaware of Susan's immortality. Susan awakes and finds the house littered with cat and human [[meat]]. She unsuccessfully calls the police and then Mitzi, asking for the chemical combination used by Jack, and uses this to [[murder]] the couple.

Upon returning to the flat, Susan and Mitzi slowly reconcile and become friends, and Susan agrees to help Mitzi find the Eye of Adam. When having [[coffee]], Mitzi naively asks Susan if she has children, unknowingly bringing up her pained memories. After breaking a mug, Mitzi attempts to apologise before Susan angrily walks out, only to be murdered by a man pretending to offer [[flower]]s. Susan awakes on some kind of [[dock (maritime)|dock]], her in [[limbo]] state between life and death, where she has to blow out another [[candle]] to reveal another death.

Awaking in the flat, she is tied to Mitzi in the bath, where they fail to escape. Susan reveals her hatred for [[flower]]s; ten years ago, she was young mother to Zoe, married to a [[taxi]] driver named Eric. One night, whilst Eric was working, Susan was at home with Zoe. She spoke to a man on the phone, supposedly her admirer, who sent her flowers whilst she was married. Susan hid the flowers in Zoe's room with the window open. Eric returned home, angrily informing Susan of a terrorist attack happening earlier that day, nearly killing him. Susan was oblivious to this as she was talking to her admirer, who promptly called to interrupt the conversation. Whilst Eric and Susan argued, Zoe's rare [[allergy]] to [[pollen]] reacted with the [[pollen]] coming from the flowers, eventually killing her. Susan also reveals to Mitzi that Eric was found dead shortly after, leaving her alone and depressed in the same flat.

The man returns, untying Susan and hanging Mitzi from the ceiling, attempting to kill her. The man orders Susan to play the piano for him, summoning the cats, who eat him. Susan unties Mitzi, and they set out trying to find the Eye of Adam. Whilst searching, they meet Joe and Ivy Davis from Downfall, an old man, and a young mother with her baby - which Susan finds uncomfortable.

The game deals with mature themes such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], [[murder]] and [[cancer]], but also provides moments of humor and hope.

The ending of the game is slightly modified based on player's choices.

But that horror is in service of a touching character portrait—a portrait that's authentically, poignantly askew."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; The game won Best Story in the 2012 [[Aggie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/24014/page2 Adventure Gamers 2012 Aggie Awards] The Cat Lady wins Best Story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14624">'''Thomas Brattle''' (June 20, 1658 &amp;ndash; May 18, 1713) was a well-educated and prosperous [[Boston]] merchant who served as treasurer of [[Harvard College]], and was a member of the intellectually elite [[Royal Society]].

== Early life ==
Thomas Brattle was born on June 20, 1658 in Boston, Massachusetts to Elizabeth Brattle née Tyng and Captain Thomas Brattle. He was the couple's second child and the first son to survive past infancy. He had eight siblings, including William Brattle and Catherine Winthrop. Brattle's date of birth is often confused with the first-born son of the Brattle family (also named Thomas Brattle) – who was born on, and died on, September 5, 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Account of Some of the Descendants of Capt. Thomas Brattle|last=Harris|first=Edward-Doubleday|publisher=Clapp and Son|year=1867|isbn=978-1332096022|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Thomas Brattle was exposed to radical forms of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] faith, primarily through his father's participation in the controversial founding of the Third (South) Church, which advocated for ecclesiastical reforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=365919|title=Brattle, William|last=Kennedy|first=Rick|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church's membership included many notable members such as [[Samuel Sewall]], [[Samuel Adams]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At one point in time, Thomas' father, Captain Brattle, was named the wealthiest man in the colony. After the death of his father, Thomas was appointed administrator of the estate on April 12, 1683, leaving him with a large sum of money and a healthy plot of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An account of some of the descendants of Capt. Thomas Brattle|last=Harris|first=Edward Doubleday|year=1867|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before attending Harvard University in 1676, he attended the [[Boston Latin School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71069|title="Thomas Brattle (1658-1713)" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Wright|first=Conrad Edick|publisher=OUP|year=|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was open to all boys regardless of class, and served to educate and prepare the young men for university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/74909/Boston-Latin-School|title="Boston Latin School" in Encyclopædia Britannica|last=|first=|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Latin School is where Brattle met influential Puritan leader [[Cotton Mather]]. Although the two men agreed on many social and political ideologies later in life, they did not see eye to eye during their time at the Boston Latin School. It is documented that Thomas Brattle and other schoolmates enjoyed picking on Cotton Mather (to the point where he wrote to his father, [[Increase Mather]], and requested to come home early).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First American Evangelical: A Short Life of Cotton Mather|last=Kennedy|first=Rick|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1958|isbn=|location=Michigan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time at the [[Boston Latin School]], Brattle attended Harvard University and received an AB in mathematics and science.

==Education==
In 1676, Brattle graduated from [[Harvard College]] with an A.B., equivalent to our modern B.A. At Harvard, Brattle developed marked skill in mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of the American Enlightenment|last=Spencer|first=Mark G.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he is most well known for ''The Witchcraft Delusion'', which was written to argue against the [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]], Brattle was interested in many areas including mathematics, architecture, and astronomy.&lt;ref name="Salem Witch Trials Notable Persons"/&gt;

Brattle gained most of his education on his own due to the bad leadership at Harvard in his undergraduate years. He used whatever books that were available and studied with John Foster and Dr. William Avery. Brattle wrote a letter to [[John Flamsteed]], a mentor of his, stating that no one at Harvard could teach him mathematics so he took it upon himself to do so. Thomas and a group of other prominent colonists studied several comets that appeared in the late seventeenth century. He wrote several essays on these comets.

Brattle later travelled abroad and then settled in Boston in 1693, where he pursued a short business career and gave several gifts to Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Brattle|title=Thomas Brattle {{!}} North American entrepreneur|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was appointed as the Harvard College treasurer and he served in that position for twenty years until his death. During his time as treasurer, the finances of the college grew exponentially. Brattle was a member of the intellectually elite [[Royal Society]]. The Royal Society was a new group of scientific thinkers that practiced a more intense and rational thought process. This group grew much larger in the eighteenth century when it was headed by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. Sir Isaac Newton was so impressed with Brattle's work that he planned to procure his papers on astronomy and math after Brattle's death in order to benefit the Royal Society. In an attempt to obtain them, Newton tried to make his brother, William Brattle, a member of the Society, however William declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings|last=Miller, Perry, Thomas Herbert, Johnson, and George McCandlish|first=|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1711, Brattle attempted to use a mathematical algorithm in order to end [[Smallpox|small pox]]. Although he failed, it can be seen that Brattle was heavily involved in education and scientific discovery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Kennedy) Brattle made more substantial contributions to science than any other American of the day.

== Personal life ==
Thomas Brattle's  mother was Elizabeth Brattle and his father Captain Thomas Brattle. He was one of four children, including his brother, William Brattle (and nephew [[William Brattle]]), and his two sisters, Elizabeth Oliver and Katherine Winthrop Eyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Thomas-Brattle/6000000019286889691|title=Thomas Brattle|website=geni_family_tree|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brattle was an accomplished amateur mathematician and astronomer which eventually lead him to becoming the unofficial professor of mathematics and astrology at Harvard. There he taught and trained students in return for their assistance in his research. His work was directly influenced by the ideas of [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Flamsteed]], which he communicated to his students. In addition to being a professor, he became the treasurer of Harvard College after numerous donations.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Circumstantial evidence indicates that he designed [[Stoughton Hall]] at Harvard and his own Brattle Street Meeting House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00100.html?a=1&amp;n=thomas%20brattle&amp;d=10&amp;ss=0&amp;q=1|title=Brattle, Thomas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brattle lived in London from 1682-1689 in order to study science. There he was involved in both scientific communities which can "help us understand a good deal about the progress of scientific expertise in colonial New England," since he was able to communicate information to both communities.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Rick|date=1990-01-01|title=Thomas Brattle and the Scientific Provincialism of New England, 1680-1713|jstor=365919|journal=The New England Quarterly|volume=63|issue=4|pages=584–600|doi=10.2307/365919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his accomplishments, he was also a member of [[Royal Society]], and Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/home.html|title=Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive|website=salem.lib.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brattle was also the principal founder of the [[Brattle Street Church]],&lt;ref name="PILGRIMS"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pilgrims of Boston and their descendants|last= Bridgman|first= Thomas|author2=Everett, Edward|year=1856|publisher=Appleton &amp; Co|location= New York|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPQWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which broke away from the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational church]]. This sparked an intense dispute between Brattle and famous Puritan minister, [[Cotton Mather]]. Rather than being similar to the Puritans, his church was more like the Church of England.&lt;ref name="Salem Witch Trials Notable Persons"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people?group.num=&amp;mbio.num=mb2|title=Salem Witch Trials Notable Persons|website=salem.lib.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized by the Reverend Benjamin Colman as "worth Christian philosopher, who was also the glory of his country in respect to his excelling knowledge of mathematics".&lt;ref name=science /&gt; Brattle died in Boston, MA, but his death date is still questioned to this day. He was buried in Boston, MA.

== Legacy ==
=== Salem Witch Trials ===
In early October 1692, Brattle wrote a letter to an English clergyman which was critical of the [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]. The letter was circulated widely in Boston at the time, and it continues to be studied for its reasoned attack on the witchcraft trials in Salem. The "highly literate" and "satirical tone" of the letter was seen as writing beyond its time, leading [[Perry Miller]] to call it a "milestone in American literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madden|first1=Matthew|title=Salem Witch Trials Notable Persons|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people?group.num=&amp;mbio.num=mb2|website=Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive and Transcription Project|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brattle denounced the persecution of suspected witches, and his letter revealed a "chink in the armor" of Puritan ideology. Brattle presents a compelling argument against the legal premises and procedures involved in the afflictions, accusations, and executions, with a particular focus on the invalidity of spectral evidence in proceedings.

Brattle's letter was designed to illustrate the wrongful convictions that the Court of [[Oyer and terminer|Oyer and Terminer]] made during this time as they based their evidence on witchcraft from intangible evidence. He was careful to not critique the "Salem Gentlemen", which he referred to as the judges and ministers, but rather focused on critiquing the methods they used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salem.lib.virginia.edu|title=Thomas Brattle|last=|first=|date=March 28, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Governor Phips read Brattle's letter, he ordered that the courts could no longer use intangible evidence as a source to convict individuals of witchcraft. Phips dissolved the court entirely within the same month. Six months later, the Superior Court of Massachusetts took over the remaining witchcraft cases and no one was found guilty. Although Brattle's letter was written after 20 people were already wrongfully convicted, his powerful letter helped shape the future of Salem.

=== Church Reformation ===
As a result of the reaction toward theological, political, and cultural transformations that affected the whole of New England in the later half of the 17th century, the Brattle Street Church was formed as a result of radical development in the evolution of colonial congregationalism - bringing reason and religion together in a new church. The Congregational Church was broadly catholic, but used conservative principles of congregationalism (that just liberty and privilege should be allowed to all, while imposing nothing upon an individual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot|first1=Cara|title=This House which I have built: The Foundation of the Brattle Street Church in Boston and Transformations in Colonial Congregationalism|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&amp;context=ghj|website=Gettysburg College.edu|publisher=The Gettysburg Historical Journal|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not make any radical changes from contemporary theological consensus - its foundation did represent the first concrete fragmentation of a previously united New England Congregational Community.

Outside of his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Brattle and his younger brother William provided new radical ideas that the Puritan Church did not agree with. Brattle preached some of these more liberal ideas in the church he founded, the Brattle Street Church, which led to an argument with Puritan minister [[Cotton Mather]]. Also, both Thomas and William improved Harvard College. Thomas donated money many times, served as treasurer of the college, and was an unofficial professor of astronomy and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Brattle|title=Thomas Brattle: North American Entrepreneur|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=©2016 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Thomas died, he left the New World with a new rational approach towards thought.

==== Other Achievements ====
Brattle is also credited as being the first person to import an organ to the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilder Foote|first1=Henry|title=Musical Life in Boston|publisher=American Antiquarian Society|page=307|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44807002.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">A '''Traffic Homicide Investigator''' ('''THI''') is a term used primarily in the [[United States of America]] for a [[police]] employee, generally a sworn [[law enforcement officer]], who is assigned to investigate [[Death|fatalities]] resulting from [[motor vehicle]] [[Car acc ident|collisions]].

== Overview ==
Traffic Homicide Investigator's have special training that goes beyond standard accident investigation and equips them to conduct an investigation of the site of a serious or fatal collision and to treat it as a crime scene.&lt;ref name="northchilton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.northchiltonadvertiser.com/2010/11/jemison-has-traffic-homicide-investigator/|title=Jemison has traffic homicide investigator|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually a traffic officer who has investigated a great number of nonfatal crashes and have advanced towards more in-depth crash investigation. Although they may not be the first responder to a traffic-related fatality, they will be called upon to take over the investigation at an early stage and see it through to its conclusion.&lt;ref name="wctv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wctv.tv/news/headlines/UPDATE_Accident_on_Springhill_and_Sprinil_Road_Student_Killed.html?ref=198|title=Accident on Springhill and Sprinil Road: Student Killed|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naples1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2010/nov/21/freeport-texas-falls-death-estero-atv-crash/|title=Texas man falls to death in Estero ATV crash|date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Traffic Homicide Investigators are "part physicist, part policeman and part victim's advocate".&lt;ref name="ocala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20090726/ARTICLES/907261007|title=Physics, police work help FHP solve hit-and-runs|date=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carefully document the scene of a crash, ideally in a manner thorough enough to allow specially trained officers to reconstruct the scene at a later time, after the [[roadway]] has been reopened. This includes documenting the precise details of the roadway on which the fatality occurred; the state of any vehicles involved, including the use of safety features; the condition, legal status and attitude of the operator or operators of any vehicles, and any other local factors such as the weather and the presence or absence of appropriate road signage. 

In addition, investigators will conduct interviews with drivers and witnesses to assist in building up an overall picture of what led to the crash.&lt;ref name="ocala"/&gt;

== Around the world ==
=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], specialised collision investigators working as part of the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|local police force's]] traffic unit will usually handle collisions that result in death or serious injury. They receive training equivalent to this in the USA and conduct their investigations with similar methodology.&lt;ref name="metpol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/traffic/traffic_teams.htm|title=Traffic Teams|publisher=[[Metropolitan Police]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''White Lady''' is a type of female [[ghost]] dressed in all white reportedly seen in rural areas and associated with some local legend of tragedy. While White Lady legends are found in many countries around the world, they are most prominent in parts of the United States, Ireland and Great Britain. Common to many of these legends is the theme of loss of a daughter or husband and a sense of purity before death (as opposed to the [[Lady in Red (ghost)|Lady in Red]] ghost).

==In different parts of the world==
In popular [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[legend]], a White Lady is fabled to appear by day as well as by night in a house in which a family member is soon to die. According to ''[[The Nuttall Encyclopædia]]'', these spirits were regarded as the ghosts of deceased ancestresses.

===Brazil===
Called ''Dama Branca'' or ''Mulher de Branco'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the Brazilian Lady in White is said to be the ghost of a young woman who died of [[childbirth]] or violent causes. According to legend, she appears as a pale woman in a long white dress or a sleeping gown, and although usually speechless, will occasionally recount her misfortunes. The origins of the myth are not clear, Luís da Câmara Cascudo's ''Dicionário do Folclore Brasileiro'' (Brazilian Folklore Dictionary) proposes that the ghost is related to the violent deaths of young white women who were murdered by their fathers or husbands in an [[honour killing|"honor" killing]]. The most frequent reasons for these honor killings were [[adultery]] (actual or suspected), denial of [[sex]], or abuse. [[Monteiro Lobato]] in his book ''[[Urupês]]'' describes a young woman starved to death by her husband because he suspected she was in love with a black slave and only gave her the stewed meat of his corpse for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supernaturalbrasil.org/?p=9807|title=supernaturalbrasil.org|website=www.supernaturalbrasil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
A popular legend claims that the surroundings of the [[Montmorency Falls]], near [[Quebec City]] are haunted by a white lady. It is said to be the spirit of a young ''[[Canadien]]ne'' woman whose soon-to-be husband was killed while fighting against the British in the [[battle of Beauport]]. The young couple allegedly used to meet near the top of the falls and, accordingly, the grieving woman is said to have chosen the site to end her life by throwing herself in the raging waters while wearing the wedding dress that she had recently ordered to be made. A smaller waterfall in the vicinity now bears the name [[Chute de la Dame Blanche]] ''(White Lady Waterfall)'' in reference to this legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/voyage/destinations/quebec/201403/10/01-4746265-la-dame-blanche-de-la-chute-montmorency.php |title=La dame blanche de la chute Montmorency from |publisher=La Presse |date=2014-03-10 |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
The best-known White Lady of the [[Czech Republic]] is the ghost of Perchta of [[House of Rosenberg|Rožmberk]] at [[Rožmberk Castle]]. [[Perchta of Rožmberk]] (c. 1429–1476) was a daughter of an important Czech nobleman, Oldřich II of Rožmberk. She married another nobleman, Jan of Lichtenštejn (John of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]) in 1449. The marriage was quite unhappy. One of the reasons might have been the fact that Perchta's father had been reluctant to pay the agreed dowry. Legend has it that as her husband was dying, he asked for her forgiveness for his treatment of her. Perchta refused, and her husband cursed her. This is why she haunts his holdings, which include Český Krumlov Castle, where she has been seen most often. During her married life, Perchta wrote many letters to her father and brothers with colourful descriptions of her unhappy family life. Some 32 of these letters had been handed down.&lt;ref&gt;Perchta of Rozmberk – the White Lady of Bohemia, Jan Velinger, Radio Prague – http://www.radio.cz/en/article/50216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of the Rožmberk Sisters, John Klassen, Library of Medieval Women, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonia===
[[File:Haapsalu piiskopiliinnuse müür, vaade põhjast.jpg|thumb|[[Haapsalu Castle]]]]
The most famous white lady of [[Estonia]] resides in [[Haapsalu Castle|Haapsalu castle]]. She is said to be the woman who a [[Priest|canon]] fell in love with. She hid in the castle as a choir boy, and remained a secret for a long time. But when the Bishop of Ösel-Wiek visited Haapsalu she was discovered, and immured in the wall of the chapel for her crime. To this day she is said to look out of the Baptistery’s window and grieve for her beloved man. She can be seen on clear August full-moon nights.&lt;ref name="WhiteLady"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haapsalulinnus.ee/?id=1324 | title=The White Lady on the window | accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
A White Lady was first reported to be seen in the [[Berliner Schloss]] in 1625 and sightings were reported up until 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Hildebrandt: Das Berliner Schloss. Deutschlands leere Mitte. Hanser, Munich, 2011, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hürlimann: Berlin. Berichte und Bilder. Berlin, 1934, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline von Rochow: Vom Leben am Preußischen Hofe 1815–1852. Berlin, 1908, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griepentrog: Berlin-Sagen. 2010, S. 45f&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Cyran: Das Schloss an der Spree. 6. Aufl. Berlin, 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; This castle is the residence of the [[kings of Prussia]], so the Lady has been linked to several historical figures:

*the guilt-ridden countess Kunigunda of Orlamünde, born Landgravine of Leuchtenberg (Oberpfalz), who, according to legend, murdered her two young children because she believed they stood in the way of her marriage to Albert of Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Rudolph Ottomar Freiherr von Minutoli: Die Weiße Frau 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Die Weiße Frau'' at [http://www.himmelkron.de/112.html www.himmelkron.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
*the unfortunate widow Bertha of Rosenberg from Bohemia, overthrown by the heathen [[Perchta]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wähler: ''Die Weiße Frau''. pp. 7-8 and 23 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a legend of a White Lady who was a prince's wife in the town of [[Rheda-Wiedenbrück]], [[Westphalia]].  The prince was away, fighting in the [[Thirty Years' War]], and his wife took a wandering minstrel as a lover. The prince returned unexpectedly, caught the two lovers, and drowned the minstrel in the moat. He then took his wife and encased her behind a wall in his manor with some food and water, so that she wouldn't cheat on him again as he returned to the fighting. The prince died in battle, the food and water ran out, and his wife died. Her spirit now haunts the manor. When the manor was renovated, the new owner had his builders tear down the wall behind which she was immured. The next day, the worker who tore down the wall was working on the roof of the manor when he fell, broke his back, and died.  The manor is called ''Haus Aussel''.

===Malta===
[[File:Malta - Siggiewi - Triq il-Buskett - Buskett Gardens + Verdala Palace 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Verdala Palace]]]]
The White Lady is the name of a female ghost that lives in [[Verdala Palace]] in the small forest of [[Buskett]], [[Rabat, Malta]].

Legend has it that many years ago, a woman was to be married to a man she did not love. Her father told her that she must always do as her fiancé said since he was soon to be her husband. On the day of her wedding, she committed suicide by jumping off a balcony. This is why she is to this day known as the White Lady, because she was wearing her wedding gown on the day of her death. It is said that she haunts the Verdala Palace and many people who attend the August moon ball confirm that she does indeed appear in the palace.

According to another Maltese legend, the White Lady of [[Mdina]] was killed by her lover after she was forced to marry another man. Many have claimed to see this spirit, always after eight o'clock in the evening. She usually appears to children under eight years old, heart-broken teenage boys, and elderly men. While she tells the children goodnight and bids them to return home, she advises the teenagers to "find another" or to join her and become a part of her "shadow" (her ghostly followers). She also attempts to lure elderly men into her "shadow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medinaproject.net/malta/pages/poc.php?ID_POC=255&amp;ID_Lang=1|title=502 Bad Gateway|website=www.medinaproject.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
''Vrouwen in wit'' (plural of ''vrouw in wit''), or "witte wieven" as these women are called in local dialects, are mythical creatures of [[West Low German|Lower Saxon]] origin and so most known in the eastern and northern parts of the Netherlands. Sometimes referred to as ''witte joffers'' ('white maidens'), they can have both a benevolent as well as a malevolent nature. Often related with [[witches]] and/or [[ghost]]s, they show many similarities with the [[banshee]], the [[fairy]], and the [[elf]]. Understood as malevolent beings, they abduct or [[changeling|switch newborns]], abduct women, and punish people who have treated them badly. As benevolent beings, they may aid in childbirth or offer good advice. Indeed, though the adjective ''wit'' means 'white', it may originally refer to the Germanic word ''wid'', related to English 'wit' and 'wise', and so may be better understood as 'wise women', as they are known in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verhalenbank.nl Korte Beschryvinge van eenige vergetene en verborgene Antiquiteten der provincien en landen gelegen tusschen de Noord-Zee, de Yssel, Emse en Lippe.

===Philippines===
White Ladies are popular ghost story topics in the [[Philippines]]. White Ladies are often used to convey horror and mystery to young children for storytelling. Sightings of White Ladies are common around the country. The most prominent one is the White Lady of [[Balete Drive]] in [[Quezon City]]. It is said that it is the ghost of a long-haired woman in a white dress who, according to legend, died in a car accident while driving along Balete Drive. Most stories about her were told by taxi drivers doing the graveyard shift, such as the one where a taxi crosses Balete Drive and a very beautiful woman is asking for a ride. The cabbie then looks behind and sees the woman's face was full of blood and bruises, causing him to abandon his taxi in terror.

In other instances, it is said that when solitary people drive on that street in the early morning, they briefly see the face of a white-clad woman in the rear-view mirror before she [[Vanishing hitchhiker|quickly disappears]]. Some accidents on this road are blamed on apparitions of the White Lady.

Many sources have said this legend was actually manufactured by a reporter in the 1950s, and also a possible combination of multiple stories from the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ellayn De Vera &amp; Charrissa M. Luci, "Balete Drive:White Lady, Haunted houses and other myths"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===

In [[Hungarian mythology]], a white lady was the ghost of a girl or young woman that died violently, usually young women who committed suicide, were murdered or died while imprisoned. The ghost is usually bound to a specific location and is often identified as a specific person (i.e. [[Elizabeth Báthory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.hu/aktualis/vergrofno-volt-bathory-erzsebet/|title=Vérgrófnő volt Báthory Erzsébet? - Cultura.hu|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Thailand===
In Thailand, there is a story of teenagers going into a deserted house in [[Thawi Watthana]], suburban [[Bangkok]] to look for ghosts and afterwards died from accidents. In each case, witnesses claim to have seen the presence of a mysterious long hair woman in a white dress. A [[mediumship|medium]] claimed that this was a [[vengeful spirit]] named "Dao" or "Deuan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pptvhd36.com/programs/%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7/70106#part-1|date=2017-08-31|accessdate=2018-07-06|website=[[PPTV (Thailand)|PPTV]]|language=thai|title=เป็นเรื่อง!

===United Kingdom===
Several tales out of the U.K. also suggest that the White Lady may be a victim of murder or suicide who died before she could tell anyone the location of some hidden treasure.  Around 1800, the castle of Blenkinsopp in Northumberland was occupied by a family. One night the parents woke to their boy screaming "The White Lady!" By the time they arrived at his bedside, she had vanished, but the boy reported that the lady had been angry and tried to take him away after he refused to accompany her to a box of gold buried in the vaults below. She could not rest while it was there. The same events took place the following three nights.  When the child began sleeping with his parents, the White Lady no longer disturbed him, but he never again traveled through the castle alone for fear of her. A second instance of treasure being involved exists in Welsh tradition. Near Bridgend, Glamorgan in Wales, "Dynes Mewn Gwyn", or the lady in white, appeared to guard a treasure located in the tower of Ogmore Castle. When a man had the courage to approach her, she rewarded him with half the treasure. In his greed, he took it all, but the White Lady retaliated, her fingers turning into claws. The man later wasted away and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Jane C.|title=The White Lady of Great Britain and Ireland|journal=Folklore|date=1970|volume=81|issue=4|pages=292–306|jstor=1259197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Lady (also known as the "Running Lady") of [[Beeford]], [[East Yorkshire]] resides on the "Beeford Straight", a stretch of road between [[Beeford]] and [[Brandesburton]]. Motorists have reported her apparition running across the Beeford Straight toward the junction of [[North Frodingham]]. Anecdotal tales also report a motorcyclist picking up a female hitchhiker on the same stretch of road. A few miles later the motorcyclist, upon turning around, noticed the passenger had vanished.  In one instance, a car crashed into a tree killing 6 people.  It is rumored to be the white lady's curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Robinson|first=Peter |title=Ghosts and Hauntings in Beverley and East Riding |year=1987 |publisher=Hutton Press |isbn=978-0907033615 |id= {{ASIN|090703361X|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another story a White Lady is seen retracing her steps as she was said to have jumped off the [[Portchester Castle]] while trying to retrieve her fallen child. Her spirit is said to haunt the castle to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-portchester-castle-ghost-walk-tickets-41681854549#|title=The Portchester Castle Ghost Walk|website=Eventbrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
