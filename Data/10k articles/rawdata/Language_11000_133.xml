'''Argobba''' is an [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] language spoken in an area north-east of [[Addis Ababa]] by the [[Argobba people]]. It belongs to the [[South Ethiopian Semitic languages|South Ethiopian Semitic]] subgroup along with [[Amharic]] and [[Gurage languages]]. Writing in the mid-1960s, [[Edward Ullendorff]] noted that it "is disappearing rapidly in favour of Amharic, and only a few hundred elderly people are still able to speak it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Ullendorff|Ullendorff, Edward]], (1965) ''The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People'', second edition (London: Oxford University Press), pp. 131f. {{ISBN|0-19-285061-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Argobba in the Harari region are shifting to the [[Oromo language]].&lt;ref&gt;Kifleyesus, Abbebe. 2006. The Argobba of Ethiopia are not the Language They Speak. ''Aethiopica: International Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' 9:7-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is spoken in a number of pockets and has at least four regional variations ([[dialect]]s) in [[Harar]] (extinct), [[Aliyu Amba]], [[Shewa Robit]] and Shonke.

[[Image:Baby.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Babies begin babbling around 5-7 months of age]]
'''Babbling''' is a stage in child development and a state in [[language acquisition]] during which an [[infant]] appears to be experimenting with uttering articulate sounds, but does not yet [[Speech production|produce]] any recognizable words. Babbling begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant's repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech-like.&lt;ref&gt;Oller, D. K. ''The Emergence of the Speech Capacity''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age, though babbling may continue for some time afterward.&lt;ref name="Social Feedback 7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Michael H.|author2=Schwade, Jennifer A.|title=Social Feedback to Infants' Babbling Facilitates Rapid Phonological Learning|journal=Psychological Science|year=2008|volume=19|issue=5|pages=515–523|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbling can be seen as a precursor to language development or simply as vocal experimentation. The physical structures involved in babbling are still being developed in the first year of a child's life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This continued physical development is responsible for some of the changes in abilities and variations of sound babies can produce. Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions, developmental delays, and hearing impairments may interfere with a child's ability to babble normally. Though there is still disagreement about the uniqueness of [[language]] to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Typical development==
Babbling is a stage in language acquisition. Babbles are separated from language because they do not convey meaning or refer to anything specific like words do. Human [[infants]] are not necessarily excited or upset when babbling,  they may also babble spontaneously and incessantly when they are emotionally calm.

The sounds of babbling are produced before an infant begins to construct recognizable [[words]].&lt;ref name="How do infants attain first signs 4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takei|first=Waturu|title=How do deaf infants attain first signs?|journal=Developmental Science|year=2001|volume=4|pages=71–78|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be partly attributed to the immaturity of the [[vocal tract]] and neuromusculature at this age in life.&lt;ref name="6 influences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werker|first=Janet F|author2=Tees, Richard C.|title=Influences on infant speech processing: Toward a new synthesis.|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=1999|volume=50|pages=509–535|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.509|pmid=10074686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants first begin vocalizing by crying, followed by cooing and then vocal play. These first forms of sound production are the easiest for children to use because they contain natural, reflexive, mostly vowel sounds.

Babbling is assumed to occur in all children acquiring language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Particularly it has been studied in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = EVIDENCE FOR LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC RHYTHMIC INFLUENCES IN THE REDUPLICATIVE BABBLING OF FRENCH- AND ENGLISH-LEARNING INFANTS|author1=Levitt, A.

E., Casielles, E., &amp; Nathan, G. 2014" /&gt; Japanese&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and Swedish.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear are the result of the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language.&lt;ref name="6 influences" /&gt; Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.

The [[consonants]] that babbling infants produce tend to be any of the following : {{IPA|/p, b, t, d, k, g, m, n, s, h, w, j/}}. The following consonants tend to be infrequently produced during [[phonological development]] : {{IPA|/f, v, θ, ð, ʃ, tʃ, dʒ, l, r, ŋ/}}. The complexity of the sounds that infants produce makes them difficult to categorize, but the above rules tend to hold true regardless of the language to which children are exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary linguistic analysis: An Introduction|last=Eds. O'Grady, W. |author2=Archibald, J. |last-author-amp=yes |first=|publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9781256320258|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If babbling occurs during the first year of life, it can typically be concluded that the child is developing speech normally. As the baby grows and changes, his/her vocalizations change as well.

=== Timeline of typical vocal development ===
Infants follow a general timeline of vocal developments in childhood.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Development: An Introduction|last = Owens|first = R.E.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 125–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments from birth to age one. Babbling usually lasts 6–9 months in total.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The babbling period ends at around 12 months because it is the age when first words usually occur. However, individual children can show large variability and this timeline is only a guideline.

From '''birth to 1 month''', babies produce mainly pleasure sounds, cries for assistance, and responses to the human voice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''2 months''', babies can distinguish between different speech sounds, and can make “goo”ing sounds &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''3 months''', babies begin (making elongated vowel sounds "oooo" "aaaa"), and will respond vocally to speech of others. They continue to make predominantly vowel sounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''4 months''', babies may vary their pitch, and imitate tones in adult speech.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''5 months''', babies continue to experiment with sound, imitating some sounds made by adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''6 months''', babies vary volume, pitch and rate. When infants are 6 months old they are finally able to control the opening and closing of the vocal tract, and upon obtaining this ability, infants begin to distinguish between the different sounds of vowels and consonants.  This age is often distinguished as the beginning of the canonical stage.  During the canonical stage, the babbling involves reduplicated sounds containing alternations of vowels and consonants, for example, "baba" or "bobo".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reduplicated babbling (also known as canonical babbling) consists of repeated syllables consisting of consonant and a vowel such as "da da da da" or "ma ma ma ma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Waldron|first = Sharn|year = 2007|title = The Significance of the Emergence of Language and Symbol in the Development of the Young Infant|journal = [[Journal of Religion and Health]]|volume = 46|issue = 1|pages = 85–98|jstor = 27512986|doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9089-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around '''7 months''', babies can produce several sounds in one breath, they also recognize different tones and inflections in other speakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around '''8 months''', babies can repeat emphasized syllables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They imitate [[Gestures in language acquisition|gestures]] and tonal quality of adult speech. They also produce variegated babbling. Variegated babbles contain mixes of consonant vowel combinations such as "ka da by ba mi doy doy".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last = Harley|first = Trevor A|title = The Psychology Of Language|year = 1995|publisher = Erlbaum (UK) Taylor and Francis|location = UK|isbn = 0-86377-381-8|pages = 352–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variegated babbling differs from reduplicated babbling in terms of the variation and complexity of syllables that are produced.&lt;ref name="6 influences" /&gt;

Around '''9-10 months''', babies can imitate non speech sounds, and speech-like sounds if they are in the child's repertoire of sounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Infant babbling begins to resemble the native language of a child. The final stage is known as conversational babbling, or the "jargon stage". Usually occurring by about ten months of age, the jargon stage is defined as "pre-linguistic vocalizations in which infants use adult-like stress and intonation".&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, Cooper, &amp; Dehart, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The general structure of the syllables that they are producing is very closely related to the sounds of their native language and this form of babbling significantly predicts the form of early words.&lt;ref name="Cheek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheek|first=A.|author2=Cormier, K.|author3=Repp, A.|author4=Meier, R. P.|title=Prelinguistic gesture predicts mastery and error in the production of early signs|journal=Language|year=2001|volume=77|issue=2|pages=292–323|doi=10.1353/lan.2001.0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around '''11 months''', babies imitate inflections, rhythms, and expressions of speakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By '''12 months''', babies typically can speak one or more words. These words now refer to the entity which they name; they are used to gain attention or for a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Children continue to produce jargon babbles beyond their first words.

=== Manual babbling ===
[[Manual babbling]] is structurally identical to vocal babbling in its development.&lt;ref name="Petitto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petitto|first1=L.|last2=Marentette|first2=P.|title=Babbling in the manual mode: evidence for the ontogeny of language|journal=Science|date=22 March 1991|volume=251|issue=5000|pages=1493–1496|doi=10.1126/science.2006424|bibcode=1991Sci...251.1493P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants who grow up with a [[sign language]] babble with their hands.&lt;ref name="Petitto" /&gt; If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, he or she will still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.&lt;ref name="Petitto" /&gt;

All babies imitate with their hands the movements that they see. Typical [[Gestures in language acquisition|gesture]]s for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially.&lt;ref name="Bolhuis" /&gt; In addition, infants who grow up with a sign language begin to make gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.

After it was established that infants could babble with their hands and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt; Both go through a number of stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt; There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Petitto" /&gt; It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space.&lt;ref name="Bolhuis" /&gt; One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble is also one of the first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt;

Children are able to produce signs correctly, which is important since many articulation tendencies of manual babbling transfer to the children’s early sign production.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt; Children acquire signs for the same concepts as speaking children's words, and in the same stage of development.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt;

==Transition from babbling to language ==
Two hypotheses have been devised in order to explain how babbling is related to language development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
* '''The Discontinuity Hypothesis''' - This early hypothesis suggests that babbling has absolutely no relationship to language development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If true, infants would produce a full range of random sounds in no particular order during the babbling stage. However, it has been demonstrated that early babbling is quite limited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Supporters of this hypothesis also thought that children might drop certain sounds only to pick them up again in later months. Supporters proposed it would be possible for babies to incorrectly and inconsistently use sounds that they had already mastered in the early babbling stages later in life or even lose sounds altogether before learning how to speak. The hypothesis also implies that when children finally reach the age where they are able to learn their native language, they develop phonological sounds in an orderly manner. Over time, infants will relearn sounds and develop words in a specific language. Current evidence does not support these claims.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
Contemporary research supports the notion that babbling is directly related to the development of language as discussed in The Continuity Hypothesis. 
*'''The Continuity Hypothesis''' - According to this hypothesis, babbling is a direct forerunner to language. At first, infants produce universal sounds that exist in all areas of the world and in all languages. Reduplicated canonical babbling&lt;ref name="Role audition 3 babbling page"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oller|first=D. Kimbrough|author2=Eilers, Rebecca E.|title=The Role of Audition in Infant Babbling|journal=Child Development|year=1988|volume=59|issue=2|pages=441–449|doi=10.2307/1130323|jstor=1130323}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces a number of sounds but only some of them ("ma ma" and "da da", turning into "mommy" and "daddy", respectively) are recognized as meaningful and thus reinforced by caregivers and parents, while the others are abandoned as meaningless (this is the argument in, for instance, [[Susanne Langer]]'s ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=Alan Lyle|year=1963|title=The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|volume=4|issue=3|pages=297–306|jstor=2739612|doi=10.1086/200377}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis agrees with the claim that the anatomical changes of the vocal tract are very important, but suggests that the social environment in which an infant is raised has a greater influence on the development of language. Infants pay close attention to their caregivers' reactions and use their feedback as approval for the sounds that they are making. This reinforcement through feedback helps infants to focus their attention on specific features of sound. Social feedback facilitates faster learning and earlier production of a variety of advanced words.&lt;ref name="Social Feedback 7" /&gt; There is evidence that babbling varies depending on the linguistic environment in which a baby is raised. Current babbling research supports The Continuity Hypothesis. For example, it has been noted that infants raised in French speaking environments display greater amounts of rising intonation in comparison to infants raised in English speaking environments. This is likely due to the differences between French and English intonations while speaking. The ordering of consonants and vowels in the babbling of English, French, Swedish and Japanese infants also appears to resemble that of their native language. These findings support another hypothesis, the “babbling drift hypothesis” in which infant babbling resembles the phonetic characteristics of a child's native language through exposure to speech. When babies are exposed to two languages, their babbles resemble the language that they are most exposed to. The dominant language is considered to be the one that children have the most exposure to. Most often infants do not produce a blend of language styles while babbling however, may switch between languages. Sometimes infants may choose which language style they prefer to babble in based upon particular features.&lt;ref name="10 Language diff in bilingual"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulin-Dubois|first=Diane|author2=Goodz, Naomi|title=Language differentiation in bilingual infants: Evidence from babbling.|journal=Trends in Bilingual Acquisition|year=2001|pages=95–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The babbling drift hypothesis provides further support for The Continuity Hypothesis.

==Physiology==
The human mouth moves in distinct ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use different parts of their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of babbling, infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. This finding suggests that babbling is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Holowka, S. |author2=Petitto, L. A. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002|title=Left hemisphere cerebral specialization for babies while babbling.|url=|journal=Science |volume=297 |page=1515 |doi=10.1126/science.1074941|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[larynx]], or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends during the first year of life, allowing the [[pharynx]] to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like [[speech]] sounds.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Naomi S.

Reduplicated babbling (such as bababa) involves a rhythmic opening and closing of the jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolata|first=Jill K.|last2=Davis|first2=Barbara L.|last3=MacNeilage|first3=Peter F.|title=Characteristics of the rhythmic organization of vocal babbling: Implications for an amodal linguistic rhythm|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=31|issue=3|pages=422–431|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2007.12.014|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Frame Dominance Theory, when the [[mandible]] (jaw) is elevated, a [[consonant]] sound will be produced. When the mandible is lowered, a [[vowel]]-like sound is produced. Therefore, during a reduplicated sequence of sounds, the consonant and vowels are alternated as the mandible elevates and depresses. The opening and closing of the mouth alone will not produce babbling, and [[phonation]] (or voicing) is necessary during the movement in order to create a meaningful sound.  Other important oral structures involved in articulation, such as the tongue, lips and teeth remain in a stable resting position during babbling.&lt;ref name="3 co-occurence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schauwers|first=Karen|author2=Paul J Govaerts |author3=Steven Gillis |title=Co-occurrence patterns in the babbling of children with a cochlear implant.|journal=The syllable in speech production.|year=2008|pages=187–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes during the babbling period, the motions can be made without any vocalization at all.&lt;ref name=Cheek /&gt; Signing infants produce manual babbling through similar rhythmic alternations, but they perform with their hands instead of their mouths. As a baby goes beyond the reduplicated sequences of babbling, they exhibit equal sized mouth or hand openings on the right and left sides.&lt;ref name=Petitto /&gt;

== Abnormal development ==
Typically by 6 months of age, all normally developing children will babble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Human Development|last = Salkind|first = N. J.|publisher = Sage Publications|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Thousand Oakes: California|pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, infants with certain medical conditions or developmental delays may exhibit a delay or an absence of babbling. For example, infants who have had a [[tracheotomy]] typically do not babble because they are unable to phonate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Human Development|last = Salkind|first = N. J.|publisher = Sage Publications|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks: California|pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following decannulation, it has been found that these infants do produce more vocalizations, but the sounds or syllables are not as diverse as those found in typically developing infant's canonical babbling behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Babbling and early speech: continuity and individual differences|last = Locke|first = J.

Communication by infants with apraxia may instead be in the form of grunting and pointing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Infants with [[Autism spectrum|autism]] may show a delay in babbling, and in some cases it may be completely absent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Babbling in children with autism tends to occur less frequently than in typically developing children, and with a smaller range of syllables produced during the canonical babbling stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vocal Patterns in Infants with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Canonical Babbling Status and Vocalization Frequency|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-014-2047-4|journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date = 2014-01-31|issn = 0162-3257|pmc = 4117826|pmid = 24482292|pages = 2413–2428|volume = 44|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s10803-014-2047-4|language = en|first = Elena|last = Patten|first2 = Katie|last2 = Belardi|first3 = Grace T.|last3 = Baranek|first4 = Linda R.|last4 = Watson|first5 = Jeffrey D.|last5 = Labban|first6 = D. Kimbrough|last6 = Oller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbling may also be delayed in individuals who are born with [[Down syndrome]]. The canonical stage may emerge 2 months later for individuals with Down syndrome compared to other infants, although, when produced, it is similar to babbling in typically developing infants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Vocal babbling in deaf infants ===

Research has been conducted to determine whether or not infants with impaired hearing can demonstrate typical vocal sounds. Babbling can appear at the same age and in similar forms in hearing and deaf child, however, further continuation of babbling and speech development depends upon the ability for the child to hear themselves. For this reason, deaf children stop babbling vocally earlier than hearing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Babbling and the deaf child: a commentary on Lenneberg et al. (1965) and Lenneberg (1967)|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0305000900004840|journal = Journal of Child Language|date = 1982-06-01|issn = 1469-7602|pages = 511–515|volume = 9|issue = 2|doi = 10.1017/S0305000900004840|first = John H. V.|last = Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbling should appear if the child is exposed to language, but vocal babbling can be delayed or non-existent for deaf children.&lt;ref name="Cheek" /&gt; It is not clear whether spoken language can develop fully without auditory experience.&lt;ref name="Role audition 3 babbling page" /&gt; Deaf children are not only significantly delayed in spoken language development in comparison to their hearing counterparts, but they also produce fewer noises.&lt;ref name="5 rel of aud"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bass-Ringdahl|first=Sandie M.|year=2010|title=The Relationship of Audibility and the Development of Canonical Babbling in Young Children With Hearing Impairment|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=15|issue=3|pages=287–310|doi=10.1093/deafed/enq013|pmid=20457674|pmc=2912640}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that auditory experience is necessary in spoken language development. Some researchers have taken these findings as evidence against the hypothesis that language is an [[Innateness hypothesis|innate human capability]].&lt;ref name="3 co-occurence" /&gt;

A number of solutions have been used for hearing-impaired humans to gain auditory experience, one of which is [[hearing aids]]; they can be used to help infants reach babbling stages earlier.&lt;ref name="Role audition 3 babbling page" /&gt;  [[Cochlear implants]] have also been tested. Once the surgical implantation is complete, an infant has the opportunity to experience spoken language input. Once language has been heard, the infant begins to babble and speak in rhythmic patterns just as hearing infants do.&lt;ref name="3 co-occurence" /&gt;

==Evidence across species==
Though there is disagreement about the uniqueness of [[language]] to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Language 2Ed|last = Harley|first = Trevor|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-86377-867-4|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal babbling is restricted by physiological development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Songbirds===
Not only are [[songbird]] and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, they also are similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]] and his studies. [[Bird|Avian]] and [[mammalian]] brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may even be a [[gene]] that is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species' call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which is why this early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.&lt;ref name=Bolhuis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolhuis|first=J. J.|author2=Okanoya, K.|author3=Scharff, C.|title=Twitter evolution: Converging mechanisms in birdsong and human speech|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=11|issue=11|pages=747–759|doi=10.1038/nrn2931|pmid=20959859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young male songbirds produce varieties of immature songs that are referred to as babbling because the immature songs precede those that are fully developed. As with humans, if these songs are reinforced with positive social feedback, they are more likely to recur. Since the females do not sing songs, they are in charge of providing the feedback. If females provide more social signals as feedback, males will develop more mature songs at a faster rate than other male birds. Young birds require reinforcement from adults in order to finalize their songs. Another relation to human infants is that the amount of vocalizations is not key, but rather the quality of the sounds that is retained and resembles the final produce of language.&lt;ref name="Song birds second source"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Michael H |author2=Andrew P. King |author3=Meredith J. West|title=Social interaction shapes babbling: Testing parallels between birdsong and speech|year=2003|volume=100|issue=13 |pages=8030–8035|doi=10.1073/pnas.1332441100|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.8030G |pmc=164707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physiology of the animal is important. The properties of the ear and vocal tract, as well as the brain regions used in analyzing and processing information are critical determinants of how song is interpreted and later produced. In studies using isolated birds that have not had exposure to song, they produce an abnormal ‘isolate song’ that nevertheless contains species-specific aspects. This shows that the neural pathways have predetermined features that allow for such a phenomenon to occur.  The pathways are able to allow for plasticity of the songs that can be learned in the future.&lt;ref name=Bolhuis /&gt;

There is an important phase in development when song learning is best accomplished. This phase is called the ‘sensitive period’ and the amount of change that a songbird experiences in adulthood varies by species. Young birds have a production phase after a listening phase of development. The production of song is called ‘subsong’ where vocalizations resemble that of an adult as time passes. Memory for songs is able to form before the period where learning to sing occurs. Social interaction is important in vocal learning where non-singing females can even influence an infant through feedback.&lt;ref name=Bolhuis /&gt;

===Pygmy marmoset (''Cebuella pygmaea'')===

[[Pygmy marmoset]]s have been studied and found to produce complex vocalizations 2–3 weeks after birth. Both sexes are capable of creating calls at a rate of 3 calls/second and each bout of calls can last up to 6 or 7 minutes. A normal series of calls by a pygmy marmoset contains approximately 10 different call types. This variety of call forms produced by this creature is comparable to babbling in human infants for a number of reasons. Like reduplicative babbling in humans, the call is often repeated several times before a new sequence of sounds is produced.  The vocalizations gain attention from caregivers and provide practice for future vocal behavior. For these reasons, pygmy marmoset calls are seen as babbling behavior.&lt;ref name=Snowdon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=C. T.|author2=Elowson, A. M.|title='Babbling' in pygmy marmosets: Development after infancy|journal=Behaviour|year=2001|volume=138|issue=10|pages=1235–1248|doi=10.1163/15685390152822193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a total of 16 call types in pygmy marmoset babbling language. Different calls serve different survival functions such as when desiring food, social interaction or during times of alarm. As human infants have, marmoset babies have higher rates of social interaction when producing babbling sounds. During the juvenile age, marmosets often regress back to babbling stages if a new infant is born. It is suggested that their production of babbling calls increases because they are seeking attention and social interaction. Another babbling occurrence during the juvenile age is the addition of territorial calls and mild threat vocalizations. Although babbling is important for practising adult calls during the juvenile age, babbling decreases with age in pygmy marmosets.  Overall, babbling progresses through a series of stages from infancy to adulthood and slowly leads to the construction of adult calls.&lt;ref name=Snowdon /&gt;

===Sac-winged bat (''Saccopteryx bilineata'')===
Babbling-like behavior in songbirds, humans and some nonhuman primates has been previously researched, but it has not been researched until recently in non-primate mammals.  The [[sac-winged bat]] (''Saccopteryx bilineata'') is a social creature and the vocalizations that it produces depend on the social situation that the animal is in. This bat has a large repertoire of vocalizations with males being more vocal than females. [[Animal echolocation|Echolocation]] pulses, barks, chatters, and screeches are used in various social situations including courtship and territorial defense. Infants produce isolation calls if their mothers are absent, but the pups also produce vocalizations that mirror those of adults. Both sexes of infants babble, even though as an adult, the vocalizations are solely produced by males. Social context, mothers, and surrounding bats do not influence pups because the multiple vocalizations are combined regardless of the situation. Since there is not a social aspect correlated with the vocalizations, the productions of the sounds suggest that the pups vocalize for training. The pups repeat and combine adult vocalizations so that they resemble babbling in what humans, other primates and some songbirds do as infants. However, while human babbling increases social interactions, there are no social responses to babbling in bats. Babbling is common in infants that have a large repertoire of adult vocalizations to learn and this is seen in the pups of sac-winged bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knornschild|first=M. |author2=Behr, O. |author3=Von Helversen, O.|title=Babbling behavior in the sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata)|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=2006|volume=93|issue=9 |pages=451–454|doi=10.1007/s00114-006-0127-9|pmid=16736178|bibcode=2006NW.....93..451K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bagvalal language''' (Bagulal) is an [[Avar–Andic languages|Avar–Andic language]] spoken by the Bagvalals in southwestern [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]], along the right bank of the river [[Andi-Koisu]] and the surrounding hills, near the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n border. It is fairly similar to [[Tindi language|Tindi]], its closest relative. The 2010 Russian census recorded 1,450 Bagvalal speakers.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

The tradition and culture of the [[Bagvalal people]] is very similar to that of the [[Caucasian Avars|Avar people]], due to their common history within the [[Avar Khanate]].{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Bagvalal has three dialects which are named after the names of the villages in which they are spoken in. Only the [[Tlisi dialect]] has been studied to a certain significance, because of its similarities to the [[Tindi language]].{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Bagvalal has numerous loanwords from such languages as [[Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Avar language|Avar]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} It is only used as an oral language; Avar or Russian are used as written languages. Nowadays Bagvalal is only used in family settings, using Avar or Russian for every other area of communication.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

Bagvalal has been suffering severe problems and is in serious danger of extinction. The schooling and cultural revolution have contributed to Bagvalal's serious decline. Bagvalal pupils are taught in Avar in primary school, and in secondary school they are taught in Russian. Between 1950 and 1970, Bagvalals migrated to different districts in the [[Astrakhan]] province of Russia, and this also affected the Bagvalal language.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Despite this, most of the Bagvalal are supportive towards the language, and around 30~50% of children are fluent in the language.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Bagvalal was first mentioned in the 19th century, but very few recordings of the language have been made. There has been very little linguistic research done on the language.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The '''Bamum scripts''' are an evolutionary series of six scripts created for the [[Bamum language]] by [[King Njoya]] of [[Cameroon]] at the turn of the 19th century. They are notable for evolving from a [[pictographic]] system to a [[semi-syllabary|partially alphabetic syllabic script]] in the space of 14 years, from 1896 to 1910. Bamum type was cast in 1918, but the script fell into disuse around 1931.  A project began around 2007 to revive the Bamum script.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==History==
In its initial form, Bamum script was a pictographic mnemonic aid ([[proto-writing]]) of 500 to 600 characters. As Njoya revised the script, he introduced [[logograms]] (word symbols). The sixth version, completed by 1910, is a [[syllabary]] with 80 characters. It is also called ''a-ka-u-ku'' after its first four characetrs. The version in use by 1906 was called ''mbima''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13456456|title=The History of cartography|date=1987–2015|page=42|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Harley, J. B. (John Brian), Woodward, David, 1942–2004, Monmonier, Mark S.|isbn=9780226907284|oclc=13456456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script was further refined in 1918, when Njoya had copper [[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]] cast for printing. The script fell into disuse in 1931 with the exile of Njoya to [[Yaoundé]], Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.members.aon.at/africanfonts.at/bamum.htm The End of King Njoya and the Bamum Script]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, Bamum script is not in any significant use. However, the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]] is attempting to modernize and revive the script. The project is based in the old Bamum capital of [[Foumban]].&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization. In ''The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts'', ed. by Joshua A. Fishman and Ofelia García, pp. 23-32. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase A===
The initial form of Bamum script, called '''''Lewa''''' ("book"), was developed in 1896–1897.  It consisted of 465 pictograms (511 according to some sources) and 10 characters for the digits 1–10.  The writing direction could be top-to-bottom, left-to-right, or bottom-to-top.  (Right-to-left was avoided because that was the direction of the Arabic script used by the neighboring [[Hausa people]].)

===Phase B===
The second system, called '''''Mbima''''' ("mixed"), was developed in 1899–1900.  It was a simplification of the first; Njoya omitted 72 characters but added 45 new ones.  The writing direction was left-to-right in this and all subsequent phases.

===Phase C===
The third system, called '''''Nyi Nyi Nfa'''''' after its first three characters, was developed around 1902.  This simplification omitted 56 characters, leaving 371 and 10 digits. 
Njoya used this system to write his ''History of the Bamun People'' and in correspondence with his mother.

===Phase D===
The fourth system, called '''''Rii Nyi Nsha Mfw'''''' after its first four characters, was developed around 1907–1908. It has 285 characters and 10 digits and is a further simplification of the previous version.

===Phase E===
The fifth system, called '''''Rii Nyi Mfw' Men''''', was also developed around 1907–1908.  It has 195 characters and 10 digits and was used for a [[Bible]] translation.  These first five systems are closely related: All were progressively simplified pictographic protowriting with logographic elements.

===Phase F===
The sixth system, called '''''A Ka U Ku''''' after its first four characters, was developed around 1910. It has 82 characters and 10 numbers.  This phase marks a shift to a full syllabic writing system able to distinguish 160 syllables.  It was used to record births, marriages, deaths, and court rulings.

===Phase G===
The seventh and final system, called '''''Mfemfe''''' ("new") or '''''A Ka U Ku Mfemfe''''', was developed around 1918. It has only 80 characters, ten of which double as both syllables and digits.  Like the previous system, missing syllables are written using combinations of similar syllables plus the desired vowel, or with a diacritic.

==Description==
[[File:Bamum syllabary.gif|thumb|The Bamum syllabary, less diacritics, digraphs, and the ''{{IPA|nʒɛmli}}'']]
[[File:Bamun Kingdom.gif|thumb|250px|Map of the Kingdom of Bamun in present-day [[Cameroon]]]]
The 80 glyphs of modern Bamum are not enough to represent all of the [[consonant]]-[[vowel]] syllables (C V syllables) of the language. This deficiency is made up for with a [[diacritic]] or by combining glyphs having CV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values, for CV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This makes the script alphabetic for syllables not directly covered by the syllabary. Adding the inherent vowel of the syllable [[voiced consonant|voices]] a consonant: {{IPA|tu}} + {{IPA|u}} = {{IPA|/du/}}, {{IPA|fu}} + {{IPA|u}} = {{IPA|/vu/}}, {{IPA|ju}} + {{IPA|u}} = {{IPA|/ʒu/}}, {{IPA|ja}} + {{IPA|a}} = {{IPA|/ʒa/}}, {{IPA|ʃi}} + {{IPA|i}} = {{IPA|/ʒi/}}, {{IPA|puə}} + {{IPA|u}} = {{IPA|/bu/}}. 

The two diacritics are a [[circumflex accent|circumflex]] (''ko'ndon'') that may be added to any of the 80 glyphs, and a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''tukwentis'') that is restricted to a dozen. The circumflex generally has the effect of adding a glottal stop to the syllable, for instance {{IPA|kâ}} is read {{IPA|/kaʔ/}}, though the vowel is shortened and any final consonant is dropped in the process, as in {{IPA|pûə}} {{IPA|/puʔ/}} and {{IPA|kɛ̂t}} {{IPA|/kɛʔ/}}. Prenasalization is also lost: {{IPA|ɲʃâ}} {{IPA|/ʃaʔ/}}, {{IPA|ntê}} {{IPA|/teʔ/}}, {{IPA|ntûu}} {{IPA|/tuʔ/}}. Sometimes, however, the circumflex nasalizes the vowel: {{IPA|nî}} {{IPA|/nɛn/}}, {{IPA|pî}} {{IPA|/pin/}}, {{IPA|rê}} {{IPA|/rɛn/}}, {{IPA|jûʔ}} {{IPA|/jun/}}, {{IPA|mɔ̂}} {{IPA|/mɔn/}}, {{IPA|ɲʒûə}} {{IPA|/jun/}} (loss of NC as with glottal stop). Others are idiosyncratic: {{IPA|ɲʒə̂m}} {{IPA|/jəm/}} (simple loss of NC), {{IPA|tə̂}} {{IPA|/tɔʔ/}} (vowel change), {{IPA|ɲî}} {{IPA|/ɲe/}}, {{IPA|riê}} {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|m̂}} {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|ʃɯ̂x}} {{IPA|/jɯx/}}, {{IPA|nûə}} {{IPA|/ŋuə/}}, {{IPA|kɯ̂x}} {{IPA|/ɣɯ/}}, {{IPA|rə̂}} {{IPA|/rɔ/}}, {{IPA|ŋkwə̂n}} {{IPA|/ŋuət/}}, {{IPA|fɔ̂m}} {{IPA|/mvɔp/}}, {{IPA|mbɛ̂n}} {{IPA|/pɛn/}}, {{IPA|tî}} {{IPA|/tɯ/}}, {{IPA|kpâ}} {{IPA|/ŋma/}}, {{IPA|vŷ}} {{IPA|/fy/}}, {{IPA|ɣɔ̂m}} {{IPA|/ŋɡɔm/}}.&lt;ref name="L207023"/&gt;

The macron is a '[[killer stroke]]' that deletes the vowel from a syllable and so forms consonants and NC clusters ({{IPA|/nd, ŋɡ/}}) that can be used for [[syllable coda]]s. Consonantal {{IPA|/n/}} is used both as a coda and to prenasalize an initial consonant. The two irregularities with the macron are {{IPA|ɲʒūə}}, read as {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|ɔ̄}}, read as {{IPA|/ə/}}.  

The script has distinctive punctuation, including a 'capitalization' mark (''{{IPA|nʒɛmli}}''), visually similar to an inverted question mark, for proper names, and a decimal system of ten digits; the old glyph for ten has been refashioned as a zero.

Historical stages of Bamum script were added to [[Unicode]] in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0. These are encoded in the Bamum Supplement block as U+16800&amp;ndash;U+16A3F. The various stages of script development are dubbed "Phase-A" to "Phase-E". The character names note the ''last'' phase in which they appear.  For example, {{unichar|168EE|BAMUM LETTER PHASE-C PIN}} is attested through Phase C but not in Phase D.

{{History of Turkish literature}}
'''Cemâl Süreya''' (born '''Cemâlettin Seber'''; 1931 – 9 January 1990) was a Turkish poet and writer of [[Zazas|Zaza]] descent.

==Biography==
Of [[Alevi]] origin, after the 1938 [[Dersim Rebellion]], Süreya and his family were displaced to [[Bilecik]], a city in the [[Marmara Region]] of [[Turkey]].

He graduated from the Political Sciences Faculty of [[Ankara University]]. He was the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Papirüs]]'' [[literary magazine]]. Cemal Süreya is a notable member of the [[Turkish literature#Poetry|Second New Generation]] of [[Turkish poetry]], an abstract and postmodern movement created as a backlash against the more popular-based [[Garip]] movement. Love, mainly through its erotic character, is a popular theme of Süreya's works. Süreya's poems and articles were published in magazines such as ''Yeditepe'', ''Yazko'', ''Pazar Postası'', ''Yeni Ulus'', ''Oluşum'', ''Türkiye Yazıları'', ''Politika'', ''Aydınlık'', and ''Somut''. He is known to have been a primary influence on the poetry of [[Sunay Akın]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} He lost a letter "y" from his pen name – originally Süreyya – because of a lost bet with Turkish poet [[Sezai Karakoç]].&lt;ref name="Cemal Sureya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gastebursa.com/enCokOkunan/2011/11/12/29037/cemal-sureya-y-harfini-nasil-kaybetti.htm |title=Cemal Süreya 'y' harfini nasıl kaybetti? |publisher=Gastebursa.com |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-16 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124195619/http://www.gastebursa.com/enCokOkunan/2011/11/12/29037/cemal-sureya-y-harfini-nasil-kaybetti.htm |archivedate=24 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chômeur''', in the context of [[grammar]], is an element of a sentence that has been [[syntax|syntactically]] "demoted" from the nucleus to the periphery of a [[clause]]. The term comes from the [[French language|French]] word for "unemployed". In a [[passive voice|passive]] sentence, the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] is a chômeur, having been "demoted" from the central or nuclear function of [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. For instance, by changing the sentence ''Dogs attack the postman'' into ''The postman is attacked by dogs'', one transforms "dogs" into a chômeur.  The concept was introduced and used extensively in [[relational grammar]]. The term was suggested by the linguist [[Colette Craig]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">In [[computing]], '''Russification''' involves the [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] of [[computers]] and [[Software localization|software]], allowing the [[user interface]] of a computer and its software to communicate in the [[Russian language]] using [[Cyrillic script]].

Problems associated with Russification before the advent of [[Unicode]] included the absence of a single [[character encoding | character-encoding]] standard for [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] (see [[Cyrillic script#Computer encoding]]).

=={{anchor|RDOS|RDOS4.01|RDOS5.00|AlphabetPlus}}History of the MS-DOS russification==
The first official Russification of [[MS-DOS]] was carried out for [[MS-DOS 4.01]] in 1989/1990, released on {{start date|1990|4|9}}. In [[Microsoft]], the Russification project manager and one of its main developers was Nikolai Lyubovny (Николай Любовный).&lt;ref name="Starikov"&gt;[[Yuri Starikov]], [http://rdos401.org/ 15 Years of Russian MS-DOS 4.01] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.developers.org.ua/archives/koldovsky/2007/09/17/yuriy-starikov-interview/ {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian version of [[MS-DOS 5.0]] was also developed in 1991,&lt;ref name="Starikov"/&gt; released on {{start date|1991|8|9}}. Based on an initiative of Microsoft Germany in March 1991,&lt;!-- Paul Robeson? --&gt; derivates of the Russian MS-DOS 5.0 drivers used for keyboard, display and printer localization support (DISPLAY.SYS, EGA.CPI, EGA2.CPI, KEYB.COM, KEYBOARD.SYS, MSPRINT.SYS, COUNTRY.SYS, ALPHA.EXE) could also be purchased separately (with English messages) as part of Microsoft's ''AlphabetPlus'' kit. This enabled English issues of MS-DOS 3.3, 4.01 and 5.0 to be set up for Eastern European countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Starikov"/&gt;

==Russification of Microsoft Windows==

A comprehensive instruction set for computer Russification is maintained by Paul Gorodyansky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winrus.com Paul Gorodyansky] winrus.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is mirrored in many places and recommended by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/european/russify.html "Tips on viewing Cyrillic text"], U.S. LOC (assessed September 28, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dhimalish languages''', [[Dhimal language|Dhimal]] and [[Toto language|Toto]], are a small group of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in eastern India and Nepal.

==Classification==
Hammarström, et al.&lt;ref&gt;http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kena1236&lt;/ref&gt; note in [[Glottolog]] that Dhimalish is best considered to be a separate Sino-Tibetan branch rather than as a subgroup of Brahmaputran (Sal), and consider Dhimalish as failing to show sufficient Brahmaputran diagnostic vocabulary. Sotrug (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Sotrug, Yeshy T. (2015). ''Linguistic evidence for madeskā kirãntī. The phylogenetic position of Dhimalish''. Bern: University of Bern Master’s Thesis, 22 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Dhimalish to be particularly closely related to the [[Kiranti languages]] rather than to the [[Sal languages]].

Grollmann &amp; Gerber (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Grollmann, Selin and Pascal Gerber. 2017. ''[https://www.academia.edu/32861274/Linguistic_evidence_for_a_closer_relationship_between_Lhokpu_and_Dhimal Linguistic evidence for a closer relationship between Lhokpu and Dhimal: Including some remarks on the Dhimalish subgroup]''. Bern: University of Bern.&lt;/ref&gt; consider [[Lhokpu language|Lhokpu]] to have a particularly close relationship with Dhimal and Toto.

==Comparative vocabulary==
Sanyal (1973:77-81) provides a comparative word list of [[Toto language|Toto]] from Sunder (1895)&lt;ref&gt;Sunder, D. H. E. 1895. ''Survey and Settlement of Western Duars in the District of Jalpaiguri, 1889-1895''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Abraham Grierson]]'s ''[[Linguistic Survey of India]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, George A. 1909.

'''Enchant''' is a [[free software]] project developed as part of the [[AbiWord]] [[word processor]] with the aim of unifying access to the various existing [[spell-checker]] software. Enchant wraps a common set of functionality present in a variety of existing products/libraries, and exposes a stable API/ABI for doing so. Where a library doesn't implement some specific functionality, Enchant will emulate it.

Enchant is capable of having multiple backends loaded at once. As of May 2009 it has support for 8 backends:
* [[Aspell]]/[[Pspell]] (intends to replace Ispell)
* [[Ispell]] (old, could be interpreted as de facto standard)
* [[Hunspell]]/[[MySpell]] (a [[LibreOffice]] project, also used by [[Mozilla]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] and [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]])
* Uspell (primarily [[Yiddish]], [[Hebrew]], and Eastern European languages – hosted in AbiWord's [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] under the module "uspell")
* Hspell (Hebrew)
* AppleSpell ([[macOS|Mac OS X]])
* [http://voikko.sourceforge.net/ Voikko] (Finnish)
* Zemberek (Turkish)
*Forward and backward search to switch between the sources and the PDF

[[LaTeXila]] and [[gedit]] rely on the gspell library, which acts as a wrapper around enchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gspell |title=wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gspell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.gnome.org/swilmet/2015/11/20/gspell-news/ |title=gspell alongside GNOME 3.18 |date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.gnome.org/swilmet/2016/03/09/gspell-news-bis/ |title=gspell alongside GNOME 3.20 |date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enchant is currently licensed under [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), with an additional permission notice saying that any plugin backend can be loaded and used by Enchant. This ensures that it can use the native spell checkers on various platforms (Mac OS X, [[Microsoft Office]], [[Amazon Kindle]], etc.), and users can use their favorite third-party product to do the job.

'''Fair market value''' ('''FMV''') is an estimate of the [[market value]] of a [[property]], based on what a knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured [[buyer]] would probably pay to a knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured [[seller]] in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. An estimate of fair market value may be founded either on precedent or extrapolation. Fair market value differs from the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that an individual may place on the same asset based on their own preferences and circumstances.

Since market transactions are often not observable for assets such as privately held businesses and most personal and real property, FMV must be estimated. An estimate of fair market value is usually subjective due to the circumstances of place, time, the existence of comparable precedents, and the evaluation principles of each involved person.  Opinions on value are always based upon subjective interpretation of available information at the time of assessment. This is in contrast to an ''imposed value'', in which a legal authority (law, tax regulation, court, etc.) sets an absolute value upon a [[Product (business)|product]] or a [[Service (business)|service]].

An [[eminent domain]] taking, in lieu of a property sale, would not be considered a fair market transaction since one of the parties (in this case, the seller) was under undue pressure to enter into the transaction. Other examples of sales that would not meet the test of fair market value include a [[liquidation]] sale, [[deed in lieu of foreclosure]], distressed sale, and similar types of transactions.

==National definitions==

===United States===
In [[Taxation in the United States|United States tax law]], the definition of ''fair market value'' is found in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision in the ''Cartwright'' case:

::The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. ''United States v. Cartwright'', 411 U. S. 546, 93 S. Ct. 1713, 1716-17, 36 L. Ed. 2d 528, 73-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 12,926 (1973) (quoting from U.S. Treasury regulations relating to Federal estate taxes, at 26 C.F.R. sec. 20.2031-1(b)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4964174066744569590&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr#p551 |publisher=Google Scholar|litigants=United States v. Cartwright |vol=411  |reporter=U.S. |opinion=546 | date=1973|court=|quote=The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.|pinpoint=551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''fair market value'' is used throughout the [[Internal Revenue Code]] among other federal statutory laws in the USA including [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy]], many state laws, and several regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;to wit, Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-43&lt;/ref&gt; In litigation in many jurisdictions in the United States, the fair market value is determined at a hearing.  In certain jurisdictions, the courts are required to hold fair market hearings, even if the borrowers or the loans guarantors waived their rights to such a hearing in the loan documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins Jr.|first=W. Scott|title=The Arizona Court of Appeals Holds the Right to a Fair Market Value Hearing Cannot be Waived in a Deficiency Action|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/arizona-court-appeals-holds-right-to-fair-market-value-hearing-cannot-be-waived-defi|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=20 April 2014|author2=Alissa A. Brice|author3=Ryley Carlock &amp; Applewhite, PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Fair market value is not explicitly defined in the Income Tax Act.  That said, Mr. Justice Cattanach in ''Henderson Estate, Bank of New York v. M.N.R.'', (1973) C.T.C. 636 at p.&amp;nbsp;644 articulates the concept as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The statute does not define the expression "fair market value", but the expression has been defined in many different ways depending generally on the subject matter which the person seeking to define it had in mind. I do not think it necessary to attempt an exact definition of the expression as used in the statute other than to say that the words must be construed in accordance with the common understanding of them. That common understanding I take to mean the highest price an asset might reasonably be expected to bring if sold by the owner in the normal method applicable to the asset in question in the ordinary course of business in a market not exposed to any undue stresses and composed of willing buyers and sellers dealing at arm's length and under no compulsion to buy or sell. I would add that the foregoing understanding as I have expressed it in a general way includes what I conceive to be the essential element which is an open and unrestricted market in which the price is hammered out between willing and informed buyers and sellers on the anvil of supply and demand. These definitions are equally applicable to "fair market value" and "market value" and it is doubtful if the word "fair" adds anything to the words "market value."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In concert with this decision, the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) lists the following working definition in its on-line dictionary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fair market value generally means the highest price, expressed in dollars, that a property would bring in an open and unrestricted market between a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed, and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/csp/csp-f02-eng.html "Fair Market Value"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806233438/http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/csp/csp-f02-eng.html |date=2014-08-06 }} Canada Revenue Agency Dictionary. Retrieved 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the definition indicates, the Canadian and American concepts of fair market value are very similar. One obvious difference is that the Canadian working definition refers to "the highest price" whereas the American definition merely mentions "the price." It is debatable whether or not the presence of the word "highest" distinguishes the Canadian from the American definition.

'''Frank Moore Cross, Jr.''' (July 13, 1921&amp;nbsp;– October 16, 2012) was the Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages Emeritus at [[Harvard University]], notable for his work in the interpretation of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], his 1973 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic'', and his work in [[Northwest Semitic]] [[epigraphy]]. Many of his essays on the latter topic have since been collected in ''Leaves from an Epigrapher's Notebook''.

==Early life and education==
Cross was the son of Frank Moore Cross, a long-time pastor of Ensley Highland Presbyterian Church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. One of his uncles, the Rev. [[Laurance L. Cross]], was Mayor of [[Berkeley, California]] from 1947 to 1955.

Cross graduated from [[Ensley High School]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=Garrison-2010&gt;Garrison, Greg (March 20, 2010) "Old Ensley Highland Presbyterian organ reclaimed from empty church." ''Birmingham News''&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Maryville College]] in 1942 and a [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] from [[McCormick Theological Seminary]], where he was awarded the Nettie F. McCormick Fellowship in Old Testament Studies, in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Halpern and Jon D. Levenson, eds. ''Traditions in Transformation: Turning Points in Biblical Faith'', (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1981), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross went on to study under [[William F. Albright]], the founding father of [[Biblical Archaeology]], at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he received a [[PhD]] in 1950. He also received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1958. Cross was awarded a [[DPhil]] from the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1984 and a [[DSc]] from the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1990.

==Career==
From 1949–1950 Cross was a Junior Instructor in [[Semitic languages]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He was subsequently an instructor in Biblical History at [[Wellesley College]] from 1950–1951, an instructor in [[Old Testament]] at [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] 1951–1953, and an [[Associate Professor]] at the same institution from 1954-1957.

Cross was appointed Associate Professor in [[Old Testament]] at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1957. One year later, he was appointed [[Harvard University]]'s Hancock [[Professor]] of [[Hebrew]] and Other Oriental Languages, the third oldest university chair in the United States. He would hold this position from 1958–1992, then becoming Hancock Professor [[Emeritus]]. Cross was Curator of the [[Harvard Semitic Museum]] from 1958–1961 and Director of the Museum from 1974–1987.

Cross was a Fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1971–1972), a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]] (1978–1979), a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

During his tenure at Harvard, Cross supervised more than a hundred dissertations, with the result that many of today's senior scholars in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern studies are his former students. Among the most prominent of these are [[Emanuel Tov]], [[John J. Collins]], [[Jo Ann Hackett]], John Huehnergard, [[William G. Dever]], [[P. Kyle McCarter, Jr.]], Peter Machinist, [[Lawrence Stager]], [[Bruce Waltke]], [[Richard Elliott Friedman]], [[Hector Avalos]], and [[Mark S. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/news/frank-cross-birthday.asp Happy Birthday, Frank Cross] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103131508/http://www.bib-arch.org/news/frank-cross-birthday.asp |date=2011-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
Beginning June 1953, Cross was a member of the international committee responsible for editing the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which had been discovered at [[Qumran]]. Cross first heard of the scrolls in late 1948 while a student at [[Johns Hopkins University]], when he was shown pictures of the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]] by [[William F Albright|Albright]], who would later nominate Cross to the Scrolls editorial team.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S., (2014). Frank Moore Cross's Contribution to the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. American Schools of Oriental Research, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; On joining the team he was immediately allocated 61 Biblical [[manuscripts]] from Cave 4 at Qumran to prepare for publication. Initially, this involved cleaning the manuscripts in the [[Palestine Archaeological Museum]] where they were being worked on in the 'Scrollery'. As with several others on the team, Cross was financially supported between 1954 and 1960 by a [[John D Rockefeller]] subsidy. Cross was one of only two [[Americans|American]] scholars on the scroll-publication team, and he has since been recognized as a founder of Qumran studies. His general introduction to the topic is ''The Ancient Library of Qumran'', the third edition of which was published in 1995.

==Death==
Cross died in Rochester, New York in October 2012 after a long illness. He was 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yardley |first=William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/us/frank-moore-cross-biblical-scholar-and-dead-sea-scrolls-interpreter-dies-at-91.html |title= ''Frank Moore Cross, Biblical Scholar, Dies at 91 |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 1980, Cross received the Percia Schimmel Prize in [[Archaeology]] from the [[Israel Museum]] and the [[William Foxwell Albright]] Award in [[Biblical]] Scholarship. In 1991 he was awarded the Medalla de Honor de la Universidad Complutense ([[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]), the [[Gratz College]] Centennial Award in 1998 and a Lifetime Award in Textual Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture in 2004.

Cross was an Honorary Member of the [[Israel Exploration Society]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] Society for Old Testament Study. He was a [[trustee]] of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (1973–1991), and an Honorary Trustee from 1991; a Trustee of the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center (1979–1996) and a Lifetime Honorary Trustee from 1997; and a Trustee of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] Foundation since 1992.

'''Homo Sovieticus''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Soviet Man") is a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and critical reference to  an average [[conformist]] person in the [[Soviet Union]] also observed in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The term was popularized by Soviet writer and sociologist [[Aleksandr Zinovyev]], who wrote the book titled ''Homo Sovieticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4760109.stm |title=Soviet-era satirist Zinovyev dies |publisher=BBC News |date= 2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Heller]] asserted that the term was coined in the introduction of a 1974 monograph "Sovetskye lyudi" ("Soviet People")  to describe the next level of evolution of humanity thanks to the success of [[Marxism|Marxist]] social experiment.&lt;ref name="MGe"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cogs in the Wheel: The Formation of Soviet Man |last=Heller (Geller) |first=Mikhail |publisher= Alfred A.

In a book published in 1981, but available in ''[[samizdat]]'' in the 1970s, Zinovyev also coined an abbreviation ''homosos'' (''гомосос'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Lithuania in Old Hands: Effects and Outcomes of EUropeanization in Rural Lithuania |author=Harboe Knudsen, Ida |year=2013 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbqYAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=New%20Lithuania%20in%20Old%20Hands&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=homosos&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{main|New Soviet man}}
The idea that the [[Soviet system]] would create a new, better kind of [[Soviet people]] was first postulated{{when?|date=July 2018}} by the advocates of the system; they called the prospective outcome the "[[New Soviet man]]". ''Homo Sovieticus'', however, was a term with largely negative connotations, invented by opponents to describe what they saw as the real result of Soviet policies. In many ways it meant the opposite of the New Soviet man, someone characterized by the following:
* Indifference to the results of his labour (as expressed in the saying "They pretend they are paying us, and we pretend we are working").
* Lack of initiative and avoidance of taking any [[individual responsibility]] for anything. [[Jerzy Turowicz]] wrote: "it's a person enslaved, incapacitated, deprived of initiative, unable to think critically; he expects – and demands – everything to be provided by the state, he cannot and doesn't want to take his fate in his own hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = | title = Pamięć i rodowód | last = Turowicz | first = Jerzy | date = 1993 | journal = Tygodnik Powszechny | access-date = | issue = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proza.ru/2016/12/31/161 Liberi sine fano].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indifference to common property and to petty theft from the workplace, either for personal use or for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roca.org/OA/76-77/76f.htm 1917–1987: Unsuccessful and Tragic Attempt to Create a "New Man"].&lt;/ref&gt; A line from a popular song, "Everything belongs to the [[kolkhoz]], everything belongs to me" ("{{lang|ru|всё теперь колхозное, всё теперь моё}}" / ''vsyo teperь kolkhoznoe, vsyo teperь moyo''), meaning that people on collective farms treasured all common property as their own, was sometimes used ironically to refer to instances of petty theft.
* Chauvinism. The Soviet Union's restrictions on travel abroad and [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|strict censorship of information]] in the [[News media|media]] (as well as the abundance of [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda]]) aimed to insulate the Soviet people from Western influence. There existed non-public "ban lists" of Western entertainers and bands, which, in addition to the usual criteria of not conforming to fundamental Soviet values, were added to the list for rather peculiar reasons; one such example being the Irish band [[U2]], the name of which resembled that of [[Lockheed U-2]], a high-altitude U.S. reconnaissance airplane. As a result, "exotic" Western popular culture became more interesting [[Iron law of prohibition|precisely because it was forbidden]]. Due to limited exposure, entertainers considered minor, B-list, or of low artistic value in the West were regarded as [[A-list]] in the Soviet sphere. Soviet officials called this fascination "Western idolatry" / "Idolatry of the West" ({{lang|ru|идолопоклонничество перед Западом}} / ''idolopoklonnichestvo pered Zapadom'').
* Obedience to or passive acceptance of everything that government imposes (see [[authoritarianism]]).
* In the opinion of a former US ambassador to Kazakhstan, a tendency to drink heavily: "[a Kazakh defence minister] appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true ''Homo Sovieticus'' style – i.e., drinking oneself into a stupor".&lt;ref&gt;Greg McArthur [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/vain-shady-and-stupendously-fat-latest-wikileaks-like-a-teens-diary/article1818379/ "Vain, shady and stupendously fat: Latest WikiLeaks like a teen's diary"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Leszek Kołakowski|Leszek Kolakowski]], the [[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)| ''Short course'' history of the CPSU(b)]] played a crucial role in forming the key social and mental features of the Homo Sovieticus as a [[Doublethink|"textbook of false memory and double thinking"]]. Over the years, Soviet people were forced to continuously repeat and accept constantly changing editions of the ''Short course'', each containing a slightly different version of the past events. This  inevitably led to forming "a new Soviet man: ideological schizophrenic, honest liar, person always ready for constant and voluntary mental self-mutilations".&lt;ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=
The "Soviet man" is characterised by his tendency to follow the authority of the state in its assessment of reality, to adopt an attitude of mistrust and anxiety towards anything foreign and unknown, and is convinced of his own powerlessness and inability to affect the surrounding reality; from here, it is only a step towards lacking any sense of responsibility for that reality. His suppressed aggression, birthed by his chronic dissatisfaction with life, his intense sense of injustice and his inability to achieve self-realisation, and his great envy, all erupt into a fascination with force and violence, as well as a tendency towards "negative identification" – in opposition to "the enemy" or "the foreigner". Such a personality suits a quasi-tribal approach to standards of morality and law (the things "our people" have a right to do are condemned in the "foreigner").

== Homo post-sovieticus ==
Since 1991 interest has extended to the phenomenon of ''homo post-sovieticus''.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Soviet-style communism was a twentieth century social experiment that failed [...]. This experiment included the attempt to create a New Man, the Homo sovieticus (Kharkhordin 1999). One of the burning questions for post-Soviet Russia still is whether Homo post-sovieticus is capable of forming the human material for a new, prosperous, and democratic Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4126">'''Intrapreneurial Bricolage''' (IB) is the pursuit of entrepreneurial endeavors, operating within a larger organization using only limited, available resources.&lt;ref name="Halme-Innovation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halme |first1=Minna |last2=Lindeman |first2=Sara |last3=Linna |first3=Paula |title=Innovation for Inclusive Business: Intrapreneurial Bricolage in Multinational Corporations |journal=Journal of Management Studies |date=June 2012 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=743–784 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01045.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term combines the two concepts of [[intrapreneurship]] and [[bricolage]]. Intrapreneurship uses principles and strategies from the discipline of [[entrepreneurship]] and applies them within the confines of an organization rather than initiating new ones. Borrow from the French word for "makeshift job", bricolage is a type of art using whatever media is at hand. In the context of intrapreneurial bricolage, intrapreneurs find innovative ways to work with a scarcity of resources.
== Background ==
[[File:Levi-strauss 260.jpg|thumb|border|alt=Claude Lévi-Strauss|French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss]]
In [[The Savage Mind]], French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] discussed 'bricolage' as having roots in the French idea of a worker who uses his hands inventively to accomplish what other workers cannot. In his description of this jack-of-all-trades, Lévi-Strauss explains that there is no requirement for skills and tools to be highly specialized. Instead, this 'bricoleur' is flexible enough to be able to use minimal resources for multiple applications.&lt;ref name="LeviStrauss-TheSavage"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lévi-Strauss |first1=Claude |title=The savage mind |date=2000 |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226474847 |page=10 |edition=[10. print.]. |url=http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/levistrauss.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hidden Assets ==

One of the key principles of IB is finding utility in resources commonly overlooked.&lt;ref name="Mahajan-Technological"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahajan |first1=Aarti |last2=Clarysse |first2=Bart |title=Technological Innovation and Resource Bricolage in Firms: The Role of Open Source Software |journal=International Federation for Information Processing |date=2013 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_1.pdf |doi-broken-date=2018-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources can be divided into tangible and intangible assets. Often these assets are overlooked because they are obscured, dispersed or underutilized.&lt;ref name="Witell-A-Bricolage"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witell |first1=Lars |last2=Gebauer |first2=Heiko |last3=Jaakkola |first3=Elina |last4=Hammedi |first4=Wafa |last5=Patricio |first5=Lia |last6=Perks |first6=Helen |title=A bricolage perspective on service innovation |journal=Journal of Business Research |date=2017 |volume=79 |url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/S0148296317301091/1-s2.0-S0148296317301091-main.pdf?_tid=b4a4b439-d9d6-4617-8b33-f929511ae922&amp;acdnat=1530466967_448f38a7e1a7722e2059c6103706872c |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of hidden assets include:

* Personal Knowledge or Skills
* Networking
* Germinal Financing
* Information Technology

== Assessment ==
Measuring the success of IB initiatives is an essential part of the concept. One deliverable for IB is the generation of new products or services during specific times of scarcity in the organization's life cycle. Two such stages are during an organization's creation and also during times of growth.&lt;ref name="Chinyoka"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chinyoka |first1=S.

The '''JSLEE''' ([[JAIN]] Service Logic Execution Environment) is a [[Java programming language]] [[API]] for developing and deploying [[network service]]s. It was standardized in [[Java Community Process|Java Specification Requests]] [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=22 JSR 22] and [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=240 JSR 240] by [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[OpenCloud]] with the participation of more than 80 operators and software vendors.

The technical specification is designed so that implementations can meet the stringent requirements of communications applications, like high [[throughput]], [[low latency]], [[scalability]], [[availability]] and [[software portability]]. Furthermore, it allows [[software developer]]s to write robust components as it integrates the [[ACID]] properties of transactions into the programming model.

The JSLEE environment acts as an integration point for multiple network resources and [[communications protocol]]s.

The term can be used a number of ways. When a wrestler is [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] to lose a match it is described as "a job". The act itself is described with the verb '''jobbing''', while the act of booking (rather than being booked) to job is called '''jobbing out'''. To lose a match fairly (meaning without any [[kayfabe]] rules being broken) is to '''job cleanly'''.&lt;ref name=wrestle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingfortitude.com/info/dictionary.php |title=Wrestling Dictionary |publisher=Wrestling Fortitude |accessdate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002942/http://www.wrestlingfortitude.com/info/dictionary.php |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestlers who routinely (or exclusively) lose matches are known as '''jobbers'''. A regular jobber skilled at enhancing the matches he loses, as opposed to a mediocre local rookie or part-timer, is called a '''carpenter'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prowrestlinghistoricalsociety.com/hg-carpenters.html "Carpenters: Why They were Essential to Wrestling and Why They are So Needed Today", by Harry Grover, Pro Wrestling Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173309/http://www.prowrestlinghistoricalsociety.com/hg-carpenters.html |date=June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the post-kayfabe era the term has taken on a negative connotation, leading to the use of the neutral term ''enhancement talent''.&lt;ref name=f4enhance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/enhancement-era-return-wwe-jobber-217386|title=Enhancement Era: The Return of the WWE jobber|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A job which is presented as being the result of an extremely close, entertaining match, or underhanded tactics on the part of an opponent, will not necessarily tarnish a wrestler's reputation, especially if the situation is presented as one where the wrestler "deserved" to win but was cheated. At other times a high-profile loss, particularly one which makes the wrestler in question look weak, foolish, or otherwise damages their reputation, might signify certain behind-the-scenes events that have real-life implications on a wrestler. Such a job may mark the end of a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]], a departure from the company, or a loss of faith in the wrestler as a marketable commodity. As a result, it may also mark a downward slide in a wrestler's career. This is especially the case when the wrestler is beaten very easily, or [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]].

Sometimes, jobbing is presented to a wrestler because of the problems and bad working relationship that the wrestler and the owner of the promotion actually have. At other times, it is a requirement of a wrestler's on-the-job training, learning how to perform in front of a live audience while helping make the more established wrestlers look credible.

[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) has referred to jobbers as ''lovable'', ''adorable'' "losers". Sometimes they euphemistically use the term ''"local competitor"''.

==Historic usage==
Jobber is a professional wrestling term used to describe a wrestler who is routinely defeated by main eventers, mid-carders, or low-carders. Most promoters do not use the term because of the negative connotation. Jobbers have been used since the 1950s, and they were popular in promotions of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] around this time.

[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) made greatest use of full-time jobbers during their syndicated television shows in the 1980s and early 1990s, ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' and ''[[WWF All-Star Wrestling|All-Star Wrestling]]''. [[Barry Horowitz]] and [[Steve Lombardi]] were the wrestlers most prominently identified with this role; other wrestlers who performed mainly as jobbers during this period included [[Lanny Poffo|"Leaping" Lanny Poffo]], [[Dean Peters|Brady Boone]], [[Tiger Chung Lee]], [[Barry Orton|Barry O]], [[Neal Hargrove|Reno Riggins]], [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Duane Gill]], [[Barry Hardy]], [[Mick Foley|Jack Foley]], [[Scott Casey]], [[Dangerous Danny Davis]] (also wrestling as Mr. X), [[Los Conquistadores#The Shadows|The Shadows]]  ([[Randy Colley]], and [[Jose Luis Rivera]]), [[Los Conquistadores]] (Jose Luis Rivera and [[José Estrada Sr.]]), [[Mike Sharpe|Iron Mike Sharpe]], [[Vito LoGrasso|Von Krus]], [[Conrad Efraim|S.D. Jones]], [[George South]], [[Dusty Wolfe]], [[Mario Mancini]], [[Tim Horner]], Sonny Rogers, Brian Costello, Red Tyler, and Tom "Rocky" Stone. Many of these wrestlers also did work matches against each other at larger arena cards at venues such as [[Madison Square Garden]] and were usually more competitive against their opponents, with several of these wrestlers gaining victories. In some cases, a number of these wrestlers had main-event matches at some point (such as Sharpe receiving matches against then-WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Bob Backlund]] or Danny Davis working in six-man tag tag-team matches with The Hart Foundation, usually against Tito Santana and the British Bulldogs (during the "dishonest referee" angle)) before being pushed toward the bottom of the roster's hierarchy; others, such as Mick Foley, would later become main-event wrestlers. Some were given gimmicks of their own, such as Poffo (a poet laureate as a face and as a snobbish intellectual, known as "The Genius", who also read poems as a heel) and Lombardi ("The Brooklyn Brawler", a smug, tough-talking brawler).

[[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), just like the WWE, made huge use of jobbers during the late 1980s and 1990s. Jobbers like [[DeWayne Bruce|Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker]], [[Bobby Walker (wrestler)|Bobby Walker]], [[Joe Gomez (wrestler)|Joe Gomez]], [[The Gambler (wrestler)|The Gambler]], [[The Roadblock]] and Trent Knight lost the majority of their matches. However, they usually scored clean victories against other pure jobbers. Wrestlers who worked as jobbers for WWE were also employed as jobbers in WCW during this period.

The [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) also made moderate use of jobbers in their shows. In [[independent circuit|independent promotions]] jobbers rarely appear, but when they do, it is mostly in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squash matches]].

A jobber may not necessarily lose, only make the superstar look powerful - or at least make another wrestler interfering with the match to look more powerful. One example is [[Jimmy Jacobs]]: employed by WWE as a jobber for a time, Jacobs wrestled [[Eddie Guerrero]] during the latter's last heel run. Though Jacobs was squashed, he actually won by disqualification when Guerrero beat him with a chair. Another example of a jobber winning was when "[[Sean Waltman|The Kid]]" suddenly won an upset over [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]] on the May 17, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. He then renamed himself the "1-2-3 Kid".&lt;ref name="WaltmanSpotlight"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spotlight On... Sean Waltman|work=The Wrestler/Inside Wrestling|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=Volume 15, 2007|pages=24–28|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This win (and the Kid) were worked into Ramon's [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ted DiBiase]], with DiBiase taunting Ramon repeatedly over losing to a nobody until he too was pinned by the Kid. On the September 20, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[Mike Rotunda|I.R.S.]] was pinned with a rollup by [[Justin Credible|P.J. Walker]] thanks to Ramon's interference.&lt;ref name=SLAM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/waltman.html|accessdate=2008-08-03|title=Sean Waltman at SLAM sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|SLAM! Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobbers can also get recognition on [[social media]] after appearing on a major promotion, giving them exposure they wouldn't receive otherwise. While being interviewed by [[Byron Saxton]] before his match against [[Braun Strowman]] in 2016, independent wrestler [[Johnny Knockout]] said he wanted to wrestle Strowman because "he likes [[Bear (gay culture)|big, sweaty men]]". The unexpected response led to Knockout eventually trending on [[Twitter]] ahead of other events on that night's ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0823/616864/braun-strowman-raw-victim/&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=May 2017}}

Heels and some faces used to abuse and humiliate jobbers during or after a match: [[Jake Roberts]] would allow his pet snake slither over his opponents once he pinned them; [[Brutus Beefcake]] would cut their hair off (on those sporting long hair or a [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]]); [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] would cuff them to the ropes and beat them with a baton; [[Ted DiBiase]] would put them under the [[Million Dollar Dream]] and then stuff a hundred dollar bill in their mouths; [[Lex Luger]], under his "Narcissitic" gimmick, would make them stand up by holding them by the hair and make them look at themselves in a mirror; [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|the Islanders]] would chew some fruit (usually pineapple) and then spit it over their chests, and so on. Some jobbers like Trent Knight, Cougar Jay, Tim Parker, Reno Riggins, Tommy Angel, Bob Emory, Ricky Nelson, Curtis Thompson, the Mulkey Brothers, Kenny Kendall, Red Tyler, Eddie Jackie, among others, grew to become household names to fans due to this, and fans would expect to see the humiliating act after the match. Jake "The Snake" Roberts got Bob Emory's and Trent Knight's heads inside the sack where he kept his python snake; Dick Murdoch smashed the aforementioned Emory against a podium and then hit him with a piece of wood, Kenny Kendall got hogtied twice by Bunkhouse Buck at the end of a match, Reno Riggins was made to put a woman's dress on.

==Jobbers==
A slightly higher position is "jobber to the stars" (also known as a "glorified jobber"), which is a wrestler who defeats pure jobbers and mid-carders but who consistently lose to top-level or up-and-coming stars. For example, Dolph Ziggler in the WWE is widely considered to have these traits. This often happens to popular [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] and sometimes [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] towards the end of their careers. Many of these jobbers to the stars are "heels" (villains) who routinely beat up on "nice guy" jobbers ("faces") so as to build up a reputation of being reasonably capable competitors (which makes the stars all the more impressive when they in turn defeat them easily) as well as to earn the contempt of the audience who enjoy seeing them finally get their comeuppance when they take on the tougher wrestlers. Heels can also be jobbers, such as [[Steve Lombardi]] during the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1980s, Lombardi teamed with [[Barry Horowitz]], to form a heel team. However, Lombardi and Horowitz ended up losing most of their matches in the WWE. In addition, [[Triple H]] was given the role of "jobbing to the stars" by WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] in the summer of 1996 as punishment for the [[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Madison Square Garden Incident]].

There are times, however, when a jobber will prove their skill, determination, and/or loyalty to the business, and move beyond jobber status. [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]], who served as high-level jobbers during their initial WWE runs, later became main-eventers. [[Billy Kidman]] initially started out as a jobber in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), before moving up the ranks to become a champion in both the WCW and WWE. [[Paul Roma]], who started as a jobber for the WWE in the 1980s, gained enough popularity in WCW to win that promotion's Tag Team Titles with partners such as [[Paul Orndorff]] and [[Arn Anderson]], the latter as part of the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]]; however, in Roma's case, he went downhill again some time later. The brothers [[the Hardy Boyz]] began their careers in WWE as jobbers for a few years, before receiving their first push as legitimate contenders in the tag division.

Sometimes the opposite will occur, as was in the case of [[Mike Sharpe|"Iron" Mike Sharpe]], who started as a normal wrestler in the independent circuit and the WWE, and eventually ended up being a heel jobber. Another example is [[Siva Afi]], who was a successful main-eventer/mid-carder in the independent circuit, including challenging [[Ric Flair]] for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] World Heavyweight Championship to a 60-minute time limit draw in front of 20,000 people, eventually ended up being a jobber in the WWF, which eventually led to other local promotions to give him a jobber position. A tag-team known as The Undertakers that did well on the independent circuit became jobbers when they joined the WWF in 1992 and became known as Double Trouble.

Sometimes, jobbing may be used as a gimmick. While in ECW, [[Al Snow]] began referring to jobbing on-screen as part of his gimmick. He subsequently formed a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] called [[The J.O.B. Squad]], composed of prominent jobbers. In [[World Championship Wrestling]], the tendency of the Armstrongs, (particularly [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]) to lose matches was referred to as the "Armstrong curse". On average, however, Brad Armstrong was more of a jobber to the stars, while his brothers were pure jobbers for the most part, though Brian Armstrong would find the greatest success of the brothers in WWE as the [[Road Dogg]]. In 2003, after he returned from his neck injury, [[Chris Kanyon]] did a jobber angle, in which his gimmick was "Who's Better Than Kanyon? Nobody". He ended up jobbing to opponents on ''[[WWE Velocity]]''. A jobber angle involved [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP), whose continual losses during the end of 2008 – including embarrassing losses in which he was pinned by roll-ups from mid-level WWE superstars – cost him the signing bonus he received when he joined WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/mvpbigthingsarepoppingagain|title=Big things are poppin' again|date=2009-01-20|last=Burdick|first=Michael|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">A large number of languages known only from brief mentions are thought to have been [[Uto-Aztecan languages]], but became extinct without being documented. The following list is based on {{harvcoltxt|Campbell|1997|pages=133–135}}.

*'''[[Nicoleño language|San Nicolás]]''' ('''Nicoleño'''): spoken in California, thought to be a [[Takic languages|Takic language]].
*'''Giamina/Omomil''':&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|omom1235|Omomil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kroeber (1907) and Lamb (1964) believe Giamina may constitute a separate branch of Northern Uto-Aztecan, although Miller (1983) is uncertain about this. It was spoken in Southern California.
*'''Vanyume''': a [[Takic languages|Takic language]] of California
*'''[[Acaxee]]''' ('''Aiage'''): closely related to [[Tahue language|Tahue]], a Cahitan language, linked with [[Tebaca language|Tebaca]] and [[Sabaibo language|Sabaibo]].
*'''Amotomanco''' ('''Otomoaco'''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|amot1239|Amotomanco}}&lt;/ref&gt; uncertain classification, possibly Uto-Aztecan. (See Troike (1988) for more details.)
*'''[[Caxcan|Cazcan]]''' ('''Caxcan'''): sometimes considered to be the same as '''Zacateca''', although {{harvcoltxt|Miller|1983}} would only consider these to be geographical classifications.
*'''Baciroa''': closely connected to Tepahue
*'''Basopa'''
*'''Batuc''': possibly an Opata dialect
*'''Cahuimeto'''
*'''Cahuameto''': probably belongs with Oguera and Nio
*'''Chínipa''': may be a Tarahumaran language close to Ocoroni, since colonial sources claim the two are mutually intelligible. It may also instead be a local name for a variety of Guarijío.
*'''Coca''': spoken near [[Lake Chapala]].
*'''Colotlan''': a Pimic language closely related to Tepehuan, or Teul and Tepecano
*'''Comanito''': a Taracahitic language closely related to Tahue
*'''Concho''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|conc1237|Concho}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably a Taracahitic language (Troike 1988). Subdivisions include '''Chinarra''' and '''Chizo'''; '''Toboso''' is possibly related to Concho as well.
*'''Conicari''': a Taracahitic language closely related to Tahue
*'''[[Guachichil]]''': possibly a variant or close relative of Huichol
*'''Guasave''': possibly a Taracahitic language, or may instead be non-Uto-Aztecan language possibly related to [[Seri language|Seri]] due to the speakers' maritime economy (Miller 1983). Dialects include Compopori, Ahome, Vacoregue, and Achire.
*'''Guazapar''' ('''Guasapar'''): probably a Tarahumara dialect, or it may be more closely related to Guarijío and Chínipa. Guazapar, Jova, Pachera, and Juhine may possibly all be dialects of Tarahumara.
*'''Guisca''' ('''Coisa''')
*'''Hio''': possibly a Taracahitic language
*'''Huite''': closely related to Ocoroni, and may be Taracahitic
*'''Irritila''': a Lagunero band
*'''Jova''' ('''Jobal''', '''Ova'''):&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|jova1234|Jova}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often linked with Opata, although some scholars classify it as a Tarahumara dialect. Miller (1983) considers it to be "probably Taracahitan."
*'''[[Jumano]]''';&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|juma1248|Jumano}}&lt;/ref&gt; also Humano, Jumana, Xumana, Chouman (from a French source), Zumana, Zuma, Suma, and Yuma. Suma is probably the same language, while Jumano is possibly Uto-Aztecan.
*'''Lagunero''': may be the same as Irritila, and may also be closely related to Zacateco or Huichol.
*'''Macoyahui''': probably related to Cahita.
*'''Mocorito''': a Tahue language, which is Taracahitic.
*'''Naarinuquia''' ('''Themurete'''?): Uto-Aztecan affiliation is likely, although it may instead be non-Uto-Aztecan language possibly related to [[Seri language|Seri]] due to the speakers' maritime economy.{{sfn|Miller|1983}}
*'''Nacosura''': an Opata dialect
*'''Nio''': completely undocumented, although it is perhaps related to Ocoroni.
*'''Ocoroni''': most likely a Taracahitic language, and is reported to be mutually intelligible with Chínipa, and similar to Opata. Related languages may include Huite and Nio.
*'''Oguera''' ('''Ohuera''')
*'''Patarabuey''': unknown affiliation ([[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] region near [[Lake Chapala]]), and is possibly a Nahuatl dialect.
*'''Tahue''': may also include Comanito, Mocorito, Tubar, and Zoe. It is possibly a Taracahitic language, and is definitely not Nahuan.
*'''Tanpachoa''':&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|tanp1235|Tanpachoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; unknown affiliation, {{sfn|Troike|1988}} and was once spoken along the Río Grande.
*'''[[Tecuexe]]''': speakers were possibly part of a "Mexicano" (Nahua) colony.
*'''[[Teco-Tecoxquin]]''': an Aztecan language
*'''[[Tecual]]''': closely related to Huichol. According to Sauer (1934:14), the "Xamaca, by another name called Hueitzolme [Huichol], all ... speak the Thequalme language, though they differ in vowels."
*'''Témori''': may be a Tarahumara dialect.
*'''Tepahue''': possibly a Taracahitic language. Closely related languages or dialects include Macoyahui, Conicari, and Baciroa.
*'''[[Tepanec]]''': an Aztecan language.
*'''[[El Teúl|Teul]]''' ('''Teul-Chichimeca'''): a Pimic language, possibly of the Tepecano subgroup.
*'''[[Tobosos|Toboso]]''': grouped with Concho.
*'''Topia''': perhaps the same as Xixime (Jijime).
*'''Topiame''': possibly a Taracahitic language.
*'''[[Totorame language|Totorame]]''': grouped with Cora.
*'''Xixime''' ('''Jijime'''): possibly a Taracahitic language. Subdivisions are Hine and Hume. Its links with Acaxee are uncertain.
*'''[[Zacateco]]''': often considered the same as Acaxee, although this is uncertain. It is possibly related to Huichol, although Miller (1983) leaves it as unclassified.
*'''Zoe''': possibly a Taracahitic language, with Baimena as a subdivision. It is possibly affiliated with Comanito.

'''''Literacy with an Attitude''''', written by Patrick J. Finn, attempts to redefine [[literacy]] as the term exists within the education field.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In his professional life, Finn served as an Associate Professor Emeritus of the Graduate School of Education from the [[University at Buffalo|University of Buffalo]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Johnson, L. (2005). ''Urban education with an attitude''. Albany: State Univ. of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He also and co-chairs a committee of Urban Education through the University of Buffalo that helps provide support for the schools and school districts in Buffalo, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gse.buffalo.edu/about/directory/faculty/10373|title=Patrick Finn {{!}} UB Graduate School of Education|website=gse.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book outlines the differences between 'domesticating' and 'liberating' education, and offers advice on how to fix the discrepancy between upper and lower class schools. Finn references studies conducted by other published authors within the field of education, including Jean Anyon&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]].

== Synopsis ==

=== Chapters 1-3 ===
Finn outlines different socioeconomic levels at which schools exist, and dissects the educational practices that are common for each.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Whiting, E. (2011). Literacy with an attitude: Educating working-class children in their own self interest.  ''Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy, 54(8),'' pp. 638-640.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of schools include executive elite, affluent professional, middle class, and working class schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Working class schools are characterized by work being seen as a procedure, with the dominant theme as [[wikt:resistance|resistance]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Middle class schools are characterized by work as getting the right answer, with a dominant theme of possibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Affluent professional schools are characterized by work being carried out as creative activity carried out independently, with a dominant theme of [[individualism]] with a minor theme of [[humanitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Executive elite schools are characterized by the dominant theme of excellence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chapters 4-6 ===
This section outlines the difference between immigrant and involuntary minorities. Finn introduces the concept of oppositional identities observed by John Ogbu,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literacy as Praxis: Culture, Language, and Pedagogy|last=Ogbu|first=John U.|publisher=Ablex, Publishing Corporation|year=1991|isbn=|editor-last=Walsh|editor-first=Catherin E.|location=Norwood, N.J|pages=|chapter=Cultural Diversity and School Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that some students, such as those from working-class backgrounds, see their cultures are directly opposed to what is being taught in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Finn illustrates that students with oppositional identities find it more challenging to self advocate for their education than those who do not have them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chapters 7-10 ===
This section discusses the dynamics between lower, middle, and upper class students and the ways they use language. Lower class students were often noted to use implicit language, middle and upper class students use explicit language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finn also argues that all students regardless of their socioeconomic status should have access to empowering education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finn discusses how a community comes together to form a [[discourse]]. Students get their primary discourse from their family but in the larger society students will develop a secondary discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students with oppositional identities often have trouble acquiring the dominant discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In chapter ten, Finn introduces the four types of literacy. There is performative, functional, informational, and powerful literacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These literacies exist within society.

=== Chapters 11-12 ===
Chapter eleven reviews the history of schooling in America. After reviewing the beginnings of the educational system, Finn explains that Corresponding Societies questioned authority and exercised power to learn, discuss, evaluate, conclude, formulate, and exchange.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is more like literacy “with an attitude” than a defeated form of literacy expressed earlier in the book. The chapter continues by going through the history of Corresponding Societies until settling on that this ultimately became an education for domestication.

In chapter twelve, Finn discusses [[New literacies|New Literacies]] by giving an example of a classroom that uses it. In New Literacies, communication is indistinct and expression is emphasized over correctness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Gatekeeping" is a mode of correctness that often deters from the content of what the student is trying to communicate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finn argues then that the approach of New Literacies could help this problem. Finn then discusses ways that New Literacies is difficult to employ in the classroom. An ideal classroom to promote democracy would be similar to that of New Literacies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chapters 13-20 ===
From chapters thirteen to twenty, Finn claims to offer solutions to the problems he poses in the text’s earlier chapters. He bases much of his proposed solution on the work of [[Paulo Freire]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literacy with an Attitude (second edition)|last=Finn|first=Patrick J.|publisher=SUNY|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4384-2806-2|location=Albany, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friere suggests that problems should be diagnosed and eliminated through activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/|title=Paulo Freire|last=|first=|date=|website=Freire Institute University of Central Lancashire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon this, Finn recommends Frieian motivation in the classroom, or the idea of teachers teaching students to stand up for themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He provides research that supports this thesis, as well as exemplar organizations that are already using this type of education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cae.americananthro.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Finn_Patrick-Literacy_with_an_Attitude.pdf|title=Inquiry and Learning for Change|last=Watkins|first=John M.|date=September 2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== At Publication ===
When the book was first published, education scholars had mixed reviews. Some, like John M. Watkins, note that the book holds to strong ideals that cannot be enacted. In his review, Watkins states that ''Literacy with an Attitude'' is "passionate" and "urgent".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  He says that Finn does not present himself at a distance from the subject.  Instead, Watkins states that this book should be read by those who are worried about the failure of schools in their attempts to "Educate all our citizens into a powerful democratic discourse".  However, Watkins believes that we will not be able to utilize Finn's advice.  He states that he does not believe that we have the will and that we will not be able to "help working-class children develop literacy with an attitude".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Throughout his review, Watkins repeatedly mentions his "discomfort" that occurred while reading ''Literacy with an Attitude.''  Watkins attributes this "discomfort" to the direct nature of Finn's writing.  Watkins states that the most uncomfortable moment was Finn's personal anecdote of "his own painful realizations of the extent to which public education has betrayed him".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In contrast, Honey Halpern notes that the book presents great contributions to the education community. In her review, Halpern states that Finn's book opened up "new and perceptive ways of looking at familiar situations" in education.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Honey|date=April 2000|title=Literacy with an Attitude|url=|journal=Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy|volume=43|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her review, she notes that Finn's identification of politics in education is outwardly insightful. Halpern argues that the change that Finn is looking for is possible through aligning curriculum with powerful literacy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She concludes by urging that all teachers learn about the effective ways to help middle class students become literate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Since Publication ===
''Literacy with an Attitude'' has been accepted by others in the education field, including [[Donna Alvermann|Donna E. Alvermann]], a professor of Literacy at the University of Georgia, who has served as the director of the National Reading Research Center, and has published extensively on literacy and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.readinghalloffame.org/donna_alvermann|title=Donna E. Alvermann (Inducted 1999) {{!}} Reading Hall of Fame|website=www.readinghalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvermann referenced Finn’s discussion of “domesticating education” in her article “Reading adolescents’ reading identities: Looking back to see ahead,” to point out the flaws of the “deprivation approach” an approach to literacy that suggests struggling readers are disadvantaged. She says that when students are thought of this way, they often receive domesticating education and social inequality. For that reason, the label “struggling reader” should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvermann|first=Donna E|date=2001|title=Reading adolescents' reading identities: Looking back to see ahead.|url=|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|volume=44 |issue=8|pages=680–681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosalie Romano, an education professor at [[Western Washington University]], explained in her review that Finn's argument on teaching powerful literacy as a matter of justice is significant to societal challenges to "our environment, to our infrastructure, to our social systems, and to our public institutions".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Romano, Rosalie M. (2012) "Literacy with an Atitude: Educating Working-Class Children in their Own Self-Interest By Patrick J. Finn," Journal of Educational Controversy: Vol. 6: No. 1, Article 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to literacy that she approaches in response to "Literacy with an Attitude" is one of engagement and purpose in a democratic society.

Critiques of ''Literacy with an Attitude'' come from Whiting in his outline of the book; he states that although Finn has a well put together argument, he does not provide readers with practical and applicable solutions to enact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Influence on the Education Community ===

The '''grammar of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]''' is, in many respects, similar to that of some other [[Balkans|Balkan]] languages (constituent languages of the ''[[Balkan sprachbund]]''), especially [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. Macedonian exhibits a number of grammatical features that distinguish it from most other [[Slavic languages]], such as the elimination of [[grammatical case|case declension]], the development of a suffixed [[definiteness|definite]] [[article (grammar)|article]], and the lack of an [[infinitive|infinitival]] verb, among others.

The first printed Macedonian grammar was published by [[Gjorgjija Pulevski]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manu.edu.mk/roots/roots.htm Gjorgjija Pulevski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415012642/http://www.manu.edu.mk/roots/roots.htm |date=2008-04-15 }} on the site of MANU.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
The Macedonian orthography (правопис, ''pravopis'') encompasses the [[spelling]] and [[punctuation]] of the Macedonian language.

=== Alphabet ===
{{main|Macedonian alphabet}}

The modern Macedonian alphabet was developed by linguists in the period after the [[World War II|Second World War]], who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], though a similar writing system was used by [[Krste Misirkov]] in the late 19th century. The Macedonian language had previously been written using the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] and later using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] with local adaptations from either the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]] or [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]] alphabets.

The following table provides the upper and lower case forms of the Macedonian alphabet, along with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] value for each letter:

{| cellpadding="10" style="margin:auto; text-align:center;"

The cursive version of the alphabet is slightly different:

[[File:Macedonian cursive script.svg|border|center|500px]]

=== Punctuation ===
[[Punctuation]] (интерпункција, ''interpunkcija'') marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type ([[syntax|syntactic]] use), [[abbreviation]]s, et cetera.

Marks used in Macedonian include [[Full stop|periods]] (.), [[question mark]]s (?), [[exclamation mark]]s (!), [[comma (punctuation)|commas]] (,), [[semicolon]]s (;), [[colon (punctuation)|colons]] (:), [[dash]]es (–), [[hyphen]]s (-), [[ellipsis|ellipses]] (...), different types of inverted commas and [[quotation mark]]s ( ‚‘, „“), [[bracket]]s ((), [], {}) (which are for syntactical uses), as well as [[apostrophe (mark)|apostrophes]] (',’), [[slash (punctuation)|solidi]] (/), [[equal sign]]s (=), and so forth.

== Syntax ==
The canonical [[word order]] of Macedonian is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object), but word order is variable. Word order may be changed for poetic effect ([[Inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] is common in [[poetry]]).

Generally speaking, the syntactic constituents of the language are:{{ref|Opsta}}:

:''sentence'' or ''clause''- the sentence can be simple and more complex.
:''noun phrase'' or ''phrase'' - one or more words that function as single unit.
:''complex sentence'' - a combination of two sentences and clauses.
:''text'' - a set of sentences that are syntactically and semantically linked.

== Morphology ==
[[File:Zborovni grupi.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Macedonian word classes. Open word classes are in blue, whereas closed word classes are in green.]]

Words, even though they represent separate linguistic units, are linked together according to the characteristics they possess. Therefore, the words in Macedonian can be grouped into various groups depending on the criteria that is taken into consideration. Macedonian words can be grouped according to the meaning they express, their form and their function in the sentence. As a result of that,  there are three types of classification of the Macedonian words: ''semantic'', ''morphological'' and ''syntactic classification''.{{ref|Opsta}}

According to the semantic classification of the words, in the language there are eleven word classes: ''nouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, particles, interjections and modal words''.{{ref|Opsta}}

Nouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns and verbs belong to the ''[[open word class]]'', whereas the prepositions, adverbs, conjunctions, particles, interjections and modal words belong to the ''[[closed word class]]''. This is the morphological classification of the words. Finally, there are two large groups according to the syntactic classification. The larger part of the words belong to group of ''[[lexical word]]s'', and such words are: nouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and modal words. The prepositions, conjunctions, particles and interjections belong to the group of ''[[function word]]s''{{ref|Opsta}}.

=== Nouns ===
Macedonian '''[[noun]]s''' (именки, ''imenki'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter'') and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (''singular'' and ''plural''), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.{{ref|Friedman2001p17}}

The Macedonian nominal system distinguishes two '''[[grammatical number|numbers]]''' (''singular'' and ''plural''), three '''[[grammatical gender|genders]]''' (''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''), '''[[grammatical case|case]]''' and '''[[definiteness]]'''. Definiteness is expressed by three '''[[definite article]]s''' pertaining to the position of the object (''unspecified'', ''proximate'' and ''distal'') which are suffixed to the noun.

==== Definiteness ====
The '''[[Article (grammar)|article]]''' (член, ''člen'') is [[wikt:postfix|postfixed]], as in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. In Macedonian there is only the [[definite article]]. One feature that has no parallel in any other standard Balkan language&lt;ref name="Bulgarian"&gt;Standard Bulgarian has only the unspecified form, although three definite article forms exist in certain Bulgarian dialects, notably the vernaculars of [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]] and parts of the [[Rhodopes]] {{ref|stoykov2002a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the existence of three definite articles pertaining to position of the object: ''medial and/or unspecified'', ''proximal'' (or ''close'') and ''distal'' (or ''distant'').

| −не (−ne)
| −не (−ne)
| −на (−na)
|-
|}

Examples:
* Јас го видов човекот (''Jas go vidov čovekot'', 'I saw the man', medial): the subject, 'man', is either close to the interlocutor or its position is unspecified;
* Јас го видов човеков (''Jas go vidov čovekov'', 'I saw the man', proximal): the subject, 'man', is close to the speaker (and possibly the interlocutor(s) as well);
* Јас го видов човекон (''Jas go vidov čovekon'', 'I saw the man', distal): the subject, 'man', is far from both the speaker and the interlocutor(s).

==== Vocative case ====
Macedonian lost the traditional (Slavic) grammatical cases during its development and became an [[analytic language]]. The case endings were replaced with a complex system of prepositions; however, there are still some traces left of the vocative case in contemporary Macedonian. The [[vocative case]] is formed by adding the endings '–o' (for feminine nouns), '–u' (for masculine monosyllabic nouns), and '–e' (for masculine polysyllabic nouns). For example, пријател {{IPA-mk|ˈprijatɛɫ|}} ('friend') takes the form of пријателе {{IPA|[priˈjatɛlɛ]}} ('friend!').&lt;ref name="Vocative"&gt;Compare with other languages in the Balkan sprachbund; Bulgarian: ''приятел'' and ''приятелю''; Serbo-Croatian: ''prijatelj'' and ''prijatelju''; Greek: ''φίλος'' and ''φίλε''; Romanian: ''prieten'' and ''prietene''.&lt;/ref&gt; The vocative is used almost exclusively for singular masculine and feminine nouns.

=== Pronouns ===
{{main|Macedonian pronouns}}

Macedonian pronouns decline for [[grammatical case|case]] ('падеж'), i.e., their function in a phrase as [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (ex. '''јас''' 'I'), direct object ('''него''' 'him'), or object of a preposition ('''од неа''' 'from her').

Based on their meaning and their function in a sentence, pronouns fall into one of the following categories:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Types of pronouns
! Examples
|-
| [[Demonstrative|Demonstrative pronouns]] || ова (''ova'', 'this'), она (''ona'', 'that'), овде (''ovde'', 'here'), таму (''tamu'', 'there')

=== Verbs ===
Macedonian has a complex system of verbs (глаголи, ''glagoli''). Generally speaking Macedonian verbs have the following characteristics, or categories as they are called in the [[Macedonistics]]: tense, mood, person, type, transitiveness, voice, gender and number.

According to the categorization, all Macedonian verbs are divided into three major subgroups: ''a-subgroup, e-subgroup'' and ''i-subgroup''. Furthermore, the e-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: a-, e- and i-subgroups. This division is done according to the ending (or the last vowel) of the verb in the simple present, singular, third person.{{ref|Opsta}}
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

The Macedonian simple verb forms are:
* [[Present tense]]  (сегашно време)
* [[Imperfect]] (минато определено несвршено времe, 'past definite incomplete tense')
* [[Aorist]] (минато определено свршено време, 'past definite complete tense')
* [[Imperative mood|Imperative]]  (заповеден начин)
* Verbal l-form (глаголска л-форма)
* Verbal adjective (глаголска придавка)
* [[Verbal noun]] (глаголска именка)
* Verbal adverb (глаголски прилог)

{{col-2}}

The Macedonian complex verb forms are:
* [[Perfect (linguistics)|Perfect]] of imperfective verbs (минато неопределено несвршено време, 'past indefinite incomplete tense')
* [[Perfect (linguistics)|Perfect]] of perfective verbs (минато неопределено свршено време, 'past indefinite complete tense')
* [[Past perfect]] tense (предминато време)
* [[Future tense]]  (идно време)
* Future-in-the-past (минато-идно време)
* Future perfect tense (идно прекажано)
* Potential mood (можен начин)
* Have-construction (има-конструкција)
* Be-construction (сум-конструкција)
* To-construction (да-конструкција)
{{col-end}}

==== Simple verb forms ====

===== Present tense =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na segašnoto vreme.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Macedonian Present tense represented on a timeline. The red colour denotes fact, the blue denotes current event and the green notes future event.]]

The Present tense (сегашно време, ''segašno vreme'') is used to express present actions and actions that overlap with the moment of speaking and this meaning is expressed with the use of imperfective verbs. Besides that, the Present tense can be formed with the perfective verbs as well, but then it is not true present action, but more likely future in the past. Besides the present action, with the forms of present tense there is possibility to express{{ref|Opsta}}:
* ''past events'' - the forms are the same, but the meaning refers to certain past event. This usually occurs when telling stories or retelling events.
* ''future events'' - the forms are the same, but the meaning refers to the future. Usually, these types of events are time-table or schedule of tasks that are planned.
* ''general facts'' - expressing common knowledge that is always same.
* ''routines and habits''
* ''expressing preparedness and events that occur at same time'' - the speaker expresses that (s)he is ready to do certain tasks and expressing two actions that occur at the same time.

The forms of the [[Present tense|Present simple]] in Macedonian are made by adding suffixes to the verb stems. In the following tables are shown the suffixes that are used in Macedonian and one example for each verb subgroup.

{{col-end}}

Here are some examples where the usage of Present tense in Macedonian is applied:

: Јас јадам леб. (''Jas jadam leb.'',  'I eat bread.')
: Додека тој јаде, ти чисти ја собата. (''Dodeka toj jade, ti čisti ja sobata.'', 'While he eats, you clean the room.')
: Автобусот за Скопје тргнува во 5 часот. (''Avtobusot za Skopje trgnuva vo 5 časot.'', 'The bus for Skopje leaves at 5 o'clock.')
: Ако ја грееш водата, таа врие. (''Ako ja greeš vodata, taa vrie.'', 'If you heat the water, it boils.')
: Секој ден јас гледам сериски филм. (''Sekoj den jas gledam seriski film.'', 'Every day I watch a serial film.')

===== Imperfect =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na imperfektot.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Macedonian Imperfect represented on a timeline. The blue colour denotes witnessed action, the green denotes past conditional action and the red denotes past progressive event.]]

The [[imperfect]], or referred to as 'past definite incomplete tense' (минато определено несвршено време,''minato opredeleno nesvršeno vreme''), is used to express past actions where the speaker is a witness of it or took participation in it. In order to express such an action or state, imperfective verbs are used. Also, there is a possibility to express an action with perfective verbs, but then before the verb there should be some of these prepositions or particles: ако (''ako'', 'if'), да (''da'', 'to') or ќе (''ḱe'', 'will'). It is important to mention that when perfective verbs are used, then there is expression of conditional mood, past-in-the-future or other perfective aspects, but not witnessed past actions. Besides the basic usage of the Imperfect, with this tense in Macedonian can be expressed and{{ref|Opsta}}:
* ''conditional mood'' - as it is mentioned with perfective verbs,
* ''weak command'' - usually a polite request,
* ''past actions that were repeated for some period''
* ''preparedness'' - the speaker expresses that (s)he is ready to do certain tasks.

:Ако не брзаше, ќе немаше грешки. (''Ako ne brzaše, ḱe nemaše greški.'',  'If you weren't rushing, you would not make mistakes.')
:Да ми помогнеше малку? (''Da mi pomogneše malku?'', 'What about helping me a bit?')
:Секој ден стануваше во 7 часот и готвеше кафе. (''Sekoj den stanuvaše vo 7 časot i gotveše kafe.'',  'He was getting up every day at 7 o'clock and making coffee.')

===== Aorist =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na aoristot.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Macedonian Aorist represented on a timeline. The red colour denotes finished action, where as the blue uncertain future finished action.]]

The [[aorist]], also known as 'past definite complete tense'  (минато определено свршено време, ''minato opredeleno svršeno vreme''), is a verb form that is used to express past finished and completed action or event, with or without speakers participation in it. The duration of the action that is expressed with the aorist can be long or short. For aorist, in Macedonian are used perfective verbs, but sometimes, though very rarely, in non-standard folk speech there may be usage of imperfective verbs. Besides this basic usage, the aorist also can be used to express{{ref|Opsta}}:
* ''future event'' - the form is standard aorist, but the meaning refers to the future, usually near future as a consequence of the previous action.
* ''condition'' - past condition
* ''general fact'' - rarely used, usually in popular proverbs.

The formation of the aorist for most verbs is not complex, but there are numerous small subcategories which must be learned. While all verbs in the aorist (except ''сум'') take the same endings, there are complexities in the aorist stem vowel and possible consonant alternations. {{ref|Kramer}}

&lt;small&gt;''Note: ''∅'' indicates a zero ending.'' The suffix -ja is used for verbs of the I-division of I-subgroup and for the division of E-subgroup without vowel, i.e. ''izmi - izmija (wash - washed)''&lt;/small&gt;

==== Complex verb forms ====

===== Perfect of perfective verbs =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na minatoto neopredeleno svršeno vreme.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Macedonian Present Perfect represented on a timeline. The action is finished, but it is not specified when the action took place.]]

The Macedonian tense минато неопределено свршено време (''minato neopredeleno svršeno vreme'', 'past indefinite complete tense'), or referred to as 'perfect of perfective verbs',  functions similarly as the English Present perfect simple. The forms of the Macedonian present perfect are formed with the forms of 'to be' in present tense plus the L-form of the conjuncted verb, which is always perfective. Important to note is that for third person singular there is no presence of the verb 'to be'.{{ref|Opsta}} This form of the Macedonian perfect is sometimes called 'sum-perfect'. The declination of one perfective verb in Macedonian looks as the following one, which is the verb прочита (''pročita'', 'read'):

{| class="wikitable"
! || &lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;singular&lt;/span&gt;|| &lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;plural&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;

|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
|Ти си прочитал&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ti si pročital&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; || Вие сте прочитале&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Vie ste pročitale&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;
|Тој прочитал&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Toj pročital&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Таа прочитала&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Taa  pročitala&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Тоa прочиталo&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Toа pročitalо&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ||Тие прочитале&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tie pročitale&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|}

As an example of this tense, the sentence ''"I have read the book"'' is taken and translated in Macedonian:

{|class=wikitable
|-
| Јаc||сум||ја||прочитал||книгата.
|-
| Jas||sum||ja||pročital||knigata.
|-
| ''I''||''am''||''it (clitic)''||''read''||''book-the''
|}

Macedonian developed an alternative form of the sum-perfect, which is formed with the auxiliary verb 'to have' and a verbal adjective in neutral, instead of the verb 'to be' and verbal l-form. This is sometimes called 'ima-perfect'.

{| class="wikitable"
! || &lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;singular&lt;/span&gt;|| &lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;plural&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;
|Јас имам прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jas imam pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ||Ние имаме прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nie imame pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
|Ти имаш прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ti imaš pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; || Вие имате прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Vie imate pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;
|Тој има прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Toj ima pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Таа има прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Taa  ima pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Тоa има прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Toа ima pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ||Тие имаат прочитано&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tie imaat pročitano&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|}

There is a slight difference in meaning between 'sum-perfect' and 'ima-perfect'.

===== Perfect of imperfective verbs =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na minatoto neopredeleno nesvršeno vreme.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Macedonian Present Perfect Progressive represented on a timeline. The action is past and progressive, but there is not information about the results and when it happened.]]

The English tense 'Present perfect continuous' functions similarly as the Macedonian tense минато неопределено несвршено време (''minato neopredeleno nesvršeno vreme'', 'past indefinite incomplete tense') or known as 'perfect of imperfective verbs'. This perfect tense is formed similarly as the perfect of perfective verbs i.e. with the present tense forms of 'to be'  and the L-form of the conjuncted verb, but this time the verb is imperfective. Important to note is that for third person singular there is no presence of the verb 'to be'.{{ref|Opsta}} The declination of one imperfective verb in Macedonian looks as the following one, which is the verb ''чита'' (read):

{| class="wikitable"

Like the perfect of perfective verbs, Macedonian also developed an alternative form of the sum-perfect, which is formed with the auxiliary verb 'to have' and a verbal adjective in neutral, instead of the verb 'to be' and verbal l-form. This is sometimes called 'ima-perfect'.

|-

There is also a slight difference in meaning between 'sum-perfect' and 'ima-perfect' regarding perfect of imperfective verbs. Ima-perfect usually denotes resultative meaning.

===== Future tense =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na idnoto vreme.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Future tense represented on a timeline. The action is expected to occur after the moment of speaking.]]

With the forms of future tense in Macedonian are expressed actions that are planned to happen in future. Usually, when we speak about future, we mean expressing events that should happen soon, however, there is a special form in Macedonian to express future events from past perspective, or event that happened after some other event and this is treated as separate tense called 'Future-in-the-past'.

The simple future tense is formed by adding the clitic ќе (''ḱe'', 'will') to the inflected present tense form of the verb. In this respect, both Macedonian and Bulgarian differ from other [[South Slavic languages]], since in both the clitic is fixed, whereas in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] it inflects for person and number {{ref|tomic2003}}. The negative form of the future tense in Macedonian is made by adding the particles нема да (''nema'' + ''da'') or just не (''ne'') before the verb pattern, whereas the interrogative form is made by adding the question word дали (''dali''), also before the verb pattern. When we use the negative form ''nema da'', there is not presence of the clitic ''ḱe''. Usually, ''ḱe'' in English is translated with the modal verb 'will', and vice versa. When an event is expressed with the use of ''ḱe'', then it is considered normal future, but there is a stronger future event as well which is made with the construction: има (''ima'', 'have') + да ('da', 'to') + present simple form of the verb{{ref|Opsta}}.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Besides the main usage, the future tense is used to express{{ref|Opsta}}:
* ''past events'' - expressing events that somehow refer to the future,
* ''orders'' - giving orders or commands to someone,
* ''prediction'' - predicting something,
* ''general facts'' - usually for proverbs or things that are considered as facts,
* ''events that repeat after some period'',
* ''possibility'' - possible future events.

Some of these mentioned rules, can be recognized in the following examples:
:Јас ќе одам во Скопје. (''Jas ḱe odam vo Skopje'') – I will go to Skopje.
:Јас отидов во визбата и што ќе видам, сето вино беше на подот. (''Jas otidov vo vizbata i što ḱe vidam, seto vino isteklo na podot.'', 'I went to the basement and, lo and behold, all of the wine was spilled on the floor.')
:Ќе ме слушаш и ќе траеш. (''Ḱe me slušaš i ḱe traeš.'', 'You will listen to me and you will say no words.')
:Колку е стар твојот дедо? Ќе да има 70 години. (''Kolku e star tvojot dedo? Ḱe da ima 70 godini.'', 'How old is your granddad? He'd have to be [at least] 70 years old.')
:Ќе направам сè само да се венчам со Сара. (''Ḱe napravam sè samo da se venčam so Sara.'', 'I'd do anything just to marry Sara.')
:Ќе одиш на училиште и крај! (''Ḱe odiš na učilište i kraj!'', 'You will go to school, and that’s it!')

===== Future-in-the-past =====
[[File:Grafički prikaz na minatoto-idno vreme.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Macedonian Future-in-the-past represented on a timeline. The arrow represents the aspectuality, which means the clause carries future reference.]]

Future-in-the-past is expressed by means of the same clitic ќе (ḱe, 'will') and a past tense forms of the verb:

{|class=wikitable
| ќе||доjдеше
|-
| ''ḱe''||''dojdeše''
|-
| will (clitic)||he came (imperfective aspect)&lt;br&gt;He would come/he would have come.
|}

An interesting fact is that a past tense form of the verb can be used in a future sense as well, although this construction is mostly limited to older speakers.

Examples:
* Те отепав, штом те фатам. (''Te otepav, štom te fatam.'', 'I have killed you, when I get you')
* Те фатам ли, те казнив. (''Te fatam li, te kazniv.'', 'As soon as I grab you, I have punished you')

In this respect, Macedonian is different from Bulgarian: Macedonian is consistent in the use of ''ќе'' as a clitic, whereas the equivalent Bulgarian construction involves the inflection of the clitic for tense, person and number as a regular verb (щях да дойда, 'I would [have] come'; щеше да дойде, 'he would [have] come').

=== Adjectives ===
[[Adjective]]s (придавки, ''pridavki'') agree with nouns in [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Definite article|definiteness]] with their noun and usually appear before it.

==== Comparison ====
Adjectives have three '''[[Comparison (grammar)|degrees of comparison]]''' (степенување на придавки, ''stepenuvanje na pridavki'') – [[positive (linguistics)|positive]], [[comparative]] and [[superlative]]. The positive form is identical to all the aforementioned forms. The other two are formed regularly, by prepending the [[grammatical particle|particle]] ''по'' and the word ''нај'' directly before the positive to form the comparative and superlative, respectively, regardless of its comprising one or two words.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive
! Comparative
! Superlative
|-
| тежок (''heavy'') || &lt;u&gt;по&lt;/u&gt;тежок (''heavier'') || &lt;u&gt;нај&lt;/u&gt;тежок (''heaviest'')
|-
| долг (''long'') || &lt;u&gt;по&lt;/u&gt;долг (''longer'') || &lt;u&gt;нај&lt;/u&gt;долг (''longest'')
|}

Macedonian only has one adjective that has an irregular comparative – ''многу''.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive
! Comparative
! Superlative
|-
| многу (''a lot'') || повеќе (''more'') || &lt;u&gt;нај&lt;/u&gt;многу (''the most'')
|}

A subtype of the superlative – the absolute superlative – also present in some other [[South Slavic languages]] and [[Romance languages]] (such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), expresses the highest quality without comparison. It is formed by [[prefix]]ing the particle пре (''pre'') to an adjective, roughly corresponding to the [[English language|English]] 'very + adjective' or 'too + adjective' combinations.

=== Prepositions ===
[[Prepositions]] (предлози, ''predlozi'') are part of the closed word class that are used to express the relationship between the words in a sentence. Since Macedonian lost the case system, the prepositions are very important for creation and expression of various grammatical categories. The most important Macedonian preposition is на (''na'', 'of', 'on' or 'to'). Regarding the form, the prepositions can be: '''simple''' (''vo, na, za, do, so, niz, pred, zad,'' etc.) and '''complex''' (''zaradi, otkaj, nasproti, pomeǵu,'' etc.). Based on the meaning the preposition express, they can be divided into:{{ref|Opsta}}{{ref|kratka}}{{ref|Kepeski}}

|They can be determined by the question word ''како'' {{IPA|[ˈkakɔ]}} ('how').

|They can be determined by the question word ''колку'' {{IPA|[ˈkɔlku]}} ('how much/ how many').
|}

Having in mind the fact that the preposition "на" is the most frequently used in the language, it may be used to express different meaning{{ref|Opsta}}{{ref|kratka}}:
* time, e.g. Штрковите &lt;u&gt;на&lt;/u&gt; зима се преселуваат на југ. (''Štrkovite na zima se preseluvaat na jug.'', 'The storks move to south in winter.')
* manner, e.g. Тој &lt;u&gt;на&lt;/u&gt; шега го удри пријателот. (''Toj na šega go udri prijatelot.'', 'He hit the friend for fun.')
* purpose, e.g. Ние ќе одиме &lt;u&gt;на&lt;/u&gt; скијање. (''Nie ḱe odime na skijanje.'', 'We will go skiing.')
* possession, e.g. Таа е сестрата &lt;u&gt;на&lt;/u&gt; Марко. (''Taa e sestrata na Marko.'', 'She is the sister of Marko.')
* comparison, e.g. Детено многу личи &lt;u&gt;на&lt;/u&gt; брат му. (''Deteno mnogu liči na brat mu.'', 'That child looks like his brother, a lot.')

=== Particles ===
The [[particle (linguistics)|particles]] (честички, ''čestički'') are [[closed word class]] that have grammatical function. The particles are used to determine other words, form some grammatical categories and emphasize some words or phrases. Regarding the function of the particles, they can be divided into the following groups: {{ref|Opsta}}{{ref|Koneski}}
* particles used to emphasize something
:e.g. ''барем'' {{IPA|[ˈbarɛm]}} ('at least'), ''само'' {{IPA|[ˈsamɔ]}} ('just'), ''сè'' {{IPA|[sɛ]}} ('all'), etc.
* particles used to separate a person or an object from a larger group
: e.g. ''само'' {{IPA|[ˈsamɔ]}} ('only'), ''единствено'' {{IPA|[ɛˈdinstvɛnɔ]}} ('solely'), ''исклучиво'' {{IPA|[isˈklut͡ʃivɔ]}} ('only'), etc.
* particles for joining things
: e.g. ''исто'' {{IPA|[ˈistɔ]}} ('same'), ''исто така'' {{IPA|[ˈistɔ taka]}} ('also'), ''притоа'' {{IPA|[ˈpritɔa]}} ('besides that'), etc.
* particles for quantity
: e.g. ''речиси'' {{IPA|[ˈrɛt͡ʃisi]}} ('almost'), ''скоро'' {{IPA|[ˈskɔrɔ]}} ('almost', 'nearly'), ''точно'' {{IPA|[ˈtɔt͡ʃnɔ]}} ('right'), ''рамно'' {{IPA|[ˈramnɔ]}} ('equal'), etc.
* particles for exact determination of something
: e.g. ''имено'' {{IPA|[ˈimɛnɔ]}} ('namely'), ''токму'' {{IPA|[ˈtɔkmu]}} ('precisely'), etc.
* particles for approximate determination of something
: e.g. ''−годе'' {{IPA|[-ɡɔdɛ]}}, ''−било'' {{IPA|[-bilɔ]}}, ''− да е'' {{IPA|[da ɛ]}}. These particles should be combined with other words, they do not stand on their own.
* particles for indication of something
:e.g. ''еве'' {{IPA|[ˈɛvɛ]}} ('here'), ''ене'' {{IPA|[ˈɛnɛ]}} ('there), ете {{IPA|ˈɛtɛ}} ('there'), etc.
* particles for negative sentences
:e.g.  ''не'' {{IPA|[[nɛ]]}} ('no', 'not'), ''ниту'' {{IPA|[ˈnitu]}} ('neither'), ''нити'' {{IPA|[ˈniti]}} ('neither') and ''ни'' {{IPA|[ni]}} ('nor').
* particles for interrogative sentences
:e.g. ''ли'' {{IPA|[li]}}, ''дали'' {{IPA|[ˈdali]}}, ''зар'' {{IPA|[zar]}}, ''али'' {{IPA|[ˈali]}} and ''нели''{{IPA|[ˈnɛli]}} (question tag)
* particles for imperative sentences
:e.g. ''да'' {{IPA|[da]}} ('to') and ''нека'' {{IPA|ˈnɛka}} ('let')

== Phraseology ==
{{Main|Macedonian phraseology}}

The group of words that are used in the language as one unit, word construction, are called [[Phraseology|phraseological units]] or in Macedonian ''фразеологизми'' (''frazeologizmi'').  The phraseological units have special linguistic characteristics and meaning. Within one sentence, the words may be joined together in order to create units of various types. For instance, the word ''nut'' can be combined with many adjectives, such as ''big nut'', ''small nut'' etc. Moreover, the word ''nut'' can be combined with other parts of speech as well, such as with verbs as in the sentence ''I ate a nut''. {{ref|kratka}}

These types of combinations are led by the general principles of the [[phraseology]], which states that the words in the sentences can be freely combined. Within these combinations or collocations, each word keeps its original meaning, so the meaning of the whole construction is equal to the meaning of its constituents.{{ref|kratka}}

Besides the word construction with loose connections, in Macedonian there are word constructions that are not freely combined, which means they are permanently combined together. As an illustration of these two types of connections are the following sentences, where the noun phrase "hard nut" is used{{ref|kratka}}:
* ''It is a &lt;u&gt;hard nut&lt;/u&gt; and it cannot be cracked easily.''
* ''We will be &lt;u&gt;hard nut&lt;/u&gt; for our opponent.''

In the first sentence, "hard nut" is a common collocation, where the words are connected freely and can be changed with other words in different contexts. On the other hand, in the second sentence the noun phrase "hard nut" (i.e. ''a hard nut to crack'') is an expression that means "strong, unbreakable" and the words are in strong connection and they are not changed with other words. If these words are changed, the meaning of the phrase will be lost.

== Onomastics ==
{{Main|Macedonian Onomastics}}

Macedonian onomastics ({{lang-mk|Македонска ономастика|translit=makedonska onomastika}}) is a part of [[Macedonistics]] that studies the names, surnames and nicknames of the [[Macedonian language]] and people. This is relatively new linguistic discipline. In Macedonia, and in the Macedonistics in general, it developed during the 19th century, where the first few research results have been provided. The Onomastics for a long period of time has been considered as part of various different scientific disciplines, such as [[Geography]], [[History]] or [[Ethnography]], until it became a discipline on its own in the 20th century. The Macedonian Onomastics, generally speaking, is divided into ''toponomastics'' and ''anthroponomastics''.{{ref|Opsta}}

'''Nyelâyu''' (Yâlayu), more commonly known as Nyelâyu, is a [[Kanak languages|Kanak language]] of northern [[New Caledonia]], spoken by approximately 2,000 speakers.   There are two dialects that are not mutually intelligible. Pooc (or Haat) is spoken in the Belep islands, which are located just north of [[Grande Terre (New Caledonia)|Grande Terre]]. Puma (or Paak or Ovac) is spoken in the northermost regions of New Caledonia in the areas around [[Poum]] in the west and [[Pouébo]] and [[Balade (New Caledonia)|Balade]] in the east.

Voiceless stops, nasals, and approximants exhibit a constrast of aspiration exhibited in the following examples.

pe [pe] "ray fish" || phe [pʰe] "sharpening stone"

teec [teec] "scorching" || theec [tʰeec] "washed up"

nu [nu] "coconut palm" || nhu [nʰu] "hot"

Aspirated consonants are very subtly marked. Aspiration seems to be a prosodic trait that affects the overall realization of the syllable by lowering the register of the voice. &lt;ref name="FOR"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ozanne-Rivierre |first1=Françoise |title=Le Nyelâyu de Balade (Nouvelle-Calédonie) |date=1998 |publisher=Peeters Press |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4002">[[File:עלי באבא מתחבא על העץ.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ali Baba overhearing one of the thieves saying "Open Sesame".]]
"'''Open Sesame'''" ({{lang-fr|Sésame, ouvre-toi}}) ({{lang-ar|إفتح يا سمسم}})  is a [[Magic word|magical phrase]] in the story of "[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]" in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.  It opens the mouth of a cave in which forty thieves have hidden a treasure.

==Documentation==

The phrase first appears in [[Antoine Galland]]'s ''[[One Thousand and One Nights#Modern translations|Les Mille et une nuits]]'' (1704–1717) as ''Sésame, ouvre-toi'' (English, "Sesame, open!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5564679j/f299.image.r=sesame.langEN |title=Les mille et une nuits : contes arabes / traduits par Galland, ornés de gravures |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=2009-05-25 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; No earlier oral or written version of the story is known in any language.

Galland's phrase has been variously translated from the French into English as "Sesame, Open",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hFAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA562 |title=The Novelist's Magazine - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Open, Sesame" and "Open, O Simsim".&lt;ref&gt;Burton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Open Sesame has been classified by [[Stith Thompson]] as motif element D1552.2, "Mountain opens to magic formula".&lt;ref&gt;S. Thompson, ''Motif-index of folk-literature : a classification of narrative elements in folktales, ballads, myths, fables, mediaeval romances, exempla, fabliaux, jest-books, and local legends", 1955-1958. [https://www.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Content/d.htm] ''cf.'' [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the story==
In the story, [[Ali Baba]] overhears the 40 thieves saying "open sesame".  His brother later cannot remember the phrase, and confuses it with the names of other grains (becoming trapped in the magic cave).

==Origin==
[[Sesame]] seeds grow in a seed pod that splits open when it reaches maturity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mdidea.com/products/new/new06704.html |title=Sesame: Origin, History, Etymology and Mythology |publisher=MDidea.com |date=2015-11-30 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase possibly alludes to unlocking of treasures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/open-sesame.html |title=Open Sesame |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=2015-04-08 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not certain that the word "sesame" actually refers to the [[sesame]] plant or seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first1=Marian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBh0jgWdWtsC&amp;dq |title=Wildlife and Plants |volume=16 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |page=972 |isbn=978-0761477105 |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include:

* Sesame is a reduplication of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''šem'' 'name', i.e. God or a [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] word representing the Talmudic ''šem-šamáįm'' ("shem-shamayim"), 'name of heaven'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Ernst Peiser]] in ''Orientalistische Literaturzeitung'' (1902), as reported in Haupt.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sesame is connected to Babylonian [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices which used [[sesame oil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Nöldeke]] in ''Zeitschrift für Assyriologie'' (1914), as reported in Haupt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally presented at the meeting of the [[American Oriental Society]], Washington, April 15, 1916.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stamps.com 44c personalized stamp produced for Tamils for Obama 2010.jpg|thumbnail|right|A 2010 "personalised stamp" produced by Stamps.com for Tamils for Obama. Personalised stamps have been used to promote political causes or to depict controversial individuals, despite most countries have rules designed to avoid such things. This "stamp" is technically more akin to a meter stamp.]] --&gt;
A '''personalised (or personalized) stamp''' is a [[postage stamp]], with (or without) an adjoining label on the left, on which, for a fee, an image and/or text of the purchaser's choosing may be placed. The stamps vary from country to country, and while some are normal stamps with a personalised label on the left attached by perforations, elsewhere the stamps are more properly regarded as one-piece personalised [[meter stamp]]s with a colourful design next to the [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]]. Stamps produced by Zazzle.com for the United States, for instance, are one-piece, self-adhesive with die cut margins to emulate perforations, and visually very similar to normal United States postage stamps, except for the addition of an IBI (information-based indicia; encoded by black and white little squares) along one edge. Also, a numeric serial number appears next to IBI.

==Usage==
Examples given by [[postal authorities]] who offer this service usually depict family members, pets or other uncontroversial&lt;ref name=rm&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/personal/stamps-and-collecting/smilers  Smilers® Provided by our trusted partner, Snapfish by HP] Royal Mail, 2013. Retrieved 25 September 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6Jtzhr6UF Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; subjects but users quickly realised that they could place almost any image in its space. For instance, there have been attempts to publicise missing persons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zazzle.com/jennkesse_missing_help_bring_her_home_www_postage-172406206386525353 Jennkesse, Missing - Help bring her home.] zazzle.com, 2013. Retrieved 25 September 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6Ju0MkfIp Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; promote political causes such as [[Tamil independence]], or to place the image of criminals or other controversial individuals on its stamps. The rules of most countries generally prohibit such things, however, stamp producers may not spot every attempt to circumvent their rules, particularly when it is not obvious who or what is being depicted, or that the image has some political or other significance.

==In Austria==
The Austrian Postal Service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meine-marke.at/ MeineMarke.at | personalisierte Marke | persönliche Briefmarke | eigene Briefmarke | selber Marken erstellen und designen | Die Geschenkidee der Österreichischen Post AG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has permitted personalisation of postage stamps. In Austria the [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]] of personalised stamps can now be changed as well.

==The United Kingdom==
[[Royal Mail]] has permitted personalisation of labels adjoining their stamps.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; The stamps are produced in small sheets known as [[smilers sheet]]s.

==The United States==
In the United States, personalized stamps – also known as customized postage – are technically a form of meter labels and are governed by the [[United States Postal Service]]. As "a form of meter labels", they are not supposed ("they are not required") to be cancelled for postal purposes. Instead, a scanning machine at the post office is supposed to scan and void the postal value of that personalized stamp. For philatelic purposes, the postmarking of a personalized stamp is permitted, and it is harmless to USPS. In fact, a visible postmark is a further protection of revenue for USPS, since a postmarked personalized stamp is far less likely to be re-affixed on a mail piece for another mailing. While consumers may find that customized postage is available in a number of retail and online outlets, the USPS has authorized different companies to handle selected aspects of the program.

*'''Providers,''' including [[Pitney Bowes]], Endicia and [[Stamps.com]], are authorized to generate, transmit and print the indicia barcodes, ensure that images conform to USPS standards, market and sell customized postage and fulfill customer orders.
*'''Partners''' such as Zazzle can approve imagery, market, sell and fulfill orders, but they must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.
*'''Affiliates''' like [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] can market, sell and fulfill orders, but are not authorized to approve imagery or print postage and must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.

[[Pitney Bowes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcom Pitney Bowes]&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamps.com/ Stamps.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zazzle.com]] and Fuji offer USPS-approved personalised postage via Stamp Expressions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampexpressions.com Stamp Expressions Personal Postage]&lt;/ref&gt; PhotoStamps&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.stamps.com/ Photo Stamps]&lt;/ref&gt; and ZazzleStamps and Yourstamps.com respectively.

Consumers and businesses may also print their own postage using a small, specialized, printer, such as the Pitney Bowes Stamp Expressions Printer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampexpressions.com Pitney Bowes Stamp Expressions Printer]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent innovations include postal kiosks, where consumers can download an image at their local convenience store.
 
===Choice of images===

Although most postal regulations permit the exclusion of "objectionable" pictures on the stamps, in 2004 [[The Smoking Gun]] managed to create personalised stamps featuring the [[Rosenbergs]], [[Jimmy Hoffa]], [[Ted Kaczynski]], [[Monica Lewinsky's dress]], [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] using the service offered by stamps.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/funny/stamps-approval Stamps Of Approval] thesmokinggun.com, 31 August 2004. Retrieved 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm subsequently revised its policies.

===Stamps for hunters===

In 2006 Ed Owens of REACT Consulting Group, a lobbyist for the Hunters Heritage Council,  complained to the [[U.S. Postmaster General]] when Zazzle.com refused to create a personalised stamp that promoted hunters as conservationists. The stamp would have borne the legends "$1.7 Billion for Conservation Annually" and "Sportsmen... America's First Conservationists". The creation of the stamp was refused because, Zazzle said, it "Incorporates material that is primarily partisan, or political, in nature." REACT Consulting cited stamps created for the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) which it said were also partisan and political but which had been accepted for production.&lt;ref&gt;Zazzle.com Lawsuit Involves U.S. Postmaster, Hunters, Politics, Jim Shepherd ''The Outdoor Wire'', 15 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Zazzle eventually withdrew the HSUS stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naiaonline.org/heroes_winners_and_success_stories/page/the-stamp-collector ''The Stamp Collector''] by [[Patti Strand]], National Animal Interest Alliance, 27 January 2012. Retrieved 28 September 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6JygNr9B1 Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Indonesia ==
[[File:Indonesian Stamp with Prof. Philip Kotler.jpg|thumb|An example of Prisma stamp]]
Personalized stamps or '''Prisma''' ('''''Pr'''angko '''I'''dentita'''s''' '''M'''ilik '''A'''nda'' - Your Identity Stamp, but also Indonesian term for a [[prism]]) was launched in Indonesia in 2003.&lt;ref name="prisma"&gt;[http://indonesianewsonline.com/prangko/stamps/news/pprisma.html Prangko Prisma]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all kind of picture could be displayed in a Prisma stamp. The guideline stated only the following were allowed in a Prism stamp: face picture of one or more persons, writing or signatures, logo/symbol/slogans, picture made by other people, advertisement of a product or service.&lt;ref name="prisma" /&gt;

'''Petro Evstaf'evic  Stojan''' ({{lang-rus|Пётр Евстафьевич Стоян}}, also known by the pseudonyms Ribaulb, Radovich and Šulerc) (June 22, 1884 in [[Izmail]], [[Bessarabia]] — May 3, 1961 in [[Nice]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[Esperanto|esperantist]], bibliographer and lexicographer and a member of the [[Akademio de Esperanto|Esperanto Language Committee]] (''Lingva Komitato'') from 1914.

==Life and work==
Stojan studied physics and mathematics at the Richelieu Lyceum (today's [[Odessa University]]) in [[Odessa]] and in [[Sankt Petersburg]] and from 1906 to 1907 in Paris. From 1919 to 1922, he was a high school teacher in [[Serbia]]. From 1925, he worked at the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] in [[Geneva]] at its biggest work, the ''Bibliography of the International Language'' (''Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo'') which was published in 1929.

He spent the end of his life in [[Southern France]] where he died of drowning.

==Esperantist engagement==
He joined the Esperanto movement in 1903. According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Esperanto]]'' of 1933, "he was one of the most competent regarding the dictionary technique." Over sixteen years, he worked on twelve dictionaries; among them are the great Russian dictionary of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy]]. His other well-known dictionaries are the ''Ornithological Eight-language Dictionary'' (1911) and the ''Small Russian-Esperanto dictionary and the Illustrated Dictionary of the [[Russian Language]]'' (760 pages and 2000 pictures). In 1929, his ''Bibliography of the International Language'' (''Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo'') was published.

In 1913, he proposed the creation of the ''Universal Card Encyclopedia'' (''Universala Slipa Enciklopedio, USE'') which, according to his idea, could be updated by adding cards for each subject.

He also wrote a great number of scientific articles and original literature in [[Esperanto]].

==Vindiania and Biosophy==
In France he worked on ''La Vindiania'', a thesis on the origin of the [[Indo-European languages]] and on a complete philosophy of life, which he named biosophy (in [[Esperanto]] - ''Biozofio''). However, his works remained in the manuscript form and circulated among his friends, and only one book was actually published in 1946 in [[Arras]].

==Constructed languages==
&lt;!-- [[Amiana (constructed language)]], [[Ariana (constructed language)]], [[Eo (constructed language)]], [[Espo (constructed language)]], [[Espo]], [[Uniala (constructed language)]], and [[Uniala]], all redirect here --&gt;

Stojan created a number of [[international auxiliary languages]], most of which were never published:

*'''Amiana''' (an evolved form of Ariana, first presented in 1919 and its final version appeared in 1922)&lt;ref&gt;[[Montagu C. Butler Library]] classification 419.31 “1919”, with the comment: ˝An incomplete, unfinished and fuzzy sketch˝ (˝skizo nekompleta, nefinita, nebula˝).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petr E. STOJAN: Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo. Genève: Bibliografia Servo de Universala Esperanto-Asocio, 1929. 560 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ariana''' or '''Aryana''' (1912, an [[esperantido]] whose vocabulary  was based on Pre-Indo-European ([[Aryan]]) [[root (linguistics)|radicals]]; pre-form of Amiana)&lt;ref&gt;Montagu C. Butler Library classification 419.31 “1912”&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Eo''' (an esperantido with very short radicals, proposed in 1926 under the pseudonym Ribaulb)
*'''Espo''' (1926, a pra-form of Eo created under the pseudonym Ribaulb, which does not use the Esperanto correlatives but a naturalistic system of Ido; unpublished) 
*'''Idido'''
*'''Liana'''
*'''Linga franka'''
*'''Renova'''
*'''Spiranta'''
*'''Uniala''' (1923, with P. J. Troost)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pei|first=Mario|title=One language for the world|year=1958|publisher=Biblo-Moser|isbn=0-8196-0218-3|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Unita'''
*an '''unnamed [[Pan-Slavic language]]''' (1913–16, with D. Chupovsky)&lt;ref&gt;E.K. Drezen, ''За всеобщим языком (Три века исканий)''. М.—Л., 1928, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

He possibly created these projects as [[fictional languages]], simply for his amusement; but in his time, the concept did not exist.

A '''psychic reading''' is a specific attempt to discern information through the use of heightened perceptive abilities; or natural extensions of the basic human senses of sight, sound, touch, taste and instinct. These natural extensions are claimed to be clairvoyance (vision), clairsentience (feeling), claircognisance (factual knowing) and clairaudience (hearing) and the resulting statements made during such an attempt.&lt;ref name=parasoc&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#r Reading] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }} - Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Parapsychological Association (2010-04-14)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly associated with [[paranormal]]-based consultation given for a fee in such settings as over the phone, in a home, or at [[psychic]] fairs.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite news|author=Nobel, Carmen |url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/04/10/vision_quest/?page=full |title=Vision Quest |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though psychic readings are controversial and a focus of [[skeptical inquiry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stollznow, Karen |authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/a_psychometry_reading|title=A Psychometry Reading The Naked Skeptic|publisher=csicop.org|date=2010-04-12|accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/psychic.html |title=psychic|publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com |work= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular interest in them persists.&lt;ref name=Haskett&gt;{{cite news|author=Haskett, Wendy |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-15/news/vw-44_1_psychic-fair |title=Psychic Fairs Aim for Aura of Fun in Mind Reading |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 15, 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive experimentation to replicate psychic results in laboratory conditions have failed to find any precognitive phenomena in humans.&lt;ref name=Ritchie&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ritchie, Stuart J. |author2=Wiseman, Richard |authorlink2=Richard Wiseman|author3=French, Christopher C. |authorlink3=Chris French|title=Failing the Future: Three Unsuccessful Attempts to Replicate Bem's ‘Retroactive Facilitation of Recall’ Effect |journal=PLoS ONE |date=March 14, 2012 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033423 |pmid=22432019 |pmc=3303812 |volume=7 |pages=e33423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychic reading is [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Truzzi, Marcello |authorlink1=Marcello Truzzi|author2=Williams, William A. |title=Encyclopedia of pseudoscience |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-8160-5080-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cold reading]] technique allows psychics to produce seemingly specific information about an individual from social cues and broad statements.&lt;ref name="Dutton1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dutton | first = Denis | authorlink=Denis Dutton |year = 1988 | title = The cold reading technique | journal = Experientia | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–332 | url = http://www.denisdutton.com/cold_reading.htm | accessdate = June 30, 2009 | doi = 10.1007/BF01961271 | pmid = 3360083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are many types of psychic readings practiced. Although psychic readings might not incorporate the use of any tools, a professional psychic may have one or more specialized areas of expertise. Some of the more common readings include [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|Tarot]] reading, email psychic reading, [[Palmistry|palm reading]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] readings, or [[astrology|astrological]] readings.

===Astrology===
{{Main|Astrology}}
'''Astrology''' is the study of the movements and relative positions of [[celestial objects]] as a means for [[divination|divining]] information about human affairs and terrestrial events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of English| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Merriam-Webster Inc.| title = astrology| encyclopedia = Merriam-Webster Dictionary| accessdate = 11 December 2015| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bunnin |first2=Jiyuan |last2=Yu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |p=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=dictionary+philosophy+astrology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj169fYwtbJAhVP_mMKHSJqAbQQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20philosophy%20astrology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the stars, planets, sun and moon when one is born are believed to have affect one's personality, shape how relationships work in one's life and predict future events such as one's economic success.

===Aura reading===
Aura readings involve the observation and interpretation of [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitworth, Belinda |title=New Age Encyclopedia: A Mind Body Spirit Reference Guide (Revised edition) |publisher=New Page Books | year=2003 |page=34 | isbn=1-56414-640-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aura is purported to be a field of subtle, luminous radiation surrounding a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack, Alex |title=The New Age Dictionary Second Edition |origyear=1976 |publisher=Japan Publications, Inc. |location=Tokyo and New York |year=1990 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychics have offered aura readings for many years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} They claim to have a unique ability to see or sense individual’s auras, however no evidence has ever been provided to substantiate this claim.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Cartomancy or playing card reading===
{{Main|Cartomancy}}
Cartomancy is fortune-telling or divination using a deck of cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Paul Huson|author=Huson, Paul|year=2004 |title=Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage|location=Vermont |publisher=Destiny Books |isbn=0-89281-190-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also Tarot reading below.

===Cleromancy===
{{Main|Cleromancy}}
Cleromantic readings usually involve casting small objects and reading them by their position, orientation, and mutual proximity. There are numerous variants used throughout the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Distant readings===
A distant reading, "traveling clairvoyance", or "remote perception" can be conducted without the reader ever meeting the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes letters, telephone, text messaging, email, chat, and webcam readings.

Correspondence readings are usually done via letters, later emails and filling in special forms on psychic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Psychic Readings|url=http://www.psychicsource.com/online-psychic-readings|website=Psychic Source|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telephone readings are live readings where both psychic and client hear each other by connecting via premium rate telephone line. In the last years, with restrictions on premium rate numbers, more common are pre-paid callbacks, in which case client leaves his/her credit card details over the phone to an operator, after which gets a call on a specified phone number. Telephone readings became most popular with the growth of live advice TV shows as main means of advertising, and is commonly used by companies rather than individual psychics, due to high setup costs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[SMS]] and chat readings is a quick question-and-answer format of reading allowing exchange of basic information between psychic and client.

Webcams and online video communication may also be used for this type of reading.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Lithomancy and crystallomancy===
{{Main|Lithomancy|Crystallomancy}}
Lithomancy readings usually involve especially suitable gems or stones that are immersed in water, or tossed as a set and read by mutual proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Besterman, Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Besterman |title=Crystal-Gazing |publisher=Cosimo Classics |year=2005 |origyear=1924 |page=6 |isbn=1-59605-388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are unknown, and there are numerous different methodologies used by various cultures throughout the world. A recently more common variant is crystallomancy also known as [[crystal gazing]].&lt;ref&gt;Besterman, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Using quartz as a crystal ball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kole, Andre |authorlink1=André Kole |author2=Holley, Terry |author3=Gomes, Alan W. |title=Astrology and Psychic Phenomenon |publisher=Zondervan |year=1998 |page=75 |isbn=0-310-48921-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is stereotypically depicted as gypsy fortune telling.

===Numerology===
{{Main|Numerology}}
Numerology is defined as the study of the occult meanings of numbers and their influence on human life. It is essentially a reading of an individual based specifically upon numerical values such as their date of birth, letters in their names, etc. Numerology can be used in psychic readings.

===Palm reading===
{{Main|Palmistry}}
Palmistry is another popular method of psychic readings, involving characterization and foretelling of one's future through the study of the lines, shapes, wrinkles and curves on the palm. Palmistry does not require psychic ability, as it generally uses cold reading abilities and previous knowledge of the subject.

===Psychometry===
{{Main|Psychometry (paranormal)}}
Psychometry is a form of psychic reading in which the reader claims to obtain details about another through physical contact with their possessions.&lt;ref name="spence754"&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]] ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, Part 2'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC (February 1, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gq1LhcH48GQC&amp;lpg=PA755&amp;ots=WpVgsnLntR&amp;pg=PA754 p.754]. {{ISBN|0-7661-2817-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychometry readers often ask the subject for their favorite and most meaningful objects, such as wedding rings, glasses, car keys, etc., for the reading. The belief is that objects which are in close proximity to a person for extended periods of time hold some of that person's 'energy'. This method has been used in attempts to locate missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kessler, Robert |author2=Schachtman, Tom |authorlink2=Tom Shachtman|title=Whoever Fights Monsters: My Twenty Years Tracking Serial Killers for the FBI |publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks |year=1993 |page=270 |isbn=0-312-95044-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rune reading===
{{Main|Runic magic}}
[[Runes]] are the letters of a set of related alphabets used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Lati alphabet. There is evidence to suggest that they also had magical or divinatory uses. In modern settings, stones or tablets with runes inscribed on them are cast on a mat or cloth to discern future events or path a problem or issue will take.&lt;ref name=Paranormality /&gt; Runes are also used by some [[Wicca|witches]] and other practitioners of divination.&lt;ref name="Paranormality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Runes and their meanings|url=http://www.paranormality.com/runes.shtml|website=Paranormality|accessdate=29 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407030533/http://www.paranormality.com/runes.shtml|archivedate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tarot reading===
{{Main|Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot}}
Tarot cards have been greatly popularized, but can be often regarded solely as entertainment. Traditional decks are available in chain bookstores. New decks also frequently appear in New Age bookstores. Though not requiring psychic abilities, Tarot cards can be used as a psychic or cold reading tool and Tarot readings are common at psychic fairs.&lt;ref name=Haskett /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dullea, Georgia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/style/tarot-goes-po-mo.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tarot Goes 'Po Mo' |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 31, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Skeptics have challenged the veracity of the claims of psychic readings, largely through disclosure of the methods.  Psychologist [[Richard Wiseman|Richard Wiseman's]] 2011 book ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There'' noted the tricks of the trade, and Wiseman noted in a podcast appearance that the disclosure generated negative feedback from the psychic community.&lt;ref name=Skepicality160&gt;{{cite web|author=Skepticality|authorlink=Skepticality|url=http://www.skepticality.com/paranormality/|title=Paranormality|publisher=Skepticality.com|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BarackObama-Basketball.JPEG|thumb|right|[[Barack Obama]] rebounding the ball in a game of basketball with U.S. military personnel in [[Djibouti]]]]
''''Rebound'''' is a term used in [[sports]] to describe the ball (or puck or other object of play) becoming available for possession by either opponent after an attempt to put the ball or puck into the goal has been unsuccessful. Rebounds are generally considered to be a major part of the game, as they often lead either to a possession change or to a second (and often better) opportunity to score by the side whose initial attempt failed.

In sports such as [[basketball]] and [[netball]], the term is also used as either noun or verb to describe the successful retrieval of the ball in that circumstance.

In sports that have an assigned [[goalkeeper]] or [[goaltender]], after that player makes a [[save (sport)|save]], they may (and if they are able, usually should) then retain immediate possession of the ball or puck themselves, thus preventing a rebound from occurring.

==Rebounds in basketball==
{{Main|Rebound (basketball)}}
In basketball, rebounds are divided into two categories: '''offensive rebounds''', in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and '''defensive rebounds''', in which the defending team gain possession of the loose ball. Generally, most rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (in other words, closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Often these are grouped under the heading '''Rebounds per game''' which denotes the average number of rebounds a player or team averages for a series or season.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register complex''' is a combination of phonation type, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], length, [[vowel]] quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.

For instance, in a system where [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], voice quality and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like "Pai" (as in the [[English language|English]] word "Pie") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, "Pai" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~gt18/Papers/Vietnamese_tonogenesis.pdf |title=Vietnamese and tonogenesis: revising the model and the analysis |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many register languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in [[Bantu languages]] and throughout [[Africa]]. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the [[Kru languages]], though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and possibly [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.

'''Rotwelsch''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁoːtvɛlʃ|lang}}) or '''Gaunersprache''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaʊnɐʃpʁaːxə|lang}}, ''"[[wikt:Gauner#German|criminal]] [[wikt:Sprache#German|language]]"'') is a secret language, a [[Cant (language)|cant]] or [[Thieves' cant|thieves' argot]], spoken by covert groups primarily in southern [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

==Origin and development==
''Rotwelsch'' was formerly common among travelling craftspeople and [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]].  The language is built on a strong [[substratum]] of [[German language|German]], but contains numerous words from other languages, notably from various German [[dialect]]s, including [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as well as from [[Romany language]]s, notably [[Sinte Romani|Sintitikes]]. There are also significant influences from [[Judæo-Latin]], the ancient [[Jewish language]] spoken in the [[Roman Empire]]. ''Rotwelsch'' has also played a great role in the development of the [[Yeniche language]]. In form and development, it closely parallels the commercial speech ("shopkeeper language") of German-speaking regions.

==Vocabulary==
Because of its development as a means of conveying information about goods and transactions, ''Rotwelsch'' has no terms for [[abstraction]]s. For example, it has no direct translations for the [[season]]s such as spring and autumn.{{contradict-inline|reason=aren't the translations in the next sentence?|date=September 2015}} Instead, it uses ''Bibberling'' (literally, "shiver-ling") and ''Hitzling'' (literally, "heat-ling") in place of season names.

Other vocabulary examples, compared to their German counterparts, include:
* ''Schokelmei'' = ''Kaffee'' (coffee)
* ''schenigeln'' = ''arbeiten'' (to work)
* ''Krauter'' = ''Chef eines Handwerkbetriebes'' (master artisan)
* ''Kreuzspanne'' = ''Weste'' (waistcoat)
* ''Wolkenschieber'' = ''Frisör'', ''Barbier'' (barber)
* ''Stenz'' = ''Wanderstock des Handwerksburschen'' ([[walking stick]])
* ''fechten'' = ''betteln'' (to beg)
* ''Platte machen'' = ''Unterkunft suchen'' (to seek lodging)
* ''Puhler'' = ''Polizist'' (policeman)

===From Feraru's "The 'United Ring' and Organized Crime in Berlin"===
* ''abfaßen'' = to arrest (literally 'to write out')
* ''acheln'' = to eat (from Hebrew)
* ''ackern'' = to go acquire; to go off the line (literally 'to till or cultivate')
* ''den Affen kaufen'' = to get drunk (literally 'to buy the ape')
* ''alle gehn'' = to be arrested; to vanish into thin air
* ''assern'' = to testify against someone, to 'betray' them
* ''aufmucken'' = to revolt against orders
* ''auftalgen'' = to hang (literally 'to grease up')
* ''der Getalgente'' = the hanged man
* ''balldowern'' = to spy out; to make inquiries about (perhaps from Hebrew ''Ba'al Davar'' = one who brings an accusation)
* ''ballmischpet'' = examining magistrate (from Hebrew ''Ba'al Mishpat'' = Master of Law)
* ''der Bau'' = the prison or penitentiary (literally 'the lodge')
* ''Bauer'' = a stupid simple-minded person (literally 'peasant' or 'farmer')
* ''begraben sein'' = to be hunted for a long time (literally 'to be buried')
* ''bei jom'' = by day (Hebrew ''yom'' = day)
* ''bei leile'' = by night (Hebrew ''laila'' = night)
* ''der Bello'' = the prison toilet
* ''beramschen'' = to swindle
* ''berappen'' = to pay up or fork over money (literally 'to plaster a wall'); also possibly from Malayan through dutch: berapa means ''how much'' (what does it cost) now integrated in dutch as ''berappen'': to pay.
* ''betuke'' = discreet or imperceptible (perhaps from Hebrew ''betokh' = within)
* ''die Bim'' = a small bell (from ''bimmel'')
* ''bleffen'' (or ''anbleffen'') = to threaten. Possibly from dutch: ''blaffen'': to bark (like a dog).
* der ''Bock'', from romani bokh = hunger,  coll. ''Bock haben'' = to be up for something.
* ''Bombe'' = [[coffee]] glass (literally 'bombshell')
* ''brennen'' (literally 'to burn') = Extortion, but also to collect the "thieves' portion" with companions. The analogy between [[distilling]] spirits (''Branntweinbrennen'') and taking a good gulp of the portion (''Anteil'') is obvious.&lt;ref name=MuskelAdolfundCo_Feraru_DieRingVeriene&gt;{{cite book

==Current status==
Variants of Rotwelsch, sometimes toned down, can still be heard among travelling craftspeople and [[funfair]] showpeople as well as among vagrants and beggars.  Also, in some southwestern and western locales in Germany, where travelling peoples were settled, many Rotwelsch terms have entered the vocabulary of the vernacular, for instance in the municipalities of [[Schillingsfürst]] and [[Schopfloch, Bavaria|Schopfloch]].
A couple of Rotwelsch words have entered the colloquial language, for example, "aufmucken", "Bau", "berappen". "Baldowern" or "ausbaldowern" is very common in Berlin dialect; "Bombe" is still used in German prison jargon. "Bock haben" is also still used all around Germany. The [[Manisch]] dialect of the German city of [[Gießen]] is still used, although it was only spoken fluently by approximately 700-750 people in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Günter Lerch, "Tschü lowi...Das Manische in Giessen", 1976/2005, Reprint Edition, page 22, {{ISBN|3-89687-485-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Code ==
Josef Ludwig Blum from Lützenhardt (Black Forrest) wrote from war prison:

„[E]s grüßt Dich nun recht herzlich Dein Mann, viele Grüße an Schofel und Bock. Also nochmals viel Glück auf ein baldiges Wiedersehen in der schönen Heimat. Viele Grüße an Mutter u. Geschwister sowie an die Deinen.“

Bock and Schofel are persons? The control let pass the words.  This code words ''Schofel'' („bad“) and ''Bock'' („hunger“) change the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Christian Efing|Title=Das Lützenhardter Jenisch: Studien zu einer deutschen Sondersprache |Publisher=Harrassowitz|PublicationPlace=Wiesbaden|Year=2005|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;74|ISBN=3447052082|Date=  2005|language=German|AccessDate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotwelsch in the arts==
A variant of Rotwelsch was spoken by some American [[organized crime|criminal groups]] in the 1930s and '40s, and harpist [[Zeena Parkins]]' 1996 album ''Mouth=Maul=Betrayer'' made use of spoken Rotwelsch texts.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r272034|pure_url=yes}} Proefrock, Stacia; Allmusic.com review of ''Mouth=Maul=Betrayer'']; URL accessed Jan 06, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of Rotwelsch is found in Gustav Meyrink's ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|Der Golem]]'' and reads as follows:
''An Beindel von Eisen recht alt.''
''An Stranzen net gar a so kalt.''
''Messinung, a' Räucherl und Rohn,''
''und immerrr nurr putzen.''
''Und stoken sich Aufzug und Pfiff,''
''und schmallern an eisernes G'süff.''
''Juch,''
''Und Handschuhkren, Harom net san.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Meyrink,+Gustav/Roman/Der+Golem/Punsch Transcript of Golem novel.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saintongeais''' (''saintonjhais'') is a dialect of [[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]] spoken halfway down the western coast of France in the former [[Provinces of France|province]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of [[Saintonge]], [[Aunis]] and [[Angoumois]], all of which have been incorporated into the current [[Departments of France|department]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of [[Charente]] and [[Charente-Maritime]] as well as in parts of their neighbouring departments of [[Gironde]] and a town in Dordogne. Although many of the same words are used in both Charente departments, they differ in what they mean or in how they are pronounced.

Saintongeais has significantly influenced the [[Acadian French|Acadian]] and [[Cajun]] dialects of French spoken in the United States and Canada. However, [[Quebec French|Québécois]] has been influenced by three dialects of [[langues d'oïl]]: [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Francien]] and Saintongeais.

==Geographic distribution==
Its area covers the entire department of [[Charente-Maritime]] (except the very north), the west and centre of the department of [[Charente]], the northern department of [[Gironde]] with its ''Pays Gabaye'' and its enclaves around Saintonge, [[Monségur, Gironde|Monségur]]. Today, Saintongeais is no longer widely spoken except in the countryside. It is still used in shows, magazines, and radio. Some words from Saintongeais are still used in the region. Words like ''since'' (floorcloth) are so widespread that they can be wrongly considered to be French.

==Cultural distribution==
Along with French, Saintongeais is used in the magazine '''Xaintonge''', which is published twice a year. The great promoters of spoken Charentais at the beginning of the twentieth century were "le Barde Saintongeais" [[Goulebenéze]], succeeded by [[Odette Comandon]], author of comedy and folk tales, patois actress and storyteller.  Country doctor [[Athanase Jean]] also wrote several plays in the dialect and helped promote the Saintonge culture.

The '''[[grammar]] of the [[Sanskrit language]]''' has a complex verbal system, rich [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] [[declension]], and extensive use of [[compound noun]]s. It was studied and codified by [[Vyākaraṇa|Sanskrit grammarians]] from the later [[Vedic period]] (roughly 8th century BCE), culminating in the [[Pāṇini]]an grammar of the 6th century BCE.

==Grammatical tradition==
{{Main|Vyākaraṇa}}
Sanskrit grammatical tradition (''[[vyākaraṇa]]'', one of the six [[Vedanga]] disciplines) began in late [[Vedic India]] and culminated in the ''[[Aṣṭādhyāyī]]'' of [[Pāṇini]], which consists of 3990 [[sutra]]s ([[circa|ca.]] 5th century BCE). About a century after [[Pāṇini]] (around 400 BCE), [[Kātyāyana]] composed vārtikas (explanations) on the Pāṇinian sũtras. [[Patañjali]], who lived three centuries after Pāṇini, wrote the ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'', the "Great Commentary" on the Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vārtikas. Because of these three ancient [[Sanskrit grammarians]] this grammar is called ''Trimuni Vyākarana''. [[Jayaditya]] and [[Vāmana]] wrote a commentary named [[Kāśikā]] in 600 CE. {{IAST|[[Kaiyaṭa]]}}'s (12th century AD) commentary on Patañjali's {{IAST|[[Mahābhāṣya]]}} also exerted much influence on the development of grammar, but more influential was the ''[[Rupāvatāra]]'' of Buddhist scholar [[Dharmakīrti]] which popularised simplified versions of Sanskrit grammar.

The most influential work of the Early Modern  period was ''Siddhānta-Kaumudī'' by {{IAST|[[Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita]]}} (17th century) and its various derivate versions by [[Varadarāja]].
European grammatical scholarship began in the 18th century with [[Jean François Pons]] and others, and culminated in the exhaustive expositions by 19th century scholars such as [[Otto Boehtlingk]], [[William Dwight Whitney]], [[Jacob Wackernagel]] and others.

==Verbs==
{{Main|Sanskrit verbs}}

===Classification of verbs===
Sanskrit has ten classes of [[verb]]s  divided into two broad groups: [[athematic]] and [[Vowel stem|thematic]]. The thematic verbs are so called because an ''a'', called the [[theme vowel]], is inserted between the stem and the ending. This serves to make the thematic verbs generally more regular. [[Exponent (linguistics)|Exponents]] used in verb [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] include [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, [[infix]]es, and [[reduplication]]. Every root has (not necessarily all distinct) zero, [[guna|guṇa]], and [[vrddhi|vṛddhi]] grades. If V is the vowel of the zero grade, the guṇa-grade vowel is traditionally thought of as a + V, and the vṛddhi-grade vowel as ā + V.

===Tense systems===
Sanskrit has ten tenses (plus one used in the Vedas, the "leT"). The verb [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (a very inexact application of the word, since more distinctions than simply tense are expressed) are organized into four 'systems' (as well as [[gerund]]s and [[infinitive]]s, and such creatures as [[intensive]]s/[[frequentative]]s, [[desiderative]]s, [[causative]]s, and [[benedictive]]s derived from more basic forms) based on the different stem forms (derived from verbal roots) used in conjugation. There are four tense systems:
* Present ([[Present tense|Present]], [[Imperfect]], [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Optative mood|Optative]])
* [[perfect (grammar)|Perfect]]
* [[Aorist]]
* Future ([[Future tense|Future]], [[Conditional mood|Conditional]])

====Present system====
The present system includes the [[present tense]] and the [[imperfect]] (past imperfective),{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!--might this be the [[imperfective]]?--&gt; the [[optative mood|optative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]] moods, as well as some of the remnant forms of the old [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]. The tense stem of the present system is formed in various ways. The numbers are the native grammarians' numbers for these classes.

====Perfect system====
The perfect system includes only the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]. The stem is formed with reduplication as with the present system.

The perfect system also produces separate "strong" and "weak" forms of the verb&amp;mdash;the strong form is used with the singular active, and the weak form with the rest.

====Aorist system====
The [[aorist]] system includes aorist proper (with past indicative meaning, e.g. ''abhūḥ'' "you were") and some of the forms of the ancient [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] (used almost exclusively with ''mā'' in prohibitions, e.g. ''mā bhūḥ'' "don't be"). The principal distinction of the two is presence/absence of an [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]] – ''a-'' prefixed to the stem. The aorist system stem actually has three different formations: the simple aorist, the [[sibilant]] aorist, and the reduplicating aorist, which is [[semantic]]ally related to the [[causative]] verb.

====Future system====
The future system is formed with the suffixation of ''sya'' or ''iṣya'' and guṇa. Verbs then conjugate as though they were thematic verbs in the present system. The imperfect of the future system is used as a conditional.

===Verbs: conjugation===
Each verb has a [[grammatical voice]], whether active, passive or middle. There  also is an impersonal voice, which can be described as the passive voice of intransitive verbs. Sanskrit verbs have an [[indicative mood|indicative]], an [[optative mood|optative]] and an [[imperative mood]]. Older forms of the language had a [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], though this had fallen out of use by the time of Classical Sanskrit.

====Basic conjugational endings====
Conjugational endings in Sanskrit convey [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Different forms of the endings are used depending on what tense stem and mood they are attached to. Verb stems or the endings themselves may be changed or obscured by sandhi.

Primary endings are used with present indicative and future forms. Secondary endings are used with the imperfect, conditional, aorist, and optative. Perfect and imperative endings are used with the perfect and imperative respectively.

==Nominals==
{{Main|Sanskrit nouns}}

Sanskrit is a highly [[inflection|inflected]] language with three [[grammatical gender]]s: masculine ({{lang-sa2|पुंलिङ्ग}} ''puṃliṅga''), feminine ({{lang-sa2|स्त्रीलिङ्ग}} ''strīliṅga''), and neuter ({{lang-sa2|नपुंसकलिङ्ग}} ''napuṃsakaliṅga''); and three [[Number (grammar)|numbers]]: singular ({{lang-sa2|एकवचनम्}} ''ekavacanam''), [[dual grammatical number|dual]] ({{lang-sa2|द्विवचनम्}} ''dvivacanam''), and plural ({{lang-sa2|बहुवचनम्}} ''bahuvacanam''). It has eight [[Grammatical case|cases]]: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and [[Locative case|locative]].

The number of actual [[declension]]s is debatable. [[Pāṇini]] identifies six ''kārakas'' corresponding to the nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, locative, and ablative cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/semiotics/cyber/man3.html |title=The Karaka Theory of The Indian Grammarians |publisher=Franson D Manjali|accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pāṇini defines them as follows (Ashtadhyayi, I.4.24 – 54):

# ''Apādāna'' (lit. 'take off'): "(that which is) firm when departure (takes place)." This is the equivalent of the ablative case, which signifies a stationary object from which movement proceeds.
# ''Sampradāna'' ('bestowal'): "he whom one aims at with the object". This is equivalent to the dative case, which signifies a recipient in an act of giving or similar acts.
# ''{{IAST|Karaṇa}}'' ("instrument") "that which effects most." This is equivalent to the instrumental case.
# ''{{IAST|Adhikaraṇa}}'' ('location'): or "substratum." This is equivalent to the locative case.
# ''Karman'' ('deed'/'object'): "what the agent seeks most to attain". This is equivalent to the accusative case.
# ''Kartā'' ('agent'): "he/that which is independent in action". This is equivalent to the nominative case. (On the basis of Scharfe, 1977: 94)

The genitive (''sambandha'') and vocative (''sambodhana'') cases are not equivalent to any kāraka in {{IAST|Pāṇini}}'s grammar.

In this article they are divided into five declensions. The declension to which a noun belongs to is determined largely by form.

===Basic noun and adjective declension===

The basic scheme of suffixation is given in the table below—valid for almost all nouns and adjectives. However, according to the gender and the ending consonant/vowel of the uninflected word-stem, there are predetermined rules of compulsory ''sandhi'' which would then give the final inflected word. The parentheses give the case-terminations for the neuter gender, the rest are for masculine and feminine gender. Both Devanagari script and IAST transliterations are given.

{|class="wikitable"
! Case name !! Case number !! Singular !! Dual !! Plural
|-
! Nominative &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|कर्ता}} ''kartā'')
| 1 || {{lang-sa2|-स्}} -s &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-म्}} -m) || {{lang-sa2|-औ}} -au &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-ई}} -ī) || {{lang-sa2|-अस्}} -as &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-इ}} -i)
|-
! Accusative &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|कर्म}} ''karma'')
| 2 || {{lang-sa2|-अम्}} -am &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-म्}} -m) || {{lang-sa2|-औ}} -au &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-ई}} -ī) || {{lang-sa2|-अस्}} -as &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-इ}} -i)
|-
! Instrumental &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|करण}} ''karaṇa'')
| 3 || {{lang-sa2|-आ}} -ā || {{lang-sa2|-भ्याम्}} -bhyām || {{lang-sa2|-भिस्}} -bhis
|-

| 4 || {{lang-sa2|-ए}} -e || {{lang-sa2|-भ्याम्}} -bhyām || {{lang-sa2|-भ्यस्}} -bhyas
|-
! Ablative &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|अपादान}} ''apādāna'')
| 5 || {{lang-sa2|-अस्}} -as || {{lang-sa2|-भ्याम्}} -bhyām || {{lang-sa2|-भ्यस्}} -bhyas
|-
! Genitive &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|सम्बन्ध}} ''sambandha'')
| 6 || {{lang-sa2|-अस्}} -as || {{lang-sa2|-ओस्}} -os || {{lang-sa2|-आम्}} -ām
|-
! Locative &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|अधिकरण}} ''adhikaraṇa'')
| 7 || {{lang-sa2|-इ}} -i || {{lang-sa2|-ओस्}} -os || {{lang-sa2|-सु}} -su
|-
! Vocative &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|सम्बोधन}} ''sambodhana'')
| || {{lang-sa2|-स्}} -s &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-}} -)|| {{lang-sa2|-औ}} -au &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-ई}} -ī) || {{lang-sa2|-अस्}} -as &lt;br&gt; ({{lang-sa2|-इ}} -i)
|}

The final {{lang-sa2|स्}} (s) characters in the above table are theoretical. In Classical Sanskrit, all of them become {{lang-sa2|ः}} (ḥ) when the word is at the end of a sentence, and, if the word is followed by another in a sentence, the rules of [[sandhi]] for final "-ḥ" are applied.

===a-stems===

A-stems ({{IPA|/ə/ or /ɑː/}}) comprise the largest class of nouns. As a rule, nouns belonging to this class, with the uninflected stem ending in short-a ({{IPA|/ə/}}), are either masculine or neuter. Nouns ending in long-A ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) are almost always feminine. A-stem adjectives take the masculine and neuter in short-a ({{IPA|/ə/}}), and feminine in long-A ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) in their stems. This class is so big because it also comprises the Proto-Indo-European o-stems.

All numbers in Sanskrit can be declined in all the cases. Numbers above four are only declined in the plural. ''{{IAST|Éka}}'' is declined like a pronominal adjective, though the dual form does not occur. ''{{IAST|Dvá}}'' appears only in the dual. ''{{IAST|Trí}}'' and ''{{IAST|catúr}}'' are declined irregularly:{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Personal pronouns and determiners==

{{Main|Sanskrit pronouns and determiners}}

Sanskrit [[pronouns]] are declined for [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical number|number]], and gender. Many pronouns have alternative [[enclitic]] forms. The first and second [[Grammatical person|person]] pronouns are declined for the most part alike, having by [[analogy]] assimilated themselves with one another. [[Ablative]]s in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -''tas''; thus ''mat'' or ''mattas'', ''asmat'' or ''asmattas''. Sanskrit does not have true third person pronouns, but its demonstratives fulfil this function instead by standing independently without a modified [[substantive]].

There are four different [[demonstrative]]s in Sanskrit: ''tat'', ''etat'', ''idam'', and ''adas''. ''etat'' indicates greater proximity than ''tat''. While ''idam'' is similar to ''etat'', ''adas'' refers to objects that are more remote than ''tat''. ''eta'', is declined almost identically to ''ta''. Its paradigm is obtained by prefixing ''e-'' to all the forms of ''ta''. As a result of ''[[sandhi]]'', the masculine and feminine singular forms transform into ''{{IAST|eṣas}}'' and ''{{IAST|eṣã}}''.

The enclitic pronoun ''ena'' is found only in a few [[oblique case]]s and numbers. [[Interrogative pronoun]]s all begin with ''k-'', and decline just as ''tat'' does, with the initial ''t-'' being replaced by ''k-''. The only exception to this are the singular neuter [[nominative]] and [[accusative]] forms, which are both ''kim'' and not the expected ''*kat''. For example, the singular feminine [[genitive]] interrogative pronoun, "of whom?", is ''{{IAST|kasyãḥ}}''. [[Indefinite pronoun]]s are formed by adding the participles ''api'', ''cid'', or ''cana'' after the appropriate interrogative pronouns. All [[relative pronoun]]s begin with ''y-'', and decline just as ''tat'' does. The [[correlative pronoun]]s are identical to the ''tat'' series.

In addition to the pronouns described above, some [[adjective]]s follow the pronominal declension. Unless otherwise noted, their declension is identical to ''tat''.
* ''eka'': "one", "a certain". (singular neuter nominative and accusative forms are both ''ekam'')
* ''anya'': "another".
* ''sarva'': "all", "every". (singular neuter nominative and accusative forms are both ''sarvam'')
* ''para'': "the other". (singular neuter nominative and accusative forms are both ''param'')
* ''sva'': "self" (a reflexive adjective). (singular neuter nominative and accusative forms are both ''svam'')

==Compounds==
{{Main|Sanskrit compounds}}

One other notable feature of the nominal system is the very common use of nominal compounds, which in the later literary language may be huge (10+ words) as in some modern languages such as [[German language|German]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Nominal compounds occur with various structures, however morphologically speaking they are essentially the same. Each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection. The four principle categories of nominal compounds are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warnemyr|first1=Lennart|title=An analytical cross referenced Sanskrit Grammar|url=http://www.warnemyr.com/skrgram/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: These consist of two or more [[noun]] stems, connected in sense with 'and'. Examples are ''rāma-lakşmaņau''—Rama and Lakshmana, ''rāma-lakşmaņa-bharata-śatrughnāh''—Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna, and ''pāņipādam''—limbs, literally hands and feet, from pāņi = hand and pāda = foot.
* [[Tatpurusha|Tatpuruṣa]] (determinative)
: There are many tatpuruṣas; in a tatpuruṣa the first component is in a case relationship with another. For example, a doghouse is a dative compound, a house ''for'' a dog; other examples include instrumental relationships ("thunderstruck") and locative relationships ("towndwelling").
* [[Karmadhāraya]] (descriptive)
: A compound where the relation of the first member to the last is [[apposition]]al, [[Substantive adjective|attributive]] or [[adverbial]]; e.g., uluka-yatu (owl+demon) is a demon in the shape of an owl. Karmadhārayas are considered by some to be tatpuruṣas.
* [[Bahuvrīhi]] (possessive/exocentric)
: Bahuvrīhi compounds refer to a compound noun that refers to a thing which is itself not part of the compound. For example the word bahuvrīhi itself, from bahu = much and vrīhi = rice, denotes a rich person—one who has much rice.

{{Further|Śikṣā}}

Classical Sanskrit distinguishes about 36 [[phoneme]]s.  There is, however, some [[allophone|allophony]] and the writing systems used for Sanskrit generally indicate this, thus distinguishing 48 [[Phone (phonetics)|sounds]]. The sounds are traditionally listed in the order [[vowel]]s (''Ac''), [[diphthong]]s (''Hal''), [[anusvara]] and [[visarga]], [[Plosive consonant|plosives]] (Sparśa) and [[nasal stop|nasals]] (starting in the back of the mouth and moving forward), and finally the [[liquid consonants|liquids]] and [[fricative]]s, written in [[IAST]] as follows:

It should be understood that, while the script used here is [[Devanagari]], this has no particular importance.  It just happens currently to be the most popular script for Sanskrit.  The form of the symbols used to write Sanskrit has varied widely geographically and over time, and notably includes in modern times the Tamil and other modern Indian scripts.  What is important is that the adherence to the phonological classification of the symbols elucidated here has remained constant in Sanskrit since classical times.  It should be further noted that the phonology of modern Indian languages has evolved, and the values given to Devanagari symbols in, e.g. Hindi, differ somewhat from those of Sanskrit.

The [[vowel length|long vowels]] are pronounced twice as long as their short counterparts. Also, there exists a third, extra-long length for most vowels. This lengthening is called ''[[pluti]]''; the lengthened vowels, called ''pluta'', are used in various cases, but particularly in the [[vocative]]. The ''pluti'' is not accepted by all grammarians. The vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} continue as allophonic variants of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] {{IPA|/ai/}}, {{IPA|/au/}} and are categorised as diphthongs by Sanskrit grammarians even though they are realised phonetically as simple long vowels.

Additional points:
* There are some additional signs traditionally listed in tables of the [[Devanagari]] script:
** The diacritic {{lang-sa2|ं}} called ''anusvāra'', ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|ṃ}}''). It is a ''pure'' voiced ''nasal'' sound having no oral or oro-nasal articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/anusvara.pdf|title = A MONOGRAPH ON THE ANUSVĀRA OF THE TAITTIRĪYA KṚṢṆA YAJUR VEDA|date = |accessdate = |website = http://www.sanskritweb.net/|publisher = |last = Sharma|first = Shriramana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} {{xref|(See also {{slink|Anusvara|Sanskrit}})}}
** The diacritic {{lang-sa2|ः}} called ''[[visarga]]'', represents voiceless glottal fricative (IPA: [h]) whose voiced counterpart is the consonant ''{{IAST|h}}'' {{IPA|[ɦ]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09372-grantha.pdf|title=Proposal to encode the Grantha script in Unicode|last=Sharma|first=Shriramana|date=2009-10-24|website=https://www.unicode.org/|publisher=|page=40|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The diacritic {{lang-sa2|ँ}} called ''[[candrabindu]]'' indicates the nasalization of a vowel or the semi-vowels y,v,l&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10392r2-chandrabindus.pdf|title=Request to encode South Indian CANDRABINDU-s|last=Sharma,|first=Shriramana|date=2010-10-11|website=https://www.unicode.org/|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If a lone consonant needs to be written without any following vowel, it is given a ''virāma'' (or ''[[halanta]]'') diacritic below ({{lang-sa2|प्}}).
* The vowel {{IPA|/aː/}} in Sanskrit is realised as being more central and less back than the closest English approximation, which is {{IPA|/ɑː/}}. But the grammarians have classified it as a back vowel.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2001 p. "&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurer|first=Walter|title=The sanskrit language : an introductory grammar and reader|publisher=Curzon|location=Surrey, England|year=2001|isbn=0-7007-1382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ancient Sanskrit grammarians classified the vowels as [[velar]]s, [[retroflex]]es, [[palatal]]s and [[plosive]]s rather than as back, central and front vowels. Hence {{lang-sa2|ए}} and {{lang-sa2|ओ}} are classified respectively as palato-velar (a+i) and labio-velar (a+u) vowels respectively. But the grammarians have classified them as [[diphthong]]s and in prosody, each is given two ''mātrās''. This does not necessarily mean that they are proper diphthongs, but neither excludes the possibility that they could have been proper diphthongs at a very ancient stage. These vowels are pronounced as long {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} respectively by priests of today. Other than the "four" diphthongs, Sanskrit usually disallows any other diphthong—vowels in succession, where they occur, are converted to [[semivowel]]s according to [[sandhi]] rules.
* The vowels {{IPA|[r̩]}} and {{IPA|[r̩ː]}} were [[syllabic r]]hotics,{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=53, Allen describes this as the "vowel ṛ", a terminology that is now unfashionable, the difference being that the modern term avoids the use of the concept "vowel"}} much the same as in English "butter" and the Hindi "patr", meaning letter. Indian descendant languages of Sanskrit lost the vocalic r, and Indian pandits came to pronounce it as variously "ri" in the North - as in the name of the god known there as "krishn" -, "ru" in the West - where the same god is commonly referred to as "krushna" -, and "ra" in the East.  When vocalic r reappeared in modern Indian languages due to the loss of final "a" in Sanskrit loan words such as "patra" &gt; "patr" in Hindi (ending in a vocalic r rather than short a, in accordance with Hindi phonology), replacing Prakrit and Apabramsha "patta" - the natural derivative of the Sanskrit - it was not recognised by modern speakers that this corresponded to the vocalic r of ancient Sanskrit.

In the earlier language, {{lang-sa2|व}} was pronounced as the [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}}, but it later developed into a [[labio-dental]] sound.{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=57}}   To an English speaker's ear, this sound may be interpreted as the English "v" or the English "w", depending on context and precise articulation.     Moreover, the Sanskrit व has a considerable range of articulation depending on position. .{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=28,58}}  It is nonetheless understood in the Sanskrit writing system, as well as by speakers of modern Indian languages, as one and the same phoneme.

=== Accent ===
{{main|Vedic accent}}

Vedic Sanskrit has [[pitch accent]]; some syllables have a high tone, and the following syllable is a falling tone, though through ellipsis a falling tone may occur elsewhere.

=== Phonology and sandhi ===

The Sanskrit vowels are as discussed in the section above. The long syllabic l (ḹ) is not attested, and is only discussed by grammarians for systematic reasons. Its short counterpart ḷ occurs in a single root only, kḷp "to order, array". Long syllabic r (ṝ) is also quite marginal, occurring in the genitive plural of r-stems (e.g. ''mātṛ'' "mother" and ''pitṛ'' "father" have gen.pl. ''mātṝṇām'' and ''pitṝṇām''). i, u, ṛ, ḷ are vocalic allophones of consonantal y, v, r, l. There are thus only 5 invariably vocalic [[phoneme]]s: a, ā, ī, ū, ṝ.

[[Visarga]] ḥ {{lang-sa2|ः}} is an [[allophone]] of r and s, and [[anusvara]] ṃ, [[Devanagari]] {{lang-sa2| ं}} of any nasal, both in [[pausa]] (i.e., the [[nasalized vowel|nasalised vowel]]). The exact pronunciation of the three sibilants may vary, but they are distinct phonemes. Voiced sibilants, such as z {{IPA|/z/}}, ẓ {{IPA|/ʐ/}}, and ź {{IPA|/ʑ/}} as well as its aspirated counterpart źh {{IPA|/ʑʱ/}}, were inherited by [[Proto-Indo-Aryan language|Proto-Indo-Aryan]] from Proto-Indo-Iranian but lost around or after the time of the [[Rigveda]], as evidenced due to ḷh (an aspirated retroflex lateral consonant) being metrically a cluster (that was most likely of the form ẓḍh; aspirated fricatives are exceedingly rare in any language). The [[retroflex consonant]]s are somewhat marginal phonemes, often being conditioned by their phonetic environment; they do not continue a [[PIE]] series and are often ascribed by some linguists to the [[substratum|substratal]] influence of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_/ai_n28679333|title= On the Indo-European origins of the retroflexes in Sanskrit|accessdate  = 8 January 2009| author=Hamp, Eric P.|date =   October–December 1996| publisher = The Journal of the American Oriental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other substrate languages. The nasal {{IPA|[ɲ]}} is a conditioned allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} ({{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ɳ/}} are distinct phonemes—aṇu 'minute', 'atomic' [nom. sg. neutr. of an adjective] is distinctive from anu 'after', 'along'; phonologically independent /ŋ/ occurs only marginally, e.g. in prāṅ 'directed forwards/towards' [nom. sg. masc. of an adjective]). There are thus 31 consonantal or semi-vocalic phonemes, consisting of four/five kinds of stops realised both with or without aspiration and both voiced and voiceless, three nasals, four semi-vowels or liquids, and four fricatives, written in [[IAST]] transliteration as follows: k, kh, g, gh; c, ch, j, jh; ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh; t, th, d, dh; p, ph, b, bh; m, n, ṇ; y, r, l, v; ś, ṣ, s, h or a total of 36 unique Sanskrit phonemes altogether.

The [[phonology|phonological]] rules which are applied when combining morphemes to a word, and when combining words to a sentence, are collectively called ''[[sandhi]]'' "composition". Texts are written phonetically, with sandhi applied (except for the so-called ''padapāṭha'').

=== Phonological processes ===
'''{{vanchor|Abhinidhāna|Abhinidhana}}''' (lit. 'adjacent imposition'), (also known as ''{{IAST|āsthāpita}}'', 'stoppage', ''{{IAST|bhakṣya}}'' or ''{{IAST|bhukta}}'') is the [[No audible release|incomplete articulation]], or ""represssing or obscuring", of a [[plosive]] or, according to some texts, a [[semi-vowel]] (except r), which occurs before another plosive or a pause.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=137}} It was described in the various [[Prātiśākhya]]s as well as the ''{{IAST|Cārāyaṇīya Śikṣa}}''.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=137}} These texts are not unanimous on the [[Phonetic environment|environments]] that trigger abhinidhana, nor on the precise classes of consonants affected.

One ancient grammarian, ''{{IAST|Vyāḍi}}'' (in {{IAST|Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya}} 6.12), states that {{IAST|abhinidhāna}} only occurred when a consonant was [[Consonant gemination|doubled]], whereas according to the text of the ''{{IAST|Śākalas}}'' it was obligatory in this context but optional for plosives before another plosive of a different [[place of articulation]]. The ''{{IAST|Śākalas}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Atharva Veda Prātiśākhya}}'' agree on the observation that abhinidhana occurs only if there is a slight pause between the two consonants and not if they are pronounced jointly.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=138}} Word-finally, plosives undergo abhinidhāna according to the {{IAST|Atharva Veda Prātiśākhya}} and the ''{{IAST|Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya}}''. The latter text adds that final semivowels (excluding r) are also incompletely articulated.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=140}} The ''{{IAST|Atharva Veda Prātiśākhya}}'' 2.38 lists an exception: a plosive at the end of the word will not undergo {{IAST|abhinidhāna}} and will be fully released if it is followed by a consonant whose place of articulation is further back in the mouth.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|pp=141–2}} The ''{{IAST|Cārāyaṇīya Śikṣa}}'' states that the consonants  affected by abhinidhāna are the voiceless unaspirated plosives, the nasal consonants and the semivowels ''{{IAST|l}}'' and ''{{IAST|v}}''.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=142}}

According to Siddheshwar Varma, these differences may indicate geographical variation.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|p=139}} It is not clear whether abhinidhana was present in the early spoken Sanskrit or it developed at a later stage.{{Sfn|Varma|1961|pp=137–8}} In [[Prakrit]] and [[Pāli]] abhinidhana was carried a step forward into complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], as for example {{lang-sa|sapta}} to {{lang-pka|satta}}.

== Syntax ==

Because of Sanskrit's complex [[declension]] system, the [[word order]] is free.&lt;ref name="Staal1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.F. Staal|title=Word Order in Sanskrit and Universal Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqihQhNkqu4C&amp;pg=PA28|date=31 January 1967|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In usage, there is a strong tendency toward [[subject–object–verb|subject – object – verb (SOV)]], which was the original system in place in Vedic prose. However, there are exceptions when word pairs cannot be transposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Gillon|first=B.S | date= 25 March 1996 | journal=Indian linguistics | issn=0378-0759 |volume=57 | title=Word order in Classical Sanskrit | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2875140 |issue=1 – 4 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peculiar characteristics ==

In the introduction to his celebrated translation of [[Vidyakara]]'s 'Subhashitaratnakosha', [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H.H. Ingalls]] describes some peculiar characteristics of the Sanskrit language. He refers to the enormous vocabulary of Sanskrit, and also of the presence of a larger choice of synonyms in Sanskrit than any other language he knew of. Further, he writes, just as there exist a vast number of synonyms for almost any word in Sanskrit, there also exist synonymous constructions. Ingalls writes that in elementary Sanskrit examinations he would ask his students to write in Sanskrit the sentence 'You must fetch the horse' in ten different ways. Actually, Ingalls explains, it is possible to write the sentence in Sanskrit in around fifteen different ways 'by using active or passive constructions, imperative or optative, an auxiliary verb, or any of the three gerundive forms, each of which, by the way, gives a different metrical pattern'. Ingalls emphasizes that while these constructions differ formally, emotionally they are identical and completely interchangeable. He comments that in any natural language this would be impossible. Ingalls uses this and other arguments to show that Sanskrit is not a natural language, but an 'artificial' language. By 'artificial', he explains he means it was learned after some other Indian language had been learned by simple conditioning. Ingalls writes: 'Every Indian, one may suppose, grew up learning naturally the language of his mother and his playmates. Only after this and if he belonged to the priesthood or the nobility or to such a professional caste as that of the clerks, the physicians, or the astrologers would he learn Sanskrit. As a general rule, Sanskrit was not the language of the family. It furnished no subconscious symbols for the impressions which we receive in childhood nor for the emotions which form our character in early adolescence.'&lt;ref name="Vidyākara 1965 p. "&gt;{{cite book|author=Vidyākara|title=An anthology of Sanskrit court poetry; Vidyākara's|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1965|isbn=978-0-674-03950-6|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shooting sports]], a '''shot grouping''', or simply '''group''', is the pattern of [[projectile]] impacts on a [[shooting target|target]] from multiple shots taken in one shooting session.  The tightness of the grouping (the proximity of all the shots to each other) is a measure of the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] of a weapon, and a measure of the shooter's consistency and skill.&lt;ref name=Matunas2003&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5TKeLd6sw4C&amp;pg=PA65 |pages=65–6 |title=Do-it-yourself Gun Repair: Gunsmithing at Home |last=Matunas |first=Edward |publisher=Woods N' Water |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-9722804-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson2014&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUwFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |pages=196–8 |title=ABCs of Rifle Shooting |last=Watson |first=David |publisher=F+W Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4402-3897-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the grouping displacement (the distance between the calculated group center and the intended point of aim) is a measure of [[accuracy]].

Tightness of shot groupings are calculated by measuring the distance between bullet holes on the target (center-to-center) in length measurements such as [[millimeter]]s or [[inch]]es.  Often that measurement is converted into [[Angular unit|angular measurements]], such as [[milliradian]]s (mils) or [[minutes of angle]] (MOAs), which expresses the size of shot spreads regardless of the target distance.  Thus, by using angular measurements, one can reliably compare the relative tightness of shot groupings fired at different distances.

== Uses of the term ==
For [[firearm]]s that shoot one round at a time, a shot grouping test can be used to measure the accuracy of the entire shooting system: the weapon's mechanical precision and the uniformity of the ammunition.  The weapon is fixed into position on a test mount, and aimed at a target.  Multiple shots using rounds from the same type and batch are fired to observe how the weapon groups the shots.  If a person holds the weapon and shoots it, the grouping measures the combination of the person's skill and the weapon's accuracy.&lt;ref name=Watson2014/&gt;

In [[shotgun]] shooting, the grouping is also called the ''pattern''.  The pattern is the spread of [[shot (pellet)|shot]]s from a single [[shotshell]], measured as the smallest circle containing all the shots on the target.  The barrel of a shotgun is designed to deliver a wide or narrow scattering, depending on the expected use.  Shooting at close range indicates a cylinder bore barrel to deliver a wide grouping, while for hunting at longer distances such as 50 yards or meters, a [[choke (firearm)|choke]] is recommended for to constrict the scattering for a tighter grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briley.com/understandingshotgunchokesabriefexplanationbybriley.aspx |title=Understanding Shotgun Chokes, A brief explanation by Briley |first=Cliff |last=Moller |publisher=Briley Manufacturing |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729172417/http://www.briley.com/understandingshotgunchokesabriefexplanationbybriley.aspx |archivedate=July 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archery]], a shot grouping is the result of one person shooting multiple arrows at a target.  A tight grouping indicates consistency in the archer's [[form (exercise)|form]].&lt;ref name=Engh2005/&gt;

== Firearms ==
[[File:Mil sight adjustment.png|thumb|right|Diagram illustrating the relationship between distance, group size on the target (subtension) and angular group size.]]
Mean point of impact (MPI) is the calculated center of the grouping, which is the average center of all the shots, and is not necessarily located at a hole in the target.&lt;ref name=Watson2014 /&gt;  The process of mechanically readjusting the [[gunsight]]’s point of aim to match the MPI is called [[sighting in]] or “zeroing” the aim.  The size of the grouping is described as the diameter of the smallest circle that can be drawn to contain all the shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bdy7mT4iWMgC&amp;pg=PA97 |page=87 |title=A to Z Guide to White-tailed Deer and Deer Hunting |last=Gilbert |first=Randall |publisher=Woods N' Water |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-9707493-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "flier" is a shot from the same shooting session that is farther from the general grouping, considered to be the [[outlier]] of the group.  Such shots may be the result of an unexpected gust of wind causing drifting, a muscular flinch of the shooter at the time of the trigger pull, a problem with the firearm mechanism, or inconsistency in the ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwktAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT174 |pages=172–75 |title=The Self-Reliance Manifesto: Essential Outdoor Survival Skills |first=Len |last=McDougall |publisher=Skyhorse |year=2013 |isbn=9781628733006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Single fliers may be discounted when evaluating large groupings, but if fliers occur often, then the problem should be traced to its origin.&lt;ref name=Watson2014 /&gt;

While target shooting with a [[handgun]], if a grouping is consistently off-center then the shooter is instructed to alter the body angle or the stance, rather than shifting the arm, wrist or hand, which should remain in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ2ObSfrWSoC&amp;pg=PA214 |page=214 |title=Ed McGivern's Book of Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting |last=McGivern |first=Ed |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60239-086-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metric units ===
When using [[International System of Units|SI units]], shooting accuracy is more easily measured in [[milliradian]]s by measuring the group size in millimeters (or in centimeters and multiplying by a factor of 10) and dividing by the range measured in meters.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{group size in mils} = \frac{\text{group size in mm}}{\text{range in m}} = \frac{\text{group size in cm}}{\text{range in m}} \times 10 &lt;/math&gt;

Since shot grouping are small angles, the linear formula above can be used as a good approximation for group sizes in mils. The error of assuming that 0.1 mil equals 1 cm at 100 meters is about 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|-7}} (or 0.00001 %).

=== Imperial units ===
When using [[imperial units]], shooting accuracy is more easily measured in [[minutes of arc]] (symbol ′, sometimes called "minutes of angle" or "MOA" for short) by measuring the group size in inches, multiplying by a factor of 100 and dividing by the range measured in yards.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{group size in arcminutes} \approx \frac{\text{group size in inches}}{\text{range in yd}} \times 100 \times 1.04717593 \approx \frac{\text{group size in inches}}{\text{range in yd}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

The linear formula above for measuring group sizes in arcminutes is less precise than using milliradians together with metric units, but can still be a good approximation depending on the demands for precision. The error of assuming that 1′ equals 1" at 100 yd is about 4.5 %.

When shooting at a target 100 yards away, 1′ is a circle of approximately 1.047 inches in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexadine.com/WhatMOA.htm Dexadine Ballistics Software - ballistic data for shooting and reloading]&lt;/ref&gt; while at 100 meters, 1′ is approximately a 29.1 millimeter circle. The arcminute is an [[Minute and second of arc|arc-based measurement]], with 1′ equal to one minute of one degree. The two-dimensional circle surrounding a shooter always has 21,600 arcminutes because there are 60 minutes in each degree, and 360 degrees in the circle.

=== Benchmarks ===
A [[big-game hunting]] [[rifle]] is considered accurate if its shots fall within 1.5′ (≈ 0.5&amp;nbsp;mil), while a rifle intended for small animals is expected to have an accuracy of 1′ or less (under 0.3&amp;nbsp;mil, also known as "sub-MOA").&lt;ref name=Matunas2003 /&gt; [[Handgun]]s are typically less accurate; at a shooting distance of 25&amp;nbsp;yd, a grouping is considered acceptable for [[self-defense]] if the shots fall within a circle of 4 to 5 inches, which is 15′ to 19′ (equivalent to a grouping of 100-150&amp;nbsp;mm at 25 meters, which is 4-6 mils),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9rHbdm6xDoC&amp;pg=PA31 |page=31 |title=The Gun Digest Book of Personal Protection &amp; Home Defense |last=Campbell |first=Robert K. |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-89689-938-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, representing the shot pattern needed to hit the vital organs of a human target.  Expensive and well-machined [[match-grade]] pistols demonstrate a higher accuracy than normal handguns, capable of groupings of 1.25 inches at 25 yards, which is about 5′ (equivalent to about 30&amp;nbsp;mm at 25 meters, which is 1.2 mil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8wX1IVbBWYC&amp;pg=PA87 |page=87 |title=The Gun Digest Book of Tactical Gear |first=Dan |last=Shideler |first2=Derrek |last2=Sigler |first3=Ken |last3=Ramage |publisher=Gun Digest Books |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-89689-684-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archery ==
With the increased element of human skill in archery, a grouping on target is more a measure of the archer's skill. If an archer is not getting a consistent grouping, then their basic form needs work. If an archer's [[arrow]]s are grouping on target but off center, this shows consistent basic form, with better results achievable after slight adjustments.&lt;ref name=Engh2005&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHEnFz1m_JQC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–3, 86 |title=Archery Fundamentals |last=Engh |first=Douglas |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7360-5501-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=42 |title=Archery: Steps to Success |edition=4 |last=Haywood |first=Kathleen |last2=Lewis |first2=Catherine |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4504-4468-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the equipment side, bow stabilizers have been used since the 1960s by tournament competitors and by bow hunters to counteract the torque of shooting the arrow. A tighter grouping may be achieved with such a stabilizer, which adds mass extending outward on a [[Moment (physics)|moment arm]], usually mounted perpendicular to the bow riser, aligned with the arrow path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQAtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT293 |page=293 |title=The Traditional Bowyers Encyclopedia |last=Bertalan |first=Dan |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62873-012-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haywood and Lewis 2013, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpE9ASq9F-QC&amp;pg=PA131 |page=131 |title=Precision Archery |first=Steve |last=Ruis |first2=Claudia |last2=Stevenson |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7360-4634-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3804">'''Sjur Brækhus''' (19 June 1918 – 19 May 2009) was a Norwegian legal scholar and judge.

He was born in [[Bergen]] as a son of captain and ship-owner Sigurd Alfred Brækhus (1879–1952) and Hilda Sverresdatter Klingenberg (1884–1957). He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Frogner School]] in 1936 and graduated with the [[cand.jur.]] degree at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1941. He was a deputy judge in [[Eiker, Modum and Sigdal District Court]] from 1941 to 1942. He became a [[research fellow]] at the University of Oslo in 1945 and took the [[dr.juris]] degree in 1947 with the thesis ''Meglerens rettslige stilling''. He was married twice, the first time from 1945 to 1957.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Sjur Brækhus|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Birger Stuevold|last=Lassen|authorlink=Birger Stuevold Lassen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sjur_Brækhus/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was hired as a [[docent]] at the University of Oslo in 1947, and was promoted to professor already in 1948. He remained here until retirement in 1988. He served as [[dean (academic)|dean]] from 1963 to 1967. His main field was [[private law]] in general, and his main work was ''Omsetning og kreditt'', released in four volumes between 1985 and 1998. Sub-fields of note were [[maritime law]], [[bankruptcy law]] and court law.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Other well-known books are ''Norsk tingsrett'' (1964 with Axel Hærem), ''Bergning'' (1968), ''Konkursrett'' (1969), and ''Sjørett, voldgift og lovvalg'' (1998).

'''Sketch Engine''' is a corpus manager and [[text analysis]] software developed by Lexical Computing Limited since 2003. Its purpose is to enable people studying language behaviour ([[lexicographers]], researchers in  [[corpus linguistics]], translators or language learners) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. Sketch Engine gained its name after one of the key features, [[word sketch]]es: one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Baisa|first2=Vít|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Jakubíček|first4=Miloš|last5=Kovář|first5=Vojtěch|last6=Michelfeit|first6=Jan|last7=Rychlý|first7=Pavel|last8=Suchomel|first8=Vít|title=The Sketch Engine: ten years on|journal=Lexicography|date=10 July 2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–36|doi=10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|issn=2197-4292|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it supports and provides corpora in 90+ languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/user-guide/user-manual/corpora/by-language/ |title= Languages in Sketch Engine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of development ==
Sketch Engine is a product of Lexical Computing Limited, a company founded in 2003 by the lexicographer and research scientist [[Adam Kilgarriff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kilgarriff.co.uk Adam Kilgarriff's home page]&lt;/ref&gt; He started collaboration with Pavel Rychlý, a computer scientist working at the Natural Language Processing Centre at [[Masaryk University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz Natural Language Processing Centre, Masaryk University]&lt;/ref&gt; and the developer of Manatee and Bonito (two major parts of the software suite), and introduced the concept of [[word sketch]]es.

Since then, Sketch Engine has been commercial software, however all the core features of Manatee and Bonito that were developed by 2003 (and extended since then) are freely available under the [[GPL]] license within the NoSketch Engine suite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske NoSketch Engine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
* [[Word sketch]]es – a one-page automatic derived summary of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour
* Word sketch difference – compares and contrasts two words by analysing their collocation
* Distributional [[Thesaurus]] – automated thesaurus finding words with similar meaning or appearing in the same/similar context
* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] search – finds examples of a word form, lemma, phrase, tag or complex structure
* [[Collocation]] search – word co-occurrence analysis displaying the most frequent words (to a search word) which can be regarded as collocation candidates
* Word lists – generates frequency lists which can be filtered with complex criteria
* [[n-gram]]s – generates frequency lists of multi-word expressions
* [[Terminology extraction|Terminology]] / [[Keyword (linguistics)|Keyword]] extraction (both monolingual and bilingual) – automatic extraction key words and multi-word terms from texts (based on frequency count and linguistic criteria)
* Diachronic analysis ([[Trend analysis|Trends]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Herman|first2=Ondřej|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Jakubíček|first5=Miloš|title=DIACRAN: a framework for diachronic analysis|journal=Corpus Linguistics 2015|date=2015|pages=65–70|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Diacran_CL2015.pdf|publisher=Lancaster: UCREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; – detecting words which undergo changes in the frequency of use in time (show trending words)
* Corpus building and management – create corpora from the Web or uploaded texts including [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[lemmatization]] which can be used as [[data mining]] software
* [[Parallel corpus]] (bilingual) facilities – looking up translation examples (EUR-Lex corpus, [[Europarl corpus]], OPUS corpus, etc.) or building parallel corpus from own aligned texts

== Architecture ==
[[File:Thesaurus in Sketch Engine.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Sketch Engine thesaurus page|Thesaurus cloud of the lemma ''work'' in Sketch Engine]]

Sketch Engine consists of three main components: an underlying [[database management system]] called Manatee, a web interface search front-end called Bonito and a web interface for corpus building and management called Corpus Architect.
&lt;ref name="bonito"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|title=Manatee/bonito–a modular corpus manager|journal=1st Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2007|pages=65–70|url=http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2007/raslan07.pdf#page=73|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manatee ===

Manatee is a [[database management system]] specifically devised for effective indexing of large text corpora. It is based on the idea of [[inverted index]]ing (keeping an index of all positions of a given word in the text). It has been used to index text corpora comprising tens of billions of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pomikálek|first1=Jan|last2=Jakubíček|first2=Miloš|last3=Rychlý|first3=Pavel|title=Building a 70 billion word corpus of English from ClueWeb|journal=Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'12)|date=2012|url=http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/1047_Paper.pdf|publisher=European Language Resources Association (ELRA)|location=Istanbul, Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searching corpora indexed by Manatee is performed by formulating queries in the Corpus Query Language (CQL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ |title=CQL – Corpus Query Language |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manatee is written in [[C++]] and offers an [[API]] for a number of other programming languages including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Recently, it was rewritten into [[Go (programming language)|Go]] for faster processing of corpus queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|last2=Rábara|first2=Radoslav|title=Concurrent Processing of Text Corpus Queries|journal=Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2015|pages=49–58|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Concurrent_Processing_2015.pdf|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bonito ===

Bonito is a web interface for Manatee providing access to corpus search. In the [[client–server model]], Manatee is the server and Bonito plays the client part. It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref name="bonito" /&gt;

=== Corpus Architect ===

Corpus Architect is a web interface providing corpus building and management features. It is also written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Applications ==
Sketch Engine has been used by major British or other publishing houses for producing dictionaries such as [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]], [[Dictionnaires Le&amp;nbsp;Robert]], [[Oxford University Press]] or [[Shogakukan]] and four of the UK’s five biggest dictionary publishers use Sketch Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=39760 |title=Using Computational Lexicography for Dictionary Production with the Sketch Engine

The '''Sonsorolese language''' is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] spoken in [[Palau]], originally on the islands composing the state of [[Sonsorol]], and spreading through migration elsewhere in the country. It is very close to [[Tobian language|Tobian]].

==Introduction==

===History===
Sonsorolese is mostly spoken in the [[Palau]] archipelago, particularly in Sonsorol, [[Pulo Anna]], and the Merir Islands (ethnologue.com). The language is one of the two indigenous languages spoken in the area and is actually the most spoken in the area, especially in Palau (sonsorol.com).
As the language being established in Palau, Palau has a little history of how it became what it is today. The country was settled in the early BC era from the Philippines and Indonesia (Wikipedia). The area became part of the Spanish–American War and in the end the Spanish gave up their territory of Palau and some of the other islands to the Germans. Later down the road the Japanese took the land and then gave up to the United States during World War 2.

===Population===
There are about 360 speakers spread out within 60 islands. Some linguists believe that the language is fading little by little. The population started to fall due to an influenza epidemic that the Germans caused {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.  Most speakers of Sonsorol are bilingual, with their second language being English, to be able to communicate with others outside their island [http://sonsorol.com sonsorol.com]. The language is an official language for the areas where it is spoken. Some sister languages of Sonsorol are Ulithian, Woleaian, and Satawalese. The language is part of the [[Austronesian language]] family.

=== Geographic distribution ===
*[[Northern Mariana Islands]]: unknown (immigrant language)
*[[Palau]]: 600 speakers
** [[Sonsorol]]: 60 speakers+
*** [[Merir]]: 5 speakers+
*** [[Pulo Anna]]: 25 speakers+
*** [[Sonsorol]]: 29 speakers+
** Rest of the country: 540 speakers

=== Dialects ===
* [[Pulo-Annan dialect|Pulo-Annan]]
* [[Sonsorolese dialect|Sonsorolese]]

==Sounds==

===Consonants===
In Sonsorolese, there are 19 [[consonants]]. These consonants are: /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /c/, /k/, /g/, /m/, /n/, /f/, /v/, /j/, /x/, /ɣ/, /r/, /w/, /s/, /ŋ/, and /ʟʲ/.

Consonants that are plosive and labial are p and b. T and d are dental-alveolar and plosive.  The consonant c is palatal and plosive.  K and g are velar and plosive consonants.  The consonant that is nasal and dental-alveolar is n.  F and v are fricative and labio-dental.  The consonant that is fricative and dental-alveolar is s. J is a fricative and palatal consonant.  The consonants x and ɣ are fricative and velar. R is rolled and a dental-alveolar consonant. Lastly, w is a continuant and labial consonant (Capell, 1969).

===Vowels===
Sonsorolese has 5 vowels which are; /o/, /e/, /a/, /u/, and /i/.  The vowels that are in the front for frontness are /i/, /e/, and /a/. The back frontness vowels are /u/ and /o/. As for the height of the vowels, /i/ and /u/ is high, /e/ and /o/ is mid, and /a/ is low. There are many exceptions to the vowel usage depending on where the vowel is placed and the consonants used before and after the vowel. The vowel /i/ sometimes is drawn back in frontness, which produces a different sound.  /E/ is considered as a chiefly vowel and is rare. The only time you will see the vowel used is when it is in the body of a word.  The vowel /a/ developed a velar fricative that involves either a /x/ or /y/ in front of the vowel. /O/ is mostly used in [[diphthongs]] and a variety of French influenced words. And lastly the vowel /u/ is to lip-round the word that is being pronounced.

The language does allow diphthongs.  Some of them are /ae/, /ai/, /ao/, and /au/. Some of the diphthongs are considered to be difficult to pronounce and some do elongate the vowel sound. An example of the diphthong /ae/ is mae, which means breadfruit in English (Capell, 1969).

===Furtive vowels===
[[Furtive vowels]] are unique and are only in a few languages. Sonsorolese is one of the few languages that have furtive vowels. The vowels become furtive when one does not hear the vowel being pronounced. The vowel is “whispered” or silent when pronouncing certain words (Capell, 1969). Capell stated that there are 3 ways that furtive vowels occur, which are; “as finals, after a consonant, after a full, generally long vowel, and before a consonant, when they are acoustically similar to falling diphthongs, after non-final consonants a furtive /i/ or /u/ produces palatalization or velarisation (respectively) of the consonants.”

==Orthography and pronunciation==
Sonsorolese is usually a [[spoken language]], but is occasionally written to the writer's preference. Many of the sounds are like that in [[Tobian language|Tobian]] and [[Woleaian language|Woleaian]]. A couple of [[dialect]]s include the pronunciation of ''d'', which is common at the beginning of words and similar to {{IPA|[ð]}}; ''r'' is pronounced as in Spanish, as opposed to English; also, ''l'' is always pronounced with tongue touching the back roof of the mouth and sounds something like a combination of the {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} sounds. For that reason, some Sonsorolese prefer to spell their els as {{angle bracket|ɡl}}. As in Woleaian, silent vowels are usually found at the end of Sonsorolese words. For example, in ''Dongosaro'', the native name for [[Sonsorol]] island, the final ''-o'' is silent.

== Grammar==

===Basic word order===
Sonsorolese’s [[basic word order]] when constructing a sentence is a subject, object, verb (SOV) order.

An example of the use of the SOV word order is:
Etai maho tipel= I am not happy. 
Etai (I) is our subject, maho (happy) is our object, and tipel (not) is our adverb for this example sentence. 
As for asking questions, the word order does stay the same and there are many examples from sonsorol.com.  
Emaho tipomu = are you happy?

===Reduplication===
There is full [[reduplication]] in the Sonsorol language.
  
Ex. Orange = Hulu&lt;br /&gt;
Oranges= Huluhulu

===Numerals===
Sonsorolese numeral system is a base 10 system.  The [[numeral system]] can go up to 1,000, which is “da ngaladi” (sonsorol.com).

*deo "one"
*luwou "two"
*doruw "three"
*fauw "four"
*rimouwa "five"
*worouwa "six"
*fuduwa "seven"
*waruwa "eight"
*tiwouwa "nine"
*delh "ten"
*liyelh "twenty"

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
There are many resources and materials that deal with the Sonsorol language, which includes newspapers, small textbooks, dictionary, YouTube videos, and blogs.{{CN|date=September 2017}} Without any of these documentations of the language, the language may have a lesser chance of surviving. As the school system improves in [[Palau]], there will be more textbooks being produced in the language to provide a resource to learn the language. YouTube videos help give exposure of the language and culture, which can be a good way to preserve.

===Vitality===
Sonsorol language is considered endangered, but the language is becoming stronger because of [[intergenerational transmission]]{{CN|date=July 2017}}. In Palau, schools are being built one by one for the younger generation to attend school to learn the language (sonsorol.com). Though the number of speakers is low, the language is increasing its number of speakers. Native speakers are attempting to preserve and keep the language alive by intergenerational transmission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44115">'''Statistical learning''' is the ability for humans and other animals to extract statistical regularities from the world around them to learn about the environment. Although statistical learning is now thought to be a generalized learning mechanism, the phenomenon was first identified in human infant [[language acquisition]].

The earliest evidence for these [[statistical|statistics]] [[learning]] abilities comes from a study by [[Jenny Saffran]], [[Richard N. Aslin|Richard Aslin]], and [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]], in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone [[speech]]. Each stream was composed of four three-[[syllable]] “[[pseudoword]]s” that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing “pseudowords” as opposed to “nonwords” from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together and which ones only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning is thought to be one way that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words.

Since the initial discovery of the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition, the same mechanism has been proposed for elements of [[phonology|phonological]] acquisition,  and [[syntax|syntactical]] acquisition, as well as in non-linguistic domains. Further research has also indicated that statistical learning is likely a domain-general and even species-general learning mechanism, occurring for visual as well as auditory information, and in both [[primates]] and non-primates.

==Lexical Acquisition==
The role of statistical learning in language acquisition has been particularly well documented in the area of [[lexicon|lexical]] acquisition.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|title=Statistical language learning: mechanisms and constraints|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=110–114|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01243}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important contribution to infants' understanding of segmenting words from a continuous stream of speech is their ability to recognize statistical regularities of the speech heard in their environments.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt; Although many factors play an important role, this specific mechanism is powerful and can operate over a short time scale.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

===Original Findings===
[[File:Spectrogram-19thC.png|right|thumbnail|A [[spectrogram]] of a male speaker saying the phrase "nineteenth century." There is no clear demarcation where one word ends and the next begins.]]

It is a well-established finding that, unlike [[written language]], [[spoken language]] does not have any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them.&lt;ref name="Brent &amp; Cartwright, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brent|first=Michael R.|author2=Cartwright, Timothy A. |title=Distributional regularity and phonotactic constraints are useful for segmentation|journal=Cognition|year=1996|volume=61|issue=1–2|pages=93–125|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(96)00719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=J. R.|author2=Aslin, R. N. |author3=Newport, E. L. |title=Statistical Learning by 8-Month-Old Infants|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them.&lt;ref name="Brent &amp; Cartwright, 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; For example, in the phrase "pretty baby," children are more likely to hear the sounds ''pre'' and ''ty'' heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ''ty'' and ''ba'' together.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; In an [[artificial grammar learning]] study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task.&lt;ref name="Saffran, Newport, et al. (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|author2=Newport, Elissa L. |author3=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Word Segmentation: The Role of Distributional Cues|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=1996|volume=35|issue=4|pages=606–621|doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

To determine if young children have these same abilities Saffran Aslin and Newport exposed 8-month-old infants to an artificial grammar.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; The grammar was composed of four words, each composed of three nonsense syllables. During the experiment, infants heard a continuous speech stream of these words . Importantly, the speech was presented in a monotone with no cues (such as pauses, intonation, etc.) to word boundaries other than the statistical probabilities. Within a word, the transitional [[probability]] of two syllable pairs was 1.0: in the word ''bidaku'', for example, the probability of hearing the syllable ''da'' immediately after the syllable ''bi'' was 100%. Between words, however, the transitional probability of hearing a syllable pair was much lower: After any given word (e.g., ''bidaku'') was presented, one of three words could follow (in this case, ''padoti'', ''golabu'', or ''tupiro''), so the likelihood of hearing any given syllable after ''ku'' was only 33%.

To determine if infants were picking up on the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword made up of the same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as ''dapiku'' and ''tilado'' that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ''ku'' never followed the syllable ''pi''.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt;

To look more closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport conducted another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as ''kupado''). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.

===Further Research===
This result has been the impetus for much more research on the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition and other areas (see &lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)"/&gt;). In a follow-up to the original report,&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; [[Richard N. Aslin|Aslin]], Saffran, and [[Elissa L. Newport|Newport]] found that even when words and part words occurred equally often in the speech stream, but with different transitional probabilities between syllables of words and part words, infants were still able to detect the statistical regularities and still preferred to listen to the novel part-words over the familiarized words.&lt;ref name="Aslin, Saffran, Newport, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aslin|first=R. N.|author2=Saffran, J. R. |author3=Newport, E. L. |title=Computation of Conditional Probability Statistics by 8-Month-Old Infants|journal=Psychological Science|year=1998|volume=9|issue=4|pages=321–324|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding provides stronger evidence that infants are able to pick up transitional probabilities from the speech they hear, rather than just being aware of frequencies of individual syllable sequences.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

Another follow-up study examined the extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their [[First language|native language]].&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2001a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R|title=Words in a sea of sounds: the output of infant statistical learning|journal=Cognition|year=2001a|volume=81|issue=2|pages=149–169|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2001a" /&gt; In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.

A related finding indicates that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities from a single set of input,&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|author2=Wilson, Diana P. |title=From Syllables to Syntax: Multilevel Statistical Learning by 12-Month-Old Infants|journal=Infancy|year=2003|volume=4|issue=2|pages=273–284|doi=10.1207/S15327078IN0402_07}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they are able to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003" /&gt; At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this indicates that infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003" /&gt;

Despite the large role that statistical learning appears to play in lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn to segment words. Statistical learning studies are generally conducted with artificial grammars that have no cues to word boundary information other than transitional probabilities between words.  Real speech, though, has many different types of cues to word boundaries, including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] and [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] information.&lt;ref name="Mattys et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattys|first=Sven L.|author2=Jusczyk, Peter W. |author3=Luce, Paul A. |author4= Morgan, James L. |title=Phonotactic and Prosodic Effects on Word Segmentation in Infants|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1999|volume=38|issue=4|pages=465–494|doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the findings from these studies of statistical learning in language acquisition indicate that statistical properties of the language are a strong cue in helping infants learn their first language.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

==Phonological Acquisition==
There is much evidence that statistical learning is an important component of both discovering which phonemes are important for a given language and which contrasts within phonemes are important.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Rebecca L.|author2=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Infant artificial language learning and language acquisition|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2000|volume=4|issue=5|pages=178–186|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01467-4|pmid=10782103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werker|first=J. F.|author2=Yeung, H. H. |author3=Yoshida, K. A. |title=How Do Infants Become Experts at Native-Speech Perception?|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=21|issue=4|pages=221–226|doi=10.1177/0963721412449459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|title=Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=5|issue=11|pages=831–843|doi=10.1038/nrn1533|pmid=15496861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having this knowledge is important for aspects of both [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]].

===Distributional Learning===
Since the discovery of infants’ statistical learning abilities in word learning, the same general mechanism has also been studied in other facets of language learning. For example, it is well-established that infants can discriminate between [[phoneme]]s of many different languages but eventually become unable to discriminate between phonemes that do not appear in their native language;&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maye|first=Jessica|author2=Werker, Janet F |author3=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Infant sensitivity to distributional information can affect phonetic discrimination|journal=Cognition|year=2002|volume=82|issue=3|pages=B101–B111|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00157-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not clear how this decrease in discriminatory ability came about. Maye et al. suggested that the mechanism responsible might be a statistical learning mechanism in which infants track the distributional regularities of the sounds in their native language.&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2002" /&gt; To test this idea, Maye et al. exposed 6- and 8-month-old infants to a continuum of speech sounds that varied on the degree to which they were [[voice onset time|voiced]]. The distribution that the infants heard was either [[bimodal distribution|bimodal]], with sounds from both ends of the voicing continuum heard most often, or [[unimodality|unimodal]], with sounds from the middle of the distribution heard most often. The results indicated that infants from both age groups were sensitive to the distribution of phonemes. At test, infants heard either non-alternating (repeated exemplars of tokens 3 or 6 from an 8-token continuum) or alternating (exemplars of tokens 1 and 8) exposures to specific phonemes on the continuum. Infants exposed to the bimodal distribution listened longer to the alternating trials than the non-alternating trials while there was no difference in listening times for infants exposed to the unimodal distribution. This finding indicates that infants exposed the bimodal distribution were better able to discriminate sounds from the two ends of the distribution than were infants in the unimodal condition, regardless of age. This type of statistical learning differs from that used in lexical acquisition, as it requires infants to track frequencies rather than transitional probabilities, and has been named “distributional learning.”&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)"/&gt;

Distributional learning has also been found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants who were exposed to a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast.&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maye|first=Jessica|author2=Weiss, Daniel J. |author3=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Statistical phonetic learning in infants: facilitation and feature generalization|journal=Developmental Science|year=2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=122–134|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00653.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.

In a review of the role of distributional learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired.&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)" /&gt; However, it does seem clear that this type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing.&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)" /&gt;

===Perceptual Magnet Effect===
A related finding regarding statistical cues to phonological acquisition is a phenomenon known as the perceptual magnet effect.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|title=Human adults and human infants show a "perceptual magnet effect" for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1991|volume=50|issue=2|pages=93–107|doi=10.3758/BF03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P. K.|title=A new view of language acquisition|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2000|volume=97|issue=22|pages=11850–11857|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.22.11850|pmc=34178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P.|author2=Williams, K. |author3=Lacerda, F |author4=Stevens, K. |author5= Lindblom, B |title=Linguistic experience alters phonetic perception in infants by 6 months of age|journal=Science|year=1992|volume=255|issue=5044|pages=606–608|doi=10.1126/science.1736364|pmid=1736364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to the same category as the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991 /&gt; If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al. 1992" /&gt; That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004"/&gt;

==Syntactical Acquisition==
A statistical learning device has also been proposed as a component of syntactical acquisition for young children.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenberg (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidenberg|first=M. S.|title=Language Acquisition and Use: Learning and Applying Probabilistic Constraints|journal=Science|year=1997|volume=275|issue=5306|pages=1599–1603|doi=10.1126/science.275.5306.1599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora.&lt;ref name="Cartwright &amp; Brent, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Timothy A.|author2=Brent, Michael R. |title=Syntactic categorization in early language acquisition: formalizing the role of distributional analysis|journal=Cognition|year=1997|volume=63|issue=2|pages=121–170|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(96)00793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Redington et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=M|title=Distributional information: A powerful cue for acquiring syntactic categories|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1998|volume=22|issue=4|pages=425–469|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(99)80046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.

Later studies expanded these results by looking at the actual behavior of children or adults who had been exposed to artificial grammars.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt; These later studies also considered the role of statistical learning more broadly than the earlier studies, placing their results in the context of the statistical learning mechanisms thought to be involved with other aspects of language learning, such as lexical acquisition.

===Experimental Results===
Evidence from a series of four experiments conducted by Gomez and [[LouAnn Gerken|Gerken]] suggests that children are able to generalize [[grammar|grammatical]] structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Rebecca L|author2=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Artificial grammar learning by 1-year-olds leads to specific and abstract knowledge|journal=Cognition|year=1999|volume=70|issue=2|pages=109–135|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,.&lt;ref name="Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh-Pasek|first1=Kathy|last2=Kemler Nelson|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Jusczyk|first3=Peter W.|last4=Cassidy|first4=Kimberly Wright|last5=Druss|first5=Benjamin|last6=Kennedy|first6=Lori|title=Clauses are perceptual units for young infants|journal=Cognition|volume=26|issue=3|year=1987|pages=269–286|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located in the middle of the sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.

Together these studies suggest that infants are able to extract a substantial amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken, 1999"/&gt; Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or in the middle of the sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.

In a similar study, Saffran found that adults and older children ([[first grade|first]] and [[second grade]] children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language which had no cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present.&lt;ref name="Saffran 2001b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|title=The Use of Predictive Dependencies in Language Learning|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=2001b|volume=44|issue=4|pages=493–515|doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.

Although the number of studies dealing with statistical learning of syntactical information is limited, the available evidence does indicate that the statistical learning mechanisms are likely a contributing factor to children’s ability to learn their language.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenberg (1997)"/&gt;

==Statistical Learning in Bilingualism==
Much of the early work using statistical learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language,&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt; consistent with the process of language acquisition for [[monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are [[multilingualism|bilingual]].&lt;ref name="Schneider &amp; Hopp, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Harry D.|author2=Hopp, Jenna P. |title=The use of the Bilingual Aphasia Test for assessment and transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate language acquisition in minimally verbal children with autism|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|year=2011|volume=25|issue=6–7|pages=640–654|doi=10.3109/02699206.2011.570852}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who speak more than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple artificial languages simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages.&lt;ref name="Weiss et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Daniel J.|author2=Gerfen, Chip |author3=Mitchel, Aaron D. |title=Speech Segmentation in a Simulated Bilingual Environment: A Challenge for Statistical Learning?|journal=Language Learning and Development|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1080/15475440802340101|pmc=3981102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two artificial languages, adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were “congruent”—when the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent—a syllable that appeared in the middle of a word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language—and spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries.

Similar work replicates the finding that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in this case).&lt;ref name="Franco et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franco|first=Ana|author2=Cleeremans, Axel |author3=Destrebecqz, Arnaud |title=Statistical Learning of Two Artificial Languages Presented Successively: How Conscious?|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2011|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.’s paradigm,&lt;ref name="Weiss et al., 2009" /&gt; and participants did learn the first artificial language to which they had been exposed better than the second, although participants’ performance was above chance for both languages.

While statistical learning improves and strengthens multilingualism, it appears that the inverse is not true. In a study by Yim and Rudoy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yim|first=Dongsum|author2=Rudoy, John |title=Implicit Statistical Learning and Language Skills in Bilingual Children|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=August 2012|volume=56|pages=310–322|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0243)}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that both monolingual and bilingual children perform statistical learning tasks equally well.

Antovich and Graf Estes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Antovich|first=Dylan M.|author2=Graf Estes, Katharine |title=Learning across languages: bilingual experience supports dual language statistical word segmentation|journal= Developmental Science|date=January 2017|doi=10.1111/desc.12548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 14 month old bilingual children are better than monolinguals at segmenting two different artificial languages using transitional probability cues. They suggest that a bilingual environment in early childhood trains children to rely on statistical regularities to segment the speech flow and access two lexical systems.

==Limitations on Statistical Learning==

===Word-Referent Mapping===
A statistical learning mechanism has also been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and [[Linda B. Smith|Smith]] conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words.&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=C.|author2=Smith, L. B. |title=Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics|journal=Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=18|issue=5|pages=414–420|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x|pmid=17576281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated with one of those objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times over the course of the training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.

An alternative hypothesis is that learners in this type of task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism.&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medina|first=T. N.|author2=Snedeker, J. |author3=Trueswell, J. C. |author4= Gleitman, L. R. |title=How words can and cannot be learned by observation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=108|issue=22|pages=9014–9019|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105040108 |pmid=21576483 |pmc=3107260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trueswell|first=John C.|author2=Medina, Tamara Nicol |author3=Hafri, Alon |author4= Gleitman, Lila R. |title=Propose but verify: Fast mapping meets cross-situational word learning|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=126–156|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.10.001 |pmid=23142693 |pmc=3529979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge at the end of the training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single [[hypothesis]] and checking it on the next trial.&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013" /&gt; For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word ''vash'' she might hypothesize that ''vash'' refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word ''vash''. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word ''vash'' 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of ''vash'' (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of ''vash'') and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that ''vash'' referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, Trueswell et al. conducted a series of experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects).&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013" /&gt; Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.

Overall, these results, along with similar results from Medina et al., indicate that word meanings may not be learned through a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, which ask participants to hypothesize a mapping even on the first occurrence (i.e., not cross-situationally).&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011" /&gt; However, when the propose-but-verify mechanism has been compared to a statistical learning mechanism, the former was unable to reproduce individual learning trajectories nor fit as well as the latter.&lt;ref name="Kachergis et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kachergis|first=G. N.|author2=Yu, C. |author3=Shiffrin, R. M. |title=Cross-situational word learning is better modeled by associations than hypotheses.|journal=IEEE Conference on Development and Learning / EpiRob 2012|year=2012|doi=10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need for Social Interaction===
Additionally, statistical learning by itself cannot account even for those aspects of language acquisition for which it has been shown to play a large role. For example, [[Patricia K. Kuhl|Kuhl]], Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition.&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P. K.|title=Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure and social interaction on phonetic learning|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2003|volume=100|issue=15|pages=9096–9101|doi=10.1073/pnas.1532872100|pmid=12861072|pmc=166444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable to take advantage of the statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004" /&gt;

==Domain Generality==
Although the phenomenon of statistical learning was first discovered in the context of language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turk-Browne et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turk-Browne|first=Nicholas B.|author2=Jungé, Justin A. |author3=Scholl, Brian J. |title=The Automaticity of Visual Statistical Learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2005|volume=134|issue=4|pages=552–564|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.4.552}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together).&lt;ref name="Saffran, Johnson, et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R|author2=Johnson, Elizabeth K |author3=Aslin, Richard N |author4= Newport, Elissa L |title=Statistical learning of tone sequences by human infants and adults|journal=Cognition|year=1999|volume=70|issue=1|pages=27–52|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g.,&lt;ref name="Fiser &amp; Aslin, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiser|first=J.|author2=Aslin, R. N. |title=Unsupervised Statistical Learning of Higher-Order Spatial Structures from Visual Scenes|journal=Psychological Science|year=2001|volume=12|issue=6|pages=499–504|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00392}}&lt;/ref&gt; or time, e.g.,.&lt;ref name="Fiser &amp; Aslin, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiser|first=József|author2=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Statistical learning of higher-order temporal structure from visual shape sequences.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=458–467|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.3.458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other [[primate]]s, e.g.,&lt;ref name="Newport et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newport|first=Elissa L.|author2=Hauser, Marc D. |author3=Spaepen, Geertrui |author4= Aslin, Richard N. |title=Learning at a distance II. Statistical learning of non-adjacent dependencies in a non-human primate|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=49|issue=2|pages=85–117|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2003.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like [[laboratory rat|rats]].&lt;ref name="Toro &amp; Trobalon, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toro|first=Juan M.|author2=Trobalón, Josep B.|title=Statistical computations over a speech stream in a rodent|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=867–875|doi=10.3758/BF03193539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).

Further evidence for domain general statistical learning was suggested in a study run through the University of Cornell Department of Psychology concerning visual statistical learning in infancy.  Researchers in this study questioned whether domain generality of statistical learning in infancy would be seen using visual information. After first viewing images in statistically predictable patterns, infants were then exposed to the same familiar patterns in addition to novel sequences of the same identical stimulus components. Interest in the visuals was measured by the amount of time the child looked at the stimuli in which the researchers named “looking time.” All ages of infant participants showed more interest in the novel sequence relative to the familiar sequence. In demonstrating a preference for the novel sequences (which violated the transitional probability that defined the grouping of the original stimuli) the results of the study support the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy.&lt;ref name="KirkhamSlemmer2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkham|first1=Natasha Z|last2=Slemmer|first2=Jonathan A|last3=Johnson|first3=Scott P|title=Visual statistical learning in infancy: evidence for a domain general learning mechanism|journal=Cognition|volume=83|issue=2|year=2002|pages=B35–B42|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sven Lindqvist.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Sven Lindqvist in 2005]]
'''Sven Lindqvist''' (born April 28, 1932) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] author of mostly non-fiction, whose works include ''Exterminate All the Brutes'' and ''A History of Bombing''.&lt;ref name=bigert&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/11/bigert.php |author=Mats Bigert |date=Summer 2003 |title=Bombs Away: An Interview with Sven Lindqvist |journal=[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]] |issue=11 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monbiot&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1107861,00.html |title=A weapon with wings |author=George Monbiot |authorlink=George Monbiot |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 December 2003 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sven Lindqvist was born in [[Stockholm]] in 1932.&lt;ref name=home/&gt; He holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[History of literature]] from [[Stockholm University]] (his thesis, in 1966, was on [[Vilhelm Ekelund]]) and a 1979 [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]].&lt;ref name=home/&gt; In 1960–1961, he worked as cultural attaché at the Swedish [[embassy]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. From 1956–86 he was married to the sinologist [[Cecilia Lindquist|Cecilia Lindqvist]], with whom he had two children.&lt;ref name=home/&gt; In 1986 he married the economist [[Agneta Stark]].&lt;ref name=home/&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffries&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/sven-lindqvist-life-in-writing |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Sven Lindqvist: a life in writing |date=22 June 2012 |author=Stuart Jeffries |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in the [[Södermalm]] area of central [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=jeffries/&gt;

==Literary production==

Lindqvist has written more than thirty books of essays, aphorisms, autobiography, documentary prose, travel and reportage.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625202518/http://www.svenlindqvist.net/|archivedate=June 25, 2014|url=http://www.svenlindqvist.net |title=Sven Lindqvist official website |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffries/&gt; He occasionally publishes articles in the Swedish press, writing for the cultural supplement of the largest Swedish daily, [[Dagens Nyheter]], since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/litteratur/artikel_832665.svd |title=Sven Lindqvist har många böcker kvar |date=February 2, 2008 |author=Jenny Leonardz |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet|SvD]] |accessdate=June 21, 2012|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the recipient of several of Sweden's most prestigious literary and journalistic awards.

His work is mostly [[non-fiction]], including (and often transcending) several genres: essay, documentary prose, travel writing and reportage.&lt;ref name=jeffries/&gt; He is known for his works on developing nations in [[Africa]] and the [[Sahara]]n countries, [[China]], [[India]], [[Latin America]] and [[Australia]]. In the 1960s, partly inspired by the works of [[Hermann Hesse]], Lindqvist spent two years in China. He became fascinated by the legend of the [[Tang dynasty]] painter, [[Wu Daozi|Wu Tao Tzu]], who, when standing looking at a mural of a temple he had just completed, "suddenly clapped his hands and the temple gate opened. He went into his work and the gates closed behind him."&lt;ref&gt;Sven Lindqvist, ''The Myth of Wu Tao-Tzu.'' (London: Granta,  2012), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His later works, from the late 1980s, tend to focus on the subjects of [[Europe]]an [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], [[racism]], [[genocide]] and [[war]], analysing the place of these phenomena in [[West]]ern thought, social history and [[ideology]]. These topics are not uncontroversial. His 1992 book ''Exterminate all the Brutes'' argued that the [[Nazi]] quest for ''[[Lebensraum]]'' had at its core been an application of the [[expansionism|expansionist]] and [[racism|racist]] principles of imperialism and colonialism, but for the first time applied against fellow Europeans rather than against the distant and dehumanized peoples of the [[Third World]]. The book encouraged historians to research the effect of atrocities in colonial times on Nazi thought.&lt;ref name=jeffries/&gt;

The '''Thracian language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|r|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is an extinct [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], spoken in ancient times in [[South-east Europe]] by the [[Thracians]].  The Thracian language either belonged to the [[Centum and satem languages|satem]] group of Indo-European languages, or was a centum language that had been strongly influenced by satem languages.

A contemporary, neighboring language, [[Dacian language|Dacian]] is usually regarded as closely related to Thracian. However, there is insufficient evidence, regarding both languages, to enable the nature of this relationship to be decided.

The point at which Thracian became extinct is a matter of dispute. However, it is generally accepted that Thracian was still in use in the 6th century AD: [[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]] wrote in 570 that there was a monastery in the [[Sinai]], at which the monks spoke [[Koine Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Egyptian]] and [[Bessian]] – a Thracian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Bessian is the language of the Bessi, one of the most prominent Thracian tribes. The origin of the monasteries is explained in a mediaeval hagiography written by [[Symeon the Metaphrast]] in ''Vita Sancti Theodosii Coenobiarchae'' in which he wrote that [[Theodosius the Cenobiarch|Saint Theodosius]] founded on the shore of the [[Dead Sea]] a monastery with four churches, in each being spoken a different language, among which Bessian was found. The place at which the monasteries were founded was called "Cutila", which may be a Thracian name.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other theories about Thracian remain controversial.  
* Some linguists have suggested that the [[Albanian language]] and the ethnogenesis of the Albanians folowed a migration by members of the Bessi westward into Albania. 
* A classification put forward by some linguists, such as [[Harvey Mayer]], suggests that Thracian (and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) belonged to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] branch of Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1992_2/92_2_02.htm Harvey E. Mayer. DACIAN AND THRACIAN AS SOUTHERN BALTOIDIC LITUANUS. LITHUANIAN QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ARTS AND SCIENCES. Volume 38, No.2 – Summer 1992.] Editor of this issue: Antanas Klimas, University of Rochester . {{ISSN|0024-5089}}. 1992 LITUANUS Foundation, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However,  this theory has not achieved the status of a general consensus among linguists.
These are among many competing hypotheses regarding the classification and fate of Thracian.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Gottfried Schramm: ''A New Approach to Albanian History''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
The Thracian language was spoken in what is now [[Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&amp;pg=PA205 ''Encyclopedia of European peoples''], Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason, Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8160-4964-5}}, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R645AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 ''Archaeology and language: the puzzle of Indo-European origins''], Colin Renfrew, CUP Archive, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-38675-6}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Northern Greece]], [[East Thrace|European Turkey]] and in parts of [[Bithynia]] (North-Western Asiatic Turkey).

Eastern [[Serbia]] is usually considered by paleolinguists to have been a [[Dacian language|Daco-Moesian]] language area. [[Moesi]]an (after [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]] et al.) is grouped with Dacian.

== Remnants of the Thracian language ==
Little is known for certain about the Thracian language, since no phrase beyond a few words in length has been satisfactorily deciphered, and the sounder decipherments given for the shorter phrases may not be completely accurate. Some of the longer inscriptions may indeed be Thracian in origin but they may not reflect actual Thracian language sentences, but rather jumbles of names or magical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Olteanu et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enough Thracian lexical items have survived to show that Thracian was a member of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] and that it was a satemized language by the time it is attested.
Besides the aforementioned inscriptions, Thracian is attested through [[personal name]]s, [[toponymy|toponyms]], [[hydronym]]s, [[wikt:phytonym|phytonyms]], divine names, etc. and by a small number of words cited in Ancient Greek texts as being specifically Thracian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Groznijat/thrac/thrac_3.html |title=The Language of the Thracians |accessdate=2007-01-14 |last=Duridanov |first=Ivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient Greek lexical items were not specifically identified as Thracian by the ancient Greeks but are hypothesized by paleolinguists as being or probably being of Thracian origin. Other lexical items are hypothesized on the basis of local anthroponyms, toponyms, hydronyms, oronyms, etc. mentioned in primary sources (see also [[List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia]], [[List of Dacian plant names]]) .

Below is a table showing both words cited as being Thracian in classical sources, and lexical elements that have been extracted by paleolinguists from Thracian anthroponyms, toponyms, etc. In this table the closest [[cognate]]s are shown, with an emphasis on cognates in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and substratum and/or old-layer words in the [[Eastern Romance languages]]: [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], et cetera. See also the [[List of reconstructed Dacian words]].

Significant cognates from any Indo-European language are listed. However, not all lexical items in Thracian are assumed to be from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], some non-IE lexical items in Thracian are to be expected.

There are 23 words mentioned by ancient sources considered explicitly of Thracian origin and known meaning&lt;ref name=Duridanov1976&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Duridanov |first=I. |year=1976 |url=http://www.kroraina.com/thrac_lang |title=The Language of the Thracians (An abridged translation of Ezikyt na trakite, Ivan Duridanov, Nauka i izkustvo, Sofia, 1976.

An additional 180 Thracian words have been reconstructed.&lt;ref name=Duridanov1976 /&gt;

The proposed Thracian words in the [[Ancient Greek]] lexicon are not numerous. They include the ''parth-'' element in [[Parthenon]];{{citation needed|date=April 2014|reason=Proposed by whom? Not by e.g. H.Frisk, P.Chantraine or R.Beekes, none of whom by the way mentions Thracian, not even fleetingly, in their etymological dictionaries on Greek,  s.v. 'parthenos'; unless that is, 'Parthenon' has nothing to do with 'parthenos' (?!?) in which case this should be explained and sourced. Etymology of 'parthenos' and hence of 'Parthenon' is considered isoliert, énigmatique, uncertain-unknown. In any case please add sources.}} ''balios'' ("dappled"; &lt; PIE ''*bhel-'', "to shine", Bul. ''bel/bial'' (бял) "white" or ''bljaskav'' 'bright, shiny'; [[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny]] also cites Illyrian as a possible source, the non-Greek origin is argued on phonological grounds), ''bounos'', "hill, mound".&lt;ref&gt;Olteanu hypothesizes that the Thracian toponym ''Basibounon'' may contain ''bouno(n)'', a Greek word for "hill" that may also be a Thracian word&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thracian horseman]] hero was an important figure in Thracian religion, mythology, and culture. Depictions of the Thracian Horseman are found in numerous archaeological remains and artifacts from Thracian regions. From the Duvanli ring and from cognates in numerous Indo-European languages, ''mezēna'' is seen to be a Thracian word for "horse", deriving from PIE ''*mend-''. Another Thracian word for "horse" is hypothesized, but it looks certain, there is no disagreement among Thracologists: ''aspios'', ''esvas'', ''asb-'' (and some other variants; &lt; PIE ''*ekwo'' [https://archive.is/20130102133544/http://indoeuro.bizland.com/project/phonetics/word3.html], the Thracian showing a satem form similar to Sanskrit ''áśva-'', "horse", [[Avestan]] ''aspa'', "horse", Ossetic ''jäfs'', Prussian ''aswinan'' ‘mare milk’, Lithuanian ''ašvíenis'' ‘stallion’, ašvà, dial. ešvà ‘mare’&lt;ref&gt;In Old Church Slavonic is found ''ehu'', which may be a loan from Germanic {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}; otherwise the Slavic word for horse from ''ekwo-'' was lost, due perhaps to the lack of equestrianism among the early Slavs {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), from ''Outaspios'', ''Utaspios'', an inscription associated with the Thracian horseman. ''Ut-'' based on the PIE root word ''ud-'' (meaning "up") and based on several Thracic items, would have meant "upon", "up", and ''Utaspios'' is theorized to have meant "On horse(back)", parallel to ancient Greek ''ephippos (epi-hippos)''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiev, Olteanu et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Indo-European languages had more than one word for [[horse]]; for example Latin had ''equus'' from PIE ''*ekwo-'' and ''mannus'' ("a pony") from another IE root, later receiving ''cabalus'' as a loanword.

In many cases in current Thracology, there is more than one etymology for a Thracian lexical item. For example, Thracian ''Diana Germetitha'' (''Diana'' is from Latin while the [[epithet]] ''Germetitha'' is from Thracian) has two different proposed etymologies, "Diana of the warm bosom" (Olteanu; et al.?) or "Diana of the warm radiance" (Georgiev; et al.?). In other cases, etymologies for the Thracian lexical items may be sound, but some of the proposed cognates are not actually [[cognate]]s, thus confusing the affinity of Thracian.

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:ThracianLanguageMap.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Limits of the (southern) Thracian linguistic territory according to Ivan Duridanov,1985]]

=== Ezerovo inscription ===
Only four Thracian inscriptions of any length have been found. The first is a gold ring found in 1912 in the village of [[Ezerovo, Varna Province|Ezerovo]], [[Bulgaria]]; the ring was dated to the 5th century BC. On the ring an inscription is found written in a Greek script and consisting of 8 lines, the eighth of which is located on the edge, the rim, of the rotating disk; it reads:
:ΡΟΛΙΣΤΕΝΕΑΣΝ / ΕΡΕΝΕΑΤΙΛ / ΤΕΑΝΗΣΚΟΑ / ΡΑΖΕΑΔΟΜ / ΕΑΝΤΙΛΕΖΥ / ΠΤΑΜΙΗΕ / ΡΑΖ // ΗΛΤΑ

Dimitar Dechev (Germanised as ''D. Detschew'') separates the words thus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ivan|last=Duridanov | title=Die Sprache der Thraker |  series=Bulgarische Sammlung | volume= 5 | publisher=Hieronymus Verlag | year=1985 | isbn=3-88893-031-6 | language= german|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ra3iAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Rolisteneas|quote=Ich bin Rolisteneas, Sprößling des Nereneas; Tilezypta, Arazerin nach ihrer Heimat, hat mich der Erde übergeben (d.h. begraben).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Sprache der Thrako-Daker|first=Ion I.|last=Russu|publisher=Ed.

proposing the following translation
:''I am Rolisteneas, a descendant of Nereneas; Tilezypta, an Arazian woman, delivered me to the ground''.

=== Kyolmen inscription ===

A second inscription, hitherto undeciphered, was found in 1965 near the village of [[Kyolmen]], [[Varbitsa Municipality]], dating to the sixth century BC. Written in a Greek alphabet variant, it is possibly a tomb stele inscription similar to the Phrygian ones; Peter A. Dimitrov's transcription thereof is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thracian Language and Greek and Thracian Epigraphy|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4438-1325-9|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gkaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|first=Peter A.|last=Dimitrov|chapter=The Kyolmen Stone Inscription|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i.e.
:ilasnletednlednenidakatroso
:eba·rozesasnēnetesaigekoa
:nblabaēgn

=== Duvanli inscription ===
A third inscription is again on a ring, found in [[Duvanli]], [[Kaloyanovo Municipality]],  next to the left hand of a skeleton. It dates to the 5th century BC. The ring has the image of a [[Equestrianism|horseman]] with the inscription surrounding the image. It is only partly legible (16 out of the initial 21)
:ΗΥΖΙΗ.....ΔΕΛΕ / ΜΕΖΗΝΑΙ
i.e.
:ēuziē.....dele / mezēnai

The meaning of the inscription is 'Horseman Eusie protect!'

These are the longest inscriptions preserved. The remaining ones are mostly single words or names on vessels and other artifacts.

== A Thracian or Thraco-Dacian branch of Indo-European ==
{{Main|Classification of Thracian}}

The Thracian language in linguistic textbooks is usually treated either as its own branch of Indo-European, or is grouped with Dacian, together forming a Daco-Thracian branch of IE. Older textbooks often grouped it also with [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] or [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]]. The belief that Thracian was close to Phrygian is no longer popular and has mostly been discarded.&lt;ref&gt;See C. Brixhe – Ancient languages of Asia Minor, Cambridge University Press, 2008 &lt;br /&gt;''We will dismiss, at least temporarily, the idea of a Thraco-Phrygian unity. Thraco-Dacian (or Thracian and Daco-Mysian) seems to belong to the eastern (satem) group of Indo-European languages and its (their) phonetic system is far less conservative than that of Phrygian (see Brixhe and Panayotou 1994, §§&amp;nbsp;3ff.)''&lt;/ref&gt; The Thraco-Illyrian grouping has also been called into question.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Daco-Thracian or Thraco-Dacian is the main hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

No definite evidence has yet been found that demonstrates that Thracian or Daco-Thracian belonged on the same branch as Albanian or Baltic or Balto-Slavic or Greco-Macedonian or Phrygian or any other IE branch. For this reason textbooks still treat Thracian as its own branch of Indo-European, or as a Daco-Thracian/Thraco-Dacian branch.

The generally accepted clades branched from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] are, in alphabetical order, the [[Proto-Albanian language]], [[Proto-Anatolian language]], [[Proto-Armenian language]], [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language]], [[Proto-Celtic language]], [[Proto-Germanic language]], [[Proto-Greek language]], [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]], [[Proto-Italic language]], and the [[Proto-Tocharian language]]. Thracian, Dacian, Phrygian, Illyrian, Venetic, and Paeonian are fragmentarily attested and cannot be reliably categorized.

Thraco-Dacian has been hypothesized as forming a branch of Indo-European along with [[Baltic languages|Baltic]].&lt;ref&gt;Holst (2009):66.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a big number of the 300 Thracian geographic names there are cognates within the Baltic toponymy, most similarities between Thracian and Balto-Slavic personal and geographic names were found, especially Baltic. According to Duridinov the "most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian" "the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression". According to him there are occasional similarities between Slavic and Thracian because Slavic is related to Baltic, while almost no lexical similarities within Thracian and Phrygian were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.nbu.bg/803/1/ID_-_Thracian_Language_-_BG.pdf](Duridanov 1978: с. 128)&lt;/ref&gt; This significant relatedness show close affinity and kinship of Thracian with Baltic.

== Fate of the Thracians and their language ==
According to Skordelis, when Thracians were subjected by [[Alexander the Great]] they finally assimilated to Greek culture and became as Greek as Spartans and Athenians, although he considered the Thracian language as a form of Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daskalov|first1=Roumen|last2=Vezenkov|first2=Alexander|title=Entangled Histories of the Balkans – Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004290365|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crampton (1997) most Thracians were eventually Hellenized or Romanized, with the last remnants surviving in remote areas until the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.J. Crampton|title=A Concise History of Bulgaria|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|pages=4|isbn=0-521-56719-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marinov the Thracians were likely completely Romanized and Hellenized after the last contemporary references to them of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daskalov|first1=Roumen|last2=Vezenkov|first2=Alexander|title=Entangled Histories of the Balkans – Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004290365|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory holds as the main factor of immediate assimilation the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]].

A quick extinction would intensely contrast the avoidance of Hellenization at least by [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] till the present, possibly with the help of isolated mountainous areas.

Another author considers that the interior of Thrace have never been Romanized or Hellenized (Trever, 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Trever, Albert Augustus. '' History of Ancient Civilization''. Harcourt, Brace. p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed also by Slavonization. According to Weithmann (1978) when the Slavs migrated, they encountered only a very superficially Romanized Thracian and Dacian population, which had not strongly identified itself with Imperial Rome, while Greek and Roman populations (mostly soldiers, officials, merchants) abandoned the land or were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Weithmann, Die slawische Bevolkerung auf der griechischen Halbinsel (Munich 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Because Pulpudeva survived as [[Plovdiv]] in Slavic languages, not under Philippopolis, some authors suggest that Thracian was not completely obliterated in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J. P.|last2=Adams|first2=Douglas Q.|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-98-5|page=576|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;pg=PA576|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest known use described by [[Symeon the Metaphrast]] in a biography of Saint [[Theodosius the Cenobiarch]] (423-529), where he claimed that Thracian language was spoken in a monastery, build on [[Mount Sinai]] just then, when Theodosius was there:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Theodosius|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/THEOCENO.HTM|website=www.ewtn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"''There were four churches belonging to it, one for each of the three several nations of which his community was chiefly composed, each speaking a different language; the fourth was for the use of such as were in a state of penance, which those that recovered from their lunatic or possessed condition before-mentioned, were put into, and detained till they had expiated their fault. The nations into which his community was divided were the Greeks, which was by far the most numerous, and consisted of all those that came from any provinces of the empire; the Armenians, with whom were joined the Arabians and Persians; and, thirdly, the [[Bessi]], who comprehended all the northern nations below Thrace, or all who used the Runic or Sclavonian tongue. Each nation sung the first part of the mass to the end of the gospel in their own church, but after the gospel all met in the church of the Greeks, where they celebrated the essential part of the sacrifice in Greek, and communicated all together...''"

'''Timote''', also known as '''Cuica''' or '''Timote–Cuica''', is the language of the [[Timote-Cuica people|Timote–Cuica state]] in the Venezuelan Andes, around the present city of [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] and south of [[Lake Maracaibo]].

The language is reported to have gone extinct in the early to mid 20th century. However, in 1977 it was reported that the indigenous village of Mutús, in the heart of the old Timote state, still spoke an indigenous language, which would presumably be Timote. The name is apparently Timote, as 'Timote' itself derives from ''ti-motɨ'' 'Mutú speakers', and ''mutú'' or ''mukú'' is a common toponym in the region. This lead had not been followed up as of Adelaar (2004).

==Dialects==
The Timote and Cuica peoples apparently spoke dialects of a single language; some of the last reports of Cuica claim it was nothing other than Timote. Data is limited, but the connection is clear in the numerals:

Consonant clusters, somewhat unusual for the area, are found, especially in Cuica: ''kču'' 'bird', ''stots'' 'blood', Timote ''klef'' 'rainy season', ''hutn'' 'dog'.

'''Wendell Johnson''' (April 16, 1906 – August 29, 1965) was an American [[psychologist]], actor and author and was a proponent of [[general semantics]] (or GS).  He was born in [[Roxbury, Kansas]] and died in [[Iowa City, Iowa]]. The Wendell Johnson Speech and Hearing Center, which houses the University of Iowa's speech pathology and audiology programs, is named after him. He is known for the experiment nicknamed the "[[Monster Study]]" for the damage it did to its human subjects, although this study has defenders.&lt;ref&gt;"Retroactive Ethical Judgments and Human Subjects Research: the 1939 Tudor Study in Context," in Robert Goldfarb, ed., ''Ethics: A Case Study in Fluency'' (San Diego and Oxford: Plural Publishing, 2005), ch. 9, p. 139. [http://www.nicholasjohnson.org/wjohnson/hsr/njhsr512.pdf Link label]&lt;/ref&gt; 

His son is former American [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) commissioner [[Nicholas Johnson]].

==Stuttering contributions==
Considered one of the earliest and most influential speech pathologists in the field, he spent most of his life trying to find the cause and cure for [[stuttering]] – through teaching, research, scholarly and other writing, lecturing, supervision of graduate students, and persuading K-12 schools, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] and other institutions of the need for speech pathologists. He played a major role in the creation of the American Speech and Hearing Association. In 1930 Johnson published the book ''Because I Stutter'', based on his master's thesis, which describes his struggles with stuttering from an autobiographical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Because I Stutter,'' (New York and London: D.Appleton and Company, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Remembering Wendell Johnson,
Williams, Dean. ''Et Cetera'': (Concord, California, 49.4 (Winter 1992) p.433-5&lt;/ref&gt;

:The stutterer, if I may speak for him as a type, does not want pity any more than he wants contempt, but he does want the understanding which the normal respect of one human being for another makes possible. He is a human being, trying to make a stutterer's adaptation to a world of glib speakers.&lt;ref&gt;''Because I Stutter,'' (New York and London: D.Appleton and Company, 1930), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's book ''People in Quandaries: The Semantics of Personal Adjustment'' (1946; still in print from the [[Institute of General Semantics]]) is an excellent introduction to general semantics applied to psychotherapy. In 1956 his ''Your Most Enchanted Listener'' was published; in 1972, his ''Living With Change: The Semantics of Coping,'' a collection of selected portions of transcriptions of hundreds of his talks, organized by Dorothy Moeller, provided further general semantic insights. He also published many articles in his lifetime, in journals, including ''ETC: A Review of General Semantics''. [1] Neil Postman acknowledges the influence of ''People in Quandaries'' in his own excellent general semantics book ''Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk'' (1976, Delacorte, New York):

:I am tempted to say that there are two kinds of people in the world – those who will learn something from this book (''People in Quandaries'') and those who will not. The best blessing I can give you is to wish that as you go through life you will be surrounded by the former and neglected by the latter. 

[[Patricia Zebrowski]], University of Iowa assistant professor of speech pathology and audiology, notes, "The body of data that resulted from Johnson's work on children who stutter and their parents is still the largest collection of scientific information on the subject of stuttering onset. Although new work has determined that children who stutter are doing something different in their speech production than non-stutterers, Johnson was the first to talk about the importance of a stutterer's thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. We still don't know what causes stuttering, but the 'Iowa' way of approaching study and treatment is still heavily influenced by Johnson, but with an added emphasis on speech production." 

One of the most thorough single Web site collections of material regarding Wendell Johnson is https://web.archive.org/web/20071013204006/http://www.uiowa.edu/~cyberlaw/oldinav/wjhome.html. It contains links to his Who's Who in America entry and c.v., bibliographies, excerpts from his writing, audio of his general semantics lectures, articles by others about Johnson, and an excerpt from Robert Goldfarb, editor, ''Ethics: A Case Study from Fluency'' (2005).

Attacks on the 1930s master's thesis, and the journalistic labeling as a "[[Monster Study]]", contributed to controversy. On the one hand, speech research scientists Nicoline Grinager Ambrose and Ehud Yairi are critical of the ''conclusions'' that Mary Tudor drew from her data, but believe that no harm was done to the subjects and that there was no intention to do harm. Others felt the study was unethical by today's standards but fell within the bounds of those standards in 1939.

On the other hand, Richard Schwartz concludes in Chapter 6 of the book that the study "was unfortunate in Tudor and Johnson's lack of regard for the potential harm to the children who participated and in their selection of institutionalized children simply because they were easily available. The deception and the apparent lack of debriefing were also not justifiable." Other authors concur claiming the orphan experiment was not within the ethical boundaries of acceptable research. The University of Iowa paid a settlement to some of the surviving subjects of over $900,000 in 2007.
