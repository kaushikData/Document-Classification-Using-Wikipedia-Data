]]'''Abortion law''' permits, prohibits, restricts, or otherwise regulates the availability of [[abortion]]. Abortion has been a [[Abortion debate|controversial subject]] in many societies through history on religious, moral, ethical, practical, and political grounds. It has been banned frequently and otherwise limited by law. However, abortions continue to be common in many areas, even where they are illegal. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), abortion rates are similar in countries where the procedure is legal and in countries where it is not,&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalabortionconsortium.org/news/abortion-rates-similar-in-countries-that-legalize-prohibit-procedure-study-says-102.html|title=Abortion Rates Similar In Countries That Legalize, Prohibit Procedure, Study Says - News - I.C.M.A.|publisher=|access-date=2014-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323224239/http://www.medicalabortionconsortium.org/news/abortion-rates-similar-in-countries-that-legalize-prohibit-procedure-study-says-102.html|archive-date=2014-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to unavailability of modern [[contraceptives]] in areas where abortion is illegal.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;Singh, Susheela et al.

If the 215 million women with unmet need used modern family planning methods....[that] would result in about 22 million fewer unplanned births; 25 million fewer abortions; and seven million fewer miscarriages....If women’s contraceptive needs were addressed (and assuming no changes in abortion laws)...the number of unsafe abortions would decline by 73% from 20 million to 5.5 million."

==History==
{{Main article|History of abortion}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}

Abortion has existed since ancient times, with natural [[abortifacient]]s being found amongst a wide variety of tribal people and in most written sources. Early texts contain no mention of abortion or abortion law. When it does appear, it is entailed in concerns about male [[property rights]], preservation of social order, and the duty to produce fit citizens for the state or community. The harshest penalties were generally reserved for a woman who procured an abortion against her husband's wishes, and for slaves who produced abortion in a woman of high status. Religious texts often contained severe condemnations of abortion, recommending penance but seldom enforcing secular punishment. As a matter of [[common law]] in [[England]] and the United States, abortion was illegal anytime after [[quickening]]—when the movements of the [[fetus]] could first be felt by the woman. Under the [[born alive rule]], the fetus was not considered a "reasonable being" ''in Rerum Natura''; and abortion was not treated as [[murder in English law]].

In the 20th century, many Western countries began to codify abortion law or place further restrictions on the practice. Anti-abortion groups were led by a combination of groups opposed to abortion on moral grounds, and by medical professionals who were concerned about the danger presented by the procedure and the regular involvement of non-medical personnel in performing abortions. Nevertheless, it became clear that illegal abortions continued to take place in large numbers even where abortions were rigorously restricted. It was difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the women and abortion doctors, and judges and juries were often reluctant to convict. For example, [[Henry Morgentaler]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[pro-choice]] advocate, was never convicted by a jury. He was acquitted by a jury in the 1973 court case, but the acquittal was overturned by five judges on the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in 1974. He went to prison, appealed, and was again acquitted. In total, he served 10 months, suffering a [[heart attack]] while in [[solitary confinement]]. Many were also outraged at the invasion of privacy and the medical problems resulting from abortions taking place illegally in medically dangerous circumstances. Political movements soon coalesced around the legalization of abortion and liberalization of existing laws.

By the mid 20th century, many countries had begun to liberalize abortion laws, at least when performed to protect the life of the woman, and in some cases on woman's request. Under [[Vladimir Lenin]], the [[Soviet Union]] legalized abortions on request in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.socialistalternative.org/2016/01/16/womens-lgbt-liberation-revolutionary-russia/|title=Women's &amp; LGBT Liberation In Revolutionary Russia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/87/communist-womens-movement|title=The Communist Women’s Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=isreview.org|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeQqnwKORFgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:FWKejyajoL8C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisi86BoZPSAhUDx2MKHXYVCa8QuwUIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=abortion%20russia&amp;f=false|title=Women and Socialism: Essays on Women's Liberation|last=Smith|first=Sharon|date=September 15, 2015|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=|isbn=9781608461806|location=|pages=12, 199|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1935|title=Abstract - Abortion in Russia|url=https://journals.co.za/content/m_samj/9/17/AJA20785135_11715?crawler=true|journal=South African Medical Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialistworker.org/2011/07/14/womens-liberation-and-socialism|title=Women's liberation and socialism|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bolsheviks]] saw abortion as a social evil created by the capitalist system, which left women without the economic means to raise children, forcing them to perform abortions. The Soviet state initially preserved the tsarists ban on abortion, which treated the practice as premeditated murder. However, abortion had been practiced by Russian women for decades and its incidence skyrocketed further as a result of the [[Russian Civil War]], which had left the country economically devastated and made it extremely difficult for many people to have children. The Soviet state recognized that banning abortion would not stop the practice because women would continue using the services of private abortionists. In rural areas, these were often old women who had no medical training, which made their services very dangerous to the women's health. In November 1920 the Soviet regime legalized abortion in state hospitals. The state considered abortion as a temporary necessary evil, which would disappear in the future communist society, which would be able to provide for all the children conceived.&lt;ref name="Wendy Z. Goldman 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Overy|title=Women, the State and Revolution: Soviet Family Policy and Social Life, 1917-1936|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zD9p0pSBBv4C&amp;PG=pa254|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 [[Joseph Stalin]] placed prohibitions on abortions, which restricted them to medically recommended cases only, in order to increase population growth after the enormous loss of life in [[World War 1]] and the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC&amp;pg=PT425|year=2004|publisher= W.

Population (English Edition) 7, (1995), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930's, several countries ([[Poland]], [[Turkey]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Mexico]]) legalized abortion in some special cases ([[pregnancy from rape]], threat to mother's health, fetal malformation). In 1948 abortion was legalized in Japan, 1952 in [[Yugoslavia]] (on a limited basis), and 1955 in the Soviet Union (on demand). Some Soviet allies (Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania) legalized abortion in the late 1950's under pressure from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M.|first=Akrivopoulou, Christina|title=Protecting the Genetic Self from Biometric Threats: Autonomy, Identity, and Genetic Privacy: Autonomy, Identity, and Genetic Privacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veafBwAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8154-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=veafBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=%22some%20soviet%20allies%22 160]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion has remained legal on demand in Russia up to the present day, although that may soon change. Citing demographic, economic, and moral concerns, the pro-life parties of Russia, with some measured sympathy from president [[Vladimir Putin]], have been pressuring the government to ban abortion outright, or at least restrict its availability. In particular, the Russian Duma has been debating a bill since 2015 to remove financial coverage for abortion from the national healthcare system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/03/putins-next-target-is-russias-abortion-culture/|title=Putin’s Next Target Is Russia's Abortion Culture|first=Amie|last=Ferris-Rotman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United Kingdom, the [[Abortion Act 1967|Abortion Act of 1967]] clarified and prescribed abortions as legal up to 24 weeks. Other countries soon followed, including Canada (1969), the United States (1973 in most states, pursuant to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the federal [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision which legalized abortion nationwide), [[Tunisia]] (1973), Austria (1974), France (1975), Sweden (1975), New Zealand (1977), Italy (1978), the [[Netherlands]] (1980), and Belgium (1990). However, these countries vary greatly in the circumstances under which abortion was to be permitted. In 1975 the West German Supreme Court [[German Federal Constitutional Court abortion decision|struck down]] a law legalizing abortion, holding that they contradict the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|constitution]]'s [[human rights]] guarantees. In 1976 a law was adopted which enabled abortions up to 12 weeks. After Germany's [[German reunification|reunification]], despite the legal status of abortion in the former East Germany, a compromise was reached which deemed most abortions up to 12 weeks legal. In jurisdictions governed under [[sharia law]], abortion after 120th day from conception (19 weeks from [[Gestational age|LMP]]) is illegal, especially for those who follow the recommendations of the [[Hanafi]] legal school, while most jurists of the [[Maliki]] legal school "believe that ensoulment occurs at the moment of conception, and they tend to forbid abortion at any point [similar to the Roman Catholic Church]. The other schools hold intermediate positions. [..] The penalty prescribed for an illegal abortion varies according to particular circumstances involved. According to &lt;!--SHARIA in the source--&gt;sharia, it should be limited to a fine that is paid to the father or heirs of the fetus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Islam.html?id=OZbyz_Hr–eIC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=120+days 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Islam and abortion]].

==International law==
There are no international or multinational treaties that deal directly with abortion, but [[International human rights law|human rights law]] touches on the issues.

The [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which in 2013 had 23 Latin American parties, declares human life as commencing with conception. In [[Latin America]], abortion is only legal in [[Cuba]] (1965) and [[Uruguay]] (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/ameriques/article/2012/10/17/en-uruguay-le-parlement-vote-la-depenalisation-de-l-avortement_1776959_3222.html|title=En Uruguay, le Parlement vote la dépénalisation de l'avortement|date=17 October 2012|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also legal in [[Mexico City]] (the law on [[abortion in Mexico]] varies by [[States of Mexico|state]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf World Abortion Policies 2013] (Note 26) (archived from [https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf the original] on 2016-04-15)&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 2010 case of ''[[A, B and C v Ireland]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] did not include a right to an abortion.

In 2005 the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] ordered Peru to compensate a woman (known as K.L.) for denying her a medically indicated abortion; this was the first time a United Nations Committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe, legal abortion, and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-a-grimes/united-nations-committee-affirms-abortion-as-a-human-right_b_9020806.html|title=United Nations Committee Affirms Abortion as a Human Right|date=25 January 2016|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.L. received the compensation in 2016.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; In the 2016 case of ''[[Mellet v Ireland]]'', the UN HRC found [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion laws]] violated [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] because Irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities.

==National laws==
[[File:Vigilia por la votación de la Ley de Interrupción Voluntaria del Embarazo en Paraná 24.jpg|thumb|Supporter of legalized abortion at a rally in [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná, Argentina]]]]
While abortions are legal under certain conditions in most countries, these conditions vary widely. According to the [[United Nations]] publication ''World Abortion Policies 2013'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
abortion is allowed in most countries (97 percent) in order to save a woman's life. Other commonly-accepted reasons are preserving physical (68 percent) or mental health (65 percent). In about half of countries abortion is accepted in the case of rape or incest (51 percent), and in case of foetal impairment (50 percent). Performing an abortion because of economic or social reasons is accepted in 35 percent of countries. Performing abortion only on the basis of a woman's request is allowed in 30 percent of countries, including in the US, Canada, most [[Europe]]an countries, and China, with 42 percent of the world's population living in such countries.

In some countries, additional procedures must be followed before the abortion can be carried out even if the basic grounds for it are met. For example, in Finland, where abortions are not granted based merely on a woman's request, approval for each abortion must be obtained from two doctors (or one in special circumstances).&lt;ref name=UKAbortion1967&gt;{{cite web|title=Abortion Act 1967|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/section/1|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FinLaw1970&gt;{{cite web|title=Laki raskauden keskeyttämisestä 24.3.1970/239|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1970/19700239|publisher=Finlex|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority, 90% of abortions in Finland are performed for socio-economical reasons.&lt;ref name="tiitinen"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tiitinen |first1=Aila |title=Raskauden keskeytys |url=http://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/terveyskirjasto/tk.koti?p_artikkeli=dlk00166 |website=Terveyskirjasto |publisher=Duodecim |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; How strictly all of the procedures dictated in the legislature are followed in practice is another matter. For example, in the United Kingdom [[Care Quality Commission]]'s report in 2012 found that several [[National Health Service|NHS]] clinics were circumventing the law, using forms pre-signed by one doctor, thus allowing abortions to patients who only met with one doctor.&lt;ref name=CQC2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings of termination of pregnancy inspections published|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/media/findings-termination-pregnancy-inspections-published|publisher=Care Quality Commission|accessdate=17 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717213356/http://www.cqc.org.uk/media/findings-termination-pregnancy-inspections-published|archive-date=2012-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of national laws {{as of|2013|lc=on}} for each of the 193 member states of the [[United Nations]] and two non-member States ([[Vatican City]] and [[Niue]]) is listed in the UN ''World Abortion Policies 2013''&lt;ref name="UN2013info" /&gt; report, and summarized in the following table. The publication includes information on national estimates of abortion rate, fertility rate, maternal mortality ratio, levels of contraceptive use, unmet need for family planning, and government support for family planning, as well as regional estimates of unsafe abortion.

Despite a wide variation in the restrictions under which it is permitted, abortion is legal in most European countries. The exceptions are [[Malta]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] (although the Republic of Ireland is currently in the process of reform), [[Northern Ireland]], and the micro-states of [[Vatican City]], [[San Marino]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Andorra]], where abortion is illegal or severely restricted.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ostergren|first1=Robert C. |last2=Le Bossé|first2=Mathias |title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35980195 | work=BBC News | title=Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different to the rest of the UK? | date=2016-04-08| first=Jon | last=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other states with existent, but less severe restrictions are [[Poland]] and [[Abortion in Monaco|Monaco]]. All the remaining states make abortion legal on request or for social and economic reasons during the first trimester. When it comes to later-term abortions, there are very few with laws as liberal as those of the United States.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=God's continent: Christianity, Islam, and Europe's religious crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FLMm69jJDkC&amp;pg=PT91|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=11 May 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531395-6|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Restrictions on abortion are most stringent in a few countries that are strongly observant of the [[Catholic faith|Catholic]] faith.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /&gt;

====European Union====
Most countries in the European Union allow abortion on demand during the [[Pregnancy|first trimester]], with Sweden, the UK and the Netherlands having more extended time limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-07-14/news/malta-now-only-eu-country-without-life-saving-abortion-law-2068054030/|title=Malta now only EU country without life-saving abortion law - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first trimester, abortion is generally allowed only under certain circumstances, such as risk to woman's life or health, fetal defects or other specific situations that may be related to the circumstances of the conception or the woman's age. For instance, in Austria, second trimester abortions are allowed only if there is a serious risk to physical health of woman (that cannot be averted by other means); risk to mental health of woman (that cannot be averted by other means); immediate risk to life of woman (that cannot be averted by other means); serious fetal impairment (physical or mental); or if the woman is under 14 years of age. Some countries, such as Denmark, allow abortion after the first trimester for a variety of reasons, including socioeconomic ones, but a woman needs an authorization to have such an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm |title=1973 Danish abortion law ''Lovitidende for Kongeriget Danmark'' |publisher=Harvard Law |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Finland, technically abortions even just up to 12 weeks require authorization from two doctors (unless special circumstances), but in practice the authorization is only a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] and it is granted if the mother simply does not wish to have a baby.&lt;ref name="ramo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rämö |first1=Aurora |title=Suomessa abortin saa helposti, vaikka laki on yksi Euroopan tiukimmista |url=https://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/suomessa-abortin-saa-helposti-vaikka-laki-on-yksi-euroopan-tiukimmista/ |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Suomen Kuvalehti |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to an abortion in much of Europe depends not as much on the letter of the law, but on the prevailing social views which lead to the interpretation of the laws. In much of Europe, laws which allow a second trimester abortion due to mental health concerns (when it is deemed that the woman's psychological health would suffer from the continuation of the pregnancy) have come to be interpreted very liberally, while in some areas it is difficult to have a legal abortion even in the early stages of pregnancy due to conscientious objection by doctors refusing to perform abortions against their personal moral or religious convictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Abortion legislation in Europe |date=January 2007 |publisher=[[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta is the only EU country that bans abortion in all cases, and does not have an exception for situations where the woman's life is in danger. The law however is not strictly enforced in relation to instances where a pregnancy endangers the woman's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-07-14/news/malta-now-only-eu-country-without-life-saving-abortion-law-2068054030/ | title=Malta now only EU country without life-saving abortion law | publisher=Malta Independent | accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Abortion in Malta]]).

[[Abortion in Italy]] was legalized in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/degrazia/courseworks/legge_194.pdf|title=Law 194|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Italian legislation|website=Columbia|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law allows [[health professional]]s to refuse to perform abortion. This [[Abortion in Italy#Conscientious objection|conscientious objection]] has the practical effect of restricting access to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tamma |first1=Paola |title=Even where abortion is legal, access is not granted|url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Even-where-abortion-is-legal-access-is-not-granted |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=VoxEurop/EDJNet |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland abortion is illegal with the exception of cases where a woman's life is endangered by the continuation of her pregnancy (see [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland]]). However, in a [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|2018 referendum]] a large majority of Irish citizens voted to repeal the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendment]] prohibiting legislation relating to the termination of non-life threatening pregnancies replacing it with the following: {{quote frame|Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/29/?tab=bill-text|title=Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|date=2018-03-07|access-date=2018-05-27|others=Houses of the Oireachtas|language=en-ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}As a result, [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]] has stated that legislation will be introduced in [[Dáil Éireann]] before the summer recess allowing [[Abortion|termination of pregnancy]] on demand up to twelve weeks and will be signed into law by the [[President of Ireland|President]] by the autumn of 2018 if passed by the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] and [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-votes-by-landslide-to-legalise-abortion|title=Ireland votes by landslide to legalise abortion|last=McDonald|first=Henry|last2=Graham-Harrison|first2=Emma|date=2018-05-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26|last3=O'Carroll|first3=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/abortion-referendum/abortion-law-reform-to-be-much-sooner-than-expected-1.3511855|title=Abortion law reform to be much sooner than expected.

Andorra allows for abortions only when there is a threat to the woman's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclj.org/pdf/ECLJ_MEMO_COUNCIL_OF_EUROPE_CONSCIENTIOUS_OBJECTION_McCafferty_EN_Puppinck.pdf |format=PDF |title=Memorandum on the PACE Report - Women's Access to Lawful Medical Care: The Problem of Unregulated Use of Conscientious Objection |publisher=European Centre for Law and Justice |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's formerly Communist countries have liberal abortion laws. An exception is Poland, a country with a strict abortion law. Abortion is allowed only in cases of risk to the life or health of the woman, when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act (the criminal act has to be confirmed by a prosecutor), or when the fetus is seriously malformed. A doctor who performs an abortion which is deemed to not have a legal basis is subject to criminal prosecution, and, out of fear of prosecution, doctors avoid abortions, except in the most extreme circumstances.

Most European countries have laws which stipulate that minor girls need their parents' consent or that the parents must be informed of the abortion. In most of these countries however, this rule can be circumvented if a committee agrees that the girl may be posed at risk if her parents find out about the pregnancy, or that otherwise it is in her best interests to not notify her parents.  The interpretation in practice of these laws depends from region to region, as with the other abortion laws.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Some countries differentiate between younger pregnant minors and older ones, with the latter not subjected to parental restrictions (for example under or above 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/6049/serbia--abortion-law|title=Serbia: abortion law|first=Marc|last=Worrell|website=Women on Waves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In countries where abortion is illegal or restricted, it is common for women to travel to neighboring countries with more liberal laws. It was estimated in 2007 that over 6,000 Irish women travel to Britain to have abortions every year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Abortion in the United States}}
In 1973, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' legalized abortion nationwide. It established a minimal period during which abortion must be legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). This basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), is still in effect today. In accordance with ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', states cannot place legal restrictions posing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this legal framework established by the Supreme Court is very liberal (particularly with regard to the gestational age), in practice the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a [[paradox]] in the US, where the abortion law of the United States is one of the most liberal in the world, but ''[[de facto]]'' access to abortion services is quite poor in many parts of the country.

===Countries with very restrictive laws===
According to a report by [[Women on Waves]], approximately 25% of the world's population lives in countries with "highly restrictive abortion laws" - that is, laws which either completely ban abortion, or allow it only to save the [[maternal death|mother's life]]. This category of countries includes most countries in [[Latin America]], most countries of [[MENA]], approximately half of the countries of [[Africa]], seven countries in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, as well as two countries (Malta and Ireland) in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/460/abortion-laws-worldwide|title=Abortion Laws Worldwide|first=Marc|last=Worrell|website=Women on Waves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin America is considered the world region with the most restrictive abortion laws. Fewer than 3% of the women in this region live in countries with liberal abortion laws — that is, where abortion is permitted either without restriction as to reason or on socioeconomic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-latin-america-and-caribbean|title=Abortion in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=10 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the countries of [[Central America]], notably [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]], have also come to international attention due to very forceful enforcement of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of pregnancy controversy===
{{Main|Beginning of pregnancy controversy}}
Controversy over the beginning of pregnancy occurs in different contexts, particularly in a legal context, and is particularly discussed within the [[abortion debate]] from the point of measuring the gestational age of the pregnancy. Pregnancy can be measured from a number of convenient points, including the day of last [[Menstrual cycle|menstruation]], [[ovulation]], [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and chemical detection. A common medical way to calculate [[gestational age]] is to measure pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual cycle.{{refn|Some examples of [[gestational age]] calculated from the first day of the last menstrual cycle:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2013/10/17/whats-in-a-week-pregnancy-dating-standards-and-what-they-mean/|title=How Doctors Date Pregnancies, Explained - Rewire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Abortion/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Abortion - NHS Choices|first=NHS|last=Choices|website=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/269509|title=Pregnancy—first day of the last menstrual period|website=meteor.aihw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reference.medscape.com/calculator/estimated-delivery-date-pregnancy|title=Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) Pregnancy Calculator|website=reference.medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gestational+age|title=gestational age|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, not all legal systems use this measure for the purpose of abortion law; for example countries such as [[Abortion in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Abortion in France|France]], [[Abortion in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] use the term "pregnancy" in the abortion law to refer to the time elapsed from the sexual act that led to conception, which is presumed to be 2 weeks after the end of the last menstrual period.{{refn|For example Luxembourg abortion law states: "Avant la fin de la 12e semaine de grossesse ou avant la fin de la 14e semaine  d’aménorrhée[...]" which translates to "Before the end of the 12th week of pregnancy or before the end of the 14th week of [[amenorrhea]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2014/12/17/n2/jo|title=Loi du 17 décembre 2014 portant modification 1) du Code pénal et 2) de la loi du 15 novembre 1978 relative à l'information sexuelle, à la prévention de l'avortement clandestin et à la réglementation de l'interruption volontaire de grossesse. - Legilux|website=legilux.public.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Exceptions in abortion law==
Exceptions in abortion laws occur either in countries where abortion is, as a general rule illegal, or in countries which have abortion on request with gestational limits (for example if a country allows abortion on request until 12 weeks, it may create exceptions to this general gestation limit for later abortions in specific circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/about-the-abortion-act/id419252/|title=About the Abortion Act|first=Sosial- og|last=helsedepartementet|date=18 May 2000|website=Government.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few common exceptions sometimes found in abortion laws. Legal domains which do not have abortion on demand will often allow it when the health of the mother is at stake. "Health of the mother" may mean something different in different areas: for example, the [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] allows abortion only to save the life of the mother, whereas [[pro-life]] advocates in the United States argue health exceptions are used so broadly as to render a ban essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2008/10/15/health-of-the-mother.html |title='Health' of the Mother |date=October 15, 2008 |work=[[Newsweek]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest often go together. For example, before ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', thirteen [[U.S. state|US states]] allowed abortion in the case of either rape or incest, but only [[Mississippi]] permitted abortion of pregnancies due to rape, and no state permitted it for just [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/states-probe-limits-of-abortion-policy2-85899387496 &lt;!-- old URL: http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;contentId=121780 --&gt; |title=States probe limits of abortion policy |date=June 22, 2006 |work=Stateline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries allow for abortion only through the first or second [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]], and some may allow abortion in cases of fetal defects, e.g., [[Down syndrome]] or where the pregnancy is the result of a [[sexual crime]].

==Other related laws==
{{Main|Legal protection of access to abortion}}
Laws in some countries with liberal abortion laws protect access to abortion services. Such legislation often seeks to guard [[abortion clinic]]s against [[blockade|obstruction]], [[vandalism]], [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], and other actions, or to protect patients and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.
Other laws create a perimeter around a facility, known variously as a "buffer zone", "bubble zone", or "access zone".  This area is intended to limit how close to these facilities demonstration by those who [[Anti-abortion movements|oppose abortion]] can approach. Protests and other displays are restricted to a certain distance from the building, which varies depending upon the law, or are prohibited altogether. Similar zones have also been created to protect the homes of abortion providers and clinic staff. Bubble zone laws are divided into "fixed" and "floating" categories. Fixed bubble zone laws apply to the static area around the facility itself, and floating laws to objects in transit, such as people or [[car]]s.&lt;ref name="cfr"&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights. (n.d.). [http://www.reproductiverights.org/st_clinic_picketing.html Picketing and Harassment]. Retrieved December 14, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130201450/http://www.reproductiverights.org/st_clinic_picketing.html |date=November 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of conflicts between [[anti-abortion]] activists on one side and women seeking abortion and medical staff who provides abortion on the other side, some laws are quite strict: in [[South Africa]] for instance, any person who prevents the lawful termination of a pregnancy or obstructs access to a facility for the termination of a pregnancy faces up to 10 years in prison (section 10.1 (c) of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/num_act/cotopa1996325/|title=Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996 [No. 92 of 1996] - G 17602|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''AfrikaBurn''' is an official [[Burning Man]] [[List of regional Burning Man events|regional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikaburn.com/community/afrikaburn-year-round/regional-network |title=Regional Network |publisher=AfrikaBurn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; event, held annually in the [[Tankwa Karoo National Park]] in [[South Africa]] since 2007. It is centred on the construction of temporary artworks in a semi-desert environment, some of which are burnt towards the end of the event. Many attendees wear elaborate costumes and create decorated "[[Art car|mutant vehicles]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrikaburn.com/about/what-is-afrikaburn |title=What is AfrikaBurn |publisher=AfrikaBurn |date= |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Africa Burns Creative Projects (AfrikaBurn) was created in 2007 as a not-for-profit company, with the intention that it would serve as a vehicle for the creation and co-ordination of an independent South African Burning Man regional event. AfrikaBurn was originally conceived by Paul Jorgensen. The company's founding members were Richard Bowsher, Paul Jorgensen, Monique Schiess, Mike 't Sas-Rolfes, Liane Visser and Robert Weinek. The company's initial directors were Paul Jorgenson, Monique Schiess, Michael 't Sas-Rolfes, Liane Visser &amp; Robert Weinek.

The event has been running since 2007, with all events to date held on a private farm called Stonehenge, which is adjacent to the [[Tankwa Karoo National Park]]. The farm is very isolated, as it is situated half-way along the [[R355 road (South Africa)|R355]], a {{convert|250|km}} long untarred road between [[Calvinia]] and [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]] in the [[Northern Cape Province]] of South Africa.

The event was originally called Afrika Burns, however owing to concerns about the name having possible negative connotations there was a public call for proposals on 15 May 2008. On 16 July 2008 the new name, AfrikaBurn, was officially announced via email. The new name preserves the identity of the event, but rules out possible negative interpretations by changing the name from something that happens ('burns') to Africa, to something that happens (a 'burn') in Africa.

In 2010 the dates of the annual event were moved to earlier in the year, as autumn weather is better suited to the event, and it is currently possible for a public holiday (or in some years two public holidays) to be included within the week during which the event runs. It also means that it is not so close to Burning Man, to allow for more international participants.

The theme for any AfrikaBurn is intended as a point of possible connection, or inspiration. The theme is not enforced, and art or performance is not necessarily in line with the theme.

[[File:AfrikaBurn 2015 Clan burn.JPG|thumb|San Clan burn at AfrikaBurn 2015]]
By analogy to the Man at [[Burning Man]], the main sculpture at the event is called the San Clan. It is designed to look like a [[Bushmen|San]] rock art glyph of a group of people. The intention is to convey the idea of unity and community at the event. Like some sculptures at the event, it is burnt. The burn used to take place on the Saturday night, but is now scheduled for Friday nights in order to accommodate weather delays and provide participants from far afield with more time to return home from the event. 

==Culture==
[[Image:Afrika Burns, South Africa (2122139385).jpg|thumb|270px|right|An artist at AfrikaBurn 2007]]

As a regional [[Burning Man]] event, AfrikaBurn adheres to the ten principles of [[Burning Man]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://regionals.burningman.com/network_principles.html |title=10 Principles of Burning Man |publisher=[[Burning Man]] |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118011437/http://regionals.burningman.com/network_principles.html |archive-date=2013-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and added another in 2014.  Among these guiding principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikaburn.com/about/guiding-principles |title=Guiding Principles |publisher=AfrikaBurn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[Leave No Trace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikaburn.com/the-event/participation/leave-no-trace |title=Leave No Trace |publisher=AfrikaBurn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy, self-expression, self-reliance, and communal effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikaburn.com/community |title=Community Participation |publisher=AfrikaBurn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th principle, 'Each One Teach One', was added to encourage the sharing of knowledge throughout the community, in order to ensure the uptake of culture matches the growth in numbers. Money is not allowed on the camping site of the event since nothing is for sale, if people need something they either trade it with something else or simply ask for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/afrikaburn-tankwa|title=2017 Afrikaburn Festival|last=|first=|date=2017|website=www.capetownmagazine.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pets are not allowed at the event. This is due to concerns for the safety of both the animals (loud noises and an inhospitable environment), and the participants. In addition, fireworks, flares and fire lanterns are not permitted. 

Theme camps are one of the key components of vibrant regional Burning Man events.  Theme camps are established by participants to enhance the experience for all participants.

Major [[Burning Man#Villages and theme camps|theme camps]] from the last few years include "Alienz Coffee Shop", "BeDazzled", "Birthday Suits", "Burning Mail", "Camp Anvil", "Camp High Tea", "Camp Skaduwee", "Desert Magic", "Flow Arts Commune", "Fractal Chill Ethiopian Coffee House", "Love All Tennis", "Magical Mystery Mob", "New Beginnings", "Camp Now!", "Rust 'n Dust", "Smokescreen", "Space Cowboys", "State of Bliss", "Sunset Oasis", "The Emperor's New Theme Camp", "The Friend Zone", "The Grease Monkeys", "The Pancake People", "The Purple Spanking Booth", "The Steampunk Saloon", "The Tankwa Town Library", "The Theatre of Playful Banter", "The Vuvustasie", and "The Wild Ass Saloon". Each year, the number of Theme Camps grows in line with the increase in numbers.

"MOOP", or Matter Out Of Place, is the term for litter. Reducing and removing MOOP is part of the [[Leave No Trace]] philosophy.

'''Aso oke fabric''', (Yoruba: Așǫ oke, pronounced ''ah-SHAW-okay'') is a hand loomed cloth woven by the [[Yoruba people]] of western [[Nigeria]]. Aso oke means ''top cloth'' in the [[English language]]. Usually woven by men, the fabric is used to make men's gowns, called [[Boubou (clothing)|Agbada]], women's [[Wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]], called iro, and men's hats, called [[Aso Oke hat|fila]].

[[File:Aso oke.jpg|thumb|A Nigerian man in Aso Oke]]
It is from the Yoruba culture in Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Lagos, and the Osun States in southwestern Nigeria.

The way of making Aso-oke cloth has remained the same for centuries, however new techniques and production methods have been looked into to eliminate the weight and thickness of the Aso-Oke cloth, and to make it more accessible for casual wear.

==Types of aso oke==
Other ways that designers have made this old traditional cloth become more modern is to “structurally manipulate and combine animal and floral motifs into definite shapes of grids and geometry, suitable for computer design applications.” The basis of more traditional motifs would have originated from fables and folklore. 
* ''Sanyan'' type: woven from anaphe wild silk and cotton yarns
* ''Alaari'' type: woven with either synthetically or locally grown cotton and shinning threads, sometimes with perforated patterns
* ''Etu'' type: bears dark indigo colours with tiny white stripes noted for their simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bankole Ojo|first=Emmanuel|date=Spring 2007|title=Printing Contemporary Handwoven Fabrics (Aso-Oke) in Southwestern Nigeria|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=23|pages=31–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agbadudu|first=A.B.|date=2006|title=Aso-Oke: a Nigerian classic style and fashion fabric|url=|journal=Journal of Fashion and Marketing and Management|volume=10|pages=97–113|via=Emerald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aso oke fabric is often worn with aran,  a brown velvet with concentric designs.

==Yoruba women's garment==
When people speak of an aso oke, they are usually referring to the traditional Yoruba women's garment. It consists of four parts:

* Buba - Yoruba blouse
* Iro - a wrap skirt
* Gele - head tie
* Iborun or Ipele - shawl or shoulder sash

==Formal wear==
Nigerians around the world wear aso oke fabric for special occasions including holidays, weddings, funerals and chieftain title ceremonies. All followers of the [[Yoruba religion]] also wear aso oke fabrics and hats.

[[File:Brian and Babs (cropped).jpg|thumb|Brian Haw (on crutches) with Barbara Grace Tucker at Christmas 2009]]
She joined the London [[Parliament Square Peace Campaign]] of [[Brian Haw]] in December 2005. This round-the-clock campaign had been initiated by Haw in June 2001 to protest the [[sanctions against Iraq]] which had devastated Iraqi society and had, according to [[UNICEF]], killed some 500,000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq surveys show 'humanitarian emergency'|url=http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the seven years or so since Tucker's arrival she has been arrested  47 times–usually on charges of "unauthorised demonstration".{{cn|date=March 2016}} In 2008 she served two weeks in prison for breach of [[police bail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning a blind eye to authoritarianism |url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/59333 |publisher=www.morningstaronline.co.uk |accessdate=5 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013703/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/59333 |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 she served a nine-week prison sentence in [[Holloway Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barbara Grace Tucker|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/police-clear-brian-haws-peace-camp-6128760.html?origin=internalSearch|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=9 January 2013|location=London|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2012 she was denied a tent, blankets or sleeping bag and then slept in a chair, until that too was confiscated. Tucker has been treated for [[Hypothermia|exposure]] and has spent some time on an intravenous drip. In January 2013 Tucker started a hunger strike after protesting in the square for a total of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament Square peace protester stages hunger strike|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/parliament-square-peace-protester-stages-hunger-strike-8438307.html?origin=internalSearch|publisher=www.standard.co.uk|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her supporters vowed to continue their demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace activist campaigning against UK role in wars |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/01/04/281660/peace-activist-campaigning-against-uk-role-in-wars/ |publisher=PressTV Iran |accessdate=5 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110061907/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/01/04/281660/peace-activist-campaigning-against-uk-role-in-wars/ |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did so until later in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/peace-at-last-final-anti-war-protesters-leave-parliament-square-after-12-years-8608893.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dravidian languages==
* [[Bible translations into Tamil]]
* [[Bible translations into Telugu]]
* [[Bible translations into Kannada]]
* [[Bible translations into Malayalam]]
===Paniya===

[[Paniya language|Paniya]] is a [[Southern Dravidian]] language mainly found in [[scheduled castes]] in Kerala. Stephen Daniel translated the portions of Bible into Paniya language.

Theyyam Mancheyaathaayina Kathe, the Translation of the New Testament in the Paniya language was pioneered and presented by  Mathews Vergis to the Paniya tribe on 30 December 2008. The Paniyas have historically worked as agricultural laborers. The Paniyas are mainly found in the borders of Kerala and Mysore, with a dwindling population of about approximately 120,000. Initially only the Gospel of Luke was translated and presented to the tribe. The Paniya language has no script of its own and hence Mathews Vergis used the Malayalam script to publish the Bible in their language.

===Jennu Kuruba Language===
Vasa Nyama, the Translation of the New Testament in the [[Jennu Kuruba language]] was published by Mathews Vergis to the Jennu Kuruba tribe on 10 September 2015. People of the Jennu Kuruba tribe are traditionally honey gatherers and are found in forests in Southern central India. Since the forests are getting slaughtered and synthetic honey is replacing natural honey, the tribe is decaying and the people are getting scattered. 

Initially only the Gospel of Mark was translated and presented to the tribe. Mathews Vergis completed and presented the entire New Testament because of the earnest and eagerness of the Jennu Kuruba people, though few in number. The Jennu Kuruba language has no script of its own and hence Mathews Vergis used the Kannada script to present the Bible in their language. This is the first piece of literature in print ever since the existence of this tribe.

===Benjara===
Navo Karar, the translation of the New Testament in the Benjara language of the Benjara ethnic tribe was published by Mathews Vergis on 12 August 2015. The people of the Benjara tribe migrated from Afghanistan and settled in Rajasthan, India long ago. They were salt merchants and suppliers of bullocks. Being nomadic in nature, they spread to different parts of India, namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. In Karnataka they are known as Lambanis and in other places as Lambadis. Among these states, the state of Karnataka has about a million Lambanis – the highest in India. The Benjara language has no script and the people are familiar with the language of the home states. Thus Kannada script is used to present the Bible to the Lambanis to understand the Bible in their language. This is the first piece of literature to be printed in the Benjara language.

===Kulu===
Markana Nalla Shuddhi, the translation of the 'Gospel according to Mark' in the Kulu Language spoken by the ethnic Korama and Koracha tribes of South India, was pioneered by Mathews Vergis and was presented to the tribe on 28 December 2015. Though the language is spoken by around 200,000 of people belonging to the Koracha and Korama tribes, it failed to find a place in the dictionary of Indian tribal languages along with scores of other tribal languages recorded in the Census taken by the Government of India a decade and half ago. It was the request of the people of the Koracha and Korama tribes that propelled Mathews Vergis to pioneer the translation of the Gospel according to Mark into the Kulu language. Incidentally this is the first piece of literature in print ever since the existence of the Koracha and Korama tribes on earth.

===Tulu===
Parts of The New Testament were translated into the [[Tulu language]] of Karnataka in [[Kannada]] script in 1842 and the complete New Testament in 1847 by the [[Basel Mission]]aries in [[Mangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscriptures.org/pages/tulu.html|title=The Bible in Tulu|publisher=Worldscriptures.org|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holybiblefoundation.org/home/tulu-bible |accessdate=5 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324021301/http://www.holybiblefoundation.org/home/tulu-bible |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kam buvo naudinga nušauti V.Lingį?], delfi.lt, 2010-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; – 12 July 1995) was the head of the ''Vilnius Brigade'' [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] in [[Lithuania]]. In 1994, he was convicted of ordering the murder of Lithuanian journalist Vitas Lingys and was [[Capital punishment|executed]] by Lithuania. Dekanidze was the last person executed in Lithuania prior to the abolition of death penalty in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&amp;nome=lithuania "Lithuania"], handsoffcain.info, accessed 2008-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dekanidze was born on 13 December 1962 in [[Vilnius]] to [[History of the Jews in Georgia|Georgian Jewish]] immigrants. He was a [[stateless person]], not having been granted citizenship in Lithuania or Georgia. In [[Vilnius]], he was the leader of the ''Vilnius Brigade'' criminal organization. The ''Vilnius Brigade'' mostly consisted of Lithuanian-born people of various ethnic groups (mostly Jews, Russians, Poles and Lithuanians), although Boris Dekanidze as well as his brother were Georgian Jews.

In 1993, after receiving a number of [[death threat]]s, [[Vitas Lingys]], one of the founders and publishers of the newspaper ''[[Respublika (Lithuanian newspaper)|Respublika]]'', was shot at point-blank range near his home in Vilnius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D61E3DF930A25753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print "Lithuanian reporter is slain"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1993-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Dekanidze was arrested and charged with ordering the murder, which police said was carried out by [[Igor Akhremov]].

In 1994, Dekanidze was convicted of deliberate murder by a three-judge panel. Dakanidze claimed he was innocent, and the evidence against him was primarily the testimony of Igor Akhremov (fellow member of ''Vilnius Brigade''), who claimed to have carried out the killing on Dekanidze's orders. On 10 November 1994, Dekanidze was sentenced to death and Akhremov was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Lithuanian authorities shut down a [[nuclear power plant]] after a terrorist threat was made against it the day after the convictions were handed down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E0D81431F936A25752C1A962958260 "Lithuanians Close A Nuclear Reactor After 3 Threats"], ''The New York Times'', 1994-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dekanidze appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of Lithuania|Supreme Court]], but it ruled in February 1995 that there were no grounds for reviewing the death sentence. His appeal for clemency to [[President of Lithuania|President]] [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] was also refused.

Dekanidze was executed on 12 July 1995 in Vilnius by a single shot to the back of his head. The execution has been criticized at being carried out even as the [[Seimas|Lithuanian parliament]] was debating abolition of the death penalty.

Dekanidze's execution was the last act of death penalty in Lithuania and it was finally abolished for all crimes in 1998 after the [[Lithuanian Constitutional Court]] ruled that the death penalty was [[unconstitutional]].

}}'''''Califano v. Goldfarb''''', 430 U.S. 199 (1977),&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=Califano v. Goldfarb|volume=430|page=199|pin=|year=1977}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], which held that the different treatment of men and women mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 402(f)(1)(D)&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|42|402|f|1|D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees, and therefore violated the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The case was brought by a widower who was denied survivor benefits on the grounds that he had not been receiving at least one-half support from his wife when she died. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court, ruling [[unconstitutional]] the provision of the [[Social Security Act]] which set forth a gender-based distinction between widows and widowers, whereby Social Security Act survivors benefits were payable to a widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from his late wife, while such benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband were payable to his widow regardless of dependency. The Court found that this distinction deprived female wage earners of the same protection that a similarly situated male worker would have received, violating due process and equal protection.

== Background ==
Leon Goldfarb, a widower in the state of New York, applied for survivor benefits under the [[Social Security Act]]. Leon Goldfarb's late wife had worked as a secretary for [[New York City]] public schools for nearly twenty-five years and paid all of her social security taxes until her death in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bornstein|first=Stephanie|date=June 2012|title=The Law of Gender Stereotyping and the Work-Family Conflicts of Men|url=https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1515&amp;context=facultypub|journal=Hastings Law Journal|volume=63|pages=1308-9|via=UF Law Scholarship Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his wife's death, Leon Goldfarb applied for survivor benefits but was denied. The relevant statute, 42 U.S.C § 402(f)(1)(D), mandated that surviving widowers must meet the burden of proving that they had been receiving over half of their financial support from their wives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html|title=Califano v. Goldfarb - 430 U.S. 199 (1977)|publisher=Justia|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law made no such requirement for widows, who would be provided survivor benefits regardless of their dependency on their husbands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Goldfarb challenged the constitutionality of the statute in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]]. He was represented by attorneys from the [[Women's Rights Litigation Clinic]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb v. Sec'y of Health, Ed. &amp; Welfare, 396 F. Supp. 308 (E.D.N.Y. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The lower court ruled in Goldfarb's favor, holding that the provision of the [[Social Security Act]] that denied benefits to widowers was unconstitutional as discriminating against widowers on the basis of sex. The [[Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Goldfarb was represented by future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who at the time was co-founder and general counsel of the Women's Rights Project at the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70901660|title=The Rehnquist court : justices, rulings, and legacy|last=R.|first=Hensley, Thomas|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Hale, Kathleen., Snook, Carl.|year=|isbn=1576075605|location=Santa Barbara|pages=92|oclc=70901660}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was one of several gender discrimination cases that Ginsburg successfully argued in front of the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/us/supreme-court-woman-rejected-clerk-chosen-justice-ruth-joan-bader-ginsburg.html|title=THE SUPREME COURT: Woman in the News; Rejected as a Clerk, Chosen as a Justice: Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg|last=Lewis|first=Neil A.|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/tribute-legacy-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-wrp-staff|title=Tribute: The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and WRP Staff|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to her arguments in [[Frontiero v. Richardson|''Frontiero v. Richardson'']], Ginsburg argued in her brief that a reliance on gender stereotypes which served to devalue women's roles as breadwinners constituted gender-based discrimination in violation of equal protection. She argued that the social security statute in question "assume[d] gainful employment as a domain in which men come first, women second," and that the statute favored "one type of marital unit over another." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
== Court Decision ==
In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court. Justice Brennan's opinion, which was joined by Justice White, Justice Marshall, and Justice Powell, determined that the gender-based distinction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court agreed with Ginsburg's arguments, noting that the distinction in the federal requirements "deprive[s] women of protection for their families which men receive as a result of their employment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Court based its decision on the precedent established in prior cases ''Frontiero'' and ''[[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld]]:''&lt;blockquote&gt;''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld'', like the instant case, presented the question in the context of the [Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance] program. There the Court held unconstitutional a provision that denied father's insurance benefits to surviving widowers with children in their care, while authorizing similar mother's benefits to similarly situated widows... Precisely the same reasoning condemns the gender-based distinction made by § 402(f)(1)(D) in this case. For that distinction, too, operates ‘to deprive women of protection for their families which men receive as a result of their employment’: social security taxes were deducted from Hannah Goldfarb's salary during the quarter century she worked as a secretary, yet, in consequence of § 402(f)(1)(D), she also ‘not only failed to receive for her (spouse) the same protection which similarly situated male worker would have received (for his spouse) but she also was deprived of a portion of her own earnings in order to contribute to the fund out of which benefits would be paid to others.’ &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Court rejected the government's argument that the Court should focus solely on the distinction drawn between widowers and widows, based on the notion that the statute discriminates not against the covered wage earning female, but rather against her surviving widower, who was burdened with proof of dependency. The Court disagreed, stating that Mrs. Goldfarb "worked and paid social security taxes... at the same rate as her male colleagues" yet received narrower insurance protection than a male colleague. The Court found that this distinction requires the equal protection challenge in the case to focus on the gender-based discrimination against women and not only the distinction between widowers and widows.

Based on an examination of the legislative history of the statute, the Court found that there existed "an intention to aid the dependent spouses of deceased wage earners, coupled with a presumption that wives are usually dependent" in the statute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rejecting the "archaic and overbroad" generalizations that a wife is more likely to be dependent on her husband than a husband on his wife, the Court concluded that these presumptions cannot justify a gender-based discrimination when distributing employment-related benefits. 

=== Justice Steven's Concurrence ===
Justice Stevens wrote in concurrence with the majority. Rejecting that the rationale behind the statutory scheme was justifiably based on administrative convenience or based on a 'policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden,' he concurs with the Court's judgment as to the lack of justification for the disparate treatment of genders, but is "persuaded that the relevant discrimination in this case is against surviving male spouses, rather than against deceased female wage earners." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Justice Rehnquist's Dissent ===
In his dissent, which was joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart and Justice Blackmun, Rehnquist disagreed that the classification was discriminatory. Rehnquist argued that Congress' purpose in adopting these provisions for dependency was "to avoid the burden and expense of specific case-by-case determination in the large number of cases where dependency is objectively probable." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the likelihood that a widow would be dependent on her husband, and not the other way around, Rehnquist argued that such a justifiably rational basis is permissible under the Fifth Amendment for the purpose of aiding administrative functions.

== Implications ==

This ruling required an amendment to the Social Security Act in order to eliminate the burden of proof for widowers. The new language provided equal protection for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/24576/Califano-v-Goldfarb-Significance.html|title=Califano v.

In [[book publishing]], '''casting off''' is the process of estimating the number of [[Bookbinding#Modern_commercial_binding|signatures]] required to [[typeset]] a [[manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style'', Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 15th ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; An accurate castoff (or cast off) is important because the page length of a book affects many variables, including the cost of producing the book, the cover price, how many books can fit in a carton, and the width of the spine.

Casting off generally begins by counting the words or characters in the manuscript, usually using a [[word processor]] or [[text editor]]. This word count is then divided by an estimate of the number of words or characters per full page of a model book, i.e., a previously published book with approximately the same trim size and type specifications to be applied to the manuscript.

The editor must then account for anything else that will add pages to the finished book, such as half-title and title pages, the copyright page, part-title pages, chapter openers, photographs, illustrations, charts, tables, or lines of poetry. In addition, the editor must anticipate any elements that will be added later in proofs, such as a preface or index.

Once the editor has estimated the pages required to typeset the book, it must be rounded to the nearest multiple of sixteen (a [[Bookbinding#Modern_commercial_binding|signature]]) or eight (a half-signature) by adding blank pages or killing (editing so as to remove) pages. Editors tend to round up rather than down, because if the book requires more pages than anticipated, it will cost more to produce, but fewer pages and therefore lower production costs are less problematic.

While some software exists to help editors in accurately casting off manuscripts, even an experienced editor often can't foresee the many variables that will affect a book's length, some of which may not arise until the book is well into production.

{{main|Effects of climate change on human health}}
Humans are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy (Confalonieri ''et al''., 2007:393).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm
|accessdate=2009-05-20|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a literature assessment by Confalonieri ''et al''. (2007:393), the effects of climate change to date have been small, but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions.

With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al''. (2007:393) concluded that climate change had altered the seasonal distribution of some allergenic [[pollen]] species. With medium confidence, they concluded that climate change had:
*altered the distribution of some infectious disease vectors
*increased [[heatwave]]-related deaths

With high confidence, [[IPCC]] (2007d:48) projected that:&lt;ref name=ar4syn&gt;{{cite web

*the health status of millions of people would be affected through, for example, increases in [[malnutrition]]; increased deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; increased burden of [[diarrhoea]]l diseases; increased frequency of cardio-[[respiratory disease]]s due to high concentrations of ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change; and altered spatial distribution of some [[infectious disease]]s.
*climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa. Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries.

With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure.

According to a 2009 journal paper by [[University College London|UCL]] academics, climate change and [[global warming]] pose the biggest threat to human health in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a regional and global assessment to quantify the amount of premature [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] due to a range of factors, including climate change. Projections were made over future climate change impacts. Limited adjustments for adaptation were included in the estimates based on these projections. Projected relative risks attributable to climate change in 2030 varied by health outcome and region. Risks were largely negative, with most of the projected disease burden due to increases in diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition. These increases were primarily in low-income populations already experiencing a large burden of disease.

====Extreme events====
With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that climate change would increase the number of people suffering from death, disease and injury from [[heat wave]]s, [[flood]]s, [[storm]]s, [[fire]]s and [[drought]]s.&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt;

;Floods and weather disasters

Floods are low-probability, high-impact events that can overwhelm physical infrastructure and human communities.&lt;ref name="Health impacts of wind, storms and floods"&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) reported that major storm and flood disasters have occurred in the last two decades.

The impacts of weather disasters is considerable and unequally distributed.&lt;ref name="Health impacts of wind, storms and floods"/&gt; For example, natural disasters have been shown to result in increased domestic violence against - and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorders]] in – [[women]]. In terms of deaths and populations affected, floods and tropical cyclones have the greatest impact in South Asia and Latin America. Vulnerability to weather disasters depends on the attributes of the person at risk, including where they live and their age, as well as other social and environmental factors. High-density populations in low-lying coastal regions experience a high health burden from weather disasters.

;Heatwaves

Hot days, hot nights and heatwaves have become more frequent.&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Heatwaves are associated with marked short-term increases in mortality. For example, in August 2003, a heatwave in Europe resulted in excess mortality in the range of 35,000 total deaths.

Heat-related morbidity and mortality is projected to increase.&lt;ref name="heat and cold related mortality"&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The health burden could be relatively small for moderate heatwaves in temperate regions, because deaths occur primarily in susceptible persons.

;Drought

The effects of drought on health include deaths, malnutrition, [[infectious disease]]s and [[respiratory disease]]s.&lt;ref name="drought nutrition"/&gt; Countries within the "[[Meningitis]] Belt" in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]] and [[epidemic]] frequency of [[meningococcal disease|meningococcal]] meningitis in Africa, although other areas in the Rift Valley, the Great Lakes, and southern Africa are also affected.&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial distribution, intensity, and seasonality of meningococcal (epidemic) meningitis appear to be strongly linked to climate and environmental factors, particularly drought. The cause of this link is not fully understood.

;Fires

In some regions, changes in temperature and precipitation are projected to increase the frequency and severity of fire events.&lt;ref&gt;

In richer countries, where such diseases have been eliminated or kept in check by [[vaccination]], draining swamps and using pesticides, the consequences may be felt more in economic than health terms. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says global warming could lead to a major increase in insect-borne diseases in Britain and Europe, as northern Europe becomes warmer, ticks—which carry [[encephalitis]] and [[lyme disease]]—and [[sandflies]]—which carry [[visceral leishmaniasis]]—are likely to move in.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/372219.stm Global Warming disease warning]&lt;/ref&gt; However, malaria has always been a common threat in European past, with the last epidemic occurring in the Netherlands during the 1950s. In the United States, Malaria has been endemic in as much as 36 states (including [[Washington (state)|Washington]], North Dakota, Michigan and New York) until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reiter |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Global warming and malaria: a call for accuracy |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=323–4 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(04)01038-2 |pmid=15172336 |pmc=3130128 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1949, the country was declared free of malaria as a significant public health problem, after more than 4,650,000 house [[DDT]] spray applications had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/eradication_us.htm |title=Eradication of Malaria in the United States (1947–1951) |accessdate=2008-07-12 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=April 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organisation estimates 150,000 deaths annually "as a result of climate change", of which half are in the Asia-[[Pacific]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/200804/s2211161.htm?tab=latest "Malaria found in PNG highlands"], ABC Radio Australia, April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, it reported that, as a result of increased temperatures, the number of [[malaria]] infections is expected to increase in the [[Highland (geography)|highland]] areas of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77993 PAPUA NEW GUINEA: Climate change challenge to combat malaria] ''UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs''&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Infectious disease vectors=====
With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt; projected that climate change would continue to change the range of some [[infectious disease]] vectors. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector-borne diseases]] (VBD) are infections transmitted by the bite of infected [[arthropod]] species, such as [[mosquito]]es, [[tick]]s, [[triatominae|triatomine]] bugs, [[sandfly|sandflies]], and [[Black fly|blackflies]].&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence of climate-change-related shifts in the distribution of tick vectors of disease, of some (non-malarial) mosquito vectors in Europe and North America. Climate change has also been implicated in changes in the breeding and migration dates of several bird species. Several species of wild bird can act as carriers of human [[pathogen]]s as well as of vectors of infectious agents.

======Dengue======
With low confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that climate change would increase the number of people at risk of dengue.&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt; [[dengue fever|Dengue]] is the world's most important vector-borne viral disease.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have reported associations between dengue and climate, however, these associations are not entirely consistent.

&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall can be a limiting factor for mosquito populations and there is some evidence of reductions in transmission associated with decadal decreases in rainfall. The effects of observed climate change on the geographical distribution of malaria and its transmission intensity in highland regions remains controversial. There is no clear evidence that malaria has been affected by climate change in South America or in continental regions of the Russian Federation. There is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales.

{{Undue weight|paragraph|date=May 2010}}

A paper by researchers from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Florida]] published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in May 2010 concluded that claims that a warming climate has led to more widespread disease and death due to malaria are largely at odds with the evidence, and that "''predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.''"&lt;ref&gt;

======Other infectious diseases======
There is good evidence that diseases transmitted by [[rodent]]s sometimes increase during heavy rainfall and flooding because of altered patterns of human-pathogen-rodent contact.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

======Projections======
With very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt; concluded that climate change would have mixed effects on malaria. Malaria is a complex disease to model and all of the published models assessed by Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) had limited [[Parametrization (climate)|parametrization]] of some key factors.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Given this limitation, models assessed by Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007) projected that, particularly in Africa, climate change would be associated with geographical expansions of the areas suitable for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in some regions, and contractions in other regions. Projections also suggested that some regions would experience a longer season of transmission. Projections suggested expansions in vector species that carry dengue for parts of Australia and New Zealand.

=====Diarrhoeal diseases=====
With medium confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt; concluded that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases. Childhood mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains high.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite improvements in care. Several studies have shown that transmission of [[intestine|enteric]] pathogens is higher during the rainy season. Some studies have found that higher temperature was strongly associated with increased episodes of diarrhoeal disease in adults and children in Peru. Campbell-Lendrum ''et al.'' (2003)&lt;ref name="who projections"/&gt; projected that climate change would increase the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income regions by approximately 2 to 5% in 2020.

====Ground-level ozone====
With high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;ref name="health summary"/&gt; projected that climate change would increase cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality associated with ground-level [[ozone]]. Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and is the primary constituent of urban [[smog]].&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone in smog is formed through chemical reactions involving [[nitrogen oxide]]s and other compounds. The reaction is a [[photochemical reaction]], meaning that it involves [[electromagnetic radiation]], and occurs in the presence of bright sunshine and high temperatures. Exposure to elevated concentrations of ozone is associated with increased hospital admissions for [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], allergic [[rhinitis]] and other respiratory diseases, and with premature mortality.

Background levels of ground-level ozone have risen since pre-industrial times because of increasing emissions of methane, [[carbon monoxide]] and nitrogen oxides.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is expected to continue into the mid-21st century.

====Cold-waves====
[[cold wave|Cold-waves]] continue to be a problem in northern latitudes, where very low temperatures can be reached in a few hours and extend over long periods.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Reductions in cold-deaths due to climate change are projected to be greater than increases in heat-related deaths in the UK.&lt;ref name="heat and cold related mortality"/&gt;

====Direct effects of temperature rise====

The most direct effect of climate change on humans might be the impacts of hotter temperatures themselves. Extreme high temperatures increase the number of people who die on a given day for many reasons: people with heart problems are vulnerable because one's cardiovascular system must work harder to keep the body cool during hot weather, heat exhaustion, and some respiratory problems increase. Global warming could mean more [[cardiovascular disease]]s, doctors warn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher air temperature also increase the concentration of ozone at ground level. In the lower atmosphere, ozone is a harmful pollutant. It damages lung tissues and causes problems for people with asthma and other lung diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=McMichael, A.J., Campbell-Lendrum, D.H., Corvalán, C.F., Ebi, K.L., Githeko, A., Scheraga, J.D. and Woodward, A. |year=2003 |url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/climate/summary/en/index.html |title=Climate Change and Human Health – Risk and Responses |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising temperatures have two opposing direct effects on [[death|mortality]]: higher temperatures in winter reduce deaths from cold; higher temperatures in summer increase heat-related deaths. The net local impact of these two direct effects depends on the current climate in a particular area. Palutikof ''et al.'' (1996) calculate that in England and Wales for a 1&amp;nbsp;°C temperature rise the reduced deaths from cold outweigh the increased deaths from heat, resulting in a reduction in annual average mortality of 7000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.P.

Subak |author3=M.D. Agnew |title=Impacts of the exceptionally hot weather in 1995 in the UK |journal=Climate Monitor |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Keatinge ''et al.'' (2000) "suggest that any increases in mortality due to increased temperatures would be outweighed by much larger short term declines in cold related mortalities."&lt;ref name="Keatinge2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keatinge |first=W.

(2000), "populations in Europe have adjusted successfully to mean summer temperatures ranging from 13.5°C to 24.1°C, and can be expected to adjust to global warming predicted for the next half century with little sustained increase in heat related mortality."&lt;ref name="Keatinge2000" /&gt;

==== Children ====
In 2007, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] issued the policy statement ''Global Climate Change and Children's Health'':

:Anticipated direct health consequences of climate change include injury and death from [[extreme weather event]]s and [[natural disaster]]s, increases in climate-sensitive [[infectious disease]]s, increases in [[air pollution#Health effects|air pollution–related illness]], and more heat-related, potentially fatal, illness. Within all of these categories, children have increased vulnerability compared with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;120/5/1149 AAP ''Global Climate Change and Children's Health'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2008-04-29, a [[UNICEF UK]] Report found that global warming is already reducing the quality of the world's most vulnerable children's lives and making it more difficult to meet the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Global warming will reduce access to [[clean water]] and [[food security|food supplies]], particularly in Africa and Asia. Disasters, violence and disease are expected to be more frequent and intense, making the future of the world's poorest children more bleak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1120 UNICEF UK News :: News item :: The tragic consequences of climate change for the world’s children :: April 29, 2008 00:00] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122045816/http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1120 |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limits of human survivability====

Some areas of the world would start to surpass the [[wet-bulb temperature]] limit of human survivability with global warming of about 6.7&amp;nbsp;°C (12&amp;nbsp;°F) while a warming of 11.7&amp;nbsp;°C (21&amp;nbsp;°F) would put half of the world's population in an uninhabitable environment.&lt;ref name="SciDaily-WetBulb"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155413.htm |title=Global warming: Future temperatures could exceed livable limits, researchers find |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=21 |pages=9552–5 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0913352107 |pmid=20439769 |pmc=2906879 |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-27|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9552S |last1=Sherwood |first1=Steven C. |last2=Huber |first2=Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-WetBulb"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0913352107|pmid=20439769|pmc=2906879|title=An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=107|issue=21|pages=9552–9555|year=2010|last1=Sherwood|first1=S. C.|last2=Huber|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the survivable limit of global warming in these areas is probably lower and in practice, some areas may experience lethal wet-bulb temperatures even earlier, because this study conservatively projected the survival limit for persons who are out of the sun, in gale-force winds, doused with water, wearing no clothing, and not working.&lt;ref name="PNAS-WetBulb" /&gt;

The combined effects of global warming may have particularly harsh effects on people and countries without the resources to [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] those effects. This may slow [[economic development]] and [[poverty reduction]], and make it harder to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/iedg/publications/climate_change_web.pdf |title=Poverty Reduction, Equity and Climate Change: Global Governance Synergies or Contradictions? |author=Richards, Michael |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |accessdate=2007-12-01 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the Working Group on Climate Change and Development, a coalition of development and environment [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, issued a report
[http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=9512IIED Up in Smoke] on the effects of climate change on development. This report, and the July 2005 report [http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=9560IIED Africa - Up in Smoke?] predicted increased hunger and disease due to decreased rainfall and severe weather events, particularly in Africa. These are likely to have severe impacts on development for those affected.

In a literature assessment, Yohe ''et al''. (2007:813) concluded that climate change would very likely make it more difficult for nations to achieve the MDGs for the middle of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Conversion therapy''' is the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice of trying to change an individual's [[sexual orientation]] from [[homosexual]] or [[bisexual]] to [[heterosexual]] using psychological or spiritual interventions. There is virtually no reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed and medical bodies warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially harmful. Nevertheless, advocates and proponents do provide anecdotal reports of people who claim some degree of success in becoming heterosexual.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|Zucker|2006|pp=126, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoshino" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouthCrosshairs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haldeman1"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://drdoughaldeman.com/doc/Pseudo-Science.pdf|title = The Pseudo-science of Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy|volume = 4|issue = 1|journal = Angles: The Policy Journal of the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies|date = December 1999|accessdate = March 16, 2018|last = Haldeman|first = Douglas C.|pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical, scientific, and government organizations in the United States and United Kingdom have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful.&lt;ref name="Psych"&gt;{{cite web|title=Position Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies)|url=http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001.aspx|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110120228/http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001.aspx|archive-date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=August 28, 2007|date=May 2000|author=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|quote=In December of 1998, the Board of Trustees issued a position statement that the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as "reparative" or conversion therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation. ...

The highest-profile advocates of conversion therapy today tend to be [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] groups and other organizations which use a religious justification for the therapy rather than speaking of homosexuality as "a disease".&lt;ref name="Yoshino"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshino|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main organization advocating secular forms of conversion therapy is the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), which often partners with religious groups.&lt;ref name="Yoshino" /&gt;

==History==

The history of conversion therapy can be divided broadly into three periods: an early Freudian period; a period of mainstream approval of conversion therapy, when the mental health establishment became the "primary superintendent" of sexuality; and a post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] period where the mainstream medical profession disavowed conversion therapy.&lt;ref name="Yoshino" /&gt;

During the earliest parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical question of whether it ought to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be incurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.&lt;ref name="Lewes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Sigmund Freud====
{{Main|Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality}}
[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|Freud (1856–1939) was skeptical of the possibility of therapeutic conversion.]]

[[Sigmund Freud]] was a physician and the founder of psychoanalysis. Freud stated that homosexuality could sometimes be removed through hypnotic suggestion,&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=74,109}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that his research had "thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homo-eroticism".&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud cautioned that Steinach's operations would not necessarily make possible a therapy that could be generally applied, arguing that such transplant procedures would be effective in changing homosexuality in men only in cases in which it was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of women, and that probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]] rejects transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper "The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman", which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father wanted this condition changed. In Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which she entered therapy, and because homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that "in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse".&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible, not eliminating homosexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay people could seldom be convinced that heterosexual sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.&lt;ref name="OconnorandRyan"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LewesP34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, a mother asked Freud to treat her son. Freud replied in a letter that later became famous:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. ... it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. ... By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Sándor Ferenczi====
[[Sándor Ferenczi]] was an influential psychoanalyst. Ferenczi hoped to cure some kinds of homosexuality completely, but was content in practice with reducing what he considered gay men's hostility to women, along with the urgency of their homosexual desires, and with helping them to become attracted to and potent with women. In his view, a gay man who was confused about his sexual identity and felt himself to be "a woman with the wish to be loved by a man" was not a promising candidate for cure. Ferenczi believed that complete cures of homosexuality might become possible in the future when psychoanalytic technique had been improved.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErnestJonesVol2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1955|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartinStanton"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stanton|1991|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anna Freud====
Daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud became an influential psychoanalytic theorist in the UK.&lt;ref name="Young-Bruehl" /&gt;

[[Anna Freud]] reported the successful treatment of homosexuals as neurotics in a series of unpublished lectures. In 1949 she published "Some Clinical Remarks Concerning the Treatment of Cases of Male Homosexuality" in the ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]''. In her view, it was important to pay attention to the interaction of passive and active homosexual fantasies and strivings, the original interplay of which prevented adequate identification with the father. The patient should be told that his choice of a passive partner allows him to enjoy a passive or receptive mode, while his choice of an active partner allows him to recapture his lost masculinity. She claimed that these interpretations would reactivate repressed [[castration complex|castration anxieties]], and childhood narcissistic grandiosity and its complementary fear of dissolving into nothing during heterosexual intercourse would come with the renewal of heterosexual potency.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

Anna Freud in 1951 published "Clinical Observations on the Treatment of Male Homosexuality" in ''[[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'' and "Homosexuality" in the ''[[American Psychoanalytic Association]] (APsaA) Bulletin''. In these articles, she insisted on the attainment of full object-love of the opposite sex as a requirement for cure of homosexuality. In 1951 she gave a lecture about treatment of homosexuality which was criticised by [[Edmund Bergler]], who emphasised the oral fears of patients and minimized the importance of the phallic castration fears she had discussed.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

Anna Freud recommended in 1956 to a journalist who was preparing an article about psychoanalysis for ''[[The Observer]]'' of London that she not quote Freud's letter to the American mother, on the grounds that "nowadays we can cure many more homosexuals than was thought possible in the beginning. The other reason is that readers may take this as a confirmation that all analysis can do is to convince patients that their defects or 'immoralities' do not matter and that they should be happy with them. That would be unfortunate."&lt;ref name="Young-Bruehl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young-Bruehl|1988|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Melanie Klein====
[[Melanie Klein]] was a pupil of Ferenczi. Her seminal book ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'', based on lectures given to the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in the 1920s, was published in 1932. Klein claimed that entry into the [[Oedipus Complex]] is based on mastery of primitive anxiety from the oral and anal stages. If these tasks are not performed properly, developments in the Oedipal stage will be unstable. Complete analysis of patients with such unstable developments would require uncovering these early concerns. The analysis of homosexuality required dealing with paranoid trends based on the oral stage. ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'' ends with the analysis of Mr. B., a gay man. Klein claimed that he illustrated pathologies that enter into all forms of homosexuality: a gay man idealizes "the good penis" of his partner to allay the fear of attack he feels due to having projected his paranoid hatred onto the imagined "bad penis" of his mother as an infant. She stated that Mr. B.'s homosexual behaviour diminished after he overcame his need to adore the "good penis" of an idealized man. This was made possible by his recovering his belief in the good mother and his ability to sexually gratify her with his good penis and plentiful [[semen]].&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

==== Vote by European parliament in March 2018 ====
In March 2018, a majority of 435 against 109 representatives in the [[European Parliament|European parliament]] passed a resolution condemning conversion therapy and urging [[European Union]] member states to ban the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=30751|title=EU-Parlament stärkt LGBTI-Grundrechte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schwulissimo.de/politik/245183/EuropaeischesParlamentverurteiltdieHeilungvonHomosexuellen.htm|title=Schwulissimo - Europäisches Parlament verurteilt die "Heilung" von Homosexuellen|website=schwulissimo.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/03/01/european-parliament-condemns-gay-cure-therapy-and-tells-eu-member-states-to-ban-it/|title=European Parliament condemns gay 'cure' therapy and tells EU member states to ban it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====20th century====
Psychoanalysis started to receive recognition in the United States in 1909, when Sigmund Freud delivered a series of lectures at [[Clark University]] in [[Massachusetts]] at the invitation of [[G. Stanley Hall]].&lt;ref name="PGay1998"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gay|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, [[Abraham Brill]] wrote "The Conception of Homosexuality", which he published in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and read before the [[American Medical Association]]'s annual meeting. Brill criticised physical treatments for homosexuality such as bladder washing, [[rectum|rectal]] massage, and castration, along with [[hypnosis]], but referred approvingly to Freud and Sadger's use of psychoanalysis, calling its results "very gratifying".&lt;ref name=KatzP149&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|1976|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Brill understood curing homosexuality as restoring heterosexual potency, he claimed that he had cured his patients in several cases, even though many remained homosexual.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Stekel]], an Austrian, published his views on treatment of homosexuality, which he considered a disease, in the American ''[[National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis#Current ideology|Psychoanalytic Review]]'' in 1930. Stekel believed that "success was fairly certain" in changing homosexuality through psychoanalysis provided that it was performed correctly and the patient wanted to be treated. In 1932, ''The Psychoanalytic Quarterly'' published a translation of [[Helene Deutsch]]'s paper "On Female Homosexuality". Deutsch reported her analysis of a lesbian, who did not become heterosexual as a result of treatment, but who managed to achieve a "positive libidinal relationship" with another woman. Deutsch indicated that she would have considered heterosexuality a better outcome.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] was the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt; He was vociferous in his opposition to [[Alfred Kinsey]]. Kinsey's work, and its reception, led Bergler to develop his own theories for treatment, which were essentially to "[[blame the victim]]", in the evaluation of Jennifer Terry, associate professor of Woman's Studies.&lt;ref name="Terry"/&gt; Bergler claimed that if gay people wanted to change, and the right therapeutic approach was taken, then they could be cured in 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="BerglerTime"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergler|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergler used confrontational therapy in which gay people were punished in order to make them aware of their masochism. Bergler openly violated professional ethics to achieve this, breaking patient confidentiality in discussing the cases of patients with other patients, bullying them, calling them liars and telling them they were worthless.&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;{{Harvnb|Terry|1999|pp=308–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that gay people could be cured. Bergler confronted Kinsey because Kinsey thwarted the possibility of cure by presenting homosexuality as an acceptable way of life, which was the basis of the gay rights activism of the time.&lt;ref name="Terry"/&gt; Bergler popularised his views in the United States in the 1950s using magazine articles and books aimed at non-specialists.&lt;ref name="Terry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergler|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the mother who wrote to Freud asking him to treat her son sent Freud's response to the ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', in which it was published.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt; The 1952 first edition of the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-I) classified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref name="RonaldBayer" /&gt;

During the three decades between Freud's death in 1939 and the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, conversion therapy received approval from most of the psychiatric establishment in the United States.&lt;ref name="Drescher"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|1998|pp=19–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Irving Bieber]] ''et al.'' published ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'', in which they concluded that "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bieber|1962|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a [[Stonewall riots|riot]] in 1969 at the Stonewall Bar in New York after a police raid. The Stonewall riot acquired symbolic significance for the gay rights movement and came to be seen as the opening of a new phase in the struggle for gay liberation. Following these events, conversion therapy came under increasing attack. Activism against conversion therapy increasingly focused on the DSM's designation of homosexuality as a psychopathology.&lt;ref name="RonaldBayer" /&gt; In 1973, after years of criticism from gay activists and bitter dispute among psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''. Supporters of the change used evidence from researchers such as Kinsey and [[Evelyn Hooker]]. Psychiatrist Robert Spitzer, a member of the APA's Committee on Nomenclature, played an important role in the events that led to this decision. Critics argued that it was a result of pressure from gay activists, and demanded a referendum among voting members of the Association. The referendum was held in 1974 and the APA's decision was upheld by a 58% majority.&lt;ref name="RonaldBayer"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayer|1987|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA removed [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation|ego-dystonic homosexuality]] from the DSM-III-R in 1987 and opposes the diagnosis of either homosexuality or ego-dystonic homosexuality as any type of disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/diagnoses.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104523/http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/diagnoses.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |title=APA Policy Statement: Use of Diagnoses "Homosexuality" &amp; "Ego-Dystonic Homosexuality" |accessdate=2007-08-28 |author=APA Council of Representatives |date=1987-08-30 |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Nicolosi]] had a significant role in the development of conversion therapy as early as the 1990s, publishing his first book ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://lgbtphysicists.org/files/GLAAD_MediaRefGuide_7thEdition.pdf|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 7th Edition |author=Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD)|date=September 2006|access-date=25 November 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicolosi|first1=Joseph|title=Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach|date=1997|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=9780765701428}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Nicolosi, with [[Charles Socarides]] and Benjamin Kaufman, founded the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), an organization that opposes the mainstream medical view of homosexuality and aims to "make effective psychological therapy available to all homosexual men and women who seek change".&lt;ref name="NARTH"&gt;{{citation |url=http://narth.com/menus/goals.html |title=NARTH What We Offer |accessdate=2009-05-25 |publisher=NARTH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413091827/http://narth.com/menus/goals.html |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Christian right]] groups including the [[Family Research Council]] and the [[American Family Association]] spent $600,000 on advertising promoting conversion therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/how-christians-turned-against-gay-conversion-therapy/390570/|title=How Christians Turned Against Gay Conversion Therapy|first=Jonathan |last=Merritt |date=15 Apr 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2016 |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Paulk]] and his then wife Anne featured in full-page newspaper spreads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ex-ex-gay-pride-249282 |title=Ex-Ex-Gay Pride | first1=Zoë |last1=Schlanger |first2=Elijah |last2=Wolfson |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====21st century====

[[Surgeon General of the United States|United States Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] in 2001 issued a report stating that "there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed".&lt;ref name="SurgeonGeneral"/&gt; The same year, a study by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] concluded that some highly motivated individuals whose orientation is predominantly homosexual can become predominantly heterosexual with some form of reparative therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rk67865783602411/ |title=Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation? |volume = 32 |issue = 5 |year = 2001|format= |doi=10.1023/A:1025647527010 |pmid=14567650 |journal=Arch Sex Behav |pages=403–17; discussion 419–72 | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = RL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer based his findings on structured interviews with 200 self-selected individuals (143 males, 57 females). He told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the study "shows some people can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that".&lt;ref name="Ritter"&gt;{{cite news|title= Study: Some Gays Can Go Straight| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010509/aponline013921_000.htm |first=Malcolm |last=Ritter |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date = 9 May 2001 |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer's study caused controversy and attracted media attention.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt; Spitzer recanted his study in 2012,&lt;ref name=spitzer1 /&gt; and apologized to the gay community for making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy,&lt;ref name=spitzer3 /&gt; calling it his only professional regret.&lt;ref name=spitzer4 /&gt;

The American Psychoanalytic Association spoke against NARTH in 2004, stating "that organization does not adhere to our policy of nondiscrimination and ... their activities are demeaning to our members who are gay and lesbian".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crow |first=C. |date=2004-11-20 |title=Irate reader's expert on gays has drawn fire from his peers |publisher=[[San Antonio Express-News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, a survey of members of the [[American Psychological Association]] rated reparative therapy as "certainly discredited", though the authors warn that the results should be interpreted carefully as an initial step, not a final word.&lt;ref name="NorcrossKoocherandGarofalo"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcross|Koocher|Garofalo|2006|pp=512–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Psychological Association in 2007 convened a task force to evaluate its policies regarding reparative therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jul/11/gay-reparative-therapy-under-scrutiny/ |title=Gay reparative therapy under scrutiny |publisher=Washington Times |location=New York |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the organizers of an APA panel on the relationship between religion and homosexuality canceled the event after gay activists objected that "conversion therapists and their supporters on the religious right use these appearances as a public relations event to try and legitimize what they do".&lt;ref name="Plowman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Plowman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, American Psychological Association stated that it "encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation".&lt;ref name=Apa2009&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics guidelines of major mental health organizations in the United States vary from cautionary statements to recommendations that ethical practitioners refrain from practicing conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or from referring patients to those who do ([[American Counseling Association]]).&lt;ref name="Psych" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACA News" /&gt; In a letter dated February 23, 2011 to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Attorney General of the United States stated "while sexual orientation carries no visible badge, a growing scientific consensus accepts that sexual orientation is a characteristic that is immutable".&lt;ref name="DOMA2011"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-223.html Letter from the Attorney General of the United States to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, RE: DOMA, 23rd February 2011]. "Second, while sexual orientation carries no visible badge, a growing scientific consensus accepts that sexual orientation is a characteristic that is immutable."&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights groups and groups concerned with mental health fear reparative therapy can make depression or even suicide more likely. President [[Barack Obama]] expressed opposition to the practice in 2015.&lt;ref name="BBC-4-2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama calls for end to 'gay conversion therapies' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32227353 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[BBC News]] |date=9 April 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and techniques==
{{Wikinews|Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy}}

===Behavioral modification===
{{Main|Behavior modification}}

Before the American Psychological Association's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], practitioners of conversion therapy employed [[Aversion therapy|aversive conditioning techniques]], involving electric shock and nausea-inducing drugs during presentation of same-sex erotic images. Cessation of the aversive stimuli was typically accompanied by the presentation of opposite-sex erotic images, with the objective of strengthening heterosexual feelings. In "Aversion therapy for sexual deviation: a critical review", published in 1966, M. P. Feldman claimed a 58% cure rate, but Douglas Haldeman is skeptical that such stressful methods permit feelings of sexual responsiveness, and notes that Feldman defined success as suppression of homosexuality and increased capacity for heterosexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method used was the covert sensitization method, which involves instructing patients to imagine vomiting or receiving electric shocks, writing that only single case studies have been conducted, and that their results cannot be generalized. Haldeman writes that behavioral conditioning studies tend to decrease homosexual feelings, but do not increase heterosexual feelings, citing Rangaswami's "Difficulties in arousing and increasing heterosexual responsiveness in a homosexual: A case report", published in 1982, as typical in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldeman concludes that such methods can be called [[torture]], besides being ineffective.  He writes that "Individuals undergoing such treatments do not emerge heterosexually inclined; rather they become shamed, conflicted, and fearful about their homosexual feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ex-gay ministry===
[[Image:One by One booth.jpg|thumb|right|[[OneByOne]] booth at a [[Love Won Out]] conference]]
{{Main|Ex-gay}}

Some sources describe ex-gay ministries as a form of conversion therapy, while others state that ex-gay organizations and conversion therapy are distinct methods of attempting to convert gay people to heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf |title=Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel |accessdate=2010-05-14 |year=1999 |publisher=Just the Facts Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=149,156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesandYarhouse"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Yarhouse|2007|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-gay ministries have also been called transformational ministries.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; Some state that they do not conduct clinical treatment of any kind.&lt;ref name=ExodusStatement /&gt;  [[Exodus International]] once believed reparative therapy could be a beneficial tool.&lt;ref name=ExodusStatement&gt;{{citation |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010931/http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |title=Exodus International Policy Statements |accessdate=2007-08-28 |publisher=Exodus International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The umbrella organization in the United States ceased activities in June 2013, and the three member board issued a statement which repudiated its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit has caused to [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name=Change&gt;{{citation |url=http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry |first=Alan |last=Chambers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623013409/http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry |archivedate=2013-06-23 |title=I Am Sorry |accessdate=2013-06-22 |publisher=Exodus International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministries that had been members formed a new organization [[Restored Hope Network]] and continue to operate as before with a renewed emphases on spiritual conversion and therapy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Psychoanalysis===
{{Main|Psychoanalysis}}

Haldeman writes that psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality is exemplified by the work of Irving Bieber ''et al.'' in ''Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals''. They advocated long-term therapy aimed at resolving the unconscious childhood conflicts that they considered responsible for homosexuality. Haldeman notes that Bieber's methodology has been criticized because it relied upon a clinical sample, the description of the outcomes was based upon subjective therapist impression, and follow-up data were poorly presented. Bieber reported a 27% success rate from long-term therapy, but only 18% of the patients in whom Bieber considered the treatment successful had been exclusively homosexual to begin with, while 50% had been bisexual. In Haldeman's view, this makes even Bieber's unimpressive claims of success misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldeman discusses other psychoanalytic studies of attempts to change homosexuality. Curran and Parr's "Homosexuality: An analysis of 100 male cases", published in 1957, reported no significant increase in heterosexual behavior. Mayerson and Lief's "Psychotherapy of homosexuals: A follow-up study of nineteen cases", published in 1965, reported that half of its 19 subjects were exclusively heterosexual in behavior four and a half years after treatment, but its outcomes were based on patient self-report and had no external validation. In Haldeman's view, those participants in the study who reported change were bisexual at the outset, and its authors wrongly interpreted capacity for heterosexual sex as change of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=151, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparative therapy===

The term "reparative therapy" has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy generally, but according to Jack Drescher it properly refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists [[Elizabeth Moberly]] and [[Joseph Nicolosi]].&lt;ref name="Drescher1998" /&gt; The term ''reparative'' refers to Nicolosi's postulate that same-sex attraction is a person's rational and unconscious attempt to "self-repair" feelings of inferiority.&lt;ref name=Hicks_1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Karolyn Ann|title="Reparative Therapy": Whether Parental Attempts to Change a Child's Sexual Orientation Can Legally Constitute Child Abuse|journal=American University Law Review|date=1999|volume=49|issue=2|pages=505–547|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&amp;context=aulr|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicolosi|first1=Joseph|title=What Is Reparative Therapy?

Most mental health professionals and the [[American Psychological Association]] consider reparative therapy discredited, but it is still practiced by some.&lt;ref name="Yoshino" /&gt; In 2014 the Republican Party of Texas endorsed "counseling, which offers reparative therapy and treatment" in their party platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Permanent Committee on Platform and Resolutions As Amended and Adopted by the 2014 State Convention of the Republican Party of Texas|url=http://www.texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-Platform-Final.pdf#page=14|website=texasgop.org|publisher=Republican Party of Texas|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exodus International]] regarded reparative therapy as a useful tool to eliminate "unwanted same-sex attraction"&lt;ref name=ExodusStatement/&gt; but ceased activities in June 2013 and issued a statement repudiating its aims and apologizing for the harm the organization had caused to [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name=Change /&gt; Psychoanalysts critical of Nicolosi's theories have offered gay-affirmative approaches as an alternative to reparative therapy.&lt;ref name="Drescher1998"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|1998|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DomeniciandLesser"&gt;{{Harvnb|Domenici|Lesser|1995|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex therapy===
{{Main|Masters and Johnson}}

Haldeman has described [[Masters and Johnson|William Masters' and Virginia Johnson]]'s work on sexual orientation change as a form of conversion therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=149, 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Homosexuality in Perspective'', published in 1979, Masters and Johnson viewed homosexuality as the result of blocks that prevented the learning that facilitated heterosexual responsiveness, and described a study of 54 gay men who were dissatisfied with their sexual orientation. The original study did not describe the treatment methodology used, but this was published five years later. John C. Gonsiorek criticized their study on several grounds in 1981, pointing out that while Masters and Johnson stated that their patients were screened for major psychopathology or severe neurosis, they did not explain how this screening was performed, or how the motivation of the patients to change was assessed. Nineteen of their subjects were described as uncooperative during therapy and refused to participate in a follow-up assessment, but all of them were assumed without justification to have successfully changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldeman writes that Masters and Johnson's study was founded upon heterosexist bias, and that it would be tremendously difficult to replicate. In his view, the distinction Masters and Johnson made between "conversion" (helping gay men with no previous heterosexual experience to learn heterosexual sex) and "reversion" (directing men with some previous heterosexual experience back to heterosexuality) was not well founded. Many of the subjects Masters and Johnson labelled homosexual may not have been homosexual, since, of their participants, only 17% identified themselves as exclusively homosexual, while 83% were in the predominantly heterosexual to bisexual range. Haldeman observed that since 30% of the sample was lost to the follow-up, it is possible that the outcome sample did not include any people attracted mainly or exclusively to the same sex. Haldeman concludes that it is likely that, rather than converting or reverting gay people to heterosexuality, Masters and Johnson only strengthened heterosexual responsiveness in people who were already bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobotomy===
{{main|Lobotomy}}

In the 1940s and 1950s, neurologist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] popularized the ice-pick lobotomy to treat homosexuality. He personally performed as many as 3,439&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He was bad, so they put an ice pick in his brain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/13/neuroscience.medicalscience|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  lobotomy surgeries in 23 states, of which 2,500 used his ice-pick procedure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Fascinating And Notable Lobotomies|url=http://listverse.com/2009/06/24/top-10-fascinating-and-notable-lobotomies/|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that he had no formal surgical training.&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Lewis|date=April 2005|title=Walter Freeman's Psychosurgery and Biological Psychiatry: A Cautionary Tale|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2005/04000/Walter_Freeman_s_Psychosurgery_and_Biological.18.aspx|journal=Neurology Today|volume=5|issue=4|pages=70–72|doi=10.1097/00132985-200504000-00020|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of Freeman's patients were gay individuals subjected to a lobotomy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Gene|title=The Tiger Cure|journal=New York Magazine|date=September 2013|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/sex-surrogate-2013-9/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to change their homosexual orientation, leaving most of these individuals severely disabled for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scot|first1=Jamie|title=Shock the Gay Away: Secrets of Early Gay Aversion Therapy Revealed|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamie-scot/shock-the-gay-away-secrets-of-early-gay-aversion-therapy-revealed_b_3497435.html|work=Huffington Post|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While promoted at the time as a treatment for various psychoses, the effectiveness of lobotomy in changing sexual orientation was already the subject of critical research in 1948 when a single case was investigated by Joseph Friedlander and Ralph Banay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Friedlander |first1= Joseph W. |last2=Banay |first2=Ralph |title= Psychosis Following Lobotomy in a Case of Sexual Psychopathy |journal= Archives of Neurology &amp; Psychiatry |date= 1948 |volume= 59 |issue=3 |pages= 302–321 |url= http://archneurpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=650572 |accessdate=28 November 2016 |doi= 10.1001/archneurpsyc.1948.02300380031003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A video depicting the [[Lobotomy#Transorbital lobotomy|"ice-pick lobotomy"]] of a homosexual man was featured in the documentary film, ''[[Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker]]''.&lt;ref name=Yoshino /&gt;&lt;ref name="Homosexuality and Biology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Movie Database"/&gt;

==Studies of conversion therapy==

==="Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation?"===
In May 2001, [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] presented "Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation? 200 Participants Reporting a Change from Homosexual to Heterosexual Orientation", a study of attempts to change homosexual orientation through ex-gay ministries and conversion therapy, at the American Psychiatric Association's convention in New Orleans. The study was partly a response to the APA's 2000 statement cautioning against clinical attempts at changing homosexuality, and was aimed at determining whether such attempts were ever successful rather than how likely it was that change would occur for any given individual. Spitzer wrote that some earlier studies provided evidence for the effectiveness of therapy in changing sexual orientation, but that all of them suffered from methodological problems.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt;

In 2012, Spitzer renounced&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite news | url= | title=Echoes of an intolerant past | date=May 30, 2012 | agency=Philadelphia Inquirer | author=Zimmerman, Jonathan | location=Philadelphia, PA | quote=prominent psychiatrist Robert Spitzer renounced his famous 2001 study claiming that some gays could become straight via so-called reparative therapy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Besen"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wayne-besen/2012-many-celebrations-few-setbacks_b_2388887.html | title=2012: Many Celebrations, Few Setbacks | date=January 2, 2013 | agency=Huffington Post | accessdate=January 3, 2013 | author=Besen, Wayne | quote=Spitzer renounced his infamous 2001 study that said that some highly motivated homosexuals could change from gay to straight.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retracted this study, stating "I was quite wrong in the conclusions that I made from this study.

===Analysis of the May 2001 Spitzer report===
The study results were based solely on interviews with the patients and not on any objective observed results. This made it possible and likely that the report was reporting what the patients wanted their results to be rather than the actual results.

Spitzer reported that after intervention, 66% of the men and 44% of the women had achieved "Good Heterosexual Functioning", which he defined as requiring five criteria (being in a loving heterosexual relationship during the last year, overall satisfaction in emotional relationship with a partner, having heterosexual sex with the partner at least a few times a month, achieving physical satisfaction through heterosexual sex, and not thinking about having homosexual sex more than 15% of the time while having heterosexual sex). He found that the most common reasons for seeking change were lack of emotional satisfaction from gay life, conflict between same-sex feelings and behavior and religious beliefs, and desire to marry or remain married.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpitzerStudy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|2003|pp=403–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was widely reported in the international media and taken up by politicians in the United States, Germany, and Finland, and by conversion therapists.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt;

In 2003, Spitzer published the paper in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''. Spitzer's study has been criticized on numerous ethical and methodological grounds, and "press releases from both [[NGLTF]] and [[Human Rights Campaign|HRC]] sought to undermine Spitzer's credibility by connecting him politically to right-wing groups that had backed the [[ex-gay movement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;q=spitzer+besen+political|title=The Advocate|date=19 June 2001|publisher=Here Publishing|accessdate=13 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay activists argued that the study would be used by conservatives to undermine gay rights.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt; Spitzer acknowledged that the study sample consisted of people who sought treatment primarily because of their religious beliefs (93% of the sample), served in various church-related functions, and who publicly spoke in favor of changing homosexual orientation (78%), and thus were strongly motivated to overreport success. Critics felt he dismissed this source of bias, without even attempting to measure [[deception]] or [[self-deception]] (a standard practice in self-reporting psychological tests like [[MMPI-2]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|Zucker|2006|pp=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; That participants had to rely upon their memories of what their feelings were before treatment may have distorted the findings. It was impossible to determine whether any change that occurred was due to the treatment because it was not clear what it involved and there was no control group.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt; Spitzer's own data showed that claims of change were reflected mostly in changes in self-labelling and behavior, less in attractions, and least in the homoerotic content during the masturbatory fantasies; this particular finding was consistent with other studies in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|Zucker|2006|pp=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants may have been bisexual before treatment. Follow-up studies were not conducted.&lt;ref name="DrescherandZucker" /&gt; Spitzer stressed the limitations of his study. Spitzer said that the number of gay people who could successfully become heterosexual was likely to be "pretty low",&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica (May 9, 2001).

==="Changing Sexual Orientation: A Consumer's Report"===

Ariel Shidlo and Michael Schroeder found in "Changing Sexual Orientation: A Consumer's Report", a peer-reviewed study of 202 respondents&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shidlo|Schroeder|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2002, that 88% of participants failed to achieve a sustained change in their sexual behavior and 3% reported changing their orientation to heterosexual. The remainder reported either losing all sexual drive or attempting to remain celibate, with no change in attraction. Some of the participants who failed felt a sense of shame and had gone through conversion therapy programs for many years. Others who failed believed that therapy was worthwhile and valuable. Many respondents felt harmed by the attempt to change, and reported depression, [[suicidal ideation]] and [[Failed suicide attempt|attempts]], [[hypervigilance]] of gender-deviant mannerisms, social isolation, fear of being a child abuser and poor self-esteem. Of the 8 respondents (out of a sample of 202) who reported a change in sexual orientation, 7 worked as ex-gay counselors or group leaders.&lt;ref name="ShidloandSchroeder2002a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shidlo|Schroeder|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, legal challenges against [[New Jersey]]'s and California's conversion therapy ban were filed. United States District Court Judge [[Freda L. Wolfson]] rejected the claim of New Jersey parents that it violated their rights by keeping them from treating their child for same-sex attraction. In ''Doe v. Christie'', Wolfson wrote: "Surely, the fundamental rights of parents do not include the right to choose a specific medical or mental health treatment that the state has reasonably deemed harmful or ineffective." Wolfson added, "To find otherwise would create unimaginable and unintentional consequences." On February 10, 2015, a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled that offering conversion services on the basis of a description of homosexuality as abnormal or a mental illness is a violation of the ''New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act''.&lt;ref name="gallagher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njlawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202717571907/Judge-Says-Gay-Conversion-Therapy-is-Consumer-Fraud?mcode=1202617207189&amp;curindex=0|title=Gay 'Conversion Therapy' Consumer Fraud Ruling First in U.S.|author=Mary Pat Gallagher|work=New Jersey Law Journal|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article about the ruling on the New Jersey Law Journal web site said the decision is "believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S."&lt;ref name="gallagher"/&gt; On August 29, 2013, in the case of ''[[Pickup v.

===Legal status by US state===
Although no national ban exists, several US states and individual counties ban therapy attempting to change sexual orientation as shown in the map below.

===Status by health organizations===

Many health organizations around the world have denounced and criticized sexual orientation change efforts.&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRC" /&gt; National health organizations in the United States have announced that there has been no scientific demonstration of conversion therapy's efficacy in the last forty years.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-Answers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx | title=Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality | publisher=American Psychological Association | date=2008 | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =APA_Position/&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychNews"&gt;{{citation |last=H. |first=K |title=APA Maintains Reparative Therapy Not Effective |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/99-01-15/therapy.html |publisher=Psychiatric News (news division of the American Psychiatric Association) |date=1999-01-15 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They find that conversion therapy is ineffective, risky and can be harmful. Anecdotal claims of cures are counterbalanced by assertions of harm, and the American Psychiatric Association, for example, cautions ethical practitioners under the [[Hippocratic oath]] to do no harm and to refrain from attempts at conversion therapy.&lt;ref name=APA_Position&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001a.aspx |title=Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation |publisher=Psych.org |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910045820/http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001a.aspx |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream medical bodies state that conversion therapy can be harmful because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide.&lt;ref name="nytconversion"&gt;{{citation |last=Luo |first=Michael |title=Some Tormented by Homosexuality Look to a Controversial Therapy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/nyregion/12group.html |publisher=''The New York Times'' |page=1 |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy can cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of gay and bisexual people to lead happy, healthy lives.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

====APA taskforce study====

The American Psychological Association undertook a study of the peer-reviewed literature in the area of [[sexual orientation change efforts]] (SOCE) and found a myriad of issues with the procedures used in conducting the research. The taskforce did find that some participants experienced a lessening of same sex attraction and arousal, but that these instances were "rare" and "uncommon". The taskforce concluded that, "given the limited amount of methodically sound research, claims that recent SOCE is effective are not supported".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation] Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Two issues with SOCE claims are that conversion therapists falsely assume that homosexuality is a mental disorder and that their research focuses almost exclusively on gay men and rarely includes lesbians.&lt;ref name="Haldeman1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ucdavis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy and Position Statements on Conversion Therapy|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/policy-and-position-statements-on-conversion-therapy|website=Human Rights Campaign|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination===

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s code of conduct states that "Psychologists respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination", but also that "Psychologists are aware that special safeguards may be necessary to protect the rights and welfare of persons or communities whose vulnerabilities impair autonomous decision making."&lt;ref name="apacode"&gt;{{cite web

Supporters of SOCE focus on patient self-determination when discussing whether therapy should be available. Mark Yarhouse, of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Regent University]], wrote that "psychologists have an ethical responsibility to allow individuals to pursue treatment aimed at curbing experiences of same-sex attraction or modifying same-sex behaviors, not only because it affirms the client's rights to dignity, autonomy, and agency, as persons presumed capable of freely choosing among treatment modalities and behavior, but also because it demonstrates regard for diversity".&lt;ref name=Right2Choose&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yarhouse and Throckmorton, of the private Christian school [[Grove City College]], argue that the procedure should be available out of respect for a patient's values system and because they find evidence that it can be effective.&lt;ref name="EthicalIssues"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarhouse|Throckmorton|2002|pp=66–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haldeman similarly argues for a client's right to access to therapy if requested from a [[Informed consent|fully informed]] position: "For some, religious identity is so important that it is more realistic to consider changing sexual orientation than abandoning one's religion of origin ... and if there are those who seek to resolve the conflict between sexual orientation and spirituality with conversion therapy, they must not be discouraged."&lt;ref name="haldeman2"/&gt;

In response to Yarhouse's paper, Jack Drescher argued that "any putative ethical obligation to refer a patient for reparative therapy is outweighed by a stronger ethical obligation to keep patients away from mental health practitioners who engage in questionable clinical practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drescher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck Bright wrote that refusing to endorse a procedure that "has been deemed unethical and potentially harmful by most medical and nearly every professional psychotherapy regulating body cannot be justifiably identified as prohibiting client self-determination".&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt; Some commentators, recommending a hard stand against the practice, have found therapy inconsistent with a psychologist's ethical duties because "it is more ethical to let a client continue to struggle honestly with her or his identity than to collude, even peripherally, with a practice that is discriminatory, oppressive, and ultimately ineffective in its own stated ends".&lt;ref name=PurpleMenace&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that clients who request it do so out of social pressure and internalized homophobia, pointing to evidence that rates of depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse and suicidal feelings are roughly doubled in those who undergo therapy.&lt;ref name="ShidloandSchroeder2002a"/&gt;

Haldeman argues that, due to concern for people whose "spiritual or religious concerns" may assume priority over their sexual orientation, mental health organizations do not ban conversion therapy outright.&lt;ref name="haldeman2"/&gt;

===Ethics guidelines===
In 1998, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] issued a statement opposing any treatment which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that a person should change their orientation, but did not have a formal position on other treatments that attempt to change a person's sexual orientation. In 2000, they augmented that statement by saying that as a general principle, a therapist should not determine the goal of treatment, but recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change clients' sexual orientation until more research is available.&lt;ref name="Psych" /&gt;

The [[American Counseling Association]] has stated that they do not condone any training to educate and prepare a counselor to practice conversion therapy. Counselors who do offer training in conversion therapy must inform students that the techniques are unproven. They suggest counselors do not refer clients to a conversion therapist or to proceed cautiously once they know the counselor fully informs clients of the unproven nature of the treatment and the potential risks. However, "it is of primary importance to respect a client's autonomy to request a referral for a service not offered by a counselor". A counselor performing conversion therapy must provide complete information about the treatment, offer referrals to gay-affirmative counselors, discuss the right of clients, understand the client's request within a cultural context, and only practice within their level of expertise.&lt;ref name="ACA News"/&gt;

[[NARTH]] stated in 2012 that refusing to offer therapy aimed at change to a client who requests it, and telling them that their only option is to claim a gay identity, could also be considered ethically unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narth.com/2012/01/narth-statement-on-sexual-orientation-change |title=Statement on Sexual Orientation Change |publisher=NARTH |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the [[British Psychological Society]] issued a position statement opposing any treatments that are based on an assumption that non-heterosexual orientations are pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bps.org.uk/system/files/images/therapies_attempting_to_change_sexual_orientation.pdf|title = Position Statement: Therapies Attempting to Change Sexual Orientation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = British Psychological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 article by the Committee on Adolescence of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated "Referral for 'conversion' or 'reparative therapy' is never indicated; therapy is not effective and may be harmful to LGBTQ individuals by increasing internalized stigma, distress, and depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Office-Based Care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth|journal=Pediatrics|volume=132|issue=1|year=2013|pages=198–203|issn=0031-4005|doi=10.1542/peds.2013-1282|pmid=23796746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: Building a Foundation for Better Understanding|date=March 31, 2011|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13128&amp;page=146|page=146|publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]]/[[National Academies Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[American Association of Christian Counselors]] amended its code of ethics to eliminate the promotion of conversion therapy for homosexuals and encouraged them to be [[celibacy|celibate]] instead.&lt;ref name="religionnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/08/04/gay-christian-celibate-changing-face-homosexuality-debate/ |title=Gay, Christian and ... celibate: The changing face of the homosexuality debate - Religion News Service |publisher=Religionnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the [[American Medical Association]]'s Journal of Ethics argues that if a pediatrician learns that parents of a 12-year-old patient seek conversion therapy, the pediatrician can advise against "the ineffective and potentially harmful intervention" while being [[Cultural competence in health care|culturally sensitive]] of their religious objections to homosexuality. The authors argue that the doctor's [[medical ethics]] means they should place the interests of the patient above the cultural sensitivities of the parents, and [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentially]] counsel the patient about resources for LGBT youth facing bullying, and advise the parents about resources for parents of LGBT children.&lt;ref name="pmid25397646"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zachariah P, Blaschke GS, Weddle M | title=A request for "conversion therapy". | journal=Virtual Mentor | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 11 | pages= 877–83 | pmid=25397646 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2014.16.11.ecas2-1411 | pmc= | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2014/11/ecas2-1411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, major therapy professional bodies in the United Kingdom issued a joint consensus statement opposing conversion therapy. Professional bodies supporting the statement included the [[United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy|UK Council for Psychotherapy]], the [[British Psychoanalytic Council]], the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]], the [[British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy]], the [[British Psychological Society]] and the National Counselling Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/UKCP_Documents/policy/Conversion%20therapy.pdf|title =Conversion therapy: a consensus statement|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160209095649/http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/UKCP_Documents/policy/Conversion%20therapy.pdf|archivedate =2016-02-09|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, with support of the UK Government's [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], a wide range of UK organisations signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) setting out an agreed framework for activities by parties concerned to help address the issues raised by the practice of conversion therapy in the UK. In addition to many of the professional bodies that previously issued the consensus statement, signatories included the UK Association of Christian Counsellors, the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]], [[NHS England]] and [[NHS Scotland]]. The signatory organisations recognised a shared commitment to protecting the public from the risks of conversion therapy. They committed to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and psychological therapists of ethical issues involved in conversion therapy and to provide training to enable therapists to support clients in distress in an appropriate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/UKCP_Documents/policy/MoU-conversiontherapy.pdf|title =Memorandum of Understanding on conversion therapy in the UK|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150123004221/http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/UKCP_Documents/policy/MoU-conversiontherapy.pdf|archivedate =2015-01-23|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International medical views===
{{See also|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]], which along with the [[DSM-IV]] is widely used internationally, states that "sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder". It lists [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] as a disorder instead, which it defines as occurring where "the gender identity or sexual preference (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or prepubertal) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it".&lt;ref name="icd"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f661 |title=ICD-10, Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders: Disorders of adult personality and behaviour |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (the North and South American branch of the World Health Organization) released a statement cautioning against services that purport to "cure" people with non-heterosexual sexual orientations as they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people, and noted that the global scientific and professional consensus is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of [[human sexuality]] and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition. The Pan American Health Organization further called on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity. The World Health Organization affiliate further noted that gay minors have sometimes been forced to attend these "therapies" involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several [[United Nations]] bodies. Additionally, the Pan American Health Organization recommended that such practices be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate [[human rights]] that are protected by international and regional agreements.&lt;ref name=PAHO&gt;{{cite web|title="Therapies" to change sexual orientation lack medical justification and threaten health |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926 |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67xKQyixE?url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926 |archivedate=May 26, 2012 |df= }} archived here .&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of theoretical models of sexual orientation in countries outside the United States that have established mental health professions often follows the history within the U.S. (although often at a slower pace), shifting from pathological to non-pathological conceptions of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Special Issue on the Mental Health Professions and Homosexuality |year=2003 |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy |volume=7 |issue=1/2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}}

====Australia====
Major medical and psychological bodies in Australia uniformly prohibit conversion therapy practices,&lt;ref name = Hack /&gt;&lt;ref name = NationalLGBTIHealthAlliance /&gt; with published statements having come from peak bodies representing psychologists,&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocPosSt /&gt; psychiatrists,&lt;ref name = RANZCP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name = RANZCP2 /&gt; and medical practitioners.&lt;ref name = AMA1 /&gt;&lt;ref name = AMA2 /&gt;  In a statement issued jointly with the College of Psychiatrists,&lt;ref name = RACP /&gt; Royal Australasian College of Physicians President Catherine Yelland summarised the view of the Australian medical community: "[g]ay conversion therapy is unethical, harmful and not supported by medical evidence."&lt;ref name = Hack /&gt;  The approaches taken by peak medical bodies is exemplified by the 2015 Australian Psychological Society Position Statement, which declares (emphasis in original) that the:
:"'''APS strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that treats lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people as disordered. The APS also strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation.'''"&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocPosSt /&gt;
The Position Statement supports this position by reference to the Society's Code of Ethics, which were adopted in 2007&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocCoE&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|title = APS Code of Ethics|publisher = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|date = September 27, 2007|accessdate = March 17, 2018|quote = The Australian Psychological Society Limited (the Society) adopted this Code of Ethics (the Code) at its Forty-First Annual General Meeting held on 27 September 2007. ...

:"(a) communicate respect for other people through their actions and language;
:(b) do not behave in a manner that, having regard to the context, may reasonably be perceived as coercive or demeaning;
:(c) respect the legal rights and moral rights of others; and
:(d) do not denigrate the character of people by engaging in conduct that demeans them as persons, or defames, or harasses them."&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocCoE /&gt;
The Position Statement explicitly states that this ethical "requirement not to discriminate and to respect clients' moral rights does not equate to a justification to treat homosexuality or bisexuality as a disorder requiring treatment,"&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocPosSt /&gt; relying on the Code of Ethics' section on propriety: "psychologists only provide psychological services within the boundaries of their professional competence [which] includes but is not restricted to ... basing their service on established knowledge of the discipline and profession of psychology".&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocCoE /&gt;  Regarding the knowledge base relating to conversion therapy, the statement is unequivocal (emphasis in original):
:"'''There is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research objectively documenting the ability to 'change' an individual’s sexual orientation. Furthermore, there is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research demonstrating that homosexuality or bisexuality constitutes a disorder.''' In addition to the lack of empirical support for the claim that sexual orientation can be changed, empirical evidence indicates that attempts at changing sexual orientation can be harmful."&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocPosSt /&gt;
The Society's position concludes by noting that it "is, of course, appropriate for psychologists to provide clinical services to clients who experience distress in regards to their sexual orientation ... [but this practice] should seek to understand ''the reasons for'' distress and how it may be alleviated. Evidence-based strategies to alleviate distress do not include attempts at changing sexual orientation, but could include challenging negative stereotypes, seeking social support, and self-acceptance, among others."&lt;ref name = AustPsychSocPosSt /&gt;

A [[Fairfax Media]] investigation in 2018 reported that "across Australia, organisations who believe that LGBTI people can or should change are hard at work.  Conversion practices are hidden in evangelical churches and ministries, taking the form of exorcisms, prayer groups or counselling disguised as pastoral care.  They're also present in some religious schools or practised in the private offices of health professionals.  They're pushed out through a thriving network of courses and mentors in the borderless world of cyberspace, cloaked in the terminology of 'self improvement' or 'spiritual healing.'"&lt;ref name = Farrah1&gt;{{cite news|title = 'I am profoundly unsettled': inside the hidden world of gay conversion therapy|first = Farrah|last = Tomazin|url = https://www.theage.com.au/national/i-am-profoundly-unsettled-inside-the-hidden-world-of-gay-conversion-therapy-20180227-p4z1xn.html|date = March 9, 2018|accessdate = March 17, 2018|newspaper = [[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of [[Pentecostalism in Australia|Pentecostal-Charismatic Churches]] found that LGBTI parishioners were faced with four options: remain closeted, come out but commit to remaining celibate, undergo conversion therapy, or leave the church... the majority took the last option, though typically only after "agonising attempts to reconcile their faith and their sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Impossible Subjects: LGBTIQ Experiences in Australian Pentecostal-Charismatic Churches|first = Mark A.

Following the Fairfax investigation, [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]] [[Daniel Andrews]] called on [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]] to support outlawing conversion therapy as part of the national mental health strategy.  Federal [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Health Minister]] [[Greg Hunt]] declared that the issue is one for the states as no Commonwealth funding goes to sexual orientation change efforts &amp;ndash; though "gay conversion ideology has been quietly pushed in schools as part of the [[National School Chaplaincy Programme|federal government's chaplaincy program]]."&lt;ref name="Farrah2"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/victoria-urges-turnbull-to-help-states-crack-down-on-gay-conversion-20180316-p4z4o4.html|title = Victoria urges Turnbull to help states crack down on gay 'conversion'|first = Farrah|last = Tomazin|newspaper = [[The Age]]|date = March 16, 2018|accessdate = March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report noted that the Victorian law applies only to people offering health services&lt;ref name="Farrah1" /&gt; and so does not catch religious groups and charities "who say they are helping same-sex attracted people to live in accordance with their faith."&lt;ref name="Farrah2" /&gt;

On June 25, 2015, a New Jersey jury found the Jewish conversion therapy organization JONAH guilty of consumer fraud in the case [[Ferguson v. JONAH|Ferguson v JONAH]] for promising to be able to change its client's sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livio|first1=Susan K.|title=Group claiming to turn gay men straight committed consumer fraud, N.J. jury says|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/06/gay_conversion_therapy_fraud_trial_verdict.html|website=NJ.com True Jersey|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 U.S. case, the [[Ninth Circuit]] addressed conversion therapy in the context of an asylum application. A Russian citizen "had been apprehended by the Russian militia, registered at a clinic as a 'suspected lesbian', and forced to undergo treatment for lesbianism, such as 'sedative drugs' and hypnosis. ... The Ninth Circuit held that the conversion treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected constituted mental and physical torture." The court rejected the argument that the treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected did not constitute persecution because they had been intended to help her, not harm her, and stated "human rights laws cannot be sidestepped by simply couching actions that torture mentally or physically in benevolent terms such as 'curing' or 'treating' the victims".&lt;ref name="Gans"&gt;{{citation |last=Gans |first=Laura A. |title=Inverts, Perverts, and Converts: Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy and Liability |date=Winter 1999 |journal=The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Slovenia]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

With 101 inhabitants per square kilometre (262/sq&amp;nbsp;mi), Slovenia ranks low among the European countries in population density (compared to 402/km² (1042/sq&amp;nbsp;mi) for the [[Netherlands]] or 195/km² (505/sq&amp;nbsp;mi) for [[Italy]]). The [[Littoral–Inner Carniola Statistical Region]] has the lowest population density while the [[Central Slovenia Statistical Region]] has the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.si/letopis/2010/30_10/30-09-10.htm|title=Napaka 404|website=www.stat.si}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2002 census, Slovenia's main ethnic group are [[Slovenes]] (83%).

==Ethnic groups==
The majority of [[Slovenia]]'s population are ethnic [[Slovenes]] (83.06%). [[Hungary|Hungarians]] and [[Italy|Italians]] have the status of indigenous minorities under the [[Constitution of Slovenia]], which guarantees them seats in the National Assembly. Most other minority groups, particularly those from other parts of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (except for one part of autochthonous community of Serbs and Croats), relocated after [[World War II]] for economic reasons.

Around 12.4% of the inhabitants of Slovenia were born abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/vsak-osmi-prebivalec-slovenije-priseljenec/246585 Vsak osmi prebivalec Slovenije priseljenec :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija]. Rtvslo.si. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to data from 2008, there were around 100,000 non-EU citizens living in Slovenia, or around 5% of the overall population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racunovodja.com/clanki.asp?clanek=4281 Odgovor na pisno poslansko vprašanje v zvezi z nastanitvijo tujcev v Sloveniji – Računovodja.com]. Racunovodja.com. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], followed by immigrants from [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kosovo]]. The number of people migrating to Slovenia has been steadily rising from 1995;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.stat.si/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=1823 Statistični urad RS – Selitveno gibanje, Slovenija, 2007].

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in Slovenia}}
Traditionally, Slovenes are predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Roman Catholic]]. Before World War II, 97% of Slovenes declared as Roman Catholics, around 2.5% were Lutheran, and only around 0.5% belonged to other denominations. Catholicism was an important feature of both social and political life in pre-Communist Slovenia. After 1945, the country underwent a process of gradual but steady [[secularization]]. After a decade of severe persecution of religions, the Communist regime adopted a policy of relative tolerance towards the churches, but limited their social functioning. After 1990, the Roman Catholic Church regained some of its former influence, but Slovenia remains a largely secularized society. According to the 2002 census, 57.8% of the population is Roman Catholic.  As elsewhere in Europe, affiliation with Roman Catholicism is dropping:  in 1991, 71.6% were self-declared Catholics, which means a drop of more than 1% annually.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Census of Population, Households and Housing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Slovenian Catholics belong to the [[Latin Rite]]. A small number of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]] live in the [[White Carniola]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lokalno.si/si/aktualno/ljudje/?id=26004 Uskoška dediščina Bele krajine na RTVS|Ljudje|Lokalno aktualno]. Lokalno.si. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a relatively small number of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] (less than 1% in 2002), the Protestant legacy is important because of its historical significance, since the bases of Slovene standard language and Slovene literature were established by the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century. Nowadays, a significant [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minority lives in the easternmost region of [[Prekmurje]], where they represent around a fifth of the population and are headed by a bishop with the seat in [[Murska Sobota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&amp;id_language=1&amp;id_meta_type=10 Predstavitev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610182949/http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&amp;id_language=1&amp;id_meta_type=10 |date=10 June 2012 }}. Evang-cerkev.si. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these two Christian denominations, a small [[History of the Jews in Slovenia|Jewish community]] has also been historically present. Despite the losses suffered during the [[Holocaust]], Judaism still numbers a few hundred adherents, mostly living in Ljubljana, site of the sole remaining active [[synagogue]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/slovenia.html|title=Slovenia Virtual Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2002 census, [[Islam]] is the second largest religious denomination with around 2.4% of the population. Most Slovenian Muslims came from [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamska-skupnost.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2|title=Islamska skupnost v Republiki Sloveniji|website=www.islamska-skupnost.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third largest denomination, with around 2.2% of the population, is [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], with most adherents belonging to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] while a minority belongs to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonian]] and other Orthodox churches.

In the 2002, around 10% of Slovenes declared themselves as [[atheists]], another 10% professed no specific denomination, and around 16% decided not answer the question about their religious affiliation. According to the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005,&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11 |accessdate=5 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524004644/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 37% of Slovenian citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", whereas 46% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 16% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".

The distribution of the residents of Slovenia by religion is the following: [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] 57.8%, [[Atheism|atheist]] 10.1%, [[Islam|Muslim]] 2.4%, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] 2.3%, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] 0.9%, other and unknown 26.5% (2002).

According to the published data from the 2002 Slovenian census, out of a total of 47,488 Muslims (2.4% of the total population) 2,804 Muslims (5.90% of the total Muslims in Slovenia) declared themselves as ethnic [[Slovenian Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stat.si/popis2002/en/rezultati/rezultati_red.asp?ter=SLO&amp;st=57 |title=Population by religion and ethnic affiliation, Slovenia, 2002 Census |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dendermonde nursery attack''' was a [[stabbing]] attack on the ''Fabeltjesland'' [[Day care|daycare centre]] in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] village of [[Sint-Gillis-bij-Dendermonde]] in [[Dendermonde]], [[Belgium]], at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Central European Time|CET]] (9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[UTC]]) on 23 January 2009. Three people were stabbed to death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Belgie/article/detail/636066/2009/01/23/Drie-doden-bij-steekpartij-Dendermonde-gewonden-buiten-levensgevaar.dhtml Het Laatste Nieuws, (Belgium)]&lt;/ref&gt; and twelve were mutilated in the attack.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE50M3A720090123|title=Three die in Belgian child care center attack|last=van de Velde|first=Antonia|date=2009-01-23|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspect has been linked to a separate murder of an elderly lady and police have suggested he was plotting more nursery attacks. The daycare centre where the initial attack occurred is expected never to reopen.&lt;ref name="Thousands mourn murdered children"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/europe/thousands-mourn-murdered-children-1614338.html|title=Thousands mourn murdered children|date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2009-01-25|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
'''Kim de Gelder''', a 20-year-old [[Belgian]] from [[Sint-Niklaas|Sinaai]], entered the ''Fabeltjesland'' nursery through an unlocked side-door, claiming that he had a question to ask. He then entered one of the rooms and began attacking small children before moving to another room.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; The man was reported to be wearing black-and-white makeup with his hair vividly colored red, similar to that of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] from the ''Batman'' films (who, however, has green hair and white and red facial features).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Auteur: Steven De Bock |url=http://www.standaard.be/Krant/Tekst/Artikel.aspx?artikelId=4G25ITTG |title=De Standaard Online - Dader lacht gruwel weg |publisher=Standaard.be |date=2009-01-24 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gelder's attorney, Jaak Haentjens, later formally denied any link to "the Joker", attributing the claims of face paint to De Gelder's pale skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/3484/Drama-Dendermonde/article/detail/644263/2009/01/27/Psychiater-vond-gedwongen-opname-De-Gelder-niet-nodig.dhtml |title=''HLN Drama Dendermonde - Advocaat wil diepgaand onderzoek psychiatrisch verleden De Gelder'' (644263) |publisher=Hln.be |date= |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gelder was, in the eyes of his friends and colleagues, a silent boy, who never said anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auteur: mcu, me, kld |url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF27012009_042 |title=De Standaard Online - 'Ouders De Gelder vroegen al opname psychiatrie' |publisher=Standaard.be |date= |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports on Belgian television suggested that five people had been killed and twenty others had been injured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/23/Five_reported_dead_in_knife_attack/UPI-53301232713073/ |title=Five reported dead in knife attack |date=2009-01-23 |publisher=UPI |accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with government officials only confirming the death of one adult and one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/4322233/Five-dead-in-knife-attack-at-Belgian-crèche.html |title=Five dead in knife attack at Belgian crèche |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Nick |last=Squires}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number was later increased, as another infant had died from the injuries he had sustained. It has also been reported that some of the surviving children have needed [[plastic surgery]] due to serious mutilations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Arrest and aftermath==
A massive search operation was mounted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/23/europe/23belgium-cndattack-414345.php|title=3 killed in knife attack at Belgian day-care center |last=Castle|first=Stephen|date=2009-01-23|publisher=IHT|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a man was captured by police a short while later, in the nearby town of [[Lebbeke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aGQd9uQnD_IM&amp;refer=europe|title=Two Babies, One Adult Die in Belgian Nursery Attack (Update1) |last=Martens|first=John|date=2009-01-23|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been wounded during his capture, the man was taken to a hospital in [[Aalst, Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6714327 |title=3 Dead, 10 Wounded in Belgium Day Care Stabbings |last=Lekic |first=Slobodan |date=2009-01-23 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203092420/http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6714327 |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that he was carrying a list of nurseries, of which they suspect he may have been planning to attack as well.&lt;ref name="Belgian 'admits crèche murders'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7853011.stm|title=Belgian 'admits crèche murders'|date=2009-01-27|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor of Dendermonde, Piet Buyse, said, "The victims are being cared for and those who were not injured have been brought to a centre where they are receiving counseling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPx9B0ffbpUB4qboVaMcORcXp2NA|title=Three killed in knife attack at Belgian crèche|date=2009-01-23|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a press conference on the evening of the attack, public prosecutor Christian Du Four provided the following information about the alleged offender, denying several early rumours:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5572617.ece|title=Babies and adult killed in knife attack at Belgian nursery|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=The Times | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Belgie/article/detail/636066/2009/01/23/Drie-doden-bij-steekpartij-Dendermonde-gewonden-buiten-levensgevaar.dhtml Het Laatste Nieuws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/europe/knife-attacker-murders-nursery-children-1612694.html|title=Knife attacker murders nursery children|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 6,000 people marched through Dendermonde on 25 January 2009, laying hundreds of bouquets and stuffed animals outside the daycare centre as the Mayor of Dendermonde, Piet Buyse, announced that the ''Fabeltjesland'' nursery would never reopen.&lt;ref name="Thousands mourn murdered children" /&gt;

==The attacker==
De Gelder was identified as the attacker on 25 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=3G25J9T0 ''Duizend vragen, maar dader zwijgt'']{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130024931/http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?articleID=3G25J9T0 |date=2009-01-30 }}, ''Nieuwsblad.be'' (January 25, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; De Gelder confided in his attorney, stating that he had been troubled by depression as a teenager and at one point heard voices in his head. Regardless, a psychiatrist had concluded that he did not need to be sent to a mental institution.&lt;ref name="Belgian 'admits crèche murders'"/&gt;

On 26 January 2009, Belgian officials named De Gelder as the primary suspect in a further, fourth murder, where a 73-year-old woman was stabbed to death in her apartment in [[Beveren]], near [[Antwerp]], on 16 January. Prosecutor Christian Du Four told journalists that there were "very clear indications of links between the murders",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7851235.stm|title=Belgian 'linked to fourth murder' |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2009-01-26 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; though De Gelder denies any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/01/27/belgian-daycare.html|title=Belgian admits to daycare killings, denies link to separate homicide |date=2009-01-27|accessdate=2009-01-27|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police have stated that he was planning attacks on other nurseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0126/belgium.html |title=Crèche suspect accused of another death |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January, De Gelder admitted to the attacks.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7853011.stm | work=BBC News | title=Belgian 'admits creche murders' | date=2009-01-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media originally reported that De Gelder was wearing makeup at the time of the attack, making him look like the Joker, but police have not confirmed that depiction.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt; In further media reports, De Gelder reportedly watched ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' an unusually high number of times ("film obsession"),&lt;ref name="telegraphquoted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/4344710/Belgian-crèche-stabbings-suspect-quoted-Heath-Ledger.html|title=Belgian creche stabbings: suspect quoted Heath Ledger|last=Waterfield|first=Bruno|date=2009-01-26|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date= |via=|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears to have quoted the character [[Harvey Dent]] at the start of the attack. Both police investigators and De Gelder's lawyer have made statements dismissing such as relevant to his motive in the attack.

De Gelder's attorneys argued that he was [[schizophrenic]] and therefore could not be held fully accountable for his actions. Psychiatrists believed that De Gelder was faking psychosis and instead diagnosed him with [[schizotypal personality disorder]] with [[antisocial personality disorder|psychopathic]] traits and [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] features. The College of Psychiatrists concluded the De Gelder was mentally ill but sane, and was in control of his actions when he committed the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20130315_012|title=Waarom Kim De Gelder toerekeningsvatbaar is 'Kim De Gelder wist wat hij deed en deed wat hij wou' |publisher=Nieuwsblad|date=March 15, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economics sidebar}}

An '''economist''' is a practitioner in the [[social sciences|social science]] discipline of [[economics]].

The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about [[economic policy]]. Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[theory|theories]] to the focused study of minutiae within specific [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] analysis, [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] analysis or [[financial statement analysis]], involving analytical methods and tools such as [[econometrics]], [[statistics]], [[Computational economics|economics computational model]]s, [[financial economics]], [[mathematical finance]] and [[mathematical economics]].

==In academia==
The professionalization of economics, reflected in academia, has been described as "the main change in economics since around 1900."&lt;ref&gt;[[Orley Ashenfelter|O. Ashenfelter]] (2001), "Economics: Overview", The Profession of Economics, ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 6, p. 4159.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists debate the path they believe their profession should take.  It is, primarily, a debate between a scholastic orientation, focused on mathematical techniques, and a public discourse orientation, which is more focused on communicating to lay people pertinent economic principles as they relate to [[public policy]].  Surveys among economists indicate a preference for a shift toward the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first= William L. |title=Preference Falsification in the Economics Profession|date=August 2004|url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/DavisCharacterIssuesAugust2004.pdf|format=PDF|website=www.econjournalwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major universities have an economics faculty, school or department, where [[academic degree]]s are awarded in economics. Getting a PhD in economics takes six years, on average, with a median of 5.3 years.&lt;ref&gt;Siegried JF, Stock WA. (2001).

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], established by [[Sveriges Riksbank]] in 1968, is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field of economics. The prize winners are announced in October every year.

Economists work in many fields including academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also "...study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=56 Economist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, to be called an economist requires a Ph.D. degree in Economics. In the US government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus.&lt;ref name="http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/standards/IORs/gs0100/0110.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economist Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/Life-Physical-and-Social-Science/Economists.htm|title=Economists :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in [[bank]]ing, [[finance]], [[accountancy]], [[commerce]], [[marketing]], [[management|business administration]], [[lobbying]] and non- or not-for profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-jobs.com/|title=Economics Jobs and Economist Jobs - Econ-Jobs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politician]]s often consult economists before enacting economic [[policy]]. Many statesmen have academic degrees in economics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==By country==
Economics [[Alumnus|graduate]]s are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and [[labour economics|labour market]] conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to [[communication|communicate]] and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the [[university]] or [[college]]. Whilst only a few{{how many|date=July 2016}} economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} many find it a base for entry into a career in [[finance]] – including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or [[management]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector – for example, in the health and education sectors, or in [[government]] and [[politics]]. Small numbers{{how many|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} go on to undertake postgraduate studies, either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, unlike most countries in the world where the profession is not regulated, the profession of Economist is regulated by Law. 1411 of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of economist, according to the said law, is exclusive to the bachelors in economics graduates in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coreconrs.org.br/area-de-atuacao.html|title=Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista CORECON|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Economists salary.png|thumb|300px|Economist salaries by educational attainment.&lt;ref name = "Pay Scale, US income of Economists"/&gt;]]
According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000 the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ US Bureau of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430185238/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ |date=April 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 135 colleges and universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AEA/gradstudents/Schools.htm|title=Subscription Application}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2016}} grant around 900 new [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists' salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.&lt;ref name="Pay Scale, US income of Economists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Ph.D._Economics/Salary|title=Pay Scale, US income of Economists|accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The largest single professional grouping of economists in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are the more than 1000 members of the [[Government Economic Service]], who work in 30 government departments and agencies.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Analysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from [[Newcastle University]] to the [[London School of Economics]]), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation – with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This figure compares very favourably with the national picture, with 64 percent of economics graduates in employment.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====1945 (original members)====
The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] ([[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) and a majority of the other signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/unhistory/| title=History of the United Nations| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 51 original members (or founding members) joined that year; 50 of them signed the Charter at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]] on 26 June 1945, while [[Provisional Government of National Unity|Poland]], which was not represented at the conference, signed it on 15 October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/founders.shtml| title=Founding Member States| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6031">In the {{nihongo|'''Girard incident'''|ジラード事件|Jirādo jiken}} of 1957, a [[Japan]]ese housewife named Naka Sakai was shot and killed by an American soldier, William S. Girard.

On January 30, 1957, the 46-year-old Sakai was collecting scrap metal on a [[U.S. Army]] [[shooting range]] in [[Soumagahara]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], Japan. Sakai, a mother of six, earned a living selling [[scrap]] metal, and had entered the Army area for the purpose of collecting spent rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]. Specialist Third Class Girard, a 21-year-old enlisted man from [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]], [[Illinois]], used a [[grenade launcher]] mounted on an M1 rifle to fire an empty casing at Sakai, which killed her.&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;Harnisch, Larry. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2007/06/soldier_kills_w.html "Soldier kills woman"], ''Los Angeles Times'', retrieved November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition and controversy==

The strong Japanese outcry over the killing led to a [[jurisdiction]]al dispute between the Japanese authorities and the U.S. Army.  The Army maintained that Girard had acted while on duty and was thus under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts, while the Japanese government held that Girard's actions had taken place during a period of rest, making him subject to Japanese law.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;  Girard had been assigned to guard a [[machine gun]] at the firing range in between sessions of target practice; the Japanese contention was that since Girard had not fired a weapon during exercises, he could not be considered as actively on duty.  Eventually, Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]] ruled that Girard's specific action "was not authorized", and he was turned over for trial.&lt;ref name = "Time2"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809950,00.html "The Girard Case"], ''Time'', October 7, 1957, retrieved December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Girard appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, but the Court [[Wilson v. Girard|rejected his request for intervention]].

American response to Girard's extradition was largely negative.  Relatives and supporters in his Illinois hometown drummed up 182 feet of signatures for a petition decrying the decision, the [[American Legion]] protested vociferously, the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] said that Girard had been "sold down the river", Senator [[John Bricker]] of Ohio called the decision a matter of "sacrificing an American soldier to appease Japanese public opinion", and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' summed up its feelings in a headline: "To the Wolves, Soldier".&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Time2"/&gt;  In the midst of the uproar, the ''[[New York Times]]'', fearing that American reaction was eroding the good will earned in Asia by the initial decision to extradite, published an article lauding the positive interactions between most U.S. soldiers and Japanese civilians, including photographs of soldiers celebrating [[Christmas]] with a Japanese family while clothed in traditional Japanese attire.&lt;ref name = "Shibusawa"/&gt;

==Trial==

At the trial, a Japanese witness for the prosecution asserted that Girard had yelled a warning to Sakai before firing, but Girard himself denied ever having done so, a statement which shocked and mystified observers.&lt;ref name = "Time1"/&gt;  According to testimony from Victor Nickel, a soldier of the same rank who had accompanied him, Girard had lured Sakai and other scavengers toward his position by tossing empty casings out onto the range, then fired at Sakai "for a joke".&lt;ref name = "Time1"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809950,00.html "The Girard Case (Contd.)"], ''Time'', October 7, 1957, retrieved December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;   Girard claimed that the death had been an accident.&lt;ref name="Shibusawa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shibusawa |first=Naoko |title=America's Geisha Ally: Reimagining the Japanese Enemy |publisher=Dar al-Hayan|isbn=0-674-02348-X |page=371 (endnote) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge, Yuzo Kawachi, went so far as to visit the scene of the incident himself, and pronounced himself "baffled" by the discrepancies in Girard's account of events.  However, he stated that he could find "no evidence of deliberate murder", and Girard was handed only a three-year [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref name = "Time1"/&gt;  He was also demoted to [[Private (rank)|private]] status by the U.S. Army as a result of his actions; had he been found guilty of murder, he would have been [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]].&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Girard, who was recorded as having an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] of 90, was held in little regard by his fellow soldiers, widely viewed as a "bumpkin clown" who drank to excess and ran up debts at various Japanese establishments.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt; After his trial, he went home to America with his Taiwan-born Japanese bride, Haru "Candy" Sueyama, and was repeatedly booed by fellow servicemen during his return trip.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;

Sakai's widowed husband, Akikichi, and his six children were compensated with US $1,748.32 (US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1748.32|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for their loss, but this monetary offer was perceived as an attempt to buy off justice by many Japanese, and Akikichi stated to U.S. authorities that "I do not thank you for it." &lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;

'''Helen Grace Reswick Scott Keenan''' (June 16, 1915 — November 20, 1987), more commonly, '''Helen Grace Scott''', was a [[United States]] citizen employed in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and later the Office of U.S Chief Counsel for Prosecution of [[List of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes|Axis War Criminals]] on the staff of Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] during [[World War II]]. She was also a broadcaster for [[Free France]] in [[Brazzaville]], and later in life, as '''Helen G. Scott''', was a close associate of [[François Truffaut]] and other French filmmakers.

==Early life==
Helen Grace Reswick was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the daughter of William Reswick and Bessie Schwartz Reswick.  She and her brothers were raised in [[Paris]], where their father worked as a journalist with the [[Associated Press]]. William Reswick, who was born in Ukraine, was also a correspondent in Moscow from 1922 to 1934, and wrote a memoir of his time there.&lt;ref&gt;"William Reswick, News Writer, 64; Former Reporter in Moscow Had Worked with Hoover, Baruch, and Otto Kahn" ''New York Times'' (June 3, 1954): 27. via [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was fluent in English and French from childhood.&lt;ref name="CTObit" &gt;Vincent Canby, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-12-03-8703300814-story.html "Helen Scott's Death Grieves Film World"] ''Chicago Tribune'' (December 3, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Reswick was a radio broadcaster for [[Free France]], based in [[Brazzaville]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Bergstrom, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ePMxuoC5kTYC&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;ots=CIo0YC0T_N&amp;dq=Brazzaville%20Helen%20G.%20Scott&amp;pg=PA392#v=onepage&amp;q=Brazzaville%20Helen%20G.%20Scott&amp;f=false "Lost in Translation? Listening to the Hitchcock-Truffaut Interview"] in Thomas Leitch and Leland Poague, eds., ''A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons 2011): 392-394. {{ISBN|9781444397314}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she was a press attache to Justice Robert H. Jackson at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. She was recognized later for her wartime work: in 1965, the France Libre medal, and in 1986 she was named a "Chevalier De l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres".&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/24/obituaries/helen-g-scott-72-writer-for-truffaut-and-other-directors.html "Helen G. Scott, 72, Writer for Truffaut and Other Directors"] ''New York Times'' (November 24, 1987): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged spy activities==
Between 1933 and 1938, Helen Scott served on the Executive Committee of the [[Workers Alliance]], a [[Comintern]] affiliate front organization. In 1944, she worked for Congressman Boulton. Keenan had been a freelance journalist in the 1930s before beginning work in the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (OCIAA) as a writer and editor in 1945. She first worked for the New York line of [[KGB]], then later the [[Washington, D.C.]] branch of the KGB. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Venona===
Helen Grace Scott Keenan's code name in Soviet intelligence, and later as deciphered by the [[Venona project]] is "Fir" (or "Spruce").  "Firtree" and "El" also occurred.  Keenan is referenced in the following Venona decryptions:

*326 :KGB Moscow to New York, April 5, 1945;
*3614–3615: KGB Washington to Moscow, June 22, 1945.

==Later career==
Scott worked as a senior editor at the [[United Nations]] headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Palà, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aVx0CQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=Brazzaville%20Helen%20Scott&amp;pg=PT152#v=onepage&amp;q=Brazzaville%20Helen%20Scott&amp;f=false ''The Way it Was''] (2015). {{ISBN|9781491766323}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1959 to 1965 at the French Film Office in New York, as director of public relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-26/news/mn-24609_1_french-directors "Passings: Helen G. Scott, French Arts Figure"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 26, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with many French and American filmmakers in this role, including [[Robert Benton]], [[Milos Forman]], [[Jacques Tati]], [[Alain Resnais]], and  [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. She wrote the English subtitles of French-language films, including ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon of the Spring]]'' and ''[[Jean de Florette]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt;

She assisted François Truffaut as the interpreter in his conversations with [[Alfred Hitchcock]],&lt;ref name="CTObit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; using both her language skills and her specialized knowledge of film.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottlieb, "Hitchcock on Truffaut" ''Film Quarterly'' 66(4)(Summer 2013): 10-22. DOI: 10.1525/fq.2013.66.4.10 via [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; She collaborated with Truffaut in writing the resulting book, ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;François Truffaut in collaboration with Helen G. Scott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0YhcgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Helen+G.+Scott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEseaJruDdAhWUFTQIHbBJC3kQ6AEILzAB ''Hitchcock''] (Simon and Schuster 1967). {{ISBN|9780586086537}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote additional dialogue for Truffaut's ''Fahrenheit 451'' (1966), and was among the writers nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] when that film was a finalist for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1967-hugo-awards/ 1967 Hugo Awards], The Hugo Awards official website.&lt;/ref&gt; She translated another book of Truffaut's, ''The Adventures of Antoine Doinel'' (1971). Scott was Truffaut's confidante, and their correspondence offers insight into his personal life and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine de Baecque, Serge Toubiana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a2H0AiDn4XIC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=Free%20French%20Helen%20Scott&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=Free%20French%20Helen%20Scott&amp;f=false ''François Truffaut''] (University of California Press 2000): 198, 208, 226. {{ISBN|9780520225244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott appeared in uncredited cameos in Godard's ''[[Weekend (1967 film)|Weekend]]'' (1967) and Truffaut's ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed &amp; Board]]'' (1970). She also appears in archival footage in the 2015 documentary ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut (film)|Hitchcock/Truffaut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Travers, [https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/hitchcock-truffaut-104244/ "Hitchcock/Truffaut"] ''Rolling Stone'' (December 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Helen G. Scott was divorced. She died in [[Paris]] in 1987, aged 72 years, from a heart attack.&lt;ref name="CTObit" /&gt; Her gravesite is in [[Montmartre Cemetery]], not far from Truffaut's.

'''The IATP Food and Society Fellows Program''' provides two-year, part-time fellowships to professionals working to address health, social justice, economic viability, environmental, and other issues in food and farming systems. The program started in 2001 as a collaboration between the [[Jefferson Institute]] and the [[Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy]] (IATP), with the guidance and support of the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]]. The program is currently administered by IATP  and funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Woodcock Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodcockfdn.org&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, 8-12 fellows are selected each year; 72 fellows have been selected through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iatp.org Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandsocietyfellows.org/about Food and Society Fellows: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The goals of the Food &amp; Society Policy Fellows Program are to:

{{quote|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">Following a series of disputes regarding the participation of [[indigenous peoples]] in the Panama UN-REDD National Programme, the National Coordinating Body of the Indigenous Peoples of Panama (COONAPIP) announced their withdrawal from the climate change mitigation program on February 25, 2013.&lt;ref name=PRISMA&gt;Cuellar, Nelson, Susan Kandel, Andrew Davis and Fausto Luna. “[http://www.prisma.org.sv/uploads/media/Indigenous_peoples_and_governance_in_REDD__readiness_in_Panama.pdf PRISMA Report Indigenous Peoples and Governance in REDD+ Readiness in Panama: Case Study on COONAPIP, ANAM and the UN-REDD Program]”. [http://www.prisma.org.sv/ The PRISMA Foundation]. Retrieved July 7th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; COONAPIP, which brings together the country´s seven indigenous peoples and their 12 traditional indigenous representative structures, cited a failure to ensure guarantees of respect for indigenous rights and the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples, and a breach of agreements made during the process of the program´s approval.&lt;ref name=PRISMA /&gt; In March 2013, the Panama UN-REDD National Programme was suspended pending the results of an independent investigation and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.un-redd.org/Newsletter36/Safeguards_and_MultipleBenefits/tabid/106077/Default.aspx|title=UN-REDD Launches Independent Evaluation of National Programme in Panama” UN-REDD Programme}} Retrieved July 5th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was highlighted as an important development in the broader context of global policy efforts to implement initiatives to [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation]] (REDD+), which were at the time grappling with issues around the participation of indigenous peoples and forest communities in related initiatives, including the implementation of Free, Prior and Informed Consent.&lt;ref name=PRISMA /&gt; Preliminary results of an independent investigation and evaluation commissioned by the UN-REDD Programme were published,&lt;ref&gt;“Preliminary Report of the Independent Investigation and Evaluation Presented to the UN-REDD Policy Board” UN-REDD Programme. Retrieved July 11th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a study of the conflict by a Central American non-governmental research center.&lt;ref name=PRISMA /&gt;

In December 2013, the Panama UN-REDD National Programme was reopened following agreement between the Panama Government, through its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), and indigenous peoples, through the National Coordinating Entity of Indigenous Peoples in Panama (COONAPIP). This was realized through extensive consultations between ANAM and COONAPIP to resolve issues and develop an Environmental Agenda between indigenous peoples and the ANAM, which includes a revised result framework of the UN-REDD National Joint Programme of Panama. The General Assembly of COONAPIP, which took place on 29 November 2013 in Playa Muerto, in the Darien province of Panama, approved the Environmental Agenda jointly developed between ANAM and COONAPIP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-redd.org|title=Update: Panama Government and indigenous peoples in Panama agree to reopen UN-REDD National Programme|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the reopening of the National Programme in Panama, Candido Mezua, President of COONAPIP said, "We feel satisfied that the process followed with ANAM will help us to correct issues, and COONAPIP is going to engage again in the Programme." He added, "It is time to trust again".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mezua emphasized that REDD+ had to be conducted with full respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, asking for the support of UN agencies to ensure that rights such as free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) are respected and appropriate grievance mechanisms are made available for indigenous peoples. He further underscored the complexities and nuances of REDD+ and offered COONAPIP's contribution to national REDD+ efforts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In December 2013, UN-REDD Programme Policy Board congratulated Panama on its progress towards resolving the differences with the National Coordinating Body of Indigenous Peoples in Panama (COONAPIP) and announced the approval of a no-cost extension of Panama's National UN-REDD Programme until June 2015. The extension was approved together with a review of the new results framework of the Programme and with the full agreement of COONAPIP, who co-presented on a panel with the Government of Panama's National Environment Authority (ANAM) at the Eleventh Meeting of the UN-REDD Programme Policy Board, which took place from 9-10 December 2013 in Geneva.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The UN-REDD Programme Policy Board, composed of representatives of partner countries, indigenous peoples and civil society, donor countries and UN agencies, was deeply appreciative of progress made in Panama and of the joint efforts of COONAPIP, ANAM and the UN-REDD Programme to resolve the conflict. Members noted that the experiences in Panama provided valuable lessons for other REDD+ countries and highlighted the importance of strong stakeholder engagement processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He currently lives on his 50-acre, wooded ranch in [[Trinidad, Texas]]. He was involved in the longest-running law enforcement standoff in American history, lasting a few days short of 15 years, before the district attorney dropped the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny |agency= |title=Lesson for Stalemated Sides in Oregon: A Texas Standoff Without End |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/us/lesson-for-stalemated-sides-in-oregon-a-texas-standoff-without-end.html |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 7, 2016 |accessdate=2016-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standoff began when Gray [[jump bail|jumped bail]] after being indicted on two counts of felony assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/john-joe-grays-militant-group-texas-compound/story?id=9819578 |title=John Joe Gray's Militant Group in Texas Compound |author=Terry Moran |publisher=ABC News |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a traffic stop in [[Anderson County, Texas|Anderson County]], he allegedly attacked Texas Trooper Jim Cleland.

'''Kendall Carroll''' was shot March 19, 2013, just two weeks after the fatal [[Albuquerque Police Department]] (APD) shooting of [[Parrish Dennison]]. Kendall and his brother were both involved in an officer stand off. The stand off lasted for more than four hours. Michael the younger brother surrendered midway while Kendall continued on.  State police sniper Shane Todd fired the lethal shot to end the stand off.

Throughout the altercation police threw tear gas into the apartment that the men were shooting at them from. Police were originally called to the scene because Kendall was a suspect in an earlier shooting which involved wounding an APD officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohmann|first1=Patrick|last2=Procter|first2=Jeff|title=New details in yesterday's SWAT standoff,police shooting|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/180341/news/state-police-kill-man-in-abq-standoff.html|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=ABQ Journal|publisher=ABQ Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead paint''' or '''lead-based paint''' is [[paint]] containing [[lead]]. As pigment, [[lead(II) chromate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Chromium|Cr]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[chrome yellow]]"), [[Lead(II,IV) oxide]], ([[Lead|Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "red lead"), and [[lead(II) carbonate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Carbon|C]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[white lead]]") are the most common forms.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Völz, Hans G.

It is one of the main health and [[environmental issues with paint|environmental hazards associated with paint]]. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE57O64G20090825 | work=Reuters | title=Lead-laden paint still widely sold around the world | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas countries such as the [[Lead-based paint in the United States|U.S.]] and the [[Lead-based paint in the United Kingdom|UK]] have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
[[White lead|Lead white]] was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described by [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Vitruvius]] and the ancient Greek author [[Theophrastus]].

The traditional method making the pigment was called the stack process. Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either [[tan bark]] or cow [[feces]]. The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments, but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar. The lead was usually coiled into a spiral, and placed on a ledge inside the pot. The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead, which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the [[fermentation]] of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot.   Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan, then another layer of pots. the heat created by the fermentation, [[acetic acid]] vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work, and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead.  This crust was separated from the lead, washed and ground for pigment.  This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen.  Medieval texts warned of the danger of "[[apoplexy]], [[epilepsy]], and paralysis" from working with lead white.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the risks, the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity; a small amount could cover a large surface. It was widely used by artists until the 19th century, when it was replaced by [[zinc white]] and [[titanium white]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2000), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dangers of lead paint were considered well-established by the beginning of the 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, [[Sherwin-Williams]] reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint "poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors".&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066401898;view=1up;seq=110 |title=Dangers of White Lead |last1=Guenther |first1=Richard |date=1904-02-24 |website=[[Hathitrust]] |publisher=Sherwin Williams Co. |accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1886, German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and [[lead sugar]].&lt;ref name=ayass&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ayaß |editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor1-link=:de:Wolfgang Ayaß |date=1999-01-01 |title=Quellensammlung zur Geschichte der deutschen Sozialpolitik 1867 bis 1914, II.

==Toxicity==
{{further|Lead poisoning}}
[[File:Lead Paint - cracking and flaking.jpg|thumb|right|Lead paint can crack and form flakes, which can contaminate the surrounding environment.]]
Lead paint is hazardous. It can cause [[nervous system]] damage, stunted growth, [[kidney]] damage, and delayed development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=93&amp;tid=22|title=ToxFAQs™ for Lead|date=August 2007|last=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|publisher=Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet,{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death.

==Regulation==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=May 2012}}
The [[European Union]] has passed a directive controlling lead paint use.

In Canada, regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture, household products, children's products, and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5% by weight.&lt;ref name="healthcanada-leadfaq"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/lead-plomb/asked_questions-questions_posees-eng.php Some Commonly Asked Questions About Lead and Human Health], Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; New regulations on surface coating materials, which came into force in 2005, further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers. Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead and Health|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603023707/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|archivedate=3 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a Canadian company, Dominion Colour Corporation, is "the largest manufacturer of lead-based paint pigments in the world" and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the [[European Chemicals Agency]] to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-company-s-lead-based-products-a-danger-to-world-health-critics-say-1.3340853 |title=Toronto company's lead-based products a danger to world health, critics say |last=Fowler |first=Jennifer |date=1 December 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings (16 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 1303), along with toys and furniture containing lead paint. The cited reason was "to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77096.html|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|title=CPSC Announces Final Ban On Lead-Containing Paint|date=2 September 1977|last=Office of Information and Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819015700/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtml77/77096.html|archivedate=19 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For manufacturers, the CPSC instituted the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008]], which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06% to 0.009% starting August 14, 2009.  In 2018 the State of Delaware banned the use of lead paint on outdoor structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?legislationId=26820|title=HB 456 AN ACT TO AMEND TITLES 14, 16, 17, 26, AND 29 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO THE USE OF LEAD PAINTS ON OUTDOOR STRUCTURES.|last=State of Delaware|first=General Assembly|date=29 August 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified. EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities. It requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities and pre-schools (any child occupied facility) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/getleadsafe/|title=U.S. EPA Renovation, Repair and Painting Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there are an estimated 37 million homes and apartments with lead paint in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Charles |url=https://undark.org/article/lead-testing-child-blood-levels/ |title=America’s Misguided War on Childhood Lead Exposures |work=Undark |date=2018-03-21 |accessdate=2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines banned lead paint in 2013, but in 2017, 15% of the paint still was not certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mogensen|first1=Jackie Flynn|title=You’ll Probably Never Save as Many Lives as This Guy Who Got the Philippines to Stop Using Lead Paint|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/04/youll-probably-never-save-as-many-lives-as-this-guy-who-got-the-philippines-to-stop-using-lead-paint/|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead paint is not prohibited in India. A 2015 study found that over 31% of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million (ppm), which far exceeds the [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]] standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Over 31 percent paints have alarming levels of lead: study |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/over-31-percent-paints-have-alarming-levels-of-lead-study/ |journal=[[Press Trust of India]] |via=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2016|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the Hazardous Substances Act of 2009 classifies lead as a hazardous substance and limits its use in paint to 600 parts per million (ppm). A proposed amendment will modify this to 90 ppm, thereby almost completely eradicating lead from paint. The amendment would also include all industrial paints, which were previously excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/proposed-amendment-to-legislation-set-to-eliminate-lead-in-paint-2018-06-15|title=Proposed amendment to legislation set to eliminate lead in paint|last=Bulbulia|first=Tasneem|work=Engineering News|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead paint in art==

===Oil paints===
In art, [[white lead|white lead paint]] is known as "flake white" or "Cremnitz white". It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to [[oil paint]]s. Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong, flexible paint film. Lead-based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments. It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century, when zinc-white and titanium-white became available.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ralph|title=The artist's handbook of materials and techniques|year=1991|publisher=Viking|location=New York City|isbn=0670837016|edition=5. ed., rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrially produced lead white, the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban, was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms, which had larger "flake" particles that conferred ease of handling.

Titanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications.  Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions, such as the EU.  However, lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling, mixing, and structural qualities.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"/&gt;

Flake white has various drawbacks, including a tendency to become transparent over time. It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants, although this can be reversed.

===Water-based paints===
Lead is not a traditional pigment in water mediums, as zinc is superior for works on paper, as is [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) for [[frescos]]. Lead-based paints, when used on paper, often cause the work to become discolored after long periods of time; the paint's lead carbonate reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the air and with acids, which often come from fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume= 4

==Substitutes==

===Titanium===
Paint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute, [[titanium white]] (based on the pigment [[titanium dioxide]]), which was first used in paints in the 19th century. Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a [[food coloring]] and in [[toothpaste]]. It is also a common ingredient in [[sunscreen]]. When used in paints today, it is often coated with [[silicon]] or [[aluminum oxide]]s for durability. Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white, and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully.  Titanium white has been criticized for leading to "chalkiness" in mixtures, and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high [[refractive index]].

===Zinc===
[[Zinc white]] is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white. It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency.  Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors, its structural soundness in oils has been debated. Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film.  Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination, even when used sparingly.&lt;ref name="naturalpigments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc White –  Problems in Oil Paint?|url=http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|publisher=Natural Pigments LLC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206110619/http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|archivedate=2011-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stroud gained the permission of the Warden at [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz Penitentiary]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to write a history of the U.S. prison system. Stroud had been incarcerated at [[McNeil Island]], [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary]], [[Alcatraz Island]] and lastly at the [[Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield|United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]]. Stroud interviewed inmates, guards and administrative personnel at all those prisons. He also researched the written records on all of the other U.S. federal penitentiaries.

When Stroud finished his manuscript, he asked permission from the Warden at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at [[Springfield, Missouri]], to send his manuscript to prospective publishers. The Springfield Warden sent his request to the Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] who refused Stroud's request to offer his manuscript for publication. The Director said that Stroud's manuscript aroused prurient interest in homosexual activity and slandered the reputation of some guards, whom Stroud described as sadistic, and libeled some wardens, whom Stroud described as incompetent or corrupt.

[[Charles Dudley Martin]] of [[Missouri]] represented Stroud in his lawsuit against the Warden of United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. When Stroud died, (the day before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated), the judge ordered Stroud's manuscripts to be impounded in custody of the Clerk for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]] at Kansas City. The [[Probate Court]] of the State of Missouri for [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] at Kansas City appointed Mr. Martin as administrator of Stroud's hand written will.

When Mr. Martin presented his letters of administration to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and moved for custody of Stroud's manuscripts, the Bureau of Prisons dropped their objections after a hail of public criticism. The U.S. District Court then ordered the manuscripts delivered to the offices of Mr. Martin as administrator of Robert Stroud's estate.

An experienced [[literary agent]] in [[New York City]] was then retained, who offered a copy of ''Looking Outward'' to several New York publishers. Although they praised the manuscript, they declined to publish it. The prisoners, guards and wardens described by Stroud were at that time still alive. Only Stroud, who was dead, and his prisoner witnesses, who were scattered, could verify the claims of abuse and corruption. All of the publishers approached declined to publish Stroud's manuscript, fearing civil suits for publication of defamatory writings, along with potential civil damage suits for libel.

As of the 26th of December 2007, Mr. Martin still had Stroud's manuscript of ''Looking Outward'' in his possession, together with Stroud's hand written autobiography ''Bobbie''.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/01/30/birdman-of-alcatraz-robert-stroud/5054535/ |title='Birdman of Alcatraz' publishes book long after death |last=Goodwin|first=Juliana |date=2014-01-30 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Martin also has the hand written notes of [[Thomas E. Gaddis]], who wrote the biography and screen play of ''Birdman of Alcatraz''.

==Fate of Stroud's manuscripts==
With the court orders removing them from custody of the U. S. District Court and transferring them to Mr. Martin as the administrator of Stroud's estate, together with Thomas Gaddis's notes of ''Birdman of Alcatraz'', Mr. Martin has consigned the manuscript and partnered with Springfield, MO author; JE Cornwell. Together they will try to attract a major publishing company to publish the manuscript into four books. Mr. Martin also intends to put the original hand written manuscript up for sale at an auction-house, which has locations in both New York, New York and San Francisco, California.

In early 2014, the imminent publication of Stroud's manuscript was reported by several news outlets.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer releases book by Birdman of Alcatraz|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/morning_call/2014/02/lawyer-releases-book-by-birdman-of.html|publisher=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2014, ''Looking Outward: A Voice From The Grave'' was made available for purchase as an Amazon Kindle [[eBook]]. By January 2015 it was also available in paperback form. As noted in the book's Prologue, "[the] work was originally divided into six parts. However, due to the death of the Writer, only four parts were completed" and the 2014 edition contains only the first of four parts of the entire manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stroud |first1=Robert |last2=Eddings |first2=Pam |date=2013 |title=Looking Outward: A Voice From The Grave |url=https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Outward-Voice-Robert-Stroud-ebook/dp/B00IA8YNYI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525491702&amp;sr=1-1#reader_B00IA8YNYI |location= |publisher=Looking Outward, LLC |page=7 |isbn=978-0-9828531-7-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of Fall 2015 no additional date was known for the availability of the other three parts.

'''Medford Stanton Evans''' (July 20, 1934 – March 3, 2015), better known as '''M. Stanton Evans''', was an American journalist, author and educator. He was the author of eight books, including ''[[Blacklisted by History|Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies]]'' (2007).&lt;ref name=aclymer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/m-stanton-evans-pioneer-of-conservative-movement-dies-at-80.html|title=M.

==Early life and education==
Evans was born in [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]] in [[Kleberg County, Texas|Kleberg County]] in [[South Texas]], the son of [[Medford Bryan Evans]], an author, college professor at [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Louisiana, and official of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]],&lt;ref name="booknotes1995"&gt;[http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/62252-1/M+Stanton+Evans.aspx The Theme is Freedom: Religion, Politics, and the American Tradition by M.

Evans graduated in 1955 ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Yale University]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1960"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871696,00.html End of a Search]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' October 10, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; with a Bachelor of Arts in [[English major|English]], followed by graduate work in Economics at [[New York University]] under [[Ludwig von Mises]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Journalism==
As an undergraduate, Evans was an editor for the ''[[Yale Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/yale/1954/Page_132.html Banner and Pot Pourri Yearbook – Class of 1954], Yale University, 1954, p. 132 (e-yearbook.com)&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Yale that he read ''One Is a Crowd'' by [[Frank Chodorov]]. In ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', [[George H. Nash]] writes:

{{quote|It was the first libertarian book he [Evans] had ever read, and [he said] it 'opened up more intellectual perspectives to me than did the whole Yale curriculum.' Evans came to believe that Chodorov 'probably had more to do with the conscious shaping of my political philosophy than any other person'.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g0huAAAAMAAJ ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945''], ISI Books, 2006, p. 39; {{ISBN|1-933859-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Upon graduation, Evans became assistant editor of ''[[The Freeman]],'' where Chodorov was editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreemanonline.org/author/frank-chodorov/ Archive for Frank Chodorov], ''The Freeman''&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he joined the staff of [[William F. Buckley]]'s fledgling ''[[National Review]]'' (where he served as associate editor from 1960 to 1973),&lt;ref name="google84"&gt;Sam G. Riley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a7kT7EDFakAC ''Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists''] (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995), p. 84; {{ISBN|0-313-29192-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became managing editor of ''[[Human Events]]'', where he remained a contributing editor until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/search.php?author_name=M.+Stanton+Evans M. Stanton Evans profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216130023/http://www.humanevents.com/search.php?author_name=M.+Stanton+Evans |date=December 16, 2006 }}, humanevents.com; accessed March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans became a proponent of ''National Review'' co-editor [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]]'s "[[fusionism]]", a political philosophy reconciling the [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and libertarian tendencies of the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Meehan, III, [http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=214 Stanton profile], firstprinciplesjournal.com, April 17, 2008; accessed March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that freedom and virtue are not antagonistic, but complementary:
{{quote|The idea that there is some sort of huge conflict between religious values and liberty is a misstatement of the whole problem. The two are inseparable. ... [I]f there are no moral axioms, why should there be any freedom?&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Schneider, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux-qhbQ62IkC Cadres for conservatism: young Americans for freedom and the rise of the contemporary right]'' (NYU Press, 1999), p. 35; {{ISBN|0-8147-8108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative believes that ours is a God-centered, and therefore an ordered, universe; that man's purpose is to shape his life to the patterns of order proceeding from the Divine center of life; and that, in seeking this objective, man is hampered by a fallible intellect and vagrant will. Properly construed, this view is not only compatible with a due regard for human freedom, but demands it.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Brent Bozell III|L. Brent Bozell]], "Freedom or Virtue?", [https://books.google.com/books?id=KssUAQAAIAAJ ''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate''], George Wescott Carey, ed. (Wilmington, Del: ISI Books, 1998), p. 22&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1959, Evans became head editorial writer of ''[[The Indianapolis News]]'',&lt;ref name="google84"/&gt; rising to editor the following year—at 26, the nation's youngest editor of a metropolitan daily newspaper&lt;ref name="autogenerated1960"/&gt;—a position he held until 1974.&lt;ref name="google84"/&gt; In 1971, Evans became a commentator for the [[CBS]] Television and Radio Networks, and in 1980 became a commentator for [[National Public Radio]], the [[Voice of America]], [[Radio America (United States)|Radio America]] and WGMS in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene G. Schwartz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhDo0-A71SYC American Students Organize: Founding the National Student Association after World War II: An Anthology and Sourcebook]'' (American Council on Educators/Praeger Publishers, 2006), p. 804; {{ISBN|0-275-99100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, he became a nationally syndicated columnist for ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' [[Print syndication|syndicate]].&lt;ref name="google84"/&gt; [[Barry Goldwater]] wrote that Evans "writes with the strength and conviction and authority of experience."&lt;ref&gt;Fulton Lewis, Jr., [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19611117&amp;id=eRErAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I5wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2943,501342 "Washington Report"], Reading Eagle'', November 17, 1961, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 radio address, [[Ronald Reagan]] cited Evans as "a very fine journalist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiron K.

The center sponsors young journalists getting established in the nation's capital. [[Cliff Kincaid]] of [[Accuracy in Media]] was among those who began their careers through Evans' auspices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usasurvival.org/home/bio.html |title=Cliff Kincaid's Biography |publisher=usasurvival.org |accessdate=June 17, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017003016/http://www.usasurvival.org/home/bio.html |archivedate=October 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Evans became an adjunct professor of journalism at [[Troy University]] in [[Troy, Alabama|Troy]], [[Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troy.edu/news/archives/2005/march/evans.htm Troy University Journalism Symposium named in honor of M.

From 1981 to 2002, he was publisher of ''[[Consumers' Research]]'' magazine. Evans expressed his journalistic philosophy as follows:

{{quote|I don't think that the way to correct a spin from the left is to try to impart a spin from the right. ... [A]n information flow distorted from the right would be just as much a disservice as distortion from the left. What we really should be after ... is accurate information. And I don't see what any conservative or anybody else for that matter has to fear from accurate information.&lt;ref&gt;M.

From 1971 to 1977, Evans served as chairman of the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservative.org/about-acu/principles/ Statement of Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514082657/http://www.conservative.org/about-acu/principles/ |date=May 14, 2010 }}: The Sharon Statement, American Conservative Union&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first conservatives to denounce U.S. President [[Richard M. Nixon]], just a year into his first term, co-writing a January 1970 ACU report condemning his record. Under Evans' leadership, the ACU issued a July 1971 statement concluding, "the American Conservative Union has resolved to suspend our support of the Administration." Evans often joked that he "never liked Nixon ''until'' Watergate."&lt;ref&gt;James C. Roberts, "[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=272 CPAC Over 30 Years: Conservatives Have Come a Long Way]," ''Human Events'', February 3, 2003. Evans recycled this bit of what Roberts called his "droll, contrarian humor" at another conference two years later, when he objected to a co-panelist, self-proclaimed "unabashed ideological liberal" Rick Perlstein, characterizing Nixon as a "conservative," quipping: "I was never for Nixon until Watergate." Perlstein apparently didn't get the joke (Rick Perlstein, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-perlstein/i-didnt-like-nixon-until-_b_11735.html 'I Didn't Like Nixon Until Watergate': The Conservative Movement Now,]" Huffington Post, December 5, 2005), but the audience laughed.

Becky Norton Dunlop, an official of the [[Heritage Foundation]], said that Evans had a sense of humor that

{{quote|just naturally made people laugh. He had a way of making everyone in his presence pay attention to what he was saying just by the way he said it. And while your sides were splitting with laughter, you were thinking about what he was saying. He also imparted a love for great books and introduced many a young conservative to works that had somehow not made it into their college curriculum. His great book, ''The Theme is Freedom'' should be on the shelf of every person who loves freedom. Many of today's conservative leaders owe much to the lessons, the leadership, the energy and, yes, the humor of M. Stanton Evans. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/5/becky-norton-dunlop-a-tribute-to-stan-evans/#ixzz3TcToXoMp|title=A tribute to Stan Evans: Many owe much to a man who made conservatism relevant and fun|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Mafia Raj''' ({{lit|mafia regime}}) refers to a criminalised nexus (or "[[mafia]]") of government officials, elected politicians, business interests and other entities (such as law-enforcement authorities, non-governmental organisations, trade unions or criminal organisations).&lt;ref name="jotias2003"&gt;"Developmental policy of the state, globalisation and prawn aquaculture," ''Journal of the [[Indian Anthropological Society]]'' v.23, Indian Anthropological Society, 2003: "Mafia Raj is the rule of a group of powerful people usually outsiders from among politicians and their relatives, top bureaucrats and  merchants), their musclemen and local encroachers (local non-fisher-folk and also some influential local fisher-folk financed by outsiders who operate in connivance with revenue and police officials)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loksabha1997"&gt;Lok Sabha, "Lok Sabha Debates, ser.11 Jul 29 1997 v.15 no.5, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Lok Sabha (House of the People), Parliament of India, 1997: "This hays also placed the mafia raj in politics and in every sphere of social life in Bihar,"&lt;/ref&gt;

In India (where the term originated) it can refer to cities, states, government departments, public sector businesses or entire sectors of the economy that are subject to these conditions. Due to the ability of these mafias to operate their illegal activities in a sustained fashion, sometimes openly and with the use of violent intimidation, terms like '''Goonda Raj''' (''rule of the goons''), '''Jungle Raj''' (''law of the jungle'') and '''Anarchy''' are used to refer to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="singh2003"&gt;Mahendra Prasad Singh and Rekha Saxena, ''India at the Polls: Parliamentary Elections in the Federal Phase'', Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-250-2328-3}}: "The manifesto of the Bahujan Samaj Party sought to highlight four major objectives ... annihilation of the 'Goonda-Mafia raj' and anarchic forces"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Indian and [[Pakistan]]i media, the mafias are usually mentioned by the name of the economic sector in which they are involved. Terms such as coal mafia, timber mafia (sometimes forest mafia), contractor mafia (sometimes road construction mafia or road contract mafia) and land mafia are commonly used.

[[File:Coal mine in Dhanbad, India.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Indian coal mine. The [[Dhanbad]] mine complex is allegedly dominated by a coal mafia.]]
The state-owned coal mines of [[Bihar]] (now [[Jharkhand]] after the division of Bihar state) were among the first areas in India to see the emergence of a sophisticated mafia, beginning with the mining town of [[Dhanbad]].&lt;ref name="bharti1989"&gt;Indu Bharti, "Usurpation of the State: Coal Mafia in Bihar", ''Economic and Political Weekly'', Vol. 24, No. 42, pg. 2353. 21 October 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that the coal industry's trade union leadership forms the upper echelon of this arrangement and employs caste allegiances to maintain its power.&lt;ref name="rao1983"&gt;S. Venugopala Rao, ''Crime in Our Society: A Political Perspective'', Vikas Publishing House, 1983, {{ISBN|0-7069-1209-8}}: "Using the vast money, muscle and caste power, trade union leaders have built up a Mafia-like empire which totally controls the life and economy of Dhanbad ... workers who constitute about 40 percent of Dhanbad districts population are mainly tribals, adivasis, Harijans and backward castes, while the trade union musclemen are mostly Rajputs of Bhojpur and Rohtas districts."&lt;/ref&gt; Pilferage and sale of coal on the black market, inflated or fictitious supply expenses, falsified worker contracts and the expropriation and leasing-out of government land have allegedly become routine.&lt;ref name="mathur1991"&gt;Ajeet N. Mathur, Asian Regional Team for Employment Promotion, World Employment Programme, ''Industrial Restructuring and Union Power: Micro-economic Dimensions of Economic Restructuring and Industrial Relations in India'', International Labour Organization, 1991, {{ISBN|92-2-107494-3}}: "According to many workers, it is not possible for genuine trade unionism to flourish in Dhanbad because of illicit trading and profiteering in the garb of trade unionism and the protective umbrella such an institution holds out."&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel economy has developed with a significant fraction of the local population employed by the mafia in manually transporting the stolen coal for long distances over unpaved roads to illegal mafia warehouses and points of sale.&lt;ref name=frontline2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2205/stories/20050311001703700.htm |title=Coal theft and vote |publisher=Frontline Magazine, The Hindu Newspaper Group |date=26 Feb – 11 March 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618051946/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2205/stories/20050311001703700.htm |archivedate=18 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal mafia has had a negative effect on Indian industry, with coal supplies and quality varying erratically. Higher quality coal is sometimes selectively diverted, and missing coal is replaced with stones and boulders in railway cargo wagons. A human corpse has been discovered in a sealed coal wagon.&lt;ref name="mittal1994"&gt;D. K. Mittal, ''Coal Industry'', Anmol Publications Private Limited, 1994, {{ISBN|81-7041-863-1}}. Snippet: "Default on quality, quantity and timely supply of coal have taken their toll on the Indian industry and come in their way in acquiring international competitiveness ... coal ministry officials have themselves observed boulders and dust being loaded in wagons supposed to be carrying steam coal ... checking officials even found the dead body of a person."&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the Bollywood epic ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur]]'' was released portraying the coal mafia in the area of Dhanbad. The movie received overwhelming response and was declared a hit. Another Bollywood movie [[Gunday]] was also loosely based upon coal mafia.

==Timber mafias==
{{see also|Timber mafia}}
Protected forest areas in parts of India – such as [[Jammu and Kashmir]], Himachal Pradesh, [[Karnataka]] and Jharkhand – are vulnerable to [[illegal logging]] by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry.&lt;ref name="colchester1999"&gt;Marcus Colchester and Christian Erni, ''Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in South and Southeast Asia: From Principles to Practice'', IWGIA, 1999, {{ISBN|87-90730-18-6}}: "The Forest Department is perceived as corrupt, colluding with timber contractors (the timber mafia), and taking bribes from the communities in return."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rawat1999"&gt;Ajay Singh Rawat, ''Forest Management in Kumaon Himalaya: Struggle of the Marginalised People'', Indus Publishing, 1999, {{ISBN|81-7387-101-9}}: "within 5 years in the Western Circle, 13 forest officials have been murdered and 39 fatally wounded in their bid to prevent illicit timber trade ... Politicians are chary of getting on the wrong side of the timber mafia, which has proved to be extremely generous during election time."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contractor mafias==
[[File:Delhi-Gurgaon Airport Expressway, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public works, such as road construction, are sometimes dominated by contractor mafias.]]
Many state-funded construction activities in India, such as road building, are dominated by construction mafias, which are groupings of corrupt public works officials, materials suppliers, politicians and construction contractors.&lt;ref name="indiatoday2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20061016/state-up.html |title=Mulayam Hits Mafia Hard |publisher=India Today |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "The road sector has always been the main source of income for the mafia. They either ask their men directly to grab the contracts or allow an outsider to take the contract after accepting a hefty commission ... a large number of criminals have been grabbing contracts under the protective umbrella of parties like SP, BSP, BJP, as well as the Congress ... opportunity to refurbish the image of his Government by initiating a crackdown on the mafia-contractor-engineer nexus."&lt;/ref&gt; Shoddy construction and material substitution (e.g., mixing sand in cement while submitting expenses for cement) result in roads and highways being dangerous and sometimes simply washed away when India's heavy [[monsoon]] season arrives.&lt;ref name="livemint2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.livemint.com/blogs/romanticrealist/archive/2008/09/01/killer-roads-in-india-and-rethinking-the-death-penalty.aspx |title=Killer roads in India and rethinking the death penalty |publisher=liveMint.com, The Wall Street Journal |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025092456/http://blogs.livemint.com/blogs/romanticrealist/archive/2008/09/01/killer-roads-in-india-and-rethinking-the-death-penalty.aspx |archivedate=25 October 2008 }} "this year's rains have destroyed 581 roads in the state with 139 road accidents killing 373 people through 10 August ... they spoke about a road building contractor mafia that pretty much has a lock on many projects for redoing roads—apparently year after year."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a widely covered case, [[Satyendra Dubey]], a project director with the National Highways Authority of India, was murdered in 2003, allegedly because he had written a letter exposing deep-seated contractor mafia involvement in the construction of a section of the prestigious [[Golden Quadrilateral]] project to the prime minister's office.&lt;ref name="rediff2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.co.in/news/2006/nov/27dubey.htm |title=Satyendra Dubey: A forgotten hero? |publisher=Rediff |date=27 November 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "Dubey ... was shot dead near the Circuit House in Gaya after he exposed deep-rooted corruption in construction of the Golden Quadrilateral Project. ... It was proved beyond any doubt that Dubey was killed soon after he wrote a letter to the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister's]] Office and blew the whistle on the contract mafia. Though he requested that his name not be made public, vested interests leaked his name."&lt;/ref&gt; Although a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] investigative report after the assassination stated that there was no contractor mafia involvement in Dubey's murder,&lt;ref name="index2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/contractor-mafia-not-involved-in-dubeys-murder-cbi-report/10407/ |title=Contractor mafia not involved in Dubey's murder: CBI report |publisher=Indian Express |date=12 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} " The CBI has reiterated before the Supreme Court that there is no {{sic|invlovement}} of any contractor mafia in the murder of NHAI engineer Satyendra Kumar Dubey."&lt;/ref&gt; his family and supporters maintained that an attempt at a cover-up was being made.&lt;ref name="rediff2006-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/dec/16dubey.htm |title=Satyendra Dubey case: 'CBI trying to save culprits' |publisher=Rediff |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "We strongly feel that the CBI was trying its best to save the main culprits or mafia behind his murder and making it a case of simple robbery." ... "We have full evidence to show that the arrested accused in the case by CBI were not the real face behind his murder, Dhananjay said, claiming that the arrested accused were forced by the CBI to accept the crime they never committed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to reduce mafia influence by making construction [[tendering]] processes more transparent, sometimes by attempting to move them online, so that a complete [[audit trail]] of bids and activity is maintained. Construction mafias are alleged to have used their political influence decisively to frustrate many such attempts, for example, in the public works for which the [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi]] is responsible.&lt;ref name="hindu2005-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/01/03/stories/2005010309240400.htm |title=Tender mafia's domination in MCD continues  |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 January 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "For the past two years, Mr. Mehta has been trying to introduce on-line tendering system and mandatory quality test by an independent testing agency. "However, because of the strong nexus between engineers, politicians and contractors, it is the tender mafia which now decides which contractors should get a particular contract," officials said. ... so strong was the dominance of tender mafia that new contractors were not being allowed to enter the civic body."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land mafias==
[[File:WhiteTiger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A local land mafia reportedly attempted to seize land planned to be used by the Central Zoo Authority as the site for India's first night safari.]]
In cities and villages throughout India, mafias consisting of municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, judicial and law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways for profit.&lt;ref name="gupta2008"&gt;K.R. Gupta and J.R. Gupta, "Indian Economy, Vol# 2", Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors, 2008, {{ISBN|81-269-0926-9}}. "the land market already stands subverted and an active land mafia has already been created."&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, government land or land ostensibly acquired for some legitimate government purpose is then handed over to real estate developers '''AR''' who build commercial and residential properties and sell them in the open market, often with the connivance of administrative and police officials.&lt;ref name="indiadaily2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/3897.asp |title=India after busting land mafia organised crime involving former government officials and apartment developers |publisher=India Daily |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822134101/http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/3897.asp |archivedate=22 August 2007 |df= }} "Low priced subsidised land is being illegally developed ... permits are obtained illegally through a network of mafia style operators that involved the under world, former Indian Administrative Service officers and even the cops ... alleged misappropriation of land in the name of CGHS and selling them at very high rates after construction of flats."&lt;/ref&gt;

In one set of allegations in Karnataka, a lake was filled in and government buildings torn down after illegal transfers to a developer by mafia-connected officials.&lt;ref name="deccanherald2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Oct102008/district2008100994331.asp |title=Land mafia buries lake, encroaches govt land |publisher=Deccan Herald |date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222006/http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Oct102008/district2008100994331.asp |archivedate=16 April 2009 }} "The watershed department had built a check dam at a cost of Rs150,000 in 2006 to improve the groundwater level. But the land mafia has taken things into its own hands and got it covered."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eminent domain]] laws, intended to procure private land at relatively low prices for public benefit or redistribution to poorer people under [[social justice]] programs, are abused to pressure landholders to sell land to a government entity, which transfers the land to developers at those low prices, and who in turn sell it back on the market at much higher prices.&lt;ref name="vittal2004"&gt;N. Vittal, ''India: Technology and a vision for the future'', The Icfai University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|81-7881-346-7}}: "Another law which had a totally contradictory impact was the Urban Land Ceiling Act which provided tremendous opportunity for the land mafia. The poor people who were supposed to benefit in the process were nowhere to be seen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vajpayee1999"&gt;[[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and Narayana Madhava Ghatate, ''Decisive Days'', Shipra Publications, 1999: "In villages on the outskirts of the cities, land is being grabbed by force by the lathi-wielding miscreants. This land is public land. Skyscrapers are being built."&lt;/ref&gt;

Computerisation of records relating to the classification of tracts and land ownership is a key tool in countering the illegal activities of land mafias, since it creates transparency on all information relating to a given parcel of land. This approach has been effective in [[Bangalore]],&lt;ref name="vittal2007"&gt;N. Vittal, ''Roots of Effective Governance'', Icfai University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|81-314-1156-7}}: "transparency ... was introduced in allotment of sites. The element of discretion involved in this process was removed. The whole system was totally computerised. The allotment details were published on the website and the lease cum-sale agreement was done away with. Absolute sale deeds were issued."&lt;/ref&gt; but efforts to extend it elsewhere have sometimes met with strong resistance by land mafias, manifesting itself as bureaucratic inaction.&lt;ref name="shourie2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunshourie.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/a-state-unimagined-in-law-a-wrong-without-a-remedy/ |title=A State Unimagined in Law: A Wrong Without a Remedy |publisher=Arun Shourie |date=26 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "For this purpose the Centre formulated a scheme for the computerisation of land records. It pledged to meet the entire expense of the task. About Rs50&amp;nbsp;million have been given to the State (Bihar) for this purpose; it has been able to utilise only Rs2.2&amp;nbsp;million! The target is that by December next year there shall be one hundred per cent coverage of "Jot Bahi/Khatta": actual coverage till now? Ten per cent."&lt;/ref&gt;

Focused vigilance in specific areas by government agencies has acted as a deterrent to land mafia activities. For example, the land mafia in the [[NOIDA|Noida]] area, on the outskirts of [[Delhi]], was reported to have illegally begun carving out plots for commercial sale on land identified by the [[Central Zoo Authority of India]] as the site for India's first Night Safari park.&lt;ref name="tribune2007-001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070704/delhi.htm#5 |title=Mafia selling Night Safari land |publisher=The Tribune |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} "Land mafia is busy carving out plots in the prestigious Night Safari project and selling them at Rs800 per sq mt to gullible buyers. Surprisingly, the Greater Noida Authority is oblivious of this development."&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to coverage in the press, vigorous legal action by the Greater Noida Authority reportedly led to this mafia alliance backing away from this theft, although it may have shifted its attention to illegally encroaching on land along the [[Taj Expressway]], connecting Delhi and [[Agra]], which is expected to become quite valuable.&lt;ref name="tribune2007-002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070830/delhi.htm#8 |title=Encroachers eyeing land along Taj Expressway |publisher=The Tribune |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} The biggest Mafia is the Congress Party of the Italian and the media specially English and electronic which is in hands of Drug, Organ, Child Traffickers, and prostitution mafia and Xian terrorists"When further action was taken on projects like Javer Airport, Night Safari, Formula 1 racing track, etc, the land mafia and realtor shifted their focus on Greater Noida and Taj Expressway land ... The land along a distance of 160 km from Greater Noida to Agra is not being fully guarded from land sharks, it is learnt."&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of management information systems examines people and technology in an organizational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Management Information Systems?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003228/http://mays.tamu.edu/info/what-is-mis/|archivedate=May 9, 2015|url=http://mays.tamu.edu/info/what-is-mis/|publisher=Mays Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a management information system is to increase the value and profits of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umassd.edu/charlton/programs/mis/|title=Management Information Systems|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] |website=umassd.edu |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While it can be contested that the history of management information systems date as far back as companies using ledgers to keep track of accounting, the modern history of MIS can be divided into five ''eras'' originally identified by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] and Jane Laudon in their seminal textbook ''Management Information Systems.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm|last1=Laudon|first1=Kenneth C.|last2=Laudon|first2=Jane P.|publisher=Prentice Hall/CourseSmart|year=2009|edition=11|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bizfluent.com/about-5444925-history-management-information-systems.html|title=The History of Management Information Systems|last=Boykin|first=George|date=2017-09-26|website=bizfluent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* First Era – [[Mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]] computing
* Second Era – [[Personal computer]]s
* Third Era – [[Client/server]] networks
* Fourth Era – [[Enterprise computing]] 
* Fifth Era – [[Cloud computing]]

The ''first era'' (mainframe and minicomputer computing) was ruled by [[IBM]] and their mainframe computers for which they supplied both the hardware and software. These computers would often take up whole rooms and require teams to run them. As technology advanced, these computers were able to handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.

The ''second era'' (personal computers) began in 1965 as microprocessors started to compete with mainframes and minicomputers and accelerated the process of decentralizing computing power from large data centers to smaller offices. In the late 1970s, minicomputer technology gave way to personal computers and relatively low-cost computers were becoming mass market commodities, allowing businesses to provide their employees access to computing power that ten years before would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. This proliferation of computers created a ready market for interconnecting networks and the popularization of the Internet. (The first microprocessor — a four-bit device intended for a programmable calculator — was introduced in 1971 and microprocessor-based systems were not readily available for several years. The MITS Altair 8800 was the first commonly known microprocessor-based system, followed closely by the Apple I and II.  It is arguable that the microprocessor-based system did not make significant inroads into minicomputer use until 1979, when [[VisiCalc]] prompted record sales of the Apple II on which it ran. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 was more broadly palatable to business, but its limitations gated its ability to challenge minicomputer systems until perhaps the late 1980s to early 1990s.)

The ''third era'' (client/server networks) arose as technological complexity increased, costs decreased, and the end-user (now the ordinary employee) required a system to [[Information sharing|share information]] with other employees within an enterprise. Computers on a common network shared information on a server. This lets thousands and even millions of people access data simultaneously on networks referred to as [[Intranet|Intranets]]. 

The ''fourth era'' (enterprise computing) enabled by high speed networks, consolidated the original department specific software applications into integrated software platforms referred to as [[enterprise software]]. This new platform tied all aspects of the business enterprise together offering rich information access encompassing the complete management structure.

The ''fifth era'' (cloud computing) is the latest and employs networking technology to deliver applications as well as data storage independent of the configuration, location, or nature of the hardware. This, along with high speed [[cellphone]] and [[Wi-Fi]] networks, has led to new levels of mobility in which managers may access the MIS remotely with [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computers]] and [[smartphones]].

== Terminology ==
The terms management information systems (MIS), [[information system|information system (IS)]] , [[enterprise resource planning|enterprise resource planning (ERP)]], [[computer science]], [[Computer engineering|electrical computer engineering]], and [[information technology management]] (IT) are often confused. MIS is a hierarchical subset of information systems. MIS are more organization-focused narrowing in on leveraging information technology to increase business value. Computer science is more software-focused dealing with the applications that may be used in MIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/what-is-mis|title=What is MIS?|last=The University of Arizona|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical computer engineering is product-focused mainly dealing with the architecture behind computer systems. ERP software is a subset of MIS and IT management refers to the technical management of an IT department which may include MIS.

== Management ==
While management information systems can be used by any and every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the [[chief information officer]]s (CIO) and [[chief technology officer]]s (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. They act as decision makers in the implementation process of new MIS.

Once decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. They are also in charge of implementing the policies affecting the MIS (either new specific policies passed down by the CIOs or CTOs or policies that align the new systems with the organizations overall IT policy). It is also their role to ensure the availability of data and network services as well as the security of the data involved by coordinating IT activities.

Upon implementation, the assigned users will have the appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS need necessarily be management level. It is common practice to have inputs to MIS be inputted by non-managerial employees though they rarely have access to the reports and decision support platforms offered by these systems.

== Types ==
The following are types of information systems used to create reports, extract data, and assist in the decision making processes of middle and operational level managers.

* [[Decision support system|Decision support systems (DSS)]] are computer program applications used by middle and higher management to compile information from a wide range of sources to support problem solving and decision making. A DSS is used mostly for semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. 
* [[Executive information system|Executive information systems (EIS)]] is a reporting tool that provides quick access to summarized reports coming from all company levels and departments such as accounting, human resources and operations.
* [[Marketing Information System|Marketing information system]]s are management Information Systems designed specifically for managing the [[marketing]] aspects of the business.
*[[Accounting information system]]s are focused [[accounting]] functions. 
*[[Human resource management system]]s are used for personnel aspects. 
* [[Office automation|Office automation systems (OAS)]] support communication and productivity in the enterprise by automating [[workflow]] and eliminating bottlenecks. OAS may be implemented at any and all levels of management.
* [[School Information Management System|School Information Management Systems (SIMS)]] cover school administration, often including teaching and learning materials.
* [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise resource planning (ERP)]] software facilitates the flow of information between all business functions inside the boundaries of the organization and manage the connections to outside stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Bidgoli, Hossein, (2004). The Internet Encyclopedia, Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p. 707.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Database|Local Databases]], can be small, simplistic tools for managers and are considered to be a primal or base level version of a MIS.

== Advantages ==
The following are some of the benefits that can be attained using MIS:&lt;ref&gt; (1995), Strategic Information Systems Planning: A Review, Information Resources Management Association International Conference, May 21–24, Atlanta.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies are able to identify their strengths and weaknesses due to the presence of revenue reports, employees' performance record etc. Identifying these aspects can help a company improve its business processes and operations.
* Giving an overall picture of the company. 
* Acting as a communication and planning tool.
* The availability of customer data and feedback can help the company to align its [[business process]]es according to the needs of its customers. The effective management of customer data can help the company to perform direct marketing and promotion activities.
*MIS can help a company gain a [[competitive advantage]].
*MIS reports can help with decision-making as well as reduce downtime for actionable items.

== Enterprise applications ==
* ''Enterprise systems''—also known as ''[[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)'' systems—provide integrated software modules and a unified database that personnel use to plan, manage, and control core business processes across multiple locations. Modules of ERP systems may include finance, accounting, marketing, human resources, production, inventory management, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = A | last2 = Ferreira | first2 = C. | last3 = Bento | first3 = E. | last4 = Aparicio | first4 = F. | year = 2016 | title = Enterprise resource planning adoption and satisfaction determinants | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 659–671 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Supply chain management]] (SCM)'' systems enable more efficient management of the supply chain by integrating the links in a supply chain. This may include suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and final customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Supply Chain Management: The Next Big Thing?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/supply-chain-management-the-next-big-thing-09122011.html|work=Sept. 12, 2011|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Customer relationship management]] (CRM)'' systems help businesses manage relationships with potential and current customers and business partners across marketing, sales, and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynn|first=Samara|title=What is CRM?|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2391297,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Knowledge management]] system (KMS)'' helps organizations facilitate the collection, recording, organization, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge. This may include documents, accounting records, unrecorded procedures, practices, and skills. Knowledge management (KM) as a system covers the process of knowledge creation and acquisition from internal processes and the external world. The collected knowledge is incorporated in organizational policies and procedures, and then disseminated to the stakeholders.&lt;ref name=Joshi&gt;{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=Girdhar|title=Management Information Systems|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=9780198080992|page=328|url=http://www.oup.co.in/product/higher-education/business-management/business-management/6/management-information-systems-1e/9780198080992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manganiar''' or '''Manghanhar'''  [Sindhi مڱڻھار] and  related '''[[Langha (tribe)|Langha]]''' are [[Muslim]] communities in  [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] and in the desert of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]] in the districts of [[Barmer district|Barmer]] and [[Jaisalmer district|Jaisalmer]], along the border of [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Majority of Manghanhar are found in the districts of [[Tharparkar District|Tharparkar]], [[Sanghar District|Sanghar]], [[Mirpur Khas District|Mirpur Khas]], [[Tando Allahyar District|Tando Allahyar]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Badin District|Badin]], [[Sujawal District|Sujawal]], [[Thatta District|Thatta]], [[Jamshoro District|Jamshoro]] in [[Sindh]] [[Pakistan]]. They are known for their [[Folk Music|folk music]]. They are groups of hereditary musicians whose music has been supported by wealthy landlords and aristocrats for generations.

==History and origin==
The Manganiars consider themselves descendants of the [[Muslim Rajput|Rajputs]] and are renowned as folk musicians of the [[Thar desert]]. Their songs are passed on from generation to generation as a form of oral history of the desert. They sing songs about [[Alexander the Great]], about the local [[Maharajas]] and past battles in the region. Manganiars have survived for centuries on the patronage of wealthy merchants in caravan towns, particularly [[Jaisalmer]] where there is an important settled community today. The traditional jajman (patrons) of the Manganiar are the locally dominant [[Rajput]] community, while the Langha have a similar relationship with the [[Sindhi-Sipahi]], a community of [[Muslim Rajput]]s. At times of birth, marriage or any family festivity for their [[Rajput]] patrons, the Manganiar musicians sing songs of the desert and many specially composed songs to praise the patron and his family{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} {{dubious|date=September 2016}}.

Though Manganiar and [[Langha (tribe)|Langha]]s communities are [[Muslim]], in [[Rajasthan]] many Manganiar songs are in praise of [[Hindu]] deities and celebrate Hindu festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Holi]] where the performers traditionally invoke the Hindu God [[Krishna]] and seek his blessing before beginning their recital. {{dubious|date=September 2016}}

==Present circumstances==
In 1978, Jodhpur-based musician Komal Kothari provided the Manganiars with institutional support, allowing them to sing outside the state for the first time. Currently, several Manganiar groups tour internationally.

==Socio-political controversy==
In present-day Jaisalmer and surrounding regions in Rajasthan, the term Manganiar, or Manganiyar, meaning 'beggar', is used as a debasing and derogatory title for folk musicians that are among the lowest castes in Rajasthan. These communities of folk musicians refer to themselves as Merasi, which translates as 'musicians' or 'keepers of the stories' and had been titled this by patrons, including wealthy and powerful [[Rajput]] patrons predating [[Komal Kothari]]'s usage of Manganiar. Considered ‘untouchable’, denied access to education, healthcare, and political representation, most live in poverty yet aspire to improve their situation. Despite on-going caste-prejudice, they persist in their roles as oral genealogists, storytellers, and musicians. To reclaim their identity as storytellers, the Merasi of Jaisalmer have shed the derogatory caste label 'Manganiyar' and proudly embraced the name 'Merasi', meaning musicians and is also a poignant symbol of self-determination. New York City-based non-profit organization Folk Arts Rajasthan (FAR), partnered with Jaisalmer-based Lok Kala Sagar Sansthan (LKSS), currently seeks to empower the Merasi community through education, community development, and by nurturing and preserving cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folkartrajasthan.org/about/ Folk Arts Rajasthan in partnership with Lok Kala Sagar Sansthan, accessed 29 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
'''Kamaicha'''&lt;br/&gt;
The 17-string khamaycha is a bowed instrument. Made of mango wood, its rounded resonator is covered with goat skin. Three of its strings are goat intestine while the other 14 strings are steel. 

'''Khartaal'''&lt;br/&gt;
The khartaal is a kind of castanet made of teak. Its name is derived from "Khar", meaning hand, and "Taal", meaning rhythm.

'''Dholak'''&lt;br/&gt;
The dholak is a North Indian, Pakistani and Nepalese hand drum similar in timbre to a bongo. A dholak may have traditional lacing or turnbuckle tuning. The dholak has a simple membrane and a handle on the right hand side. The left hand membrane has a special coating on the inner surface. This coating is a mixture of tar, clay and sand (dholak masala) which lowers the pitch.

==Notable people==
* [[Kachra Khan]], a singer of the Managniar community of western Rajasthan
* [[Sakar Khan]], Khamaicha player, Padmasree award winner
* [[Mai Dhai]], Pakistani Manganiar folk singer
* [[Allan Fakir]]
* [[Swaroop Khan]], playback singer

The NSE co-location case is under investigation by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) and the Income-tax Department (I-T department) who are probing the involvement of NSE and SEBI officials, as well as NSE's former and current executives and brokerages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/market/sebi-finds-lapses-at-nse-in-co-location-case-issues-show-cause-notices-to-related-parties/1232454/|date=2018-07-05|title=Sebi finds lapses at NSE in co-location case, issues show-cause notices to related parties|publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-finds-lapses-at-nse-in-co-location-case-issues-show-cause-notices-118070500409_1.html |date=2018-07-05|title=Sebi finds lapses at NSE in co-location case, issues show-cause notices|publisher=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/i-t-dept-suspects-money-laundering-by-opg-securities-117112001061_1.html|date=2017-11-21|title=I-T dept brings in ED to check money trail in NSE co-location case|publisher=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In January 2010, the NSE began offering a [[Colocation centre|co-location]] facility to members. Members could place their servers in the Exchange's premises in return for a fee. This allowed them faster access to the buy and sell orders being disseminated by the exchange’s trading engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features-2/how-ravi-narain-built-the-nse-and-then-lost-his-grip-2296629.html|date=2017-06-04|title=How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip|publisher=Money Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'co-location' means 'a setup wherein the broker’s computer is located in the same area as the stock exchange’s server. This gives a 10:1 (typically) speed advantage for the broker'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pgurus.com/anatomy-of-a-crime-p2-the-amount-of-the-hft-loot/|date=2017-09-25|title=Anatomy of a crime P2 – The amount of the HFT loot|publisher=pgurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pgurus.com/anatomy-crime-p1-benefited-hft-high-frequency-trading/|date=2017-09-24|title=Anatomy of a crime P1 – How some benefited from HFT (High Frequency Trading)|publisher=PGurus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[High-frequency trading]] (HFT) or [[algorithmic trading]] refers to the use of electronic systems, which can potentially execute thousands of orders on the stock exchange in less than a second. Also, retail investors monitoring prices are subject to a delay as compared to the tick-by-tick data broadcast a user receives in a co-location facility. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/fK2Uiuoal9lzOuTFP2E7DK/Sebi-looking-at-ways-to-limit-algo-trading-colocation-bene.html|date=2016-04-13|title=Sebi looking at ways to limit algo trading, co-location benefits|publisher=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the SEBI did not put out a discussion paper to collect market feedback before giving permission to proceed with the facility. There are no public records on HFT executed on the NSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/ajay-shah-cambridge-analytica-style-mastermind-financial-markets|date=2018-06-09|title=Ajay Shah: Cambridge Analytica-style mastermind of financial markets|publisher=Sunday Guardian Live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in passing in the NSE’s 2009-10 annual report statement: "In keeping with global trends, the exchange has provided members a co-location facility for low latency high frequency trading. The Co-location data center is an international standard, state of the art, highly robust, resilient and secure infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/NSEIL_Annual_Report_2011.pdf|title=NSEIL Annual Report|date=2011-04-26|website=nseindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whistle-blower’s letter that was addressed to SEBI and copied to the leading financial magazine, ''Moneylife''. clearly stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;when the co-location was started by NSE it took some time for the more enterprising to figure out what was happening in the system. By the end of the year, smart people had all figured out the way to game the system lay in being the first one to connect to the server and preferably the server, which was fastest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/blowing-the-whistle-on-manipulation-in-nse/42337.html|date=2015-06-19|title=Blowing the Whistle on Manipulation in NSE|publisher=Moneylife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The co-location case was initiated when certain members associated with HFT allegedly teamed up and worked in coalition for about four years, i.e. 2010- 2014 overriding rules and regulations set in place by SEBI, the market regulator.&lt;ref name = "NSE3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/probe-into-allegations-against-nse-for-favouring-clients-turning-out-to-be-a-farcical-drama/articleshow/59328132.cms |date=2017-06-27|title=Probe into allegations against NSE for 'favouring clients' turning out to be a farcical drama|publisher=etmarkets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/co-location-case-cbi-names-nse-sebi-officials-opg-securities/article24039742.ece|date=2018-05-30|title=Co-location case: CBI names NSE, SEBI officials, OPG Securities

==Resignations at NSE==
''[[The Economic Times]]'' first reported that on 22 May 2017, SEBI issued [[show cause]] notices to the exchange and fourteen individuals, including former managing directors Chitra Ramakrishna and Ravi Narain.&lt;ref name = "NSE1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-sends-show-cause-notices-to-nse-ex-mds/articleshow/64862154.cms|date=2018-07-05|title=Sebi sends show-cause notices to NSE, ex-MDs |publisher=Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notices have been sent to Ravi Narain, vice-chairman of NSE, who was serving as chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) at the exchange during the period when the alleged violations took place. Other officials include Ravi Varanasi, who was the chief of NSE’s business development vertical and was heading the surveillance department of the exchange during this period, and Suprabhat Lala, chief of regulation and head of the trading division during 2010-13. Among other officials who received show cause notices were former technology heads — Ravi Apte, and Umesh Jain, and former chief operating officer Subramanian Anand. NSE vice-chairman Ravi Narain had put in his papers on 2 June  2017, amid regulators intensifying their probe into the alleged lapses in high frequency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/ravi-narain-quits-as-nse-vice-chairman/article18708349.ece|date=2017-06-12|title=Ravi Narain quits as NSE vice-chairman|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-sends-fresh-notices-to-nse-key-officials/articleshow/64864605.cms|title=Sebi sends fresh notices to NSE, key officials|date=2018-07-05|publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitra Ramakrishna, MD and CEO resigned from the exchange in December 2016. The media reported that Chitra’s resignation the result of two governance-related issues at NSE.  One was the loss of confidence in the NSE top management due to the colocation controversy. The second was the controversy surrounding a high-ranking official at NSE, Anand Subramanian, who was re-designated on 1 April 2015 as Group Operating Officer and Advisor to the MD. This appointment happened after communication from the NSE, MD and the CEO's office bypassing the Human Resources department.&lt;ref name = "NSE3" /&gt; Complaints regarding this appointment, and Subramanian’s high salary, reached the board prompting it to examine the appointment process. This led to Subramanian leaving the exchange in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/subramanian-anand-resigned-from-nse/48590.html|title=Subramanian Anand resigned from NSE|website=moneylife.in|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Both Mr. Narain and Ms. Ramakrishna were part of the NSE’s founding team, having joined the bourse in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170603/jsp/business/story_154859.jsp|title=NSE probe prompts key man to quit|website= [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving show cause notices from SEBI, 12 out of 14 high profile current and former top executives of NSE including Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna filed an application with SEBI to settle the co-location issue under [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]] mechanism in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/former-and-current-nse-executives-opt-for-consent-mode-to-settle-co-location-case/articleshow/60833992.cms|title=Former and current NSE executives opt for consent mode to settle co-location case|website= etmarkets.com|date=Sep 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/consent-mechanism-nse-sebi-to-work-for-early-settlement-4760234/|title=Consent mechanism: NSE, Sebi to work for early settlement|website= indianexpress.com|date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;The consent process is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, allows an alleged wrongdoer to settle a pending issue by accepting a penal action without admitting or denying the guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/12-nse-officials-file-for-consent-settlement-on-co-location-issue/article22093049.ece1|title=12 NSE officials file for consent settlement on co-location issue|website=Business Line|date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, in July 2017, Vikram Limaye took charge as MD and CEO of the NSE. He gave assurances that he would approach SEBI for a settlement of the co-location issue and would find the underlying cause of this issue. &lt;ref name = "NSE8"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/limaye-takes-over-as-nse-chief-insists-he-will-get-to-the-bottom-of-colocation-issue/article9773647.ece|title= Limaye takes over as NSE chief, insists he will get to the bottom of co-location issue|website=The Hindu|date= July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a consent application filed by the exchange was later returned in March 2018 after the CBI investigation gathered momentum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.moneylife.in/article/nse-algo-scam-cbi-steps-in-where-sebi-was-pussyfooting/54193.html|title= NSE Algo Scam: CBI Steps in Where SEBI Was Pussyfooting|website= moneylife.in|date= 31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-finds-lapses-at-nse-in-co-location-case-issues-show-cause-notices-118070500409_1.html|title= Sebi finds lapses at NSE in co-location case, issues show-cause notices|date=2018-07-05|website= [[Business Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==P. Chidambaram’s conduit== 
During the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) rule from 2004 to 2014, [[P. Chidambaram]] was the finance minister for almost seven years and K.P. Krishnan had been the longest-serving joint secretary and additional secretary for the capital market.&lt;ref name = "NSE4"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.firstpost.com/business/nse-crisis-will-sebi-initiate-a-deeper-probe-in-to-the-alleged-unfair-trade-practices-3530199.html | title=NSE crisis: Will Sebi initiate a deeper probe into the alleged unfair trade practices?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markets are shocked that P. Chidambaram chose favourable bureaucrats like C B Bhave and key persons like Chitra Ramakrishna, Ravi Narain, Ashok Chawla and Ramesh Abhishek to head market regulators SEBI, NSE and FMC respectively.&lt;ref name = "NSE2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/officials-look-pm-modi-rescue-economy-toxic-cabal | title=Officials look to PM Modi to rescue economy from toxic cabal| date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna’s proximity to K.P. Krishnan and P. Chidambaram is said to be the reason for their appointments.&lt;ref name = "NSE8" /&gt; It was during this period, the NSE continued operations such as HFT for many years, "enabling brokers to help their clients especially the Foreign International Investors (FII) to make piles of illegal cash". SEBI ignored complaints from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the FT Group’s MCX-SX.  It failed to ask the NSE to discontinue the HFT system for years.&lt;ref name = "NSE7"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pgurus.com/anatomy-of-a-crime-p5-conclusion/ | title=Anatomy of a crime P5 - Conclusion| date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the government, P. Chidambaram also has confidants of eminence like Ajay Narottam Shah, Vijay Kelkar, Suprabhat Lala and the other heads of key domestic financial institutions.&lt;ref name = "NSE2" /&gt; Prior to 2010, the then-chairman of SEBI, C.B. Bhave sent some officials from SEBI to the United States for the training on co-location facilities. There they met Ajay Shah to discuss the practice. After this, NSE started providing a co-location facility in 2010 without a formal application or regulation under the name of [[Direct Market Access]] (DMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/ajay-shah-cambridge-analytica-style-mastermind-financial-markets | title=Ajay Shah: Cambridge Analytica-style mastermind of financial markets| date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the whistle-blower, "the NSE’s top brass, in connivance with some bureaucrats in the then Finance Ministry and powerful ministers in the UPA government manipulated and milked the system".&lt;ref name = "TAC report"&gt;[https://relaysblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/rs-50000-cr-hft-mafia-scandal.pdf MUCH–SUPPRESSED BY NSE: SEBI’S TAC REPORT] &lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of Ajay Shah==
The CBI booked Ajay Shah, professor at the [[National Institute of Public Finance and Policy]] (NIPFP) and former consultant in the finance ministry in co-location scandal.&lt;ref name = "NSE5"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-books-stock-broker-for-manipulating-nse-system/articleshow/64389164.cms | title=CBI books stock broker for manipulating NSE system - Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; As CBI details it, Ajay Shah lobbied for the NSE because of his clout in the Finance Ministry and had been instrumental in the exploitation of the NSE TBT (Tick-By-Tick) architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/qBSyIApQehrv59pAYBljDK/CBI-files-case-against-three-for-exploiting-NSE-systems.html | title=CBI files case against three for exploiting NSE systems| date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE7" /&gt; The CBI’s probe revealed that Ajay Shah collected NSE trade data in 2005-06 under the guise of doing research, while he was employed with Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). He developed algo software named 'Chanakya'.&lt;ref name = "NSE5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/cbi-books-stock-broker-for-illegal-nse-access/article24039051.ece|title=CBI books stockbroker for illegal NSE access|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2018-05-30|last1=Pandey|first1=Devesh K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This software was then sold to selected brokers like OPG securities on a profit-sharing basis through a firm called Infotech Financials. Sunita Thomas, one of the directors of Infotech, is Ajay Shah's sister-in-law and the wife of the NSE’s then-trading head Suprabhat Lala.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pgurus.com/ajay-shah-in-the-garb-of-an-academic/ Ajay Shah – In the garb of an academic]2018-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; After the CBI named Ajay Shah in the co-location scandal in July 2018, SEBI also served show cause notice on him for breaching the data sharing agreement with the NSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-sends-show-cause-notices-to-nse-ex-mds/articleshow/64862154.cms | title=Sebi sends show-cause notices to NSE, ex-MDs - Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whistle-blower has alleged that Ajay Shah has also benefited by influencing FIIs and Participatory (PN) Note activities on NSE, and he had profit-sharing contracts with OPG Securities, Alpha Grep and Omnesys.&lt;ref name = "TAC report"/&gt; Even on the floor of parliament, 10th August 2018, Pon Radhakrishnan, the minister of state for finance said in response to a question by Dr. Kirit Somaiya that: "Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (SEBI) examination, inter alia, observed that the professor had employed a device/ scheme/ artifice, wherein the confidential and sensitive data provided by NSE was misused in fraudulent manner, which resulted in compromising the integrity of the securities market." Even when Income-Tax authorities raided Ajay Shah’s premises in November 2017, it is alleged that I-T secured some very confidential documents and they also found the budget representations on his computer well before the actual release of budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pgurus.com/p5-six-questions-for-ajay-shah/ | title=P5 - Six Questions for Ajay Shah| date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajay Shah is known to be close to P Chidambaram and was extremely close to K P Krishnan. It is believed that the Finance Ministry was giving a minimum of Rs 1 crore every year to National Institute of Public Finance and Policy for Ajay Shah’s group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/ajay-shah-cambridge-analytica-style-mastermind-financial-markets | title=Ajay Shah: Cambridge Analytica-style mastermind of financial markets| date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TAC report"/&gt; In fact, designing the Nifty-50 for the NSE had made Ajay Shah a popular figure in the Finance Ministry. Ajay Shah and his wife Susan Thomas were paid a substantial royalty every year from the turnover of Nifty trading, which is 80% of the total turnover of the NSE.&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; However, it is unprecedented to give such an annual royalty from research and it is claimed to be a violation of standard industry norm where a one-time payment is given to researchers of any of the market indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/investigation/11764-why-income-tax-officers-are-zeroing-ajay-shah?curator=alphaideas&amp;utm_source=alphaideas | title=Why Income Tax officers are zeroing in on Ajay Shah| date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Brokers-NSE Nexus==
The brokers-NSE nexus came to the forefront with the co-location scandal. The broker entity to receive maximum benefit in the scandal was OPG Securities, which was provided multiple login IPs and allowed access from the secondary servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/2018/05/30/cbi-books-stock-broker-opg-securities-for-manipulating-nse-system#gs.56fqbsY|title=NSE Co-Location Case: CBI Books OPG Securities Owner, Others For Manipulating NSE System|date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/algo-scam-sebirsquos-show-cause-notice-to-nse-14-an-escape-route/50679.html|title=Algo Scam: SEBI’s Show-cause Notice to NSE 14 an Escape Route?|date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to favourable access, OPG Securities and other entities benefited instead of other brokers and their clients. Other firms on the list of 22 brokers who repeatedly logged in early on the NSE servers include: Alpha Grep, SMC Global, Barclays Securities, Kredent, Pace, Religare Securities, NYCE, Motilal Oswal, Kotak Securities, DE Shaw, Crimson, Advent, Mansukh Stock Brokers, JM Global, AB Financial, Indus Broking and Quant Broking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nse-co-location-case-sebi-heat-now-on-brokers-who-logged-in-first-repeatedly-2410971.html|title=NSE co-location case: SEBI heat now on brokers who logged in first repeatedly|date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/nse-co-location-audit-3-brokers-misused-secondary-server-and-ignored-exchange-notification-2782961.html|title=NSE co-location audit: 3 brokers misused secondary server and ignored exchange warning|date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBI investigation revealed that 90% of the time OPG securities, in collusion with unknown officials of the NSE, was first to access the NSE servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/ajay-shah-cambridge-analytica-style-mastermind-financial-markets|title=Ajay Shah: Cambridge Analytica-style mastermind of financial markets|date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEBI’s TAC report also revealed that OPG securities was given access using the co-location facility during 2010-2014 that enabled it to log in to the NSE server before any other entity and receive data before any other broker in the market.&lt;ref name = "FIR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbi.gov.in/firs/2018/2018_pdf/2018_ac1_firs/RC2162018A0011.pdf|title= First Information Report|date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; SEBI has alleged in its show-cause notice that the firm has earned close to ₹ 25 crore in profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/2018/08/21/sebi-co-location-probe-how-much-opg-gained-with-first-access-to-nses-server#gs.DfFpag8|title=SEBI Co-Location Probe: How Much OPG Gained With First Access To NSE's Server|date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the whistle-blower, OPG Securities alone had trades worth over Rs. 6,000 crore on the NSE using co-location.&lt;ref name = "TAC report"/&gt; In addition, the exchange's "order book" was exported to FIIs and FPIs, helping them make illegal gains in the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies-and-markets/letters-whistle-blower-sebi-nse-rot|title=Letters from a whistle-blower to SEBI on NSE rot|date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/investigation/11764-why-income-tax-officers-are-zeroing-ajay-shah|title=Why Income Tax officers are zeroing in on Ajay Shah|date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While OPG Securities used the base technology, Omnesys Technologies provided the trading software. Whistle-blower Ken Fong's letter points to Bangalore-based, front-end technology provider Omnesys, a company that sold trading software to NSE's members and is said to have benefited, legitimately, from its ability to connect ahead of others to the exchange's servers. The whistle-blower states Omnesys was so sure of the early bird strategy that it had profit-sharing arrangements with clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies-and-markets/letters-whistle-blower-sebi-nse-rot|title=Letters from a whistle-blower to SEBI on NSE rot|date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omnesys gave the technology to NSE members on a profit-sharing basis and the NSE’s wholly owned subsidiary secured 26 per cent stake in Omnesys at a huge discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/NSEIL_Annual_Report_2015.pdf|title=National Stock Exchange of India Limited Twenty-Thirds Annual Report (2014-2015)|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitra Ramakrishna, NSE's then-deputy managing director, was sitting on the board of Omnesys technologies according to documents from the registrar of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-nse-bogged-in-negatives-maybe-it-needs-to-put-protocol-first/articleshow/57908993.cms|title=Why is NSE bogged in negatives? Maybe it needs to put protocol first|date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the whistle-blower mentioned in his first letter dated, 14th January 2015, Omnesys was the market leader with its DMA product being highly popular on the institutional desk. This is important since the NSE was the second largest shareholder of Omnesys and worked closely with them for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/blowing-the-whistle-on-manipulation-in-nse/42337.html|title=Blowing the Whistle on Manipulation in NSE|date=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action by Agencies against perpetrators==

===SEBI Action===
In November 2015, the whistle-blower’s letter referred to SEBI’s technical advisory committee (TAC) report that concluded in March 2016, that NSE systems were prone to 'manipulation' and thus recommended an investigation.&lt;ref name = "FIR" /&gt; This was when SEBI directed the new NSE board to conduct a forensic audit of its systems and deposit revenue from co-location trading in an escrow account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/DBJrjsgvbqWNdrcnmFQQGO/Sebi-examining-NSE-directors-role-in-algotrading-investiga.html | title=Sebi examining NSE directors' role in algo-trading investigation| date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a blow to NSE’s plans of going public as the co-location server facility stream accounted for nearly 35–40 per cent of the NSE’s core revenues.&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; The NSE added public interest directors to its board. They include: Ashok Chawla, former finance secretary; Naved Masood, former secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs; TV Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education Services; Dinesh Kanabar, former deputy CEO of KPMG in India, and Dharmishta Raval, former SEBI executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31818&amp;articlexml=In-Second-High-Profile-Exit-Narain-Walks-Away-03062017001057 | title=The Times Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board then appointed Deloitte to conduct a forensic inquiry. The Deloitte report, submitted to SEBI on 23 December 2016, found that the exchange's tick-by-tick (TBT) system was prone to manipulation and restated the findings by the SEBI panel that some stock brokers obtained preferential access to servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/should-nse-be-allowed-to-file-consent-terms-118082000017_1.html | title=Should NSE be allowed to file 'Consent Terms'?| newspaper=Business Standard India| date=2018-08-19| last1=Basu| first1=Debashis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSE also admitted this in its draft prospectus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies-and-markets/letters-whistle-blower-sebi-nse-rot | title=Letters from a whistle-blower to SEBI on NSE rot &amp;#124; mydigitalfc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a written reply, Minister of State for Finance, Arjun Meghwal told the Lok Sabha in 2016: "The architecture of NSE with respect to dissemination of tick-by-tick through transmission control protocol (TCP) or internet protocol (IP) was prone to manipulation or market abuse. And this system has been discontinued by NSE from 3 December 2016."&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; SEBI’s action so far has been to nudge the NSE into conducting investigations by two big global consulting firms, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young, despite the fact that both had a potential conflict of interest, having handled major projects or consulting assignments for the bourse. Ravi Narain, as MD and CEO of the NSE, was also the head of the sub-committee which chose Deloitte for the forensic audit of NSE, despite being fully aware that Deloitte was working on a large project for NSE’s disaster recovery centre (DRC). This was a clear case of conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.outlookbusiness.com/the-big-story/lead-story/perilous-monopoly-3810 | title=Perilous Monopoly &amp;#124; Outlook Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt; In July 2018, SEBI issued a second show cause notice to the NSE, many of its former and existing executives, and senior officials alleged to have violated the SEBI Act, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices and broker regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/2018/07/04/nse-gets-second-show-cause-notice-from-regulator-in-co-location-probe | title=NSE Gets Second Show-Cause Notice from SEBI in Co-Location Probe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notice comes even as the CBI has booked brokers and unidentified officials at the NSE and SEBI for preferential access through the co-location service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/co-location-case-cbi-names-nse-sebi-officials-opg-securities/article24039742.ece | title=Co-location case: CBI names NSE, SEBI officials, OPG Securities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/cbi-books-stock-broker-for-illegal-nse-access/article24039051.ece|title=CBI books stockbroker for illegal NSE access|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2018-05-30|last1=Pandey|first1=Devesh K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the Madras High Court issued notice to SEBI seeking appropriate action against NSE employees for the alleged fraud in co-location services and directed SEBI to file its response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/madras-high-court-puts-sebi-on-notice-in-multicrore-stock-trading-scam/articleshow/65457187.cms | title=Madras high court puts Sebi on notice in multicrore stock trading scam - Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, SEBI will hear this case in the mid of December, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/sebi-to-hear-nse-algo-case-in-december/article25540292.ece|title=SEBI to hear NSE algo case in December|date|2018-11-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid conducted by Income Tax department===
In November 2017, the Income Tax Department (I-T) raided the premises of top former and serving officials of the NSE and its brokers. The I-T Department seized Rs. 11 crore cash from the Delhi residence of Sanjay Gupta, promoter of OPG securities. Officials of the I-T also raided more than 50 OPG group premises in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. Along with cash, some laptops, storage devices and confidential documents were also seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-dept-seizes-rs-11-crore-cash-in-raids-related-to-nse-co-location-case/articleshow/61691871.cms | title=I-T dept seizes Rs.11 crore cash in raids related to NSE co-location case - Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in the media that during the I-T raids one name that repeatedly cropped up was that of Ajay Shah. I-T officials maintain that Ajay Shah developed the algorithm for the company OPG Securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/investigation/11764-why-income-tax-officers-are-zeroing-ajay-shah | title=Why Income Tax officers are zeroing in on Ajay Shah| date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; I-T officials also disclosed that they have gathered reconstructed order books with cash being transmitted to tax havens (preferred by FIIs) like Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands, Mauritius, and Hong Kong — wherever OPG securities had access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/investigation/11764-why-income-tax-officers-are-zeroing-ajay-shah?curator=alphaideas&amp;utm_source=alphaideas | title=Why Income Tax officers are zeroing in on Ajay Shah| date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NSE4" /&gt;
The I-T raid was conducted two days after the NSE submitted reports from forensic auditors EY and the Indian School of Business (ISB) to SEBI. Surprisingly, in their reports, both EY and the ISB exonerated the exchange and its officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/it-raids-on-former-current-nse-officials-even-as-forensic-auditors-give-clean-chit/articleshow/61671549.cms | title=I-T raids on former, current NSE officials even as forensic auditors give clean chit| newspaper=The Economic Times| date=2017-11-16| last1=Narayanan| first1=Dinesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBI action===
On 28th May 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation filed nine-page first information report (FIR) a year after the second whistle- blower, calling himself Jaime Jones, made serious allegations in a letter to the SEBI chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/nse-algo-scam-cbi-steps-in-where-sebi-was-pussyfooting/54193.html | title=NSE Algo Scam: CBI Steps in Where SEBI Was Pussyfooting}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBI then booked unknown officials of the NSE and SEBI, promoter of stock-trading company OPG Securities, Sanjay Gupta, his brother-in-law Aman Kokrady and NIPFP’s professor, Ajay Shah for manipulating NSE servers to get  'preferential' access by using the co-location facility at the NSE. The new element in the FIR was the allegation that Ajay Shah allegedly used his access to data as an academic to build algo-trading software that gave OPG Securities an advantage. CBI booked the case against these individuals for entering into criminal conspiracy, attempting to give and receive bribes, abuse of their official position, unfair access to TBT servers of the NSE for wrongful gain, manipulating the NSE server, and for destroying electronic evidence. CBI has also alleged that Sanjay Gupta and his brother-in-law, were illegally trading in Dubai, Ghana, Singapore, Hong Kong and China through his firm.&lt;ref name = "FIR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/cbi-books-stock-broker-for-illegal-nse-access/article24039051.ece|title=CBI books stockbroker for illegal NSE access|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2018-05-30|last1=Pandey|first1=Devesh K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After filing this case, CBI teams also conducted raids at multiple locations in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.&lt;ref name = "NSE5" /&gt; M. Damodaran, former SEBI chairman made a statement saying, "Having seen reports of the CBI registering a case in connection with NSE's co-location issue, I hope SEBI's dealing with the matter is proceeding at the desired pace. It is important for regulatory credibility that SEBI takes effective action immediately. Since an Exchange is a first-level regulator, it must measure up, and be seen as measuring up, to the highest levels of governance. Failing that, SEBI must take quick corrective action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/nse-algo-scam-cbi-steps-in-where-sebi-was-pussyfooting/54193.html | title=NSE Algo Scam: CBI Steps in Where SEBI Was Pussyfooting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NSE vs. Moneylife Case==

On 8 July 2015, Sucheta Dalal wrote an article on ''Moneylife''{{’}}s portal alleging that certain NSE officials were leaking sensitive data related to HFT or co-location to a select set of market participants so that could trade faster than their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/moneylife%E2%80%99s-nse-expose-why-battle-against-stock-exchange-not-just-their-own-33874|title=Moneylife's NSE Expose|date=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was based on an alleged complaint made to SEBI in January by an official of a Singapore-based hedge fund. The whistle-blower’s first letter came from Singapore and was addressed to BK Gupta, deputy general manager of SEBI, and dated 14 January 2015. It was copied to Sucheta Dalal from ''Moneylife''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/blowing-the-whistle-on-manipulation-in-nse/42337.html|title=Blowing the Whistle on Manipulation in NSE|date=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-location scandal came to light when the NSE filed a defamation suit on 21s July 2015, claiming damages of Rs.100 crore in the Bombay High Court against ''Moneylife'', to stop the publication and circulation of the article. However, the court dismissed the case and asked the NSE to pay Rs.1.5 lakh each to journalists Debashis Basu and Sucheta Dalal. The court also imposed a penalty of Rs.47 lakh on the NSE to be paid in the form of a donation to [[Masina Hospital]] and [[Tata Memorial Centre|Tata Memorial Hospital]] in Mumbai. The court also ordered SEBI to investigate the charges levelled by the whistle-blower.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.moneylife.in/article/nse-withdraws-its-rs100-crore-defamation-suit-against-moneylife-pays-rs50-lakh-as-cost-and-penalty/51608.html|title=NSE withdraws its Rs100 crore defamation suit against Moneylife, pays Rs50 lakh as cost and penalty|date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mir Noori Naseer Khan Brahui '''was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] ([[head of state]]) of the princely state of [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]] in what is now the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]] during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V06_283.gif Baluchistan - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 6, p. 277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''Mir Muhammad Nasir Khan I''' (also known as ''Mir Noori Nasir Khan'') was probably the most powerful of the Khans of Kalat who ruled for 45 years from 1749 to 1794. After an initial unsuccessful revolt against [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in 1758 he later became his most powerful ally and his [[Baloch people|Baloch]] Army fought alongside the [[Afghan]]s of Abdali against the [[Persian people|Persians]], the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and the [[Sikh]]s. The boundaries of the '''Khanate of Kalat''' under Nasir Khan I extended far beyond those of modern Balochistan and included the town of [[Karachi]].

'''Page numbering''' is the process of applying a sequence of numbers (or letters, or roman numerals) to the pages of a book or other document. The number itself, which may appear in various places on the page, can be referred to as a '''page number''' or as a '''folio'''.&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;''[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch01/ch01_sec005.html The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition]'' (2003), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other numbering schemes such as [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] numbering, page numbers allow the [[citation]] of a particular page of the numbered document and facilitates to the reader to find specific parts of the document and to know the size of the complete text (by checking the number of the last page).

==Numbering conventions==
Even numbers usually appear on [[Recto and verso|verso]] pages, while odd numbers appear on [[Recto and verso|recto]] pages. In the printing industry, in cases where odd numbers appear on verso pages and even numbers on recto pages, this is referred to as ''non-traditional folios'' (in the past, it had been referred to as ''Chinese folios'', however this term has fallen out of favor in recent years).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In books, some pages, known as ''blind folios'',&lt;ref name="CMS"/&gt; of the [[front matter]] and [[back matter]] are numbered, but the numbers are not always printed on the pages. Publishers are not consistent about how they number the pages of their books. Some publishers stick with the default numbering of the tool they are using, which is typically to number the first page of the front matter as one and all pages after that in a consecutive order. When publishers wish to distinguish between the front matter and the story, the initial title pages are not numbered, the front matter is numbered using lower-case [[Roman numerals]] (i, ii, iii, etc.) and the first page of the story or main content begins with one. The title page of the story is not numbered, but if a story is broken into multiple parts (Part I, Part II, etc.), the title page for the section may be included in the numbering but not shown on the page. The first page of Chapter One would then be numbered as page three rather than page one as would be the normal case.

The sixteenth edition of the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]''&lt;ref name="CMS"/&gt; calls for the beginning of the text to begin with the Arabic number 1, while the front matter that precedes it is to be numbered with lower-case Roman numerals. If the front matter is extensive and a second half-title page is included, it is to be numbered as page one and its verso as page two. If a part title is included, it is to be included in the same numbering as the text. Page numbers do not appear on part titles. Most citation systems also call for the identification of the page number from which a quote or point is drawn. For example, such usage is specified in their citation formats of both the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition'' (2003), pp. 596, 598.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Bluebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, Seventeenth Edition'' (2000), pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-books]] and other electronic documents published in a non-[[Reflowable document|reflowable format]] such as [[PDF]] are normally [[Pagination|paginated]] and numbered in the same way as their printed counterparts.

While reading devices for reflowable documents such as [[EPUB]] e-books may display page numbers, these numbers change from device to device depending on factors such as the size of the display and the selected font size. This makes them unsuitable for citation purposes. To remedy this problem, [[Amazon Kindle]] e-books contain what are called "location numbers", that is, numbers in the margin of the electronic text that indicate where the corresponding page begins in the printed version of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pogue|first=David|title=Page Numbers for Kindle Books an Imperfect Solution|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/|accessdate=9 July 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]], "Pogue's Post" blog|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
In [[codicology]], each physical sheet (''folium'', abbreviated ''fol.'' or ''f.'') of a manuscript is numbered, and the sides are referred to as ''folium [[recto and verso|rectum]]'' and ''folium [[recto and verso|versum]]'', abbreviated as ''r'' and ''v'' respectively. This results in designations like ''5r'' (the front side of the fifth sheet), or ''8v'' (the back side of the eighth sheet).

The '''Rhön Club''' ({{lang-de|Rhönklub}}) is an inter-state local history and rambling club in [[Bavaria]], [[Hesse]] and [[Thuringia]], with around 25,000&amp;nbsp;members in 88&amp;nbsp;branches and is one of the larger German rambling clubs in the Association of German Alpine and Rambling Clubs (''Verband Deutscher Gebirgs- und Wandervereine'').

== Aims ==
The club was founded on 6 August 1876 in [[Gersfeld]] with the aim of opening up the [[Rhön Mountains]] as a hiking and rambling area. Its aim today is the conservation of the valuable natural and cultural countryside of the Rhön from a number of ecological viewpoints, especially:

* the preservation of rare plants
* the care of native animals and the general protection of wildlife
* the conservation of valuable cultural sites
* the fostering of local customs
* the preservation of local folk songs
* the knowledgeable speaking of the dialect
* the care of old cultural objects

== History ==
=== Gründung ===

[[File:RK Wegweiser unterhalb Fuldaquelle.png|thumb|Wegweiser: Wanderwege des Rhönklubs nahe der Fuldaquelle]]
Am 6.&amp;nbsp;August 1876 kam es auf Anregung des Fuldaer Arztes [[Justus Schneider]] (1842–1904) in Gersfeld zur Gründung des Rhönklubs. Da in anderen Gegenden Deutschlands bereits Gebirgsvereine gegründet waren, fasste er den Entschluss, zur Gründung eines Rhönklubs aufzurufen.

Die Einladung zur Gründungsversammlung hatte folgenden Wortlaut:

:{{Zitat|Wenn auch die Rhön unstreitig eines der schönsten Gebirge Deutschlands ist, so wird es doch von Fremden noch verhältnismäßig wenig besucht. Die Reisenden halten das Gebirge für unwirthlich, rauh und kalt und scheuen wegen angeblichen Mangels an Verkehrswegen und comfortablen Gasthäusern den Besuch. Wir halten es als Freunde des Gebirges für unsere Pflicht, den vermeintlichen und wirklichen Mißständen, die sich dem Besuche der Touristen hinderlich zeigen, entgegenzutreten und suchen, dieses durch Bildung eines Rhönklubs zu erreichen. Aufgabe desselben soll sein, die Gebirgswege zu verbessern, Wegweiser zu errichten, Aussichtspunkte und Ruheplätze herzustellen, Führer auszubilden und auf Verbesserung der Gasthäuser einzuwirken, sodann auch durch Wort und Schrift für den Besuch der Rhön zu wirken und zu werben. Der Rhönklub soll in allen in der Rhön und deren Umgebung liegenden Orten Mitglieder zu gewinnen suchen; die Geldmittel sollen durch regelmäßige Beiträge, deren Höhe dem Belieben derselben anheim gegeben ist, beschafft werden. Wir wollen deshalb eine allgemeine Partie nach Gersfeld, als möglichst centralem Orte, auf den 6. August 1876 veranstalten. Dortselbst sollen die Erschienenen sich als Generalversammlung constituieren und ein definitives Comite wählen, dem die Leitung des Vereins übertragen wird. Wir laden Sie zu dieser Partie ein und bitten, im Kreise Ihrer Bekannten für die Beteiligung an derselben und für den Beitritt zum Rhönklub zu wirken. Zeit und Local der Versammlung werden durch die Blätter veröffentlicht werden. Am Nachmittag findet ein Ausflug auf den großen Nallen statt.|Einladung zur Gründungsversammlung 1876}}

Obwohl die Rhön schon immer ein „geteiltes“ Land war, fanden sich aus 16 Orten weit mehr Rhönfreunde in Gersfeld ein, als erwartet. Der Rhönklub wurde mit großer Begeisterung gegründet, Justus Schneider wurde der erste Präsident und Fulda Sitz des Vereins. Die Vertreter der 16 anwesenden Städte und Dörfer gründeten zeitnah „Sektionen“ &lt;small&gt;(heute Zweigvereine)&lt;/small&gt;.

Die Zahl der „Sektionen“ und die Zahl der Mitglieder wuchsen ständig. Ein besonderes Anliegen war es dem Präsidenten, allen Bewohnern der Rhön zu dienen. Die Zugehörigkeit zu den drei Ländern [[Preußen]], Bayern und Thüringen, warf erhebliche Probleme auf, der Rhönklub verbindet bis heute die Bewohner.

=== Toten-Ehrenmal ===
[[File:Rhoenklub-Gedaenkstaette.jpg|thumb|Gedenkstätte auf dem Heidelstein in der Rhön]]
Die Idee zum Toten-Ehrenmal auf dem Heidelstein entstand 1923, es wurde im selben Jahr eingeweiht. Jährlich im September wird dort der Verstorbenen des Rhönklubs im Rahmen der „Heidelsteinfeier“ gedacht.

=== Frühe Jahre ===

Im Jahre 1926 zählte der Rhönklub 70 Zweigvereine. Ein großes Wanderwegenetz war aufgebaut worden, auf den Bergen entstanden Rhönklubhütten. Der Volksschullehrer [[Karl Straub (Rhönvater)|Karl Straub]] hatte 1929 erstmals im Auftrag des Hauptvorstandes des Rhönklubs einen Rhönkalender herausgegeben, der bis heute jährlich aufgelegt wird.

=== Zweiter Weltkrieg und die Nachkriegsjahre ===

Bei Ausbruch des [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieges]] übernahm [[Oswald Milker]] die Vereinsführung und er rettete den Rhönklub über die Zeit des Nationalsozialismus. Er musste sich 1941 in ''„Rhönbund“'' umbenennen, und das eigenständige Vereinsleben kam zum Erliegen, aber er überlebte.

Nach dem Zusammenbruch des Dritten Reiches ruhte jegliche Vereinstätigkeit in Deutschland. Bereits 1946 erschien die erste Nummer der Rhönwacht als einfaches Doppelblatt. Nur noch 3000 Mitglieder zählte der Gesamtverein. 16 Zweigvereine in Thüringen wurden in der DDR als „faschistische Vereine“ verboten. Der „Eiserne Vorhang“ trennte den Verein. Ostflüchtlinge kamen in die Rhön, ihnen gab der Verein eine neue Heimat.

Der fünfte Präsident Josef Hans Sauer schuf den Posten des Hauptkulturwartes. Der Rhönklub dürfe nicht nur ein Wanderverein sein, sondern müsse sich auch um die Erhaltung der traditionellen Kulturgüter der Rhönheimat bemühen.

1976 zählte der Rhönklub in 71 Zweigvereinen über 15.000 Mitglieder. [[Alfons Lühn]], der sechste Präsident, steigerte die Mitgliederzahl. Er setzte eine Satzungsänderung durch, der zufolge dem Naturschutz eine größere Bedeutung beigemessen werden konnte.

Nach seinem Ausscheiden übernahm 1989 mit [[Regina Rinke]] erstmals eine Frau aus dem bayerischen Teil der Rhön die Leitung des Rhönklubs.

=== Wiedervereinigung ===

1989 vollzog sich die politische Wende, für den Rhönklub bedeutete die Einheit Deutschlands die Öffnung nach Thüringen. Spontan entstanden in 19 Orten Thüringens neue oder auch alte Rhönklub-Zweigvereine. Die erste Gründung erfolgte bereits am 6.&amp;nbsp;Dezember 1989 in Oberalba. Am 28.&amp;nbsp;Dezember 1989 gründete sich der Zweigverein Dermbach wieder, der 1876 bereits zu den Gründungsvereinen gezählt hatte.

=== Deutscher Wandertag 2008 in der Rhön ===

Vom 26.&amp;nbsp;bis 30.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2008 veranstaltete der Rhönklub in Fulda und der Rhön den 108.&amp;nbsp;[[Deutscher Wandertag|Deutschen Wandertag]] unter dem Motto „Wandern &amp; Mehr“.

== Gliederung ==
[[File:BY SodenBg 04 2007 Gipfel2.JPG|thumb|Gedenkstein „Rhön Klub Zweigverein Hammelburg 1876–1988“ im [[Naturschutzgebiet Sodenberg-Gans|NSG Sodenberg-Gans]]]]
Die 88 Zweigvereine gehören dem Hauptverband an. Bereits am Beginn des 20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhunderts hatte der Rhönklub zur Verwaltungsvereinfachung das Gebiet der Rhön in [[Gau (Landschaft)|Gau]]e eingeteilt. Es gab einen Nord-Ost-Gau, einen Nord-West-Gau, einen Süd-Ost Gau und einen Süd-West-Gau. Später entschied man sich zur Umbenennung und benannte die Gaunamen nach den Flüssen der Rhön. Durch den Wegfall des Werragaues (in der ehemaligen DDR gelegen) kam es nach dem Krieg zur Gründung des [[Ulster (Werra)|Ulster]]gaues. In 2008 wurden die Gaue in Regionen umbenannt. 2011 fusionierten die Regionen Saale und Sinn zur Region Saale/Sinn. So gibt es nun die Region [[Werra]], Region [[Fulda (Fluss)|Fulda]], Region [[Saale]]/[[Sinn (Fluss)|Sinn]], Region [[Ulster (Werra)|Ulster]].

== Rhönwacht ==
Das erste Erscheinen der Vereinszeitschrift „Die Rhön“ (zwischenzeitlich „Rhönwacht“) fiel in die Amtszeit des zweiten Präsidenten Hugo Pfeiffer. Seit 1912 erscheint diese Zeitschrift vierteljährlich. Ihre Herausgabe wurde nur kurz durch die beiden Kriege unterbrochen. Weil es eine Webseite der Musikgruppe "Rhoenwacht" gibt, über die rechtsradikales Liedgut verbreitet wird, wurde die Zeitschrift 2008 in ''DIE RHÖN - WANDERN &amp; MEHR'' umbenannt.

'''Russophilia''' (literally love of [[Russia]] or [[Russians]]) is individual or collective admiration and fond of Russia, [[Russian history]] and [[Russian culture]], especially someone who is sympathetic to the political system and customs of the former Soviet Union or who exhibits Russian nationalism in spite of not even being either an ethnic Russian or a Russian citizen. The opposite of Russophilia is [[Russophobia]].

==Russophilia in Europe==
Russophilia in other European countries may be based on [[stereotype]]s produced by [[media culture|mass culture]] ("traditional Russian hospitality", "Russian tenderness" etc.),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} as well as on in-depth study of Russian mentality, as expressed, e.g., by American author Robert Alexander: "I love Russians for their dramatic, emotional nature. They're not afraid to love, not afraid to get hurt, not afraid to exaggerate or act impulsively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusoffagency.com/authors/alexander_r/kitchen_boy/kitchen_boy_reading_guide.htm|title=Book Group Guide - Rusoff Agency|website=Rusoffagency.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the [[Gallup Poll|International Gallup Organization]] announced the results of its poll,&lt;ref name=HelsSan&gt;''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', October 11, 2004, [http://www.hs.fi/english/article/International+poll+Anti-Russian+sentiment+runs+very+strong+in+Finland/1076154202275 International poll: Anti-Russian sentiment runs very strong in Finland. Only [[Kosovo]] has more negative attitude]&lt;/ref&gt; according to which approximately 20% of the residents of [[Western Europe]] viewed Russia positively, with the most positive view coming from [[Iceland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The percentage of respondents expressing a positive attitude towards Russia was 9% in [[Finland]], [[Turkey]], and [[Japan]], 38% in [[Lithuania]], 36% in [[Latvia]], and 34% in [[Estonia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Estonia and especially Latvia have a large number of ethnic Russians, which likely affected the result.

==Russophilia in Serbia and Montenegro==

===Russophilia in Serbia===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Russia is hugely popular in Serbia, and [[Serbs]] have always traditionally seen Russia as a close ally due to shared [[Slavs|Slavic]] culture and Orthodox faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crms.org.rs/zasto-je-putin-toliko-popularan-u-srbiji/|title=Зашто је Путин толико популаран у Србији? – Центар за развој међународне сарадње|website=crms.org.rs|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbia and Montenegro, whose nations are both predominately [[Eastern Orthodox]], the faith expressed by a vast majority of Russians, there was no Soviet influence and Russians were always seen as friendly brotherly people.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} About 83% of Serbs see Russia as their first ally on the international scene.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In both Serbia and Montenegro, there are neighbourhoods, streets, buildings and statues named after something Russian.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In Serbia there is the Russian Centre of Science and Culture and [[Hotel Moskva (Belgrade)|Hotel Moskva]].

===Russophilia in Montenegro===
Montenegro is also an [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] country. There is the [[Moscow bridge|Moscow Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidvodic.com/info_podgorica_turisticke-atrakcije_moskovski-most|title=Moscow bridge in Podgorica|website=Androidvodic.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Podgorica]], and a statue of Russian singer and actor [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] next to the bridge.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Russophilia in Ukraine==
Following [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1991 Ukrainians, mostly in the [[East Ukraine|east]] and [[South Ukraine|south]] of the country, voted to a see a more Russophile attitude of the government, ranging from closer economic partnership to full national union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/files/sp/SP90.pdf|title=Ethnic Reidentification in Ukraine (page 17)|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|first=Stephen|last=Rapawy|year=1997|location=Washington, D.C.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/1997/demo/sp90.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] the overall attitude of Ukrainians towards Russia and Russians has become much more negative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/10/18/how-ukraine-views-russia-and-the-west/ How Ukraine views Russia and the West], [[Brookings Institution]] (October 18, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Ukraine===
{{Main|Western Ukrainian Russophiles}}
'''Russophilia''' (Moscophilia, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: москвофільство, ''moskvofil’stvo'') was a linguistic, literary and socio-political movement in the Western [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] territories of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]], and [[Bukovyna]] in the 18th - 20th centuries. Proponents of this movement believed in linguistic, cultural, social union with Russian people and later in state union with Russia. Among the causes for the emergence of this phenomenon were the absence of Ukrainian statehood, centuries of foreign oppression, fragmented Ukrainian territories and dispersed population, as well as the defection of national elite to neighbouring cultures and a weak sense of national identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Russophile Movement in Transcarpathia===
The first instances of Russophilia in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] date back as far as late 18th early 19th centuries when several famous Russians with ties to the government and the court of the tsar settled there. Such famous scientists and social activists as [[I. Orlai]], [[M. Baludiansky]], [[P. Lodiy]] and others lived in Transcarpathia and maintained close ties with the country of their birth and thereby promoted interest towards Russia, especially towards its cultural life, its language and literature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Russophile Movement in Galicia and Bukovyna===
When [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Bukovyna]] were incorporated into the [[Habsburg Empire]] in 1772 the Austrian government treated the Ukrainian population of these territories with suspicion as it was afraid it was susceptible to Russian influence due to the closeness of Ukrainian and Russian languages and cultures. This mistrust of the authorities was cultivated by influential Polish politicians and activists in an effort to forestall the growth of national consciousness on territories where Poles traditionally had influence. Any attempt at cultural revival was met with hostility from the Austrian government which regarded them as an influence from Moscow. In spite of this atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion the first educational establishment "The Fellowship of Priests" was founded in [[Przemyśl]]. Metropolitan M. Levytsky began to introduce the [[Ruthenian language]] in elementary schools, developed grammar books, insisted on instruction in University in Ruthenian and founded "Ruska Troyka" Society.  The [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]], after [[World War I]], attempted to join [[Lemko]] territories to Russia, and later to similar areas of the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The '''Sara people''' are Nilotes originating from the Upper Nile.  They predominantly reside in southern [[Chad]], the northwestern areas of the [[Central African Republic]], and the southern border of North [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sara Sara people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Sara languages]], a dialect or sub-group of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/17/subgroups/sara/ Sara languages], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; They are also the largest [[Ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic group in Chad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html Chad: Society and People], CIA Factbook, US Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Zuchora-Walske|title=Chad in Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkB1GaR2SXEC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century|isbn=978-1-57505-956-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara oral histories add further details about the people. In summary, the Sara are mostly animists (veneration of nature), with a social order made up of several patrilineal clans formerly united into a single polity with a national language, national identity, and national religion. Many Sara people have retained their ethnic religion, but some have converted to Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p510"/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Charirivermap.png|thumb|left|180px|Many Sara people live in the region southeast of [[Lake Chad]], which is irrigated by the Chari and Logone rivers.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p510"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stuart Olson|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA510|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===In Chad===
The Sara (Kameeni) are the largest ethnic group in the Republic of Chad, they're concentrated in the [[Moyen-Chari Region|Moyen-Chari]], the [[Logone Oriental Region|Logone Oriental]], the [[Logone Occidental Region|Logone Occidental]], and parts of the [[Tandjilé Region|Tandjile]] regions. They're originally from the Nile valley and migrated towards what is now Chad during the sixteenth century AD, seeking refuge in the south against northern [[Arab slave trade|Muslim slave raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.our-africa.org/chad/history-politics&lt;/ref&gt;{{notinref|date=October 2017}} After their arrival, they continued to be the target of violent raids by northern [[Fula people|Fulani]] and [[Arab]] people.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p510"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Azevedo&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Twee Sara mannen met gezichtsscarificaties TMnr 60033953.jpg|thumb|180px|Body scarring rituals to create lifelong body art have long been a part of Sara culture and acts as a means of affirming solidarity; both men and women subscribe to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Zamora et al (1981), [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED241392.pdf#page=139 Image and Reality in African Interethnic Relations: The Fulbe and their Neighbors], US Department of Education, pages 136-137, 162-167&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The local Muslim groups of what is now Chad, referred to the Sara as ''"Kirdi"'', with the term "Kirdi" denoting a non-Muslim person. The Muslim raiders of what is now Chad were autonomously called ''"Bagirmi"'', and this geo-political conflict between the ''Kirdi'' and the ''Bagirmi'' continued through the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=levinsonsara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gateseoa254"/&gt;

The French colonial empire entered the ongoing hostilities in the early twentieth century, and the Sara people became a part of the French Equatorial Africa, more specifically as part of the ''"1e Tchad utile"''. The Sara society was transformed by this development, both in terms of culture such as French-based education and training, but also socio-economically because of forced labor and conscription to serve the French military during the World Wars.&lt;ref name=levinsonsara/&gt; At the time of independence from France in 1960, the southerners of Chad were more assimilated into French institutions than the northerners.&lt;ref name=levinsonsara&gt;{{cite book|title = The Encyclopedia of World Cultures - 10 Volume set, 1st Edition|author=David Levinson|publisher= Gale|isbn= 978-0816118403|chapter=Sara|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to their political dominance of the country after 1960. They were also a part of the civil war with populations in north and central Chad, each population aligning with a different ideology.&lt;ref name="Gateseoa254"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Central African Republic===
The Sara people make up ten per cent of the population of the [[Central African Republic]], making it the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. They live in the northwest part of CAR.

==Languages==
The Sara people natively speak the [[Sara languages]]. This dialect cluster belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.

==Genetics==
Analysis of classic genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms by Excoffier et al. (1987) found that the Sara are most closely related to the [[Kunama people]] of [[Eritrea]]. Both populations speak languages from the Nilo-Saharan family. They are also similar to West African populations, but biologically distinct from the surrounding [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Excoffier, Laurent, et al.|title=Genetics and history of sub-Saharan Africa|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=1987|volume=30|pages=151–194|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:14816/ATTACHMENT01|accessdate=1 September 2016|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330300510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Si La''' (also '''Sila''' or '''Syla''') are an [[ethnic group]] of about 1,800 people living in northern [[Laos]] and another 600 living in [[Lai Châu Province]], [[Northwest (Vietnam)|Northwest]] region, [[Vietnam]].

== Culture ==
The Si La people speak a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] closely related to [[Hani language|Hani]] (Edmondson 2002). Their primary occupation is the cultivation of [[cereal]]s, augmented by [[hunting]] and [[foraging]]. One of the most distinctive Si La customs is [[tooth painting]]: men traditionally painted their teeth red, while women painted theirs black. The custom is increasingly uncommon among the younger generation.

[[Honduras]] has experienced a long history of changing social conditions, beginning with the bands of foragers in ancient times, through the development of complex societies in the Pacific coast side of the [[isthmus]], and evolving through the innovations introduced by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the colonial period.  

Post colonial Honduras continued many of the colonial social structures and institutions, with major additions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as major foreign companies pioneered new modes of producing export products and systems of controlling labor.  More recent trends in [[industrialization]] have also had important effects.

== Summary ==

Honduras faces enormous challenges in the areas of [[crime]] and [[human rights]] and improving overall economic and [[Living Conditions|living conditions]] in one of the hemisphere’s poorest countries. The [[United States]] has a close relationship with Honduras, characterized by significant foreign assistance, an important trade partnership, a military presence in the country, and cooperation on a range of transnational issues. 

A U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with five [[Central America|Central American]] countries was signed on May 28, 2004, and a combined U.S.-[[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement|Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA) was signed on August 5, 2004. The [[Honduran Congress]] approved the agreement on March 3, 2005, by a vote of 124-4. The Bush Administration views DR-CAFTA as a means of solidifying democracy in Honduras and promoting safeguards for [[environmental protection]] and [[labor rights]] in the country. 

Critics fear that a CAFTA without strong environmental and labor provisions would do nothing to spur reforms in the country. For additional information, see CRS Report RL31870, The Dominican Republic.-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DRCAFTA); and CRS Report RL32322, Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] in the Context of the Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;For more info visit: https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/47138.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social history ==
=== Early history ===

The indigenous people of Honduras developed stratified societies in some regions very early, and much of the earliest period conditions were shaped by its division into unequally represented social groups, in which some economic exploitation took place.  Documentation, limited as it was from Maya sites confirms this inequality which is also observed archaeologically.

Early Spanish reports likewise speak of inequities in the society, and the Spanish tended to exacerbate these.  The [[encomienda]] system while it initially drew heavily on the older systems of taxation and labor employment used by indigenous polities, added new elements.  The mining economy, at first drawing on laborers from the encomiendas, increasing used slave labor in the late sixteenth century, and then as the mines were depleted, also turned back to wage labor.

===Twentieth Century===

In the last years of the nineteenth century, Honduran governments sought to encourage economic growth by creating incentives for foreign concerns to operate in the country.  The involvement of such companies as [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]], [[Standard Fruit Company|Standard Fruit]] and others in the northern sections of the country led to concentration of landholdings, the emergence of a class of [[United States|North American]] managers living in separate quarters on estates, and the importation of migrant workers from the [[English-speaking Caribbean|English-Speaking Caribbean]] and elsewhere in Central America altered the pattern of small holding farming that had prevailed in the region before.  Many of the new workers were housed in barracks, frequently came without families and were subject to strict discipline.

Beginning in the late 1970s, new foreign concerns began the introduction of [[maquiladora]]s, larger more modern factories to produce textiles and other goods.  They were particularly interested in using the labor of young females, to the point that in much of the industry female workers outnumber male by as much as two-to-one.  This imbalance in employment has led increasingly to problems with the often unemployed males, and led to a concomitant growth of gangs and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adrienne |last=Pine |title=Working Hard, Drinking Hard: On Violence and Survival in Honduras |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-25543-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Substance abuse, at first primarily alcohol, and later hard drugs (especially as the international drug trade has made use of Honduras for the transit of drugs) have created their own problems.

}}The '''Hampton Institute''' ('''HI''') is an American "[[working-class]] [[think tank]]" that was founded in 2013.&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/au.html|title=About the Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to traditional [[think tanks]], the HI is a virtual organization that does not have a physical location and does not seek to provide specific policy analysis for political parties. For organizational purposes, its official location is in [[Albany, New York]] with a main address located in [[Clifton Park, New York]], a suburb of Albany. Current chairpersons are located throughout the United States (including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Oregon, Hawaii, and California), as well as Canada (Montreal) and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/ht.html|title=The Hampton Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HI was founded by Colin Jenkins, a [[libertarian socialist]], with the purpose of giving a platform to everyday, working-class people to theorize, comment, analyze and discuss matters that exist outside the confines of their daily lives, yet greatly impact them on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/au.html|title=Q &amp; A with Colin Jenkins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is named after former Black Panther [[Fred Hampton]] and also cites inspiration from Italian Marxist theorist [[Antonio Gramsci]] and educator and philosopher [[Paulo Freire]].&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution1"/&gt; In order to remain consistent with their working-class billing, the HI claims to seek [[organic intellectual]]s as opposed to traditional intellectuals and scholars.  In an interview from 2013, Jenkins even went as far as saying that "credentials are products of privilege" and "essentially mean nothing".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whataboutpeace.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-hampton-institute.html|title=What About Peace?: The Hampton Institute|first=Devon|last=Db|date=20 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, some members of the Hampton Team, as well as some contributors, possess [[PhDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/oc.html|title=Our Contributors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational makeup and approach==

The organization consists of sixteen departments, each with corresponding chairpersons, as well as a sub-department listed under "Current Projects" which includes a Director of Projects, Actions, and Activism. The sixteen departments are: Criminal Justice, Ecology &amp; Sustainability, Education, Geopolitics, Indigenous Rights, Labor Issues, [[LGBTQ]] Rights, Race &amp; Ethnicity, Resistance Art, Social Economics, Social Movement Studies, Society &amp; Culture, Spirituality &amp; Religion, Urban Issues, and Women's Issues.

Some of the current team, including Jason Williams, Andrew Gavin Marshall, Derek Ide, Cherise Charleswell, Sean Posey, Devon Douglas-Bowers, Jeriah Bowser, and Eyad Alkurabi are founding members. The HI operates a publishing wing ('''Hampton Institute Press'''), a blog (The HI blog), and a bi-monthly podcast (A Different Lens) which is run by the Politics &amp; Government department chairperson, Devon Douglas-Bowers. The organization also maintains a presence on social media, including Facebook (The Hampton Institute) and Twitter (@HamptonThink).

Its operational structure is run as a collective, cooperative, and [[Non-hierarchical Organization]]. From its founding in 2013 until August 2018, the HI has operated on an all-volunteer basis. Jenkins commented on the organization's approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In terms of approach, the HI attempts to begin to fill the historical void of which Gramsci once termed, "Organic Intellectualism" – the collective politicization and critical analysis of and from the working class itself. The HI is indifferent to traditional structures dominated by the pedigreed and privileged [[intelligentsia]].  Our members are passionate and probing members of the common... [we believe] intelligent analysis exists throughout the socioeconomic spectrum, and the only thing that separates those who own a public voice and those who do not is varying degrees of privilege.  "Credentials" essentially mean nothing because they are typically nothing more than products of privilege; and for that reason alone, perspectives and analyses coming from those credentials/privilege are often presented in a way that opposes the public-at-large (the working class). The HI seeks to challenge this embedded, highly-controlled and top-down mode of inquiry by offering an alternative, organic and bottom-up viewpoint."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Political orientation==

The organization does not claim an official political or ideological orientation other than "working class." Some of the members - including Marshall, Jenkins and Bowser - have openly identified with [[anarchist philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/brenan-daniels-the-question-of-hierarchy-an-interview-with-colin-jenkins&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins has also cited [[Marxism]] as a strong influence, and is a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], an international labor union that prescribes to "revolutionary industrial unionism," with ties to both socialist and anarchist labor movements. Derek Ide identifies as a [[socialist]], stating, "I am a socialist, and I'm deeply rooted in that intellectual and political tradition broadly speaking. However, I do not identify with any of the particular subsets of Marxist schools of thought, but my view of history and the world is largely materialist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/derek-ide.html|title=Get to Know: Derek Ide I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Posey describes himself as [[anti-war]] and "situated on the Left, politically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/sean-posey.html|title=Get to Know: Sean Posey I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his political orientation, Bowser wrote, "I am not a huge fan of labels, as they tend to isolate and exclude rather than invite and include, but the ideological worlds I tend to find myself in most often include [[Deep Ecology]], [[Anarcho-primitivism]], [[Anarcho-communism]], [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Anti-psychiatry]], and [[Christian Agnosticism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/jeriah-bowser.html|title=Get to Know: Jeriah Bowser I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek R. Ford states that he is a [[Communist]], which, he says, "means being... a dialectical-materialist and a member of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/derek-ford.html#.VPdQpy73Szd|title=Get to Know: Derek R. Ford I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former chair, [[Jonathan Mathias Lassiter]], explained, "My work is inherently political as it focuses on principles and opinions. However, I am not aligned with any political party nor am I am against any particular political party. I am not interested in political parties or politics in the common sense of the word but am more concerned with pursuing love and justice for the whole of humanity with a specific focus on marginalized populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/jonathan-mathias-lassiter.html|title=Get to Know: Jonathan Mathias Lassiter I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former chair, Syard Evans, has said, "Despite my disgust for politics and traditional political systems, working in the non-profit human services realm for the past 15 years requires that I am an active advocate for individuals I support in every way possible, including politically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/syard-evans.html|title=Get to Know: Syard Evans I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the political system in the United States, Jenkins said, "I view both parties (Democrats and Republicans) as "two wings of the same (corporate) business party."  Both represent moneyed interests, and not the interests of the large majority."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Hampton Institute Press==

The organization operates a small publishing wing for the purpose of producing books in both print and digital form.  Their first title, ''Egypt's Past and Potential: Nationalism, Neoliberalism, and Revolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Egypts-Past-Potential-Nationalism-Neoliberalism/dp/0991313607/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418845878&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=egypt's%20past%20and%20potential|title=Egypt's Past and Potential: Nationalism, Neoliberalism, and Revolution|first=Derek A.|last=Ide|date=24 January 2014|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Social Movement Studies chairperson Derek Ide.  The book was published in January of 2014. The synopsis of the book reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Egypt's Past and Potential'' grapples with the complex political, economic, and social dynamics that led to Egypt's historic revolution of 2011. Utilizing a critical framework, author Derek Ide analyzes the country's development ranging from Nasser-era nationalism to the decades of neoliberal "reform" in order to situate the revolutionary uprising of 2011 in its appropriate historical context. The book also draws out the unique and often overlooked working class tradition in Egypt which both predated the January 25th revolution and, contrary to the common sense of many Western commentators, played a significant role in it. This timely book delivers a cogent analysis as events in Egypt continue to unfold, and provides a historical backdrop to help readers understand the economic pressures, dialectical conflicts, and social movements that intersect to shape Egyptian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Egypts-Past-Potential-Nationalism-Neoliberalism-ebook/dp/B00HYPRERQ|title=Egypt's Past and Potential: Nationalism, Neoliberalism, and Revolution|first=Derek|last=Ide|date=19 January 2014|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2014, Hampton's Press published their first annual reader duly titled, ''The 2015 Hampton Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/2015-Hampton-Reader-Institute-Working-Class/dp/0991313615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417987916&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=2015%20hampton%20reader|title=The 2015 Hampton Reader: Selected Essays and Analyses from the Hampton Institute: A Working-Class Think Tank|first=Colin|last=Jenkins|date=5 December 2014|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of essays from the organization's first year in existence, and includes at least four exclusive essays:
* Housing Works: A Trans Analysis, by Jonathan Mathias Lassiter
* From Class to Privilege: A Post-Industrial Marxist Analysis, by Colin Jenkins
* Planning Without Precedent: The Fate of Neighborhoods in America's Fastest Shrinking City (Youngstown, Ohio), by Sean Posey
* Millennium Development Goals: A Focus on Women, by Cherise Charleswell

A third title, ''Elements of Resistance: Violence, Nonviolence, and the State'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Resistance-Violence-Nonviolence-State/dp/0991313623/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423949924&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=elements%20of%20resistance|title=Elements of Resistance: Violence, Nonviolence, and the State|first=Jeriah|last=Bowser|date=13 February 2015|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jeriah Bowser, was published in February 2015. The synopsis of the book reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our world is full of ideas about the way that humans should live. Some of these ideas create a more beautiful and equal world that we all want to live in, while other ideas create violence, hatred, inequality, and suffering. Some of us care an awful lot about beautiful ideas; we care enough to fight for them and spend our lives working towards them, and we care enough to resist. Resistance takes many forms, however, and there are many ideas about the most effective and correct ways to resist.

''Elements of Resistance'' attempts to transcend the false binary of nonviolent and violent resistance, and looks at the heart and soul of what it means to resist, why we resist, and what some different methods of effective resistance might look like. Drawing from recent work by social theorists and activists such as Derrick Jensen, Ward Churchill, Shane Claiborne, Johann Galtung, and Peter Gelderloos, as well as the work of Frantz Fanon, Henry Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mohandas Gandhi, this book is an exploration into the history, theory, and necessity of resistance to oppression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Elements of Resistance'' received positive reviews from author and radical environmentalist, [[Derrick Jensen]], as well as from anarchist and [[primitivist]] philosopher, [[John Zerzan]]. Jensen called the book "an important contribution to a necessary conversation," while Zerzan noted that it goes beyond "just a survey of thinking on the perennial violence/non-violence debate" to form "a very strong contribution."

In December 2015, Hampton's Press published their second annual reader, ''The 2016 Hampton Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/2016-Hampton-Reader-Institute-Working-Class/dp/099131364X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449430593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2016%20hampton%20reader|title=The 2016 Hampton Reader: Selected Essays and Analyses from the Hampton Institute: A Working-Class Think Tank|first=Colin|last=Jenkins|date=6 December 2015|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of sixty-one essays from the organization's second year in existence, and includes at least four exclusive essays:
* Falsehoods and Shattered Dreams: The Dark Side of For-Profit Colleges, by Devon Douglas-Bowers
* Communist Pedagogy and the Contradictions of Capital, by Curry Malott
* American Gracchi, by Dr. Nicholas Partyka
* Is There Room for Decolonial, Transnational, and Radical Feminist Discourse in Pop Culture Feminism?, by Cherise Charleswell

==A Different Lens podcast==

The HI operates a podcast called "A Different Lens" for the purpose of conducting and broadcasting audio interviews with members and notable others.  The podcast was initiated and is run by Politics &amp; Government chairperson, [[Devon Douglas-Bowers]], who also conducts the interviews.  The most notable guests to date have been former Black Panther and [[black anarchist]] [[Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin]]; political cartoonist, editorialist and activist [[Stephanie McMillan]]; geopolitical analyst Prof. Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya; independent journalist [[Rania Khalek]]; noted co-founder of [[Reaganomics]], [[Paul Craig Roberts]]; founder of [[Mint Press News]], [[Mnar A. Muhawesh]]; author and historian [[Michael Parenti]]; Israeli journalist [[Gideon Levy]]; [[Philip Giraldi]]; [[Socialist Party USA]] 2016 Presidential Candidate [[Mimi Soltysik]], and scientist [[Guy McPherson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/auteur124226.html?lang=en|title=Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya [Voltaire Network]|first=Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, Voltaire|last=Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adifferentlens.libsyn.com/|title=A Different Lens: The Hampton Institute's Podcast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projects==

* Geopolitics chairperson Andrew Gavin Marshall operates an initiative known as ''The People's Book Project,'''&lt;ref name="thepeoplesbookproject.com"&gt;http://thepeoplesbookproject.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which is described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an independent initiative to crowd-source funding for a research and writing project, aiming to produce a series of books which take a radical look at the ideas, institutions, and individuals of power and resistance. The books aim to study power and people: what is the nature of our society, how did we get here, who brought us here, why, where are we going, when will we get there, and what can we do to change it?&lt;ref name="thepeoplesbookproject.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''Applying Poulantzas''' is a research project by Colin Jenkins that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...analyzes the work of Greek Marxist political sociologist, [[Nicos Poulantzas]], and applies it to the unique political and economic structures found under neoliberalism and post-industrial capitalism.&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/cp.html|title=Research Projects and Direct Action I The Hampton Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''A Crossroads for Socialism: Cuba in Transition''' is a research project by Nicholas Partyka that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...presents a multi-part analysis of Cuba, including dispatches and observations from his 2014 visit to the country. Partyka aims to present the most accurate insight into the reality of Cuba today, as it embarks on an unprecedented transition. With a heavy reliance on macroeconomic, geopolitical, and foreign policy analysis, this study seeks to pinpoint the nuanced economic, political, and social changes that are occurring on the island nation, and how these changes are impacting everyday Cubans.&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''Ecofeminism''' is a research project by Cherise Charleswell that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...analyzes the various health consequences of the global food production operations, distribution systems, preparation, and consumption, that affect women.&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution.org"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''Bridging the Gap: Reaching out to our Incarcerated Allies''' is a [[direct action]] initiative by Jeriah Bowser that seeks to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...connect individuals currently incarcerated in America's 'Prison Industrial Complex' with their concerned brothers and sisters who are not currently incarcerated, with the intention of creating class-consciousness through relationships, education, and empowerment.&lt;ref name="hamptoninstitution.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Work and relevance==

Hampton's analyses and commentaries have been picked up and republished by numerous media outlets, most notably [[Monthly Review]], [[Z Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/the-great-recession-six-years-later/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/gentrification-is-a-feminist-issue-a-discussion-of-the-intersection-of-clss-race-gender-and-housing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/coming-home-to-roost-part-1/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/retracing-toledos-radical-history/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Truthout]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truth-out.org/component/search/?searchword=hampton%20institute&amp;searchphrase=all&amp;Itemid=302&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternet]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alternet.org/culture/why-prepper-cultures-idea-you-can-survive-apocalypse-all-your-own-recipe-sure-death&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common Dreams NewsCenter]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commondreams.org/author/colin-jenkins&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Agenda Report]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blackagendareport.com/blog/2068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blackagendareport.com/blog/2197?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blackagendareport.com/blog/2358&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dissident Voice]],&lt;ref&gt;http://dissidentvoice.org/search/?cx=004699754223191941067%3Adjkep-0myaa&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hampton+institute&amp;sa=Search&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign Policy Journal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2013/12/05/the-new-politics-of-the-21st-century-global-resistance-and-rising-anarchism/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Popular Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;https://popularresistance.org/revisionism-vs-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Gavin Marshall]] has been featured in [[ROAR Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;https://roarmag.org/essays/finance-capital-power-banks-free-market-discipline/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://roarmag.org/essays/the-orwellian-language-behind-the-eurozone-debt-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://roarmag.org/essays/banker-impunity-drug-money-laundering-fraud/&lt;/ref&gt; and interviewed by [[Russia Today]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2010/10/09/the-3-minute-download-michael-t-snyder-andrew-gavin-marshall-and-paul-craig-roberts/&lt;/ref&gt; for his geopolitical analysis.

==2015 Report to the United Nations==

In April 2015, the Hampton Institute was one of a number of organizations invited to submit a report to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] regarding Resolution A/RES/69/160 on "Combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance." The HI's report, ''Rising Nazism and Racial Intolerance in the United States: A Contemporary Analysis'', focused on a variety of areas including (1) a brief history of Nazism in the US, (2) Neoliberal economics, rising inequality and austerity as a driver, (3) Nazism and white supremacy in the US military, (4) Nazism and white supremacy online, (5) Nazism and white supremacy on college campuses, (6) Racist policing and mass incarceration, (7) Nazism protected by the state, (8) Rising fascism in American politics, (9) a case study on the state of California, and (10) a comparative analysis regarding Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/Rising-Nazism-and-Racial-Intolerance-in-the-US.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==

The HI relies solely on donations from readers and supporters. The organization has not released a financial report to date. In August 2018, the organization announced a detailed, five-year plan along with launching a Patreon account as a means to fund this plan. The plan includes: (1) An improved website with more user-friendly layout and improved searchability; (2) HI believes in compensation for one's work - writers, editors, etc. are no exception. All of our members are volunteers, and all of our contributors are currently unpaid. We want to change that; (3) Revitalizing HI's publishing house (HI Press). If working-class consciousness is going to be raised to where it needs to be in our lifetime, our political perspectives will need to be as widely available as possible, both online and, as affordably as possible, in print; (4) Further develop and improve HI's excellent podcast (“A Different Lens”) hosted by Devon Bowers. Devon does great work already, and we’re excited to see what he can do with some improved recording equipment and editing software; (5)Expand engagement with working-class movements and contribute to consciousness raising beyond the website, podcast, and publishing. HI wants to become a more active participant in the growth of a working-class public sphere. While HI is somewhat limited as a non-profit, we hope to push up against the legal boundaries (without crossing them, of course. We would never deign to do such a thing.), to participate in and host, among other things: public talks, educational seminars, teach-ins, and book talks. HI contributors will continue to show up in the streets, as they have always done—and we want to see you in the streets, too; (6) More of everything you already love and value from HI. More and better content of the kind that you’ve always come to HI for.

==Activism and outreach==

Many of Hampton's members are involved in activism, direct action, and community outreach. Sean Posey has worked in community development at the [[Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corporation]], where he assists with vacancy issues and urban agriculture in the inner city of [[Youngstown, Ohio]].  Derek Ide is the co-founder of and community adviser to the [[University of Toledo]]'s [[Students for Justice in Palestine]] chapter on campus. Jonathan Mathias Lassiter has served as a therapist at the [[Center for HIV Educational Studies and Training]], where he provided clinical services for a [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] funded clinical intervention trial. Jeriah Bowser has been involved in prison outreach programs. Derek Ford is an anti-war and anti-racist organizer with [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answercoalition.org/answer_delegation_shows_solidarity_at_international_conference_in_korea&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce Brown has been active in Hawaii's indigenous rights movement for many years. Eyad Alkurabi is a community organizer for [[GetEQUAL]]. Debra Hocking received an [[International Year of Peace]] award, and the [[Tasmanian Human Rights Award]] for humanitarian work in her homeland of [[Tasmania]].

In June 2014, the HI sponsored a two-part book talk on [[Thomas Piketty]]'s ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''. The presenters were [[Nicholas Partyka]] and [[Colin Donnaruma]], and the two events took place at the [[Social Justice Center]] in Albany, New York.

In August 2014, the HI sponsored a "Freedom for Gaza" protest and march.  The event took place in Albany, New York and was part of a nationwide "Day of Rage" coordinated in hundreds of cities in response to Israel's bombing of the Gaza strip.

In November 2014, Criminal Justice department chair, Dr. [[Jason Michael Williams]], traveled to [[Ferguson, Missouri]] as part of an effort to assess the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]] due to the [[Michael Brown shooting]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Williams was part of a collection of criminologists and professors seeking to monitor the nature of the police response, which was deemed by many organizations (including [[Amnesty International]]) to be "heavy-handed" and "excessive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Dr. Jason Michael |title=Doing Ferguson and Baltimore at the Intersection of Racial Oppression and Hopelessness |url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/field-work-in-ferguson-and-baltimore.html#.WybUvtMvyRs |website=The Hampton Institute |accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the HI became an official sponsor of the [[James Connolly Forum]] in [[Troy, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jamesconnollyforum.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The forum is a monthly event that attracts speakers, scholars, and activists from a wide range of disciplines. Guest speakers to date have included [[Doug Henwood]], [[Liza Featherstone]], author and professor [[Jodi Dean]], peace activist [[Dahlia Wasfi]], author [[Vijay Prashad]],  teacher and activist [[Brian Jones]], and founder and editor of [[Jacobin Magazine]], [[Bhaskar Sunkara]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jamesconnollyforum.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/forum-videos/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the HI co-sponsored a panel discussion on "Electoral Politics and the Left". The panel included [[Green Party US]] Presidential candidate, [[Jill Stein]], the [[International Socialist Organization]]'s Ashley Smith, and [[Bhaskar Sunkara]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAiEw1vhFGM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheHamptonInstitute/photos/a.205011549649056.1073741824.159587070858171/633055726844634/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the HI and its founder, Colin Jenkins, publicly endorsed the September 9th nationally coordinated prisoner work stoppage and protest throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://supportprisonerresistance.noblogs.org/endorsements/&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinated work stoppage was designed as a direct action protest by prisoners who are essentially used as slave labor throughout the country. The action was organized by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and its Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee.

In April 2017, the HI sponsored a weekend conference on the State University of New York at Albany campus. The conference, titled "When I See Them, I See Us," was focused around "intersectional, anti-capitalist discussion and action," and touched on various issues such as Black liberation and Black Lives Matter, the struggle in Palestine, the Indigenous struggle and water justice, migrant and immigrant rights, battling Islamophobia, and the prison industrial complex. HI's Labor Issues chair Nicholas Partyka gave a presentation on "Mass Incarceration and Monopoly Capital."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/223077018170218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/CapitalDistrictSocialistParty/photos/pcb.793782840776477/793781354109959/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt; The HI directly sponsored another presentation, given by Miguel Roel, on "Imperialism and Immigration."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/CapitalDistrictSocialistParty/photos/pcb.793782840776477/793781427443285/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

The HI publicly endorsed the Workers March on Washington, D.C. on April 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workersmarch.com/updates/the-hampton-institute-endorses-the-workers-march&lt;/ref&gt; The march was organized as a way to create working-class solidarity with "people across the globe who are realizing that we have more in common with each other than we do with the 0.1% of humans who own the top 50% of all 'wealth.' The same humans who make
short sighted destructive decisions for the rest of us in order to increase their own profit."

In May 2017, the HI was one of six sponsoring organizations of FemJam 2017: Jamming Feminism and Organizing Across LA. HI's Women's Issues chair Cherise Charleswell was a participant at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://womenscenterforcreativework.com/news/femjam-2017-jamming-feminism-and-organizing-across-la/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute officially endorsed a solidarity peace delegation to South Korea to demand an end militarism in Korea and Asia and to support dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stopthaad.org/solidarity-peace-delegation-to-south-korea/|title=Solidarity Peace Delegation to South Korea – No to U.S. Missile Defense in Korea|website=stopthaad.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Education Chair Derek Ford organized and led a peace delegation to the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] through Korea Peace Tours.&lt;ref&gt;www.koreapeacetours.org&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation met with workers, cooperative farmers, students, professors, soldiers, generals, and government officials throughout the time there. They were the last U.S. delegation to visit the country before the U.S. travel ban was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/eyewitness-north-korea.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The HI is one of many organizations to have officially endorsed the People's Congress of Resistance, which is scheduled for September 16–17 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congressofresistance.org/endorsements&lt;/ref&gt; The HI joins a long list of "endorsements that are coming in from all over the country, and from grassroots resisters from all walks of life — from Black Lives Matter to immigrant rights, climate justice, trade union, women's rights, and LGBTQ rights groups." The Congress plans "confront the Congress of the millionaires (US Congress), galvanize the energy of the many groups resisting Trump, and demonstrate what democracy looks like."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congressofresistance.org/call_to_action&lt;/ref&gt;

The HI endorsed the [[Nationwide Prison Strike]] that occurred between August 21 and September 9, 2018. The strike was organized by prisoners throughout the United States with assistance from the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]'s [[Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee]]. Striking prisoners released a list of ten demands: (1) Immediate improvements to the conditions of prisons and prison policies that recognize the humanity of imprisoned men and women; (2) An immediate end to prison slavery. All persons imprisoned in any place of detention under United States jurisdiction must be paid the prevailing wage in their state or territory for their labor; (3) The Prison Litigation Reform Act must be rescinded, allowing imprisoned humans a proper channel to address grievances and violations of their rights; (4) The Truth in Sentencing Act and the Sentencing Reform Act must be rescinded so that imprisoned humans have a possibility of rehabilitation and parole. No human shall be sentenced to Death by Incarceration or serve any sentence without the possibility of parole; (5) An immediate end to the racial overcharging, over-sentencing, and parole denials of Black and brown humans. Black humans shall no longer be denied parole because the victim of the crime was white, which is a particular problem in southern states; (6) An immediate end to racist gang enhancement laws targeting Black and brown humans; (7) No imprisoned human shall be denied access to rehabilitation programs at their place of detention because of their label as a violent offender; (8) State prisons must be funded specifically to offer more rehabilitation services; (9) Pell grants must be reinstated in all US states and territories; (10) The voting rights of all confined citizens serving prison sentences, pretrial detainees, and so-called “ex-felons” must be counted. Representation is demanded. All voices count. &lt;ref&gt;https://incarceratedworkers.org/campaigns/prison-strike-2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://sawarimi.org/groups-organizations-in-solidarity&lt;/ref&gt;

While '''women in Japan''' were recognized as having equal legal rights to men after [[World War II]], economic conditions for women remain unbalanced.&lt;ref name=nytimes-soble /&gt; Modern policy initiatives to encourage motherhood and workplace participation have had mixed results.&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt; 

While a high percentage of Japanese women are college graduates, making up 77% of the part-time work force,&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite web|title=Holding back half the nation|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21599763-womens-lowly-status-japanese-workplace-has-barely-improved-decades-and-country|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; they typically earn 27% less than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Nikkei Asian Review 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Japan's gender wage gap persists despite progress- Nikkei Asian Review | website=Nikkei Asian Review | date=23 Feb 2017 | url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Japan-s-gender-wage-gap-persists-despite-progress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional expectations for married women and mothers are cited as a barrier to full economic equality.&lt;ref name=Nohara /&gt; The monarchy is strictly males-only and a princess has to give up her royal status when she marries a commoner.

==Cultural history==

{{multiple image| align = left | direction = vertical | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = 19th century depictions of Japanese women, ''Woman in Red Clothing (1912)'' and ''Under the Shade of a Tree (1898)'' by [[Kuroda Seiki]].

The extent to which women could participate in Japanese society has varied over time and social classes. In the 8th century, Japan had women emperors, and in the 12th century during the [[Heian period]], women in Japan could inherit property in their own names and manage it by themselves: "Women could own property, be educated, and were allowed, if discrete (sic), to take lovers."&lt;ref name="Women in World History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heroines: Heian Period (Women in World History Curriculum)|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/Heian9.html|website=www.womeninworldhistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographed in 1888.| image2 = Yanagiwara Byakuren.jpg | width2 = 157| caption2  = Yanagiwara Byakuren, a poet and member of the imperial family.}}

From the late [[Edo period]], the status of women declined. In the 17th century, the "[[Onna Daigaku]]", or "Learning for Women", by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] author [[Kaibara Ekken]], spelled out expectations for Japanese women, stating that "such is the stupidity of her character that it is incumbent on her, in every particular, to distrust herself and to obey her husband".&lt;ref name=Ekken&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekken|first1=Kaibara|title=Onna Daigaku A Treasure Box of Women's Learning.|date=2010|publisher=Gardners Books|isbn=0955979676|url=https://archive.org/stream/womenwisdomofjap00kaib/womenwisdomofjap00kaib_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Meiji period]], [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] reduced the authority of [[father]]s and [[husband]]s, but at the same time the Meiji Civil Code of 1898 (specifically the introduction of the [[Ie (Japanese family system)|"ie"]] system) denied women [[legal rights]] and subjugated them to the will of household heads.&lt;ref name="Womeninworldhistory"&gt;[http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/WR-04.html The Meiji Reforms and Obstacles for Women Japan, 1878–1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral expectations===

In interviews with Japanese housewives in 1985, researchers found that socialized [[Femininity|feminine]] behavior in Japan followed several patterns of modesty, tidiness, courtesy, compliance, and self-reliance.&lt;ref name="Lebra 1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebra|first1=Takie Sugiyama|title=Japanese women : constraint and fulfillment|date=1985|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu, HI|isbn=0824810252|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modesty extended to the effective use of silence in both daily conversations and activities. Tidiness included personal appearance and a clean home. Courtesy, another trait, was called upon from women in domestic roles and in entertaining guests, extended to activities such as preparing and serving tea.

Lebra's traits for internal comportment of femininity included compliance; for example, [[child]]ren were expected not to refuse their parents. Self-reliance of women was encouraged because needy women were seen as a burden on others. In these interviews with Japanese families, Lebra found that girls were assigned helping tasks while boys were more inclined to be left to schoolwork.&lt;ref name="Lebra 1985" /&gt; Lebra's work has been critiqued for focusing specifically on a single economic segment of Japanese women.&lt;ref name=Tamanoi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamanoi|first1=Mariko|title=Women's Voices: Their Critique of the Anthropology of Japan|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=October 1990|volume=19|pages=17–37|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=11266352&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=25 December 2015|issn=0084-6570|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.19.100190.000313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Japan remains a socially conservative society, with relatively pronounced [[gender roles]], Japanese women and Japanese society are quite different from the strong stereotypes that exist in foreign media or travel guides, which paint the women in Japan as 'submissive' and devoid of any self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Japan: Social sciences, ideology &amp; thought'', by Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, pp. 164-173&lt;/ref&gt; Another strong stereotype about Japan is that women always stay in the home as housewives and that they do not participate in public life: in reality most women are employed&amp;nbsp;– the [[employment rate]] of women (age 15–64) is 64.6% (data from [[OECD]] 2015&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"&gt;http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R#&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Political status of women==

The Japanese Constitution, drafted by the US and adopted in the post-war era, provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women’s equality in Japan.&lt;ref name=Chanlett&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chanlett-Avery|first1=Emma|last2=Nelson|first2=Rebecca M.|title="Womenomics" in Japan: In Brief|journal=Congressional Research Service|date=2014|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43668.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were given the [[Women's suffrage in Japan|right to vote]] in 1946. This allowed them greater freedom, equality to men, and a higher status within Japanese society. Other postwar reforms opened education institutions to women and required that women receive [[equal pay for equal work]]. In 1986, the Equal Employment Opportunity Law took effect. Legally, few barriers to women's equal participation in the life of society remain. However, socially they lack opportunities in the workforce due to the long work hours and dominance in the workplace by men.

In a global survey of women in parliaments, Japan ranked 123rd out of 189 countries.&lt;ref name="Economist 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Economist|title=Holding back half the nation|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21599763-womens-lowly-status-japanese-workplace-has-barely-improved-decades-and-country|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan's [[National Diet|Diet]], women hold slightly less than 10% of seats despite a government goal for 30% of elected officials to be women by 2020.&lt;ref name=Chanlett /&gt; In the lower house of the Diet, women hold only 8% of seats, with 19% in the upper house.&lt;ref name="Economist 2015" /&gt; Less than 1% of mayors were women.&lt;ref name=Beech&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beech|first1=Hannah|title=‘You Mean Women Deserve Careers?’ Patriarchal Japan Has Breakthrough Moment|url=http://world.time.com/2013/09/30/you-mean-women-deserve-careers-patriarchal-japan-has-breakthrough-moment/|website=Time|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese government has expressed a will to address this inequality of numbers in the 21st century of the [[Heisei period]] through several focused initiatives,&lt;ref name=ShinzoAbe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abe|first1=Shinzo|title=Unleashing the Power of 'Womenomics'|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303759604579091680931293404|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2012 poll by the [[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]] found that nearly 70% of all Japanese polled agreed that men were given preferential treatment.&lt;ref name="Gender Equality Bureau 1-10"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabinet Office|first1=Gender Equality Bureau|title=Perceptions of Gender Inequality|url=http://www.gender.go.jp/english_contents/pr_act/pub/pamphlet/women-and-men15/pdf/1-10.pdf|website=www.gender.go.jp/|publisher=Japan Cabinet Office Gender Equality Bureau|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common occupation for young women is that of [[office lady]], that is, a female office worker who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[Secretary|secretarial]] or [[Clerk|clerical]] work.

A number of government and private post-war policies have contributed to a gendered division of labor.&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt; These include a family wage offered by corporations which subsidized health and housing subsidies, marriage bonuses and additional bonuses for each child; and pensions for wives who earn below certain incomes.&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt; Additionally, in 1961, income for wives of working men were untaxed below $10,000; income above that amount contributed to overall household income.&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt; Corporate culture also plays a role; while many men are expected to socialize with their managers after long work days, women may find trouble balancing child-rearing roles with the demands of mandatory after-work social events.&lt;ref name="nytimes-soble"/&gt;

Some economists suggest that a better support system for working mothers, such as a shorter daily work schedule, would allow more women to work, increasing Japan's economic growth.&lt;ref name=Nohara&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nohara|first1=Yoshiaki|title=Goldman’s Matsui Turns Abe to Womenomics for Japan Growth|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/goldman-s-matsui-turns-abe-to-womenomics-for-japan-growth|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, in 2003, the Japanese government set a goal to have 30% of senior government roles filled by women.

Families, prior to and during the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji restoration]], relied on a patriarchal lineage of succession, with disobedience to the male head of the household punishable by expulsion from the family unit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borovoy|first1=Amy|title=The Too-Good Wife: Alcohol, codependency, and the politics of nurturance in postwar Japan|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=0520244524|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshizumi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshizumi|first1=Kyoko|editor1-last=Fujimura-Fanselow|editor1-first=Kumiko|editor2-last=Kameda|editor2-first=Atsuko|title=Japanese Women: new perspectives on the past, present and future|date=1995|publisher=Feminist Press at the City University of New York]|location=New York|pages=183–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male heads of households with only daughters would adopt male heirs to succeed them, sometimes through [[Arranged marriages in Japan|arranged marriage]] to a daughter.&lt;ref name=Hendry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendry|first1=Joy|title=Marriage in changing Japan : community and society|date=1986|publisher=C.E.

[[File:Woman in traditional dress holding open parasol and carrying baby on her back. (19949880145).jpg|thumb|upright|Woman in traditional dress holding open parasol and carrying baby on her back, c. 1910]]

After the Meiji period, the head of the household was required to approve of any marriage.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; Until 1908, it remained legal for husbands to murder wives for infidelity.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

As late as the 1930s, arranged marriages continued, and so-called "[[Romantic love|love matches]]" were thought to be rare and somewhat scandalous, especially for the husband, who would be thought "effeminate".&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Iwasaki&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iwasaki|first1=Yasu|title=Divorce in Japan|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1930|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Post-War Constitution, however, codified women’s right to choose their partners.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; Article 24 of [[Constitution of Japan|Japan's Constitution]] states:

:''Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis. With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.''

This established several changes to women’s roles in the family, such as the right to inherit the family home or land, and the right of women (over the age of 20) to marry without the consent of the house patriarch.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

[[File:Morioka Kinder 2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|A little girl in Morioka.]]

In the early Meiji period, many girls married at age 16; by the post-war period, it had risen to 23, and continued to rise.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; The average age for a Japanese woman’s first marriage has steadily risen since 1970, from 24 to 29.3 years old in 2015.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Office 1-1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Population, Family and Household|url = http://www.gender.go.jp/english_contents/pr_act/pub/pamphlet/women-and-men15/pdf/1-1.pdf|publisher = Japan Cabinet Office Gender Equality Bureau|accessdate = 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to divorce===
In the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]], men could [[divorce]] their wives simply through stating their intention to do so in a letter. Wives could not legally arrange for a divorce, but options included joining convents, such as at [[Kamakura]], where men were not permitted to go, thus assuring a permanent separation.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

Under the Meiji system, however, the law limited grounds for divorce to seven events: sterility, adultery, disobedience to the parents-in-law, loquacity, larceny, jealousy, and disease. However, the law offered a protection for divorcees by guaranteeing a wife could not be sent away if she had nowhere else to go.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; Furthermore, the law allowed a woman to request a divorce, so long as she was accompanied by a male relative and could prove desertion or imprisonment of the husband, profligacy, or mental or physical illness.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

By 1898, cruelty was added to the grounds for a woman to divorce; the law also allowed divorce through mutual agreement of the husband and wife. However, children were assumed to remain with the male head of the household.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; In contemporary Japan, children are more likely to live with single mothers than single fathers; in 2013, 7.4% of children were living in single-mother households; only 1.3% live with their fathers.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Office 1-1" /&gt;

When divorce was granted under equal measures to both sexes under the post-war constitution, divorce rates steadily increased.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

In 2015, Article 733 of Japan’s Civil Code that states that women cannot remarry 6 months after divorce was reduced to 100 days. The 6 month ban on remarriage for women was previously aiming to "avoid uncertainty regarding the identity of the legally presumed father of any child born in that time period". Under article 772, presumes that after a divorce, a child born 300 days after divorce is the legal child of the previous husband. A ruling issued on December 16, 2015, the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that in light of the new 100 days before women's remarriage law, so that there is no confusion over the paternity of a child born to a woman who remarried, any child born after 200 days of remarriage is the legal child of the current husband.

The Ministry of Japan revealed the outline of an amendment for the Civil Code of Japan on February 18, 2016. This amend shortens the women's remarriage period to 100 days and allows any woman who is not pregnant during the divorce to remarry immediately after divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Umeda, S. (2016, February 26). Global Legal Monitor. Retrieved December 04, 2016, from https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/japan-new-instructions-allow-women-to-remarry-100-days-after-divorce/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surname change===
The [[Law of Japan|Civil Code of Japan]] requires legally married spouses to have the same surname. Although the law is gender-neutral, meaning that either spouse is allowed to change his/her name to that of the other spouse, Japanese women have traditionally [[Maiden and married names|adopt their husband’s family name]] and 96% of women continue to do so as of 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Reuters in Tokyo|title = Japanese women in court fight to keep their surnames after marriage|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/japan-supreme-court-rule-one-surname-law-married-couples|website = The Guardian|publisher = Reuters|accessdate = 15 December 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211071657/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/japan-supreme-court-rule-one-surname-law-married-couples|archivedate = 11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Japanese Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of the law, noting that women could use their maiden names informally, and stating that it was for the legislature to decide on whether to pass new legislation on separate spousal names.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35109455&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood===

While women before the Meiji period were often considered incompetent in the raising of children, the Meiji period saw [[mother]]hood as the central task of women, and allowed education of women toward this end.&lt;ref name=Niwa&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niwa|first1=Akiko|title=The Formation of the Myth of Motherhood in Japan|journal=US Japan Women's Journal|date=1993|volume=4|pages=70–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising children and keeping household affairs in order were seen as women's role in the state.&lt;ref name=nolteandhastings&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolte|first1=Sharon|last2=Hastings|first2=Sally|authorlink1=The Meiji State's Policy Toward Women, 1890-1910|editor1-last=Bernstein|editor1-first=GL|title=Recreating Japanese Women, 1600-1945|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's political and social advancement was thus tied to their role as mothers.&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt;

Today, Japanese mothers are still seen as managers of a household, including the behavior of their children. For example, media reports often focus on the apologies of criminals' mothers.&lt;ref name=Iwao&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iwao|first1=Sumiko|title=The Japanese Woman: Traditional Image and Changing Reality|date=1993|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern education of women began in earnest during the Meiji era's modernization campaign. The first schools for women began during this time, though education topics were highly gendered, with women learning arts of the [[samurai]] class, such as [[Tea ceremony|tea ceremonies]] and [[Ikebana|flower arrangement]]. The 1871 education code established that students should be educated "without any distinction of class or sex".&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Margaret Emerstine|title=The Education of Women in Japan|date=1914|publisher=Fleming H.

Notably, [[Tsuruko Haraguchi]], the first woman in Japan to earn a PhD, did so in the US, as no Meiji-era institution would allow her to receive her doctorate.&lt;ref name=Patessio /&gt; She and other women who studied abroad and returned to Japan, such as [[Yoshioka Yayoi]] and [[Tsuda Umeko]], were among the first wave of women's educators who lead the way to the incorporation of women in Japanese academia.&lt;ref name=Patessio /&gt;

In 2002, the government of Japan passed a law against [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=Borovoy /&gt; In 2013, 100,000 women reported domestic violence to shelters.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Office 1-6"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabinet Office|first1=Gender Equality Bureau|title=Violence against Women|url=http://www.gender.go.jp/english_contents/pr_act/pub/pamphlet/women-and-men15/pdf/1-6.pdf|website=gender.go.jp|publisher=Japanese Gender Equality Bureau Cabinet Office|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 10,000 entering protective custody at the shelter, nearly half arrived with children or other family members.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Office 1-6" /&gt;

Victims act in 2001.&lt;ref name=Nemoto2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The Gender Equality Bureau of the Cabinet Office|title=Heisei 14 nenban danjo kyodo sankaku hakusho [FY 2001, Annual report on the state of formation of a gender equal society]|date=2002|publisher=Zaimusyou insatsu Kyoku.|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law referred to domestic violence as "a violation of the constitutional principle of equal rights between sexes". This law established protection orders from abusive spouses and created support centers in every prefecture, but women are still reluctant to report abuse to doctors out of shame or fear that the report would be shared with the abuser.&lt;ref name=Nemoto2 /&gt; A 2001 survey showed that many health professionals were not trained to handle domestic abuse and blamed women who sought treatment.&lt;ref name=Nemoto2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tokyoto&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokyoto Iryo Syakai Jigyo Kyokai Iryo Fukushi Mondai Kenkyu Kai|title=Iryokikan ni okeru domesutikku baiorensu ni tsuite no chosa hokokusho [A report regarding domestic violence in health care settings]|journal= Josei no anzen to kenko no tameno shien kyoiku senta tushin|date=2001|volume=3|pages=23–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalking===
[[Stalking|Stalking laws]] were passed in 2000 after the media attention given to the murder of a [[Murder of Shiori Ino|university student]] who had been a stalking victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051221a4.html|title=Stalker-killer's life term upheld|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=December 21, 2005|accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With nearly 21,000 reports of stalking in 2013, 90.3% of the victims were women and 86.9% of the perpetrators were men.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Office 1-6" /&gt; Anti-stalking laws in Japan were expanded in 2013 to include [[Cyberstalking|e-mail harassment]], after the widely publicized 2012 murder of a young woman who had reported such harassment to police.&lt;ref name=Aquino&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aquino|first1=Faith|title=Japan toughens anti-stalking laws, includes repeated emailing as harassment|url=http://japandailypress.com/japan-toughens-anti-stalking-laws-includes-repeated-emailing-as-harassment-2731299/|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=Japan Daily Press|date=2013-06-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928181217/http://japandailypress.com/japan-toughens-anti-stalking-laws-includes-repeated-emailing-as-harassment-2731299/|archivedate=2015-09-28|location=https://web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking reports are growing at a faster rate in Japan than any other country.&lt;ref name="Al-jazeera stalk"&gt;{{cite web|title = Japan's stalking crisis|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/12/japan-stalking-crisis-2014128103943425348.html|website = Al-jazeera|publisher = Al-jazeera|accessdate = 20 December 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905141833/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/12/japan-stalking-crisis-2014128103943425348.html|archivedate = 5 September 2015|location = https://web.archive.org/web/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault===
Surveys show that between 28% and 70% of women have been groped on train cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8254389.stm "Tokyo police act on train gropers"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitsutoshii /&gt; Some railway companies designate [[women-only passenger car]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Untitled Document |url=http://www.belsona-strategic.com/hisandhers_subway.htm |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226060039/http://www.belsona-strategic.com/hisandhers_subway.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 "Japan Tries Women Only Train Cars to Stop Groping: Tokyo Subway Experiment Attempts to Slow Epidemic of Subway Fondling"] An ABC News article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071218143817/http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/35/11500 "Women Only Cars on Commuter Trains Cause Controversy in Japan"]&lt;/ref&gt; though there are no penalties for men to ride in a women-only car.&lt;ref name=Mitsutoshii&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitsutoshii|first1=Horii|last2=Burgess|first2=Adam|title=Constructing sexual risk: 'Chikan', collapsing male authority and the emergence of women-only train carriages in Japan.|journal=Health, Risk &amp; Society|date=2012|volume=14|issue=1|pages=41–55|doi=10.1080/13698575.2011.641523|issn=1369-8575|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gropers can be punished with seven years or less of jail time and/or face fines of just under $500.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

The use of women-only cars in Japan has been critiqued from various perspectives.&lt;ref name=Mitsutoshii /&gt; Some suggest that the presence of the cars makes women who choose not to use them more vulnerable. Public comment sometimes include the argument that women-only cars are a step too far in protecting women.&lt;ref name=Mitsutoshii /&gt; Some academics have argued that the cars impose the burden of social segregation to women, rather than seeking the punishment of criminals.&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman |first1=Alisa |title=Commuting Gazes: Schoolgirls, Salarymen, and Electric Trains in Tokyo |journal=The Journal of Transport History |date=1 March 2002 |volume=23 |issue=1 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-115159347/commuting-gazes-schoolgirls-salarymen-and-electric |accessdate=27 December 2015 |issn=0022-5266 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227000859/https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-115159347/commuting-gazes-schoolgirls-salarymen-and-electric |archivedate=December 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique suggests the cars send the signal that men create a dangerous environment for women, who cannot protect themselves.&lt;ref name=Mitsutoshii /&gt;

==Beauty==

The Japanese cosmetics industry is the second largest in the world, earning over $15 billion per year.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Laura|title=Beauty up : exploring contemporary Japanese body aesthetics|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9780520245082|edition=2. [printing]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong market for beauty products has been connected to the value placed on self-discipline and self-improvement in Japan, where the body is mastered through ''[[kata]]'', repeated actions aspiring toward perfection, such as bowing.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

In the [[Heian period]], feminine beauty standards favored darkened teeth, some body fat, and eyebrows painted above the original (which were shaved).&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Ivan|title=The world of the shining prince : court life in ancient Japan|date=1995|publisher=Kodansha International|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-1568360294|edition=[3. Dr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauty corporations have had a role in creating contemporary standards of beauty in Japan since the Meiji era. For example, the Japanese cosmetics firm, [[Shiseido]] published a magazine, ''Hannatsubaki'', with beauty advice for women emphasizing hair styles and contemporary fashion.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The pre-war "[[modern girl]]" of Japan followed Western fashions as filtered through this kind of Japanese media.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Products reflect several common anxieties among Japanese women. Multiple polls suggest that women worry about "fatness, breast size, hairiness and bust size".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The idealized figure of a Japanese woman is generally fragile and petite.&lt;ref name="Keene, Donald 1989"/&gt; Japanese beauty ideals favor small features and narrow faces.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Big eyes are admired, especially when they have "double eyelids".&lt;ref name="Keene, Donald 1989"&gt;[Keene, Donald. "The Japanese Idea of Beauty". The Wilson Quarterly 13.1 (1989): 128–135. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ideal is pale skin. Tanned skin was historically associated with the working-class, and pale skin associated with the nobility.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Many women in Japan will take precaution to avoid the sun, and some lotions are sold to make the skin whiter.&lt;ref name=Kyo /&gt;

By the 1970s, "[[cuteness]]" had emerged as a desirable aesthetic, which some scholars linked to a boom in [[Manga|comic books]] that emphasized young-looking girls, or Lolitas.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; While these characters typically included larger eyes, research suggests that it was not a traditional standard of beauty in Japan, preferred in medical research and described as "unsightly" by cosmetic researchers of the Edo era.&lt;ref name=Kyo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selden|first1=Cho Kyo; translated by Kyoko|title=The search for the beautiful woman a cultural history of Japanese and Chinese beauty|date=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham|isbn=9781442218956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese clothing|Clothing]] is another element in beauty standards for women in Japan. Again, femininity is a large factor; therefore, [[pink]]s, reds, bows, and frills are all found in their apparel. [[Kimonos]], full-length silk robes, are worn by women on special occasions.&lt;ref name="Keene, Donald 1989"/&gt;

==Geisha==
{{Main article|Geisha}}

[[File:Geiko Kimiha.jpg|thumb|left|Geisha in Miyagawa-chō, Kyoto]]

A {{nihongo|[[geisha]]|芸者}} is a traditional Japanese female entertainer who acts as a hostess and whose skills include performing various Japanese arts such as classical music, dance, games, serving tea and conversation, mainly to entertain male customers.&lt;ref name="Dalby, Liza 1992"&gt;[Dalby, Liza. "Kimona and Geisha". ''The Threepenny Review 51'' (1992): 30–31. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Geisha are trained very seriously as skilled entertainers and are not to be confused with [[prostitutes]]. The training program starts from a young age, typically 15 years old, and can take anywhere from six months to three years.&lt;ref name="Dalby, Liza 1992"/&gt; 

A young geisha in training, under the age of 20, is called a [[maiko]]. Maiko (literally "dance girl") are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for years. Maiko learn from their senior geisha mentor and follow them to all their engagements. Then at around the age of 20–22, the maiko is promoted to a full-fledged geisha&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[Warta, T. (n.d.). Geisha Makeup Designs and Origin.]&lt;/ref&gt; in a ceremony called [[erikae]] (turning of the collar).

==Contraception and sexuality==
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|thumb|400px|The percentage of births to unmarried women in selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of other Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree.]]
{{Further|Sexuality in Japan}}
In Japan, the [[contraceptive pill]] was legalized in 1999, much later than in most Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cosgrove-Mather |first1=Bootie |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japanese-women-shun-the-pill/ |accessdate=2018-10-14 |work=CBS News |date=20 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use is still low, with many couples preferring [[condom]]s. Sexuality in Japan has developed separately from mainland [[Asia]], and Japan did not adopt the [[Confucian view of marriage]] in which [[chastity]] is highly valued. However, births outside marriage remain rare in Japan.

A '''young adult''' is generally a person ranging in age from their late teens or early twenties to their thirties, although definitions and opinions, such as [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of human development]], vary. The young [[adult]] stage in human development precedes [[middle age|middle adulthood]]. A person in the middle adulthood stage ages from 40 or 41 to 64. In [[old age]], a person is 65 years old or older.&lt;ref name="Martin Briner"&gt;Martin Briner, [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm Erik Erikson page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821183134/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, 1999, on Briner's [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm site about learning theories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007042838/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm |date=2006-10-07 }}, USMA Department of Mathematical Sciences, Center for Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), United States Military Academy at West Point.

==Time co-ordinates==
For a variety of reasons, timeliness on young adulthood cannot be exactly defined—producing different results according to the different mix of overlapping indices (legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional and the like) employed, or on whether 'a ''developmental perspective''... [or] the ''socialization perspective''&lt;ref name=Levinson1986&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel J. |title=A conception of adult development |journal=American Psychologist |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is taken. 'Sub-phases in this timetable of psychosocial growth patterns... are not rigid, and both social change and individual variations must be taken into account'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}—not to mention regional and cultural differences. Arguably indeed, with people living longer, and also reaching puberty earlier, 'age norms for major life events have become highly elastic'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=15}} by the twenty-first century.

Some have suggested that, after {{'}}''Pre-adulthood''... in the first 20 years or so... the second era, ''Early Adulthood'', lasts from about age 17 to 45... the adult era of greatest energy and abundance and of greatest contradiction and stress.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; Within that framework, 'the ''Early Adult Transition'' (17–22) is a developmental bridge between pre-adulthood and early adulthood',&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; recognizing that 'the transition into adulthood is not a clear-cut dividing line'.{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} One might alternatively speak of 'a ''Provisional Adulthood (18–30)''... [&amp;] the initiation to First Adulthood'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}} as following that.

Despite all such fluidity, there is broad agreement that it is essentially the twenties and thirties which constitute {{'}}''Early adulthood''... the basis for what [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] calls ''the Dream''—a vision of his [or her] goal's in life which provide motivation and enthusiasm for the future'.{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=220}}

==Health==
Young/prime adulthood can be considered the healthiest time of life{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} and young adults are generally in good health, subject neither to [[disease]] nor the problems of [[senescence]].

In [[developed countries]], [[mortality rate]]s for the 18–40 age group are typically very low. Men are more likely to die at this age than women, particularly in the 18–25 group: reasons include [[car accidents]] and [[suicide]]. Mortality statistics among men and women level off during the late twenties and thirties, due in part to good health and less [[recklessness (psychology)|risk-taking behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Life Expectancy Profiles  | work =  | publisher = BBC  | date=   6 June 2005  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3784854  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding disease, [[cancer]] is much less common in young than in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = UK cancer mortality statistics by age| publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/mortality/age/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are [[testicular cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Cancers at a glance | publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/cancers/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] has hit the early adult population particularly hard. According to a [[United Nations]] report, AIDS has significantly increased mortality of between ages 20 to 55 for African males and 20 to 45 for African females, reducing the [[life expectancy]] in South Africa by 18 years and in Botswana by 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Ngom, Pierre  |author2=Clark, Samuel   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Adult Mortality In The Era Of HIV/AIDS: Sub-Saharan Africa  | publisher = Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations Secretariat  | date=  18 August 2003 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adultmort/CLARK_Paper3.pdf  | format = pdf  | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adulthood==
According to Erikson, in the wake of the adolescent emphasis upon [[identity formation]], 'the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He [or she] is ready for [[intimacy]], that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=255}} To do so means the ability 'to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and [[sex|sexual unions]], in close friendships and in physical combat'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}} Avoidance of such experiences 'because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of [[solitude|isolation]] and consequent self-absorption'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}}

Where isolation is avoided, the young adult may find instead that 'satisfactory sex relations... in some way take the edge off the hostilities and potential rages caused by the oppositeness of male and female, of fact and fancy, of [[love]] and hate';{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=257}} and may grow into the ability to exchange intimacy, love and [[compassion]].

In modern societies, young adults in their late teens and early 20s encounter a number of issues as they finish school and begin to hold full-time jobs and take on other responsibilities of adulthood; and 'the young adult is usually preoccupied with self-growth in the context of society and relationships with others.'{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=227}} The danger is that in 'the second era, ''Early Adulthood''... we must make crucially important choices regarding marriage, family, work, and lifestyle before we have the maturity or life experience to choose wisely.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

While 'young adulthood is filled with avid quests for intimate relationships and other major commitments involving career and life goals', there is also "a parallel pursuit for the formulation of a set of moral values".{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=298}} Erikson has argued that it is only now that what he calls the 'ideological mind' of adolescence gives way to 'that ''[[Ethics|ethical]] sense'' which is the mark of the adult.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|pp=254–6}}

Reaching adulthood in modern society is not always a linear or clean transition. As generations continue to adapt, new markers of adulthood are created that add different social expectations of what it means to be an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandegrift |first1=Darcie |title='We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=221–36 |doi=10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age 30 transition==

Daniel Levinson suggested that the first phase of early adulthood comes to a close around twenty-eight to thirty, when 'at about 28 the provisional character of the twenties is ending and life is becoming more serious... the ''age-thirty crisis''.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; between age 28 and 32', stressing that 'it is not uncommon, at the approach to the thirties, to tear up the life structure one put together to support the original dream of the twenties,'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=47}} and to start anew—'to create the basis for the next life structure.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;
When 'the Age Thirty Transition' is a difficult one, 'in a severe crisis [s/]he experiences a threat to life itself, the danger of chaos and dissolution, the loss of hope for the future.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

==Settling down==
After the relative upheaval of the early 30s, the middle to late 30s are often characterized by '''settling down''': 'the establishment phase', involving 'what we would call ''major life investments''—work, family, friends, community activities, and values.'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=72}} What has been termed 'the ''Culminating Life Structure for Early Adulthood'' (33–40) is the vehicle for completing this era and realizing our youthful aspirations.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; People in their thirties may increase the financial and emotional investments they make in their lives, and may have been employed long enough to gain promotions and raises. They often become more focused on advancing their careers and gaining stability in their personal lives—'with marriage and child-rearing,'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}} starting a [[family]], coming to the fore as priorities.

[[Gail Sheehy]], however, signposts the same twenties/thirties division rather differently, arguing that nowadays 'the twenties have stretched out into a long Provisional Adulthood', and that in fact 'the transition to the Turbulent Thirties marks the initiation to First Adulthood.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}}

==Midlife transition==

Young Adulthood then draws to its close with 'the ''Midlife Transition'', from roughly age 40 to 45'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;—producing 'a brand-new passage in the forties, when First Adulthood ends and Second Adulthood begins.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=14}}
