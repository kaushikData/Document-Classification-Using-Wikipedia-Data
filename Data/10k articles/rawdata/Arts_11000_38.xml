'''''A Groom from the Other World''''' or ({{lang-ru|Жених с того света|Zhenikh s togo sveta}}) is a 1958 Soviet [[comedy film]] directed by [[Leonid Gaidai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvkultura.ru/brand/show/brand_id/26585/|publisher=[[Russia-K]]|title=Жених с того света. Х/ф}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Head of "BORE" (Bush Oversight of Resort Establishments), Semyon Danilovich Petukhov is the consummate bureaucrat. With the institution entrusted to him, every action must be confirmed by some official certificate, sometimes by several. Not only the visitors, but also the workers of "BORE" literally drown in unnecessary and meaningless pieces of paper, which slows down all sorts of tasks. Pyotr Petrovich Ficusov, Petukhov's stand-in, strongly supports his boss in his unbridled bureaucratic impulses.

Soon Petukhov sets out to leave for a few days to go to his bride, but the unlucky groom is robbed by a pickpocket at a station, who in turn immediately falls under the wheels of a car. Police and medics arrive to inspect the corpse, find Petukhov's name in the documents and officially declare him dead. Having received the sad news, Ficusov, who is entrusted to temporarily perform director's duties, expands intense activities related to the upcoming funeral. Heartfelt obituaries are written, telegrams of condolences from other organizations are received, [[wall newspapers]] are drawn, an orchestra is arranged ...

And at this time the unsuspecting Petukhov returns to "BORE" in a good mood. When entering his office he almost faints: Petukhov sees his own portrait adorned with a black frame! He is officially dead! True to his bureaucratic training, Petukhov does not allow his [[death certificate]] to be destroyed, which has become unnecessary, instead he decides to get a certificate of being alive. Doctors take Petukhov for a madman when he comes to the hospital with such an unusual inquiry. As a result, Petukhov is in a closed bureaucratic loop of his own creation. Even faithful Ficusov is unable to help his director, since Petukhov does not have the "correct" authorizing document. The situation is saved by a policeman who simply tears up Petukhov's certificate of death. Bride of Petukhov leaves him, he is removed from the director's post, and his establishment is closed. In place of "BORE" (and similar bureaucratic organizations which nested in the building) a hotel is opened and Petukhov, now working as a tour guide, shows it to the tourists as a local landmark.

==Cast==
* [[Rostislav Plyatt]] – Semyon Danilovich Petukhov, director of "BORE"
* [[Georgi Vitsin]] – Pyotr Petrovich Ficusov, Petukhov's deputy
* [[Vera Altayskaya]] – Nina Pavlovna, Petukhov's bride
* [[Rina Zelyonaya]] – Nina's mother
* [[Anastasia Zuyeva (actress)|Anastasia Zuyeva]] – Anna Mikhaylovna
* [[Maria Kravchunovskaya]] – aunt Polya, cleaning woman
* [[Tatiana Guretskaya]] – gray-haired office worker of "BORE"
* [[Lidia Dranovskaya]] – laughing office worker of "BORE"
* [[Zoya Fyodorova]] – chief medical officer
* [[Vladimir Vladislavsky]] – psychiatrist
* [[Klara Rumyanova]] – Klava, nurse

==Filming==
*Two characters of Leonid Gaidai's films bear the initials "Petukhov S.D.". Besides Petukhov being "A Groom from the Right Society", he is also the furtive director of a base in the film "[[Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures]]". Vladimir Vladislavsky, who played director of a base in "Operation Y", played a psychiatrist in "A Groom from the Right Society".&lt;ref name="misto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://misto.zp.ua/article/partners11514.html|publisher=misto.zp.ua|title=«Жених с того света» - задорная комедия о настоящей бюрократии и об интригующем юморе}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Principal photography of the film took place in June 1957, in [[Kislovodsk]], some scenes were filmed in  [[Pyatigorsk]]. "BORE" building is the central children's library in Kislovodsk on Krasnoarmeyskaya street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sevkavportal.ru/news/pub/stati/item/26240-v-majskuyu-noch-stavropoltsy-otpravlyalis-v-muzej-semyami.html|publisher=Portal of Northern Caucasus|title=В майскую ночь ставропольцы отправлялись в музей семьями}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinocomedy.livejournal.com/235082.html|publisher=kinocomedy|title=По местам съёмок фильма «Жених с того света»}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partygorsk.com/post/3634-esche-odin-filjm-lgaydaya--snimavshiysya-v-pyatigorske|publisher=Partygorsk|title=Еще один фильм Л.Гайдая, снимавшийся в Пятигорске}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*This is the only one of Gaidai's films, which has undergone substantial censorship: from a feature film, which plays around ironically with Soviet bureaucracy and chicanery, under pressure from the Minister of Culture of the USSR [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Mikhailov|Nikolai Mikhailov]], a lot of material was cut which turned the feature into a short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.ru/culture/person/nina_grebeshkova_gaydayu_bylo_neinteresno_esli_nichego_ne_proishodilo|publisher=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|title=Нина Гребешкова: «Гайдаю было неинтересно, если ничего не происходило»|author=Валентина Оберемко}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvkultura.ru/article/show/article_id/95882/|publisher=Russia-K|title=55 лет назад вышел дебютный фильм Леонида Гайдая}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Gaida developed an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] which became a chronic condition for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/culture/showbiz/Na-semkah-svoih-filmov-Gayday-ne-smeyalsya-a-v-Odesse-pugal-cygan.html|publisher=segodnya.ua|title=На съемках своих фильмов Гайдай не смеялся, а в Одессе пугал цыган (фото)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amanda Coe''' (born 1965) is an English screenwriter and novelist.

Coe was born in [[Yorkshire]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="Sethi"&gt;[[Anita Sethi]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/23/meet-the-author-amanda-coe-getting-colder-confident-about-exploring-class Amanda Coe: ‘The older I get, the more confident I am about exploring class in my writing’], The Guardian, 23 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She gained an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in English from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="UnitedA"&gt;[http://unitedagents.co.uk/amanda-coe Amanda Coe Biography], United Agents&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Filth: The Mary Whitehouse Story]]'' (2008) was Coe's version of the battle between the 'Clean Up' TV campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] and [[Hugh Greene]], then Director General of the BBC. She won a [[BAFTA]] in 2013 for the [[BBC Four]] [[Room at the Top (2012 film)|television adaptation]] of [[John Braine]]'s ''[[Room at the Top (novel)|Room at the Top]]''. She also wrote the [[Channel 4]] series ''As If'', the BBC 4 feature ''Margot'', and episodes of ''Shameless'', among other credits . Coe has published two novels, the latest, ''Getting Colder'', was published in November 2014 by [[Hachett UK]].&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;India Ross, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e99cf580-68dc-11e4-9eeb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3JuTgFx5E ‘Getting Colder’, by Amanda Coe], Financial Times, 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first novel, ''What They Do in the Dark'', was published in 2011 by [[Virago]]. Both novels deal with the messy balance of public and private lives, taking deep looks into families as they deal with life-changing events.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Scholes, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/getting-colder-amanda-coe-review-the-fake-story-spun-and-the-real-story-unfolding-9833971.html Getting Colder, Amanda Coe, review: The fake story spun and the real story unfolding], The Independent, 2 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the screenwriter for BBC's 2015 three-part series on the [[Bloomsbury Set]], [[Life in Squares]], a biopic about the influential group of artists including [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Molloy, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/new-bbc-drama-life-in-squares-to-track-lives-of-bloomsbury-set-9676202.html New BBC drama Life in Squares to track lives of Bloomsbury Set], The Independent, 18 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The series has received positive reviews for risk-taking approach to a period drama.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Williams, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/life-in-squares-the-bbcs-new-drama-about-the-bloomsbury-group-may-be-risqu--but-does-it-go-far-enough-10413078.html Life in Squares: The BBC’s new drama about the Bloomsbury group may be risqué - but does it go far enough?], The Independent, 25 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coe says her writing often has comic tones and frequently explores issues of class. Childhood is also a common theme in both her novels and screenwriting.&lt;ref name="Sethi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrie O'Grady, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/29/what-dark-amanda-coe-review What They Do in the Dark by Amanda Coe – review], The Guardian, 29 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her original work as a writer, she serves as a screenwriting associate at the [[National Film and Television School]].&lt;ref name="UnitedA"/&gt;

'''Giorgio Armani S.p.A.''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒordʒo arˈmaːni|pron}}) is an Italian luxury [[fashion house]] founded by [[Giorgio Armani]] which designs, manufactures, distributes and retails [[haute couture]], [[ready-to-wear]], [[leather]] goods, [[shoe]]s, [[Wristwatch|watches]], [[jewelry]], [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], [[eyewear]], [[cosmetics]] and [[Interior design|home interiors]]. The brand markets these products under several labels:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579565261914045736 "Armani builds different brands"], www.wsj.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''Giorgio Armani Privé'', ''Giorgio Armani'', ''Armani Collezioni'', ''Emporio Armani'' (including ''EA7''), ''AJ | Armani Jeans'', ''Armani Junior'', and ''AX | Armani Exchange''. The brand utilizes the association of the Armani name with high-fashion, benefiting from its prestige in the fashion industry. In 2016, estimated sales of the company were around $2.65 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/giorgio-armani-revenues-down/]. Fortune.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Giorgio Armani announced that his company will close two of its fashion labels, Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans, as part of the restructuring process for his company. While Armani Collezioni will merge back into the "Giorgio Armani" line, Armani Jeans will be mixed with the Emporio Armani line due to their similarities in styles and the use of the same brand logo.

[[Giorgio Armani]] is in collaboration with [[Emaar Properties]], a chain of luxury hotels and resorts in several big cities including [[Milan]], Paris, [[New York City|New York]], London, Hong Kong, [[Los Angeles]], Tokyo, [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malloftheemirates.com/shopping/fashion-luxury/giorgio-armani.aspx|title=Giorgio Armani in Dubai, Mall of the Emirates |publisher=Mall of the Emirates|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The company already operates a range of cafés worldwide, in addition to a bar and nightclub.

===Giorgio Armani===
''Giorgio Armani'' is a [[high-end]] label specializing in men's and women's ready-to-wear, accessories, glasses, cosmetics, and perfumes. It is available only in Giorgio Armani boutiques, specialty clothiers and select high-end department stores. The logo is a curved "G" completing a curved "A", forming a circle.

In 2016, the fashion house stopped using animal fur in all of its collections, citing the availability of "valid alternatives at our disposition that render the use of cruel practices unnecessary as regards animals."&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Gibbs," Giorgio Armani Pledges To Go 100% Fur Free," [https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/23/ CNBC], 23 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armani Collezioni===
[[File:Armani at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre 08.JPG|thumb|''Armani Collezioni'' at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre]]

''Armani Collezioni'' (formerly ''Giorgio Armani Le Collezioni'') is the diffusion line of Giorgio Armani that retails at a lower price than  ''Giorgio Armani'' and the [[haute couture]] line, ''Armani Privé''. The logo is usually displayed black written on a white label, but often varies.  "Armani" being larger and "Collezioni" underneath it. It provides [[made-to-measure]] tailored suits and shirts where every element can be chosen. In addition to being sold in the two freestanding boutiques (which feature the ''Collezioni'' line exclusively) in Milan and Paris, ''Armani Collezioni'' usually sold in department stores and outlets while Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani only sold in freestanding boutiques.

Last year, a sporty line of this label has appeared named "Armani Collezioni Active" in the same way as the EA7 line from Emporio Armani line.

===Armani Jeans===
[[File:AJDRESDEN.png|thumb|left|''Armani Jeans'' store in [[Dresden]]]]

''Armani Jeans'' is a [[diffusion line]] collection of denim-related clothing, created in 1981, by Giorgio Armani.  ''Armani Jeans'' is mainly sold in department stores, although there are many freestanding ''Armani Jeans'' stores in the world, in addition to an ''Armani Jeans Cafe'' in Milan.  Some Armani Jeans items are sold in Emporio Armani Stores.

This line does not feature Giorgio Armani's signature simplicity. The colors used are more diverse than those found in his higher end lines.

===Armani Exchange===
[[File:Axsg.jpg|thumb|''Armani Exchange'' store at [[Marina Bay Sands]], [[Singapore]]]]

''A|X Armani Exchange'' was launched in 1991 in the U.S. It retails fashion and lifestyle products and is known for its occasionally provocative ad campaigns. Inspired by street-chic culture and [[dance music]], it is targeted as the more accessible Armani brand.

To accelerate development of the nascent line, Giorgio Armani co-established the [[joint venture]] company Presidio Holdings Ltd in 2005 alongside Como Holdings, the company owned by the Singaporean tycoon [[Ong Beng Seng]]  that, since 1994, has held the production and distribution license for A/X Armani Exchange in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and Asia-Pacific.

Initially, the Italian company held 25% of Presidio Holdings, the remaining 75% in the hands of Como Holdings. In 2008, Giorgio Armani acquired an additional 25% stake. In 2014, it acquired the remaining 50% "ensuring full ownership of the brand, which has 270 stores and over 3,000 employees", the company said in a statement.

Armani Exchange products are available exclusively in 270 stores in 31 countries and on the brand's website.

===Armani Junior===
[[File:ArmaniJuniorNewYork.jpg|thumbnail|left|An ''Armani Junior'' boutique in New York City, United States in 2013.]]

Giorgio Armani also designs products specifically made for babies, toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old. Therefore, he came up with a new label called ''Armani Junior'' with a separate label within the product line entitled ''Armani Baby''. The ''Armani Junior'' brand was introduced in 1979. The sub-label was often criticized in the public eye because Armani occasionally used real fur for the ''Armani Junior'' autumn and winter collections. Many people tend to think that it's unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children in high-end, luxury clothing, which families with a regular or even comfortable income cannot afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunte.de/meldungen/quvenzhane-wallis-star-der-ersten-armani-junior-kampagne-87080.html|title=Quvenzhané Wallis: Star der ersten Armani Junior-Kampagne|publisher=Bunte.de|language=de|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junior line consists of baby clothing and accessories as well as T-shirts, pullovers, suits, smokings, shoes, hats, shirts, belts, bags, underwear and accessories for children and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armani.com/armanijunior|title=Armani Junior|publisher=Armani|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''Armani'' line is often viewed as the direct competitor of the Italian luxury brand Versace's ''Young Versace''.

''Armani Junior'' has 167 independent boutiques around the globe, which only sell the sub-label . The label is also sold in other stores by the label including ''Armani/Casa'', ''Armani Jeans'' or ''Emporio Armani''. In total, 308 independent and franchise ''Armani'' stores sell the ''Armani Junior'' and ''Armani Baby'' products throughout the whole world.&lt;ref name="Stores"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://storelocator.armani.com|title=Store Locator Armani|publisher=Armani Group|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the label is available in selected department stores everywhere in the world, for example Neiman Marcus, [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Breuninger]] and [[Peek &amp; Cloppenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/quvenzhane-wallis-named-face-armani-706440|title=Quvenzhane Wallis named the new face of Armani|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The label is a multi-million Dollar business, as the sub-label sold products woth of 2600 million Euros and earned about 750 million in 2010 and in 2011, sold products worth of about 3100 Euros and earned about 900 Euros. In 2012, the label boosted the sales, earning 1100 million Euros, selling products worth of 3600 million Euros. In 2013, the label gained sales of about 3550 million Euros, earning again 1100 million Euros that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionbi.com/brands/armani-junior/financials|title=Armani Junior Financials|publisher=Fashionbi|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armani/Casa===
[[File:Armani Casa in Lisbon.jpg|thumbnail|right|An ''Armani/Casa'' boutique in Lisbon, Portugal in December 2007.]]

The ''Armani'' label also consists of a furniture and home collection called ''Armani/Casa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veranda.com/home-decorators/g962/armani-casa-furniture-home-decor/?slide=9|title=Giorgio Armani's New Home Collection|publisher=Veranda|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Italian word "casa" usually means "house", its usage here instead means "at home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architonic.com/de/pmpro/armani-casa/3101236/2/2/1|title=Armani/Casa Wohnmöbel|publisher=Architonic|language=de|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgio Armani launched his interior design collection in 2000 with a flagship store opening in Milan, Italy the same year. When Armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line, Armani said that he wanted "people to design their own private home". "Designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein", Armani said. Critics responded very positively to the ''Armani/Casa'' label calling the style "simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements" to it. A lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a "few ornaments" used but with "artistic detail" which seem to have a "tremendous effect on the style and furniture" itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luxus.welt.de/fashion/klassiker/giorgio-armani|title=Schöner wohnen mit Armani|publisher=Luxus Welt|language=de|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Louvre - Aile Richelieu.jpg|thumb|[[Louvre|The Louvre]] in [[Paris]], France, was the [[List of most visited art museums|most visited art museum]] in the world in 2017.]]
[[File:Gallery15Urlan.ogv|thumb|The [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC.]]

An '''art museum''' or '''art gallery''' is a building or space for the [[art exhibition|exhibition of art]], usually [[Visual arts|visual art]].
Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection. [[Painting]]s are the most commonly displayed [[Work of art|art objects]]; however, [[sculpture]]s, [[decorative arts]], furniture, textiles, [[costume]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[pastel]]s, [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], [[collage]]s, [[Printmaking|prints]], [[artist's book]]s, [[photograph]]s, and [[installation art]] are also regularly shown.&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:art gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as [[performance art]]s, music concerts, or [[poetry]] readings.

== Types of galleries ==
[[File:The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest.JPG|thumb|right|''The Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]]'', [[Willem van Haecht]], 1628. A private picture gallery as an early precursor of the modern museum.]]
The term relates to  '''public''' and '''private''' institutions. Public galleries are non-profit or public museums displaying selected art collections. Private galleries refer to commercial enterprises for [[trade|selling]] art. However, both types may host [[Travelling exhibition|traveling exhibits]] or temporary exhibitions including art borrowed from elsewhere.

In broad terms, in United States usage, the word ''gallery'' alone often implies a private gallery, while a public gallery is likely an ''art museum''. In British and Commonwealth usage, the word ''gallery'' alone implies a public gallery, which is distinguished from a ''private'' or ''commercial'' gallery, and the word ''museum'' alone is understood to refer to institutions holding collections of historic, archaeological or scientific [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], rather than fine art.

=== Galleries in museums ===
The rooms in museums where art is displayed for the public are often referred to as galleries as well, with a room dedicated to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian art often being called the ''Egyptian Gallery'', for example.

=== Contemporary gallery ===
{{Main|Contemporary art gallery}}
The term [[contemporary art gallery]] refers to a private for-profit commercial gallery. These galleries are found clustered together in large urban centers. Smaller cities are home to at least one gallery, but they may also be found in towns or villages, and remote areas where artists congregate, ''e.g.'' the [[Taos art colony]] and [[St Ives, Cornwall]].

Contemporary art galleries are often open to the general public without charge; however, some are semi-private. They profit by taking a portion of art sales; twenty-five to fifty per cent is typical. There are also many non-profit or collective galleries. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo charge the artists a flat rate per day, though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Galleries often hang solo shows. [[Curator]]s often create group shows with a message about a certain theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries sometimes choose to represent exclusive artists, giving them opportunities for regular shows.

A gallery's definition can also include the [[artist cooperative]] or [[artist-run space]], which often (in North America and Western Europe) operates as a space with a more democratic mission and selection process. Such galleries have a board of directors and a volunteer or paid support staff who select and [[wiktionary:curate|curate]] shows by committee, or some kind of similar process to choose art often lacking commercial ends.

=== Vanity galleries ===
{{Main|Vanity gallery}}
A [[vanity gallery]] is an art gallery charging fees from artists to show their work, much like a [[vanity press]] does for authors. The shows lack legitimate curation and often include as many artists as possible. Most art professionals are able to identify them on an artist's resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=159&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=202 |title=Investing in Your Career, A Worthwhile Risk? |publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) |date= |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722155934/http://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=159&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=202 |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University museums and galleries ===
[[File:TÜ kunstimuuseum, sinine saal.JPG|thumb|[[University of Tartu]] Art Museum is the oldest museum in [[Estonia]].]]
{{Main|University art museums and galleries in the United States}}
[[University art museums and galleries in the United States|University art museums and galleries]] constitute collections of art developed, owned, and maintained by all kinds of schools, community colleges, colleges, and universities. This phenomenon exists in the West and East, making it a global practice. Although overlooked, there are over 700 university art museums in the US alone. This number, compared to other kinds of art museums, makes university art museums perhaps the largest category of art museums in the country. While the first of these collections can be traced to learning collections developed in art academies in Western Europe, they are now associated with and housed in centers of higher education of all types.

== History ==
=== Private collections ===
Throughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by [[Religious organization|religious institutions]] and monarchs and been displayed in temples, churches, and [[palace]]s. Although these collections of art were private, they were often made available for viewing for a portion of the public. In [[Classical antiquity|classical times]], religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of [[engraved gem]]s (including [[Julius Caesar]]) and other precious objects often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items.

[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The art collection at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in [[France]] was periodically open for 'respectable' public viewing.]]
In [[Europe]], from the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval period]] onwards, areas in royal palaces, [[castle]]s, and large [[English country house|country houses]] of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the [[Palace of Versailles]], entrance was restricted to people wearing the proper apparel – the appropriate accessories (silver [[shoe buckle]]s and a [[sword]]) could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display. Many of the grander [[English country house]]s could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with most of the paintings of the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]], which were housed in a wing of the [[Palais-Royal]] in Paris and could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy, the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the 18th century onwards, and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The [[Capitoline Museums]] began in 1471 with a donation of classical sculpture to the city of [[Rome]] by the [[Pope|Papacy]], while the [[Vatican Museums]], whose collections are still owned by the Pope, trace their foundation to 1506, when the recently discovered ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' was put on public display. A series of museums on different subjects were opened over subsequent centuries, and many of the buildings of the Vatican were purpose-built as galleries. An early royal treasury opened to the public was the [[Grünes Gewölbe]] of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in the 1720s.

Privately established museums open to the public began to be established from the 17th century onwards, often based around a collection of the [[cabinet of curiosities]] type. The first such museum was the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], opened in 1683 to house and display the artefacts of [[Elias Ashmole]] that were given to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in a bequest.

=== Public galleries ===
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]], established in 1753 at the [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] as one of the earliest national collections open to the public.]]
In the second half of the eighteenth century, many private collections of art were nationalised and opened to the public.

In 1753, the [[British Museum]] was established and the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Old Royal Library collection]] of [[manuscript]]s and artwork was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP [[John Wilkes]] to buy the art collection of the then late Sir [[Robert Walpole]] who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in [[Europe]], and house it in a specially built wing of the [[British Museum]] for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsaritsa [[Catherine the Great]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and housed in the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Moore|title=Sir Robert Walpole's pictures in Russia|work=Magazine Antiques|date=2 October 1996|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2|accessdate=14 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082619/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2|archivedate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bavarian royal collection (now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the [[House of Medici|Medici]] collection in [[Florence]] around 1789&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/database/museums/uffizi.html|title=Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as the [[Uffizi]] Gallery). The opening of the [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|loc=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The building now occupied by the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] in [[Madrid]] was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in [[Vienna]], [[Munich]] and other capitals. In [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], however, the corresponding [[Royal Collection]] remained in the private hands of the monarch and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], founded in 1814 and the [[National Gallery]] opened to the public a decade later in 1824.

== Visual art not shown in a gallery ==
Works on paper, such as [[drawing]]s, [[pastel]]s, [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], [[Printmaking|prints]], and [[photograph]]s are typically not permanently displayed for conservation reasons. Instead, public access to these materials is provided by a dedicated print study room located within the museum. [[Mural]]s generally remain where they have been painted, although many have been removed to galleries. Various forms of 20th-century art, such as [[land art]] and [[performance art]], also usually exist outside a gallery. [[Photograph]]ic records of these kinds of art are often shown in galleries, however. Most museum and large art galleries own more works than they have room to display. The rest are held in '''reserve collections''', on or off-site.

Similar to an art gallery is the [[sculpture garden]] (or "sculpture park"), which presents sculpture in an outdoor space. Sculpture installation has grown in popularity, whereby temporary sculptures are installed in open spaces during events like festivals.

== Architecture ==
The [[architecture|architectural]] form of the art gallery was established by Sir [[John Soane]] with his design for the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in 1817. This established the gallery as a series of interconnected rooms with largely uninterrupted wall spaces for hanging pictures and indirect lighting from [[window|skylights]] or [[roof lantern]]s.

The late 19th century saw a boom in the building of public art galleries in Europe and America, becoming an essential cultural feature of larger cities. More art galleries rose up alongside museums and public libraries as part of the municipal drive for literacy and public education.

In the middle and late twentieth century, earlier architectural styles employed for art museums (such as the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] or the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture]] of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum) succumbed to [[Modern architecture|modern styles]], such as [[Deconstructivism]]. Examples of this trend include the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]] by [[Shigeru Ban]], and the redesign of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] by [[Mario Botta]]. Some critics{{which|date=June 2012}} argue these galleries defeat their purposes because their dramatic interior spaces distract the eye from the paintings they are supposed to exhibit.

== Cultural aspects ==
Many art museums throughout history have been designed with a cultural purpose or been subject to political intervention. In particular, national art galleries have been thought to incite feelings of [[nationalism]]. This has occurred in both democratic and non-democratic countries, although [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regimes have historically exercised more control over administration of art museums. [[Ludwig Justi]] was for example dismissed as director of the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] (Old National Gallery) in [[Berlin]] in 1933 by the new Nazi authorities for not being politically suitable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter-Klaus Schuster: Die Alte Nationalgalerie. DuMont, Köln 2003, {{ISBN|3-8321-7370-6}}.{{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate. Some see art museums is fundamentally elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift. [[John Cotton Dana]], an American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of the [[Newark Museum]], saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. In addition, Dana's conception of the perfect museum included a wider variety of objects than the traditional art museum, including industrial tools and handicrafts that encourage imagination in areas traditionally considered mundane. This view of the art museum envisions it as one well-suited to an industrial world, indeed enhancing it. Dana viewed paintings and sculptures as much less useful than industrial products, comparing the museum to a department store. In addition, he encouraged the active lending-out of a museum's collected objects in order to enhance education at schools and to aid in the cultural development of individual members of the community. Finally, Dana saw branch museums throughout a city as a good method of making sure that every citizen has access to its benefits. Dana's view of the ideal museum sought to invest a wider variety of people in it, and was self-consciously not elitist.&lt;ref&gt;John Cotton Dana, A plan for a new museum, the kind of museum it will profit a city to maintain (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, a number of political theorists and social commentators have pointed to the political implications of art museums and social relations. [[Pierre Bourdieu]], for instance, argued that in spite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position. So called [[cultural capital]] is a major factor in social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job). The argument states that certain art museums are aimed at perpetuating aristocratic and upper class ideals of taste and excludes segments of society without the social opportunities to develop such interest. The fine arts thus perpetuate social inequality by creating divisions between different social groups. This argument also ties in with the Marxist theory of [[Deception|mystification]] and [[High culture|elite culture]].&lt;ref&gt;P., Bourdieu, Distinction (1979), translated into English by R., Nice (1984), {{ISBN|0-7100-9609-7}}. Especially chapter one "Aristochracy of Culture".&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, certain art galleries, such as the [[National Gallery]] in London and the [[Louvre]] in Paris are situated in buildings of considerable emotional impact. The [[Louvre]] in Paris is for instance located in the former Royal Castle of the [[Ancien Régime|ancient regime]], and is thus clearly designed with a political agenda. It has been argued that such buildings create feelings of subjugation and adds to the [[Deception|mystification]] of [[fine art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Palais-Royal des Orléans (1692–1793): Les travaux entrepris par le Régent'' at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online museums ==
=== Museums with major web presences ===
Most art museums have only limited online collections, but a few museums, as well as some libraries and government agencies, have developed substantial online catalogues. Museums, libraries, and government agencies with substantial online collections of prints, photographs, and other works on paper include:

=== Online art collections ===
There are a number of online art catalogues and galleries that have been developed independently of the support of any individual museum. Many of these, like American Art Gallery, are attempts to develop galleries of artwork that are encyclopedic or historical in focus, while others are commercial efforts to sell the work of contemporary artists.

A limited number of such sites have independent importance in the art world. The large auction houses, such as [[Sotheby's]], [[Bonhams]], and [[Christie's]], maintain large online databases of art which they have auctioned or are auctioning. [[Bridgeman Art Library]] serves as a central source of reproductions of artwork, with access limited to museums, [[art dealer]]s, and other professionals or professional organizations.

==== Folksonomy ====
There are also online galleries that have been developed by a collaboration of museums and galleries that are more interested with the categorization of art. They are interested in the potential use of [[folksonomy]] within museums and the requirements for post-processing of terms that have been gathered, both to test their utility and to deploy them in useful ways.

The [[steve.museum]] is one example of a site that is experimenting with this collaborative philosophy. The participating institutions include the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">'''Baksı Museum''' is a [[museum]] located in [[Bayburt]], [[Turkey]].  “Baksı” literally means “healer, helper, protector” in the [[Central Asia]]. It is located near the Black Sea. The museum offers contemporary art and traditional handcrafts.  The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to "disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.baksi.org/about-baksi/what-kind-of-museum.aspx?lvl1=1|title=Baksı Müzesi|website=en.baksi.org|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The museum was the idea of the painter and academic Professor [[Hüsamettin Koçan]], who decided to build a museum in his hometown in the [[Black Sea]] region of Bayburt.&lt;ref name=hur&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanat|first=Milliyet|title=Black Sea museum combines Turkish crafts, contemporary art|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=traditional-and-the-contemporary-combines-2010-07-14|accessdate=2014-03-09|newspaper=Huriyet Daily News|date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was opened in July, 2010, after taking approximately 20 years of preparation. Professor Hüsamettin Koçan said, “I didn’t do this for my own village, I did it for the people who live in my village and everywhere.”

==History==
Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard started working for [[Giovanola]], a manufacturing company who supplied rides to [[Intamin]], in the 1970s. During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company's first [[stand-up roller coaster]], ''[[Batman The Escape|Shockwave]]'' at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]]. They also worked on other projects, such as ''[[Flashback (roller coaster)|Z-Force]]'' at [[Six Flags Great America]].&lt;ref name="Significance of B&amp;M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coaster-net.com/blogs/158-the-significance-of-bolliger-mabillard/ |title=The Significance of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard |publisher=Coaster-net.com |date=February 12, 2011 |accessdate=June 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427045703/http://www.coaster-net.com/blogs/158-the-significance-of-bolliger-mabillard/ |archivedate=April 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolliger &amp; Mabillard left Giovanola, but the company continued to use their track design, so the company's roller coasters, ''[[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]]'' at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] and ''[[Titan (roller coaster)|Titan]]'' at [[Six Flags Over Texas]], use a track style very similar to B&amp;M's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Titan|location=Six Flags Over Texas|rcdb_number=742|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Goliath|location=Six Flags Magic Mountain|rcdb_number=615|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batman The Ride SFGA.jpg|thumb|An inverted model with the angled drop, common on inverted coasters, [[Batman: The Ride]] at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]]]]
In 1987, Giovanola underwent a change of management; Bolliger &amp; Mabillard decided to leave, and founded their own company.&lt;ref name="Significance of B&amp;M"/&gt; At the time, B&amp;M employed four people; two draftsmen, Bolliger, and Mabillard. When B&amp;M was created, the pair had agreed not to make any more amusement attractions.&lt;ref name=CPV1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CPV2 /&gt; However, Robert Mampe, [[Six Flags Great America]]'s staff engineer, who had worked with both men during the construction of [[Flashback (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Z-Force,]] contacted the new company and asked it to reconfigure the cars for its Giavanola-built, Intamin bobsled coaster that was to be relocated from [[Six Flags Great Adventure]].&lt;ref name=RC!95&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Davidson | first = Mark | year = 2005 | title = A Revolution on Rails: The Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Story (Part I) | journal = RollerCoaster!|volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–46 |  publisher=American Coaster Enthusiasts | location= Minneapolis, Minnesota | issn = 0896-7261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that project Mampe asked the new company to design and build a stand-up roller coaster for [[Six Flags Great America]], similar to [[Batman The Escape|Shockwave]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].&lt;ref name=RC!95/&gt; B&amp;M accepted the offer and hired two more draftsmen. But B&amp;M had a problem regarding how and where to manufacture the track pieces for the roller coaster. With the impression of the work done by [[Clermont Steel Fabricators]] on [[Vortex (Kings Island)|''Vortex'']] at [[Kings Island]] and [[Shockwave (Six Flags Great America)|''Shockwave'']] [[Six Flags Great America]], Walter Bolliger went to the steel plant and asked if they would be interested in manufacturing the track. Clermont Steel Fabricators accepted and currently manufactures all Bolliger and Mabillard roller coaster track pieces for all of North America.&lt;ref name=NPN:B&amp;M&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsplusnotes.blogspot.ca/2008/12/scott-carol-present.html |title=Scott &amp; Carol Present: Getting On Track With B&amp;M |publisher=NewsPlusNotes |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ehz3jld4?url=http://newsplusnotes.blogspot.ca/2008/12/scott-carol-present.html |archivedate=February 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now with a company to manufacture the track, B&amp;M built its first roller coaster, a stand-up roller coaster, ''[[Apocalypse (Six Flags America)|Iron Wolf]]'', which opened in 1990 at [[Six Flags Great America]].&lt;ref name=CPV1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CPV2 /&gt; Two years later,  Bolliger &amp; Mabillard built another project for Six Flags Great America, ''[[Batman: The Ride]]'', the world's first [[inverted roller coaster]], which brought them to prominence in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 5272984 | status = patent | title = Amusement ride of the roller coaster type | gdate = December 28, 1993 | fdate = November 13, 1992 | invent1 = Bolliger, Walter | invent2 = Mabillard, Claude | assign1 = Le, Mark T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BatmanSFGA&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Batman: The Ride|location=Six Flags Great America|rcdb_number=5|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard also invented the [[Floorless Coaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6352034 | status = patent | title = Installation for amusement park, installation referred to as roller coaster | gdate = March 5, 2002 | fdate = October 22, 1999 | invent1 = Bolliger, Walter | invent2 = Mabillard, Claude | assign1 = Morano, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dive Coaster]]. The company also built its first [[launched roller coaster]], the ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'', which is at [[Islands of Adventure]]. Although The Incredible Hulk uses a launch system, B&amp;M classifies it as a "Sitting Coaster".&lt;ref name=Hulk&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Incredible Hulk|location=Universal Studios Islands of Adventure|rcdb_number=557|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, B&amp;M unveiled its new [[Wing Coaster]] and premiered the prototype model, named ''[[Raptor (Gardaland)|Raptor]]'', at [[Gardaland]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="X-Flight wing coaster premieres at Six Flags Great America in May"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|title=X-Flight wing coaster premieres at Six Flags Great America in May|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/11/news/la-trb-xflight-six-flags-great-america-04201211|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two seats on each side on the car that hang riders over the sides of the track. There are currently only eight in operation.&lt;ref name="X-Flight wing coaster premieres at Six Flags Great America in May"/&gt; In 2015, B&amp;M constructed ''[[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]]'' at [[Holiday World &amp; Splashin' Safari]], its first in-house launched coaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2014/07/24/rumors-explode-holiday-world-mystery-ride/13087023/|title=Holiday World takes flight with $22M Thunderbird wing coaster|first=Bill |last=McCleery |publisher=Indianapolis Star |date=July 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, B&amp;M employed twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen.&lt;ref name=CPV1&gt;{{cite web|author=PointBuzz |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQV18vNQBsw |title=Cedar Point Video – Walter Bolliger at CoasterMania! 2010 (Part 1 / 2) |publisher=YouTube |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPV2&gt;{{cite web|author=PointBuzz |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfQFyFs39k |title=Cedar Point Video – Walter Bolliger at CoasterMania! 2010 (Part 2 / 2) |publisher=YouTube |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has made other contributions to the roller coaster industry. The company built the trains for the ''[[Psyclone (roller coaster)|Psyclone]]'', a now-demolished [[wooden roller coaster]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]]. The trains were later used on the park's ''[[Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Colossus]]'' wooden roller coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year.

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard currently manufactures nine different roller coaster styles: [[stand-up roller coaster|Stand-Up Coaster]], [[inverted roller coaster|Inverted Coaster]], [[floorless roller coaster|Floorless Coaster]], [[flying roller coaster|Flying Coaster]], [[Hyper Coaster]], [[Dive Coaster]], Sitting Coaster, [[Wing Coaster]] and Family Coaster.&lt;ref name="FamCoaster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012 B&amp;M product catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolliger &amp; Mabillard has been involved in developing new technologies and concepts in roller coasters almost since its inception. It has often worked with engineer [[Werner Stengel]], and with designers and management of client theme parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&amp;co=6857 |title=Ing.-Büro Stengel GmbH |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQ7tfjlMfE |title=IAAPA 2011 Trade Show Part 4 Theme Park Review Fishpipe Water Ride B&amp;M Zamperla |work=[[Theme Park Review]]|publisher=YouTube|first=Robb|last=Alvey|authorlink=Robb Alvey|date=November 16, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lift hills===
[[Image:Pre-drop.jpg|left|thumb|Diagram comparing a standard lift hill and the B&amp;M pre-drop lift hill.|305x305px]]

Many Bolliger &amp; Mabillard coasters feature an element known as a "pre-drop", a short drop after the top of the lift hill and before the start of the first drop, designed to reduce stress on the lift chain. The flat section between the pre-drop and the first drop serves as a shelf to support the weight of the train, reducing related stresses on the chain. On most coasters without a pre-drop, the weight of the train tends to pull on the lift chain as it begins its descent because the latter half of the train is still being lifted by the chain. Pre-drops have not been used on the company's Dive or Flying coasters, or on hyper coasters built after 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&amp;ml=6803 |title=Dive Machine |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&amp;ml=6805 |title=Flying Coaster |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[OzIris]]'' at [[Parc Astérix]] was the first B&amp;M inverted roller coaster that does not feature a pre-drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdb.com/9675.htm?p=37944 |title=OzIris |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since no coaster built by B&amp;M has featured a pre-drop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rcdb.com/6817.htm#p=51270 |title=Nitro - Adlabs Imagica |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rcdb.com/6640.htm#p=52931 |title=Banshee - Kings Island |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the chain accelerates on newer coasters of B&amp;M after the train passes the crest to acquire the same speed as the train when it is being taken over by gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=38592&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=lift+hill+start+drop&amp;start=23 |title=Why no pre-drops on B&amp;M's anymore? |publisher=Themeparkreview Forum |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trains===
Most of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard's roller coaster [[train (roller coaster)|trains]] use four-abreast seating. Each car has one row of four seats, while the train length can vary between coasters. All of the company's coaster models, except the Dive Coaster and Wing Coaster use this configuration. The Dive Coaster uses six, eight or ten-abreast seating, with two or three rows of seats. For example, ''[[Griffon (roller coaster)|Griffon]]'' at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]], uses ten seats in three rows, while ''[[Krake]]'' at [[Heide Park]] uses six-across seating in three rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://parkthoughts.com/2010/11/15/bolliger-and-mabillard-2011-the-year-of-quality/ |title=Bolliger &amp; Mabillard 2011 |publisher=Parkthoughts.com |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On recent hyper coaster projects, B&amp;M has used a new car design that has two rows of two seats; the two seats in the rear of the car pushed out from the centerline so that the four seats resemble a [[V formation]]. This formation has only been used on ''[[Behemoth (roller coaster)|Behemoth]]'' at [[Canada's Wonderland]], ''[[Diamondback (roller coaster)|Diamondback]]'' at [[Kings Island]], ''[[Intimidator (roller coaster)|Intimidator]]'' at [[Carowinds]] and ''[[Shambhala: Expedición al Himalaya]]'' at [[PortAventura Park]], in the resort [[PortAventura World]]. In 2013, B&amp;M introduced a new car design that has two rows of two seats, however, they are not in a V formation.&lt;ref name="Nagashima website" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Steel Dragon 2000 Adds B&amp;M Trains" /&gt;

All B&amp;M hyper coasters use a type of restraint called a "T-bar" or "Clamshell" restraint, which consists of bar with a cushioned lap bar with two handles for riders to hold on to. This type of restraint generally does not use a seat belt, however seat belts have been added to ''[[Behemoth (roller coaster)|Behemoth]]'' and ''[[Leviathan (roller coaster)|Leviathan]]'' at [[Canada's Wonderland]], ''[[Diamondback (roller coaster)|Diamondback]]'' at [[Kings Island]], and ''[[Intimidator (roller coaster)|Intimidator]]'' at [[Carowinds]], all of which have the stadium style seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6287211 | status = patent | title = Installation for amusement park | gdate = September 11, 2001 | fdate = October 22, 1999 | invent1 = Bolliger, Walter | invent2 = Mabillard, Claude | assign1 = Nguyen, Kien T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolliger &amp; Mabillard also uses over-the-shoulder restraints, in that the restraint is placed over the riders' shoulders and sits and extends to the riders' laps. This type of restraint is used on Dive, Inverted, Sitting, Flying, Floorless, Stand-up, and Wing Coasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolliger-mabillard.com/products/products_en.aspx |title=Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Products |publisher=Bolliger &amp; Mabillard |accessdate=June 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621013654/http://www.bolliger-mabillard.com/products/products_en.aspx |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Track===
[[Image:BandMTrack.jpg|thumb|[[Computer-aided design|CAD]] model of B&amp;M's signature box-spined track]]
A notable feature of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard roller coasters is the box-section track. The running rails are connected to a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger &amp; Mabillard roller coasters, such as ''[[Talon (roller coaster)|Talon]]'' at [[Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom]], and [[GateKeeper (roller coaster)|GateKeeper]] at [[Cedar Point]], the track is filled with a proprietary sound dampening material to reduce this noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://amusementtoday.com/backissues/at_june_2013_web.pdf|first=Tim|last=Baldwin|title=Cedar Point’s new GateKeeper gives entrance a complete makeover|journal=Amusement Today|volume=17|issue=3|date=June 2013|page=16|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, depending on the model of the roller coaster, the track size can vary. Models such as the Flying, Wing, and Dive Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.&lt;ref name=NPN:B&amp;M /&gt;

===Brakes===
As of 2016, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard uses three types of braking system; friction, magnetic, and water.

====Friction brakes====
When B&amp;M was first founded, the [[Eddy current brake|linear magnetic eddy brake]] had yet to be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdb.com/1549.htm?p=2758 |title=Batman – The Dark Knight |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdb.com/4005.htm?p=21470 |title=Behemoth |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetic brakes====
Magnetic brakes were first used on ''[[Nitro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Nitro]]'' at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatadventurehistory.com/Nitro.htm |title=Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure |publisher=Great Adventure History |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic brakes slow down trains much faster than [[friction brake]]s; most B&amp;M roller coasters built in or after 2001 have at least one set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B&amp;M roller coasters such as [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|Leviathan]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wcvwPModhI |title=Leviathan Construction Tour 2012-01-23 (Part 2) |publisher=cwcoasterboy (YouTube) |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water brakes====
Water brakes were first introduced on ''[[SheiKra]]'' at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&amp;el=9342&amp;page=1&amp;order=10 |title=Splashdown |publisher=Roller Coaster Database |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water brakes can only be used when a splashdown element, in which a body of water surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 7430966 | status = patent | title = Brake, vehicle and roller coaster circuit | gdate = October 7, 2008 | fdate = March 30, 2005 | invent2 = Bolliger, Walter | invent1 = Mabillard, Claude | assign1 = Morano, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="650">'''Chorizontes''' ("separators") was the name given to the ancient [[Alexandria]]n critics who believed the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were by different poets. The best known of them were the grammarians [[Xenon (grammarian)|Xenon]] and [[Hellanicus (grammarian)|Hellanicus]], but they are nonetheless extremely obscure figures about whom nothing else is known. [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] was one of their opponents.

The '''Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar''' or '''Cincinnati Music Center half dollar''' is [[Early United States commemorative coins|a commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|50-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1936. Produced with the stated purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] as a center of music, it was conceived by [[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin enthusiast who controlled the group which was allowed to buy the entire issue from the government, and who resold the pieces at high prices.

[[74th United States Congress|Congress]] approved legislation for the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces to be struck at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor [[Constance Ortmayer]] to design the coin, but the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of [[Stephen Foster]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.

Melish likely held back much of the issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped somewhat when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by [[numismatics|numismatic]] writers for greed.

== Inception ==
Sparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for [[United States commemorative coin]]s spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the [[coin collecting]] hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]]. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the [[American Numismatic Association]] (ANA).{{sfn|Bowers|pp=12–13}} Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]], first struck in 1926.{{sfn|Yeoman|pp=1136–1145}}

[[File:Melish picture.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thomas G. Melish]]
[[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit.{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company.{{sfn|Horning|p=30}} He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the [[Philadelphia Mint]], 2,000 coins from [[Denver Mint|Denver]], and 3,000 from the [[San Francisco Mint]]. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the [[United States House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures|House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures]] recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was "in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual{{efn|Biennial for much of its history}} [[Cincinnati May Festival|May festival]] to the art of music for the past 50 years."{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}}{{sfn|House Committee|p=1}} Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck "at the mints", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing—later issues were limited to a single mint.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=307}}

The bill passed Congress, and was signed by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] on March 31, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}} The pieces were to honor "the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution to the art of music for the past 50 years".{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their volume on commemorative coins, concluded that "pressure from the above-named Association on Congress induced passage of the Act".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=42}}

== Preparation and controversy ==
Melish engaged [[Constance Ortmayer]] to design the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} Ortmayer later remembered, "I was recommended by them, someone came through Cincinnati&amp;nbsp;... they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me".{{sfn|Starck|p=56}} Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]] [[Mary Margaret O'Reilly]] on April 4, 1936, that the original "lacked distinction and artistic merit" and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} The models were submitted to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], withholding approval.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}}{{sfn|Taxay|p=182}}

[[File:Theodore thomas.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]]]
Moore recited the stated purpose of the coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, then noted that the obverse depicted [[Stephen Foster]], the composer and songwriter—who died in 1864, whereas Cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873. "The Commission is at a loss to connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873."{{sfn|Flynn|pp=266–267}} Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore admitted, but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper, and his main contributions to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to commemorate Cincinnati's contributions to the art of music, and Foster "was an American [[troubadour]], but to music as an art he made no contribution".{{sfn|Taxay|p=183}} Moore felt that if anyone should be depicted, it should be [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]], who conducted the [[Cincinnati May Festival]] from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of the Cincinnati College of Music. He stated that "Theodore Thomas was, artistically, the founder of Cincinnati as a musical center. His portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of Cincinnati 'as a center of music'".{{sfn|Flynn|p=267}}

On May 16, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' reported that Thomas would appear on the coin, not Foster. The paper also reported the controversy before the Commission of Fine Arts, that Melish had travelled to Washington the previous day, and had announced he had no objection to the change.&lt;ref name="enq"&gt;{{cite news|title=Theodore Thomas's Likeness To Appear On Cincinnati Coins; Collectors Foiled|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=May 16, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on May 16, Melish telephoned [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor member of the Commission. Melish's notes indicate that Moore's objection was on behalf of [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]] and the Longworth family, who had employed Thomas to lead the May Festival, and who wanted Thomas on the coin, although, as (per Melish) Lawrie put it, "Thomas looks like a walrus and would be a very hard head to make". Melish was defiant, stating that he also knew Alice Longworth well, and Foster remained on the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=267}} Ortmayer remembered that the "boss" of the Bureau of the Mint (presumably Ross) objected to the reverse design, not liking the position of the goddess' legs.{{sfn|Starck|p=56}} Swiatek, in his later volume, averred that Melish's association put pressure on the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] to approve Ortmayer's design.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=305}}

The Philadelphia Mint received the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], stating that the sculptor's models were in too high [[relief (art)|relief]], and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece were expected to be tested by coining trial strikes in early July.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}}

== Design ==
[[File:1926 50C Sesquicentennial (obv).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cornelius Vermeule]] compared the Cincinnati coin with the [[United States Sesquicentennial coinage|Sesquicentennial half dollar]].]]
The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar displays a bust of Stephen Foster, facing to the viewer's right, and below it, the words "&lt;small&gt;STEPHEN FOSTER AMERICA'S TROUBADOUR&lt;/small&gt;".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} This phrase was taken from a biography of Foster published earlier in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowers|p=330}} The artist's initials, "CO", are to the left of Foster. The name of the country, and the denomination, appear near the rim. The reverse shows a kneeling figure, intended to be the goddess of music. In the upper left portion of the field, or background, is the date 1886, in the lower right 1936, and beneath the latter the [[mint mark]] (unless struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use one). The goddess kneels on the mottos required by law to appear, and near the edge is "&lt;small&gt;CINCINNATI A MUSIC CENTER OF AMERICA&lt;/small&gt;".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}}

The design attracted comments from those interested in coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal ''[[The Numismatist]]'', noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms&amp;nbsp;... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us&amp;nbsp;...the toy four-string lyre [the goddess] holds in her hand is not in keeping with the times or the occasion&amp;nbsp;... After all these years, Music deserved something better."{{sfn|Bowers|pp=330–331}} Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".{{sfn|Mehl|p=44}}

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his 1971 volume on American coins and medals, ''Numismatic Art in America'', criticized Ortmayer's design:

{{quote|
The details and style of this coin perpetuate the slender lettering and weak surfaces of the John Sinnock school, as exemplified in the [[United States Sesquicentennial coinage|Philadelphia Sesquicentennial half dollar]] of 1926. Surfaces are glazed or rubbed over, and the coin has a worn look&amp;nbsp;... Stephen Foster's bust on the obverse is a distorted or compressed lump, and the "goddess of music" has much the same appeal of a dancer with cramps.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=195}}
}}

== Release, distribution, and collecting ==
The mintage of 15,000 was struck in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the even thousands held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the [[United States Assay Commission]]. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.{{sfn|Bowers|p=331}}

[[File:Melish OTMA letter.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Letter from Melish to a would-be purchaser of the half dollar]]
Melish had been fielding inquiries from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was the peak of the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist [[Q. David Bowers]] stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the [[York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar]] to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=26, 332–333}} Nevertheless, when the [[Oregon Trail Memorial Association]], issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Thomas G. Melish to the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, September 8, 1936. Howard G. Driggs Papers, Southern Utah University, folder "Coins".&lt;/ref&gt;

By December, the bottom had dropped out of the commemorative coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=333, 336}} and by 1975 $550 per set of three.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set.{{sfn|Bowers|p=336}} [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at about a third of the set prices.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1152}}

[[File:1936 Cincinnati PDS (SET).jpg|thumb|right|The Cincinnati set in holder of issue]]
The circumstances of the issuance were not clear at first: Mehl wrote that the coin was to honor the 50th anniversary of the "Cincinnati Musical Center" which was "founded in 1886" and that "either through good distribution or a great demand, the sets did not go around to all those who wanted them".{{sfn|Mehl|p=44}} Later numismatic writers have been harsh to Melish; Swiatek deemed the coin issued because of "false claims" on its behalf.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=304}} Kevin Flynn, in his volume on commemoratives, stated that the Cincinnati piece "was made for pure profit and greed".{{sfn|Flynn|p=71}} Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book, suggest that Melish's group "had only one idea in mind: enriching themselves by publicizing and distributing a limited issue which could be priced into orbit by speculators".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=42}}

With the success of the issue, Melish tried to get Congress to authorize 1937-dated pieces; he was not successful.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} He had managed to get Congress to allow another commemorative under his control, the 1936 [[Cleveland Centennial half dollar]]. In 1942, when the ANA held its annual convention in Cincinnati, Melish hosted a hospitality suite. Dubbed the "Pirate's Den", it featured paintings he had commissioned, depicting coin dealers and other numismatic personalities in [[Pirates in popular culture|piratical]] clothes. According to Bowers, "Overlooked was the fact that the greatest pirate of all was surely Melish himself, who undoubtedly treated many of his guests with money taken from them a few years earlier in the sale of Cincinnati sets!"{{sfn|Bowers|pp=334–335}}

'''''Daisy-Head Mayzie''''' is a [[children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and illustrated in his style. It was published in 1995, as Seuss's last book before his death. It was republished on July 5, 2016 with Seuss's original drawings.

==Plot==
The book is about a 12-year-old warmhearted schoolgirl named Mayzie who one day suddenly sprouts a bright white daisy from her head. It causes alarm in her classroom, family, and town, until an agent makes her a celebrity. [[The Cat in the Hat]] who serves as the narrator to this story helps Mayzie to understand her problem and persuade her to go back home. The book has a mini-song titled "Daisy-Head Mayzie" which her classmates chant.

== Adaptations==
In 1995, prior to its actual publication, the book was adapted into a special for television on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. The special, which was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]], can be found as a bonus feature on the ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' Deluxe Edition DVD.

In 2011, Daisy-Head Mayzie was made a meetable character at [[Seuss Landing]] at Universal's Islands of Adventure.

==Differences in the 2016 edition==
In 2016, after the popularity of ''[[What Pet Should I Get?]]'', the book was republished with Seuss' original text and illustrations. As such, there are several differences between the editions.

*The Cat in the Hat does not appear as the narrator. 
*The characters are all designed differently and are given normal hairstyles, as opposed to the wild hairstyles in the 1995 edition.
*The principal is named Grumm instead of McGrumm.
*Instead of catching all of the bees in his hat, the police officer puts a fishbowl over Mayzie's head to protect her from the bees.
*Mrs. McGrew is a housewife instead of a welder.
*The plot in which the agent gives Mayzie a contract to be rich and famous is completely absent.
*Because of the absence of the Cat in the Hat, the daisy instead assures Mayzie that everyone loves her, and her flight with the Cat on the flying umbrella is not present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5642">The tract '''''Defensor pacis''''' ('''''The Defender of Peace''''') laid the foundations of modern doctrines of [[sovereignty]]. It was written by [[Marsilius of Padua]] (Italian: '''Marsilio da Padova'''), an Italian medieval scholar. It appeared in 1324 and provoked a storm of [[controversy]] that lasted through the century. The context of the work lies in the political struggle between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Pope John XXII]]. The treatise is vehemently [[anticlerical]]. Marsilius' work was censured by [[Pope Benedict XII]] and [[Pope Clement VI]].

''Defensor pacis'' extends the tradition of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[De Monarchia]]'' separating the secular [[Sovereign state|State]] from religious authority. It affirmed the sovereignty of the people and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and sought to greatly limit the power of the [[Papacy]], which he viewed as the "cause of the trouble which prevails among men" and which he characterized as a "fictitious" power. He proposed the seizure of church property by civil authority and the elimination of [[tithe]]s.  In his view, the Papacy would retain only an honorary pre-eminence without any authority to interpret the [[Biblical canon|scriptures]] or define [[dogma]].

As its name implies, it describes the State as the defender of the public peace, which is the most indispensable benefit of human society. The author of the law expresses will of the people, not of the whole populace, but of the most important part (''valentior'') of the citizens; these people should themselves elect, or at least appoint, the head of the government, who, lest he should be tempted to put himself above the scope of the laws, should have at his disposal only a limited armed force. This chief is responsible to the people for his breaches of the law, and in serious cases they can sentence him to death. The real cause of the trouble which prevails among men is the Papacy, the development of which is the result of a series of usurpations.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Marsilius of Padua |volume=17 |pages=775–776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsilius denies, not only to the pope, but to the [[episcopacy|bishops]] and [[clergy]], any [[coercion|coercive]] jurisdiction or any right to pronounce in temporal matters. He also denies episcopal authority of [[excommunication]]s and [[interdict]]s, or other imposed interpretations of divine law. He is not opposed to penalties against [[heresy|heretics]], but he would have them pronounced only by civil tribunals. Desiring to see the clergy practice a holy poverty, he proposes the suppression of [[tithes]] and the seizure by the secular power of the greater part of the property of the church. The clergy, thus deprived of its wealth, privileges and jurisdiction, is further to be deprived of independence, for the civil power is to have the right of appointing to benefices, etc.  The supreme authority in the church is to be the council, but a [[ecumenical council|council]] summoned by the emperor.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The pope, no longer possessing any more power than other bishops (though Marsilius recognizes that the supremacy of the [[See of Rome]] goes back to the earliest times of Christianity), is to content himself with a pre-eminence mainly of an honorary kind, without claiming to interpret the [[Holy Scriptures]], define dogmas or distribute benefices; moreover, he is to be elected by the Christian people, or by the delegates of the people, i.e. the princes, or by the council, and these are also to have the power to punish, suspend or depose him. The theory was purely [[democracy|democratic]], but was all ready to be transformed, by means of a series of fictions and implications, into an imperialist doctrine; and in like manner it contained a visionary plan of reformation which ended, not in the separation of the church from the state, but in the subjection of the church to the state.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1535, [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] paid [[William Marshall (translator)|William Marshall]] to translate ''Defensor'' into English in order to give intellectual support towards the implementation of [[Acts of Supremacy|Royal Supremacy]].

==Background==
Having previously written about external obstacles in his book ''The Obstacle Is the Way'', Holiday sought to answer questions about what to do when the biggest obstacle is internal.&lt;ref name="forA"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2016/06/14/ryan-holiday-how-ego-makes-business-leaders-less-successful/#3c9333b44906 | title = Ryan Holiday: How Ego Makes Business Leaders Less Successful | date= 14 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Forbes'' | author = Dan Schwabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the prologue of the book, Holiday explains how finding early successes led him to the realization that ego can cloud ambition and hinder personal and professional growth, particularly when accomplishments are tied to self-worth.&lt;ref name="BIA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-holiday-changing-the-world-can-be-a-dangerous-goal-2016-6 | title = Why you should think twice before aiming to 'change the world' | date= 24 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Business Insider'' | author = Anisa Purbasari }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday had the title of his book tattooed on his forearm as a daily reminder of its message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-ego-toxic-leadership/leadership-lessons/article/1415069 | title = Why ego is toxic to leadership | date= 9 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Management Today'' | author = Adam Gale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Ego Is the Enemy'' puts forth the argument that often our biggest problems are not caused by external factors such as other people or circumstances. Instead, our problems stem from our own attitude, selfishness and self-absorption. In other words, introducing ego into a situation often prevents us from being rational, objective and clear headed.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fox7austin.com/good-day/161094637-story | title = 'Ego Is the Enemy' | date= 17 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Fox 7'' | author = Amanda Salinas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not discuss [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Freud's ego]] or [[egotism]] as a clinical term but rather ego in a colloquial sense, defined as "an unhealthy belief in your own importance."&lt;ref name="hpA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/why-ego-is-the-enemy-in-b_b_10527208.html | title = Why Ego Is the Enemy in Business and in Life | date= 17 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Huffington Post'' | author = Quora }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also discusses the difference between ego and confidence, and argues that the solution to the problem of ego is humility, self-awareness, purpose and realism.&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/the_moment/2016/05/ryan_holiday_on_stoicism_and_why_ego_is_the_enemy.html | title = Ryan Holiday Talks Stoicism and Why Ego Is the Enemy | date= 4 May 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Slate'' | author = Brian Koppelman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qz"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://qz.com/848324/how-can-i-find-a-career-that-makes-me-happy/ | title = A career counselor at an elite college says students should follow their purpose in life—not their passion | date= 30 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Quartz'' | author = Mike O'Connor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ego Is the Enemy'' provides both cautionary tales as well as positive anecdotes about ego, citing numerous historical and contemporary figures including [[Christopher McCandless]], [[George Marshall]], [[John DeLorean]], [[Larry Page]], [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], [[Steve Jobs]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].&lt;ref name="forA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BIA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.in/Refusing-to-run-for-president-was-the-unexpected-key-to-this-Civil-War-commanders-success/articleshow/53086737.cms | title = Refusing to run for president was the unexpected key to this Civil War commander's success | date= 6 July 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Business Insider'' | author = Anisa Purbasari }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fort"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fortune.com/2016/06/14/ego-steve-jobs/ | title = How Ego Almost Destroyed Steve Jobs’ Career | date= 14 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Fortune'' | author = Ryan Holiday }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ego Is the Enemy'' has received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside Magazine]]'' commenting, "Holiday takes philosophy out of the ivory towers and translates often-dense concepts into actionable insights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.outsideonline.com/2087791/how-can-i-bulletproof-my-mind-get-more-out-my-body | title = How Can I Bulletproof My Mind to Get More Out of My Body? | date= 8 June 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Outside'' | author = Brad Stulberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/11/ego-is-the-enemy-book-review.html | title = The Antidote to the Success Paradox is to Realize that Ego is the Enemy | date= 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 31 January 2017 | publisher = ''Small Business Trends'' | author = Charles Franklin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was featured in the ''[[NPR]]'' Book Concierge Guide To 2016’s Great Reads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2016/ NPR’s Book Concierge: Our Guide To 2016’s Great Reads] ''NPR''.

'''Antoine Auguste Ernest Hébert''' (3 November 1817 &amp;ndash; 5 December 1908) was a French academic painter.

==Biography==

[[Image:Ernest Hébert - The Mal'aria - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Mal'aria'' (1848&amp;ndash;49), [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris]].]]  
Hébert was born in [[Grenoble]], son of a notary in Grenoble, and moved in 1835 to Paris to study law. He simultaneously took art lessons in the workshops of the sculptor [[David d'Angers]] (1788&amp;ndash;1856), and also of the history painter [[Paul Delaroche]] (1797&amp;ndash;1896), but even if he took art lessons he was mostly a selftaught artist.  At the age of 22 years he achieved success with his painting ''Le cup en prison'' in the Paris Salon. The Académie des Beaux-Arts awarded him the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1839 for the biblical composition ''Joseph's cup in Benjamin's sack''. The prize was a scholarship and a long study stay in the Villa Medici in Rome.
  
His painting ''Mal'aria'' was exhibited in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1850&amp;ndash;51, and now hangs in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/manifestations/expositions/au-musee-dorsay/presentation-generale/article/chronique-italienne-dessins-dernest-hebert-1817-1908-4105.html ''Chronique italienne, dessins d'Ernest Hébert'' bei www.musee-orsay.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Panthéon mosaïque abside.JPG|thumb|Mosaic in the apse of the [[Panthéon (Paris)]]]]
Painted in a [[Romanticism (art)|Romantic]] style, it depicts a family of Italian peasants escaping an epidemic by raft, a scene inspired by events Hébert had witnessed while in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenblum|first= Robert |year=1989|title=Paintings in the Musée d'Orsay|location=New York|publisher=Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang | page=126|isbn=1-55670-099-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hébert's students [[Paul Trouillebert]] was an important artist of the [[Barbizon School]]. The artist's house is preserved as the [[Musée Hébert]] in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris]]. There is another museum near Grenoble.

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Fishermen at Sea - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Fishermen at Sea'', 1796, the first oil painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to be exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], in 1796]]

'''''Fishermen at Sea''''', sometimes known as the '''''Cholmeley Sea Piece''''', is an early oil painting by English artist [[J. M. W. Turner]].  It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1796, and has been owned by the [[Tate Gallery]] since 1972.  

The painting measures {{convert|36|x|48.125|in|cm}}.  It depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near [[the Needles]], off the [[Isle of Wight]].  It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background.  The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butlin| first=Martin| title=The paintings of J.M.W. Turner| year=1984| publisher=Yale University Press| location=New Haven| isbn=978-0-300-03276-5 |edition=Rev.| author2=Joll, Evelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, ''Moonlight at Sea (The Needles)'', c.1818, as an example of [[marine art]] for his ''[[Liber Studiorum]]''.

The work shows strong influence from the work of marine artists such as [[Claude Joseph Vernet]], [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]], [[Peter Monamy]] and [[Francis Swaine]], and the intimate nocturnal scenes of [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].  The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=28| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian [[Andrew Wilton]] has commented that the image: "Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1|page=27|edition=New }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Walter Thornbury]], the work was sold to General Stewart for £10. The painting was acquired by Sir [[Henry Charles Englefield]]; after his death in 1822, it was sold at [[Christie's]] on 8 March 1823, as ''View of the Needles, with the effect of Moon and Fire Light''. It was bought by Englefield's nephew Francis Cholmeley, and it remained in the Cholmeley family for nearly 150 years, displayed at [[Brandsby Hall]], and it became known as the ''Cholmeley Sea Piece''.   It was loaned regularly to the Tate Gallery from 1931, and sold to the Tate Gallery in 1972 by [[Francis William Alfred Fairfax-Cholmeley]], with finance from the Beatrice Lizzie Benson Fund.

[[File:VIA Mini-ITX Form Factor Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Comparison of some common [[motherboard]] form factors]]
'''Form factor''' is an aspect of hardware [[design]] which defines and prescribes the size, shape, and other physical [[specification (technical standard)|specifications]] of components, particularly in [[consumer electronics]] and [[electronic packaging]].&lt;ref name="webopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/form_factor.html|website=Webopedia|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/form-factor|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components, or it may prescribe a specific standard.

==Evolution and standardization==
As electronic hardware has become smaller following [[Moore's law]] and related patterns, ever-smaller form factors have become feasible. Specific technological advances, such as [[PCI Express]], have had a significant design impact, though form factors have historically been slower to evolve than individual components. [[Standardization]] of form factors is vital for compatibility of hardware from different manufacturers.

==Trade-offs==
Smaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space, greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly, reduced use of material, and greater ease of transportation and use. However, smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the [[design]], [[manufacturing]], and [[corrective maintenance|maintenance]] phases of the [[product lifecycle|engineering lifecycle]], and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors. In particular, the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of [[computer cooling|cooling]].&lt;ref name="sff_network"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=John|title=Passive Cooling – An Experiment|url=https://smallformfactor.net/reviews/passive-cooling-experiment|website=SFF Network|publisher=Minutiae|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[End user|End-user]] maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible, and may be discouraged by [[warranty]] [[voidable|voiding]] clauses; such devices require professional servicing—or simply replacement—when they fail.&lt;ref name="prowse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prowse|first1=David L.|title=CompTIA A+ Exam Cram: Mobile Device Hardware and Operating Systems|url=http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1926198|website=Pearson IT Certification|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

'''[[Computer form factor]]s''' comprise a number of specific industry standards for [[motherboard]]s, specifying dimensions, [[power supply|power supplies]], placement of mounting holes and [[computer port (hardware)|ports]], and other parameters. Other types of form factors for computers include:
* [[Small form factor]] (SFF), a more loosely defined set of standards which may refer to both motherboards and [[computer case]]s. SFF devices include mini-towers and  [[home theater PC]]s.
* [[Pizza box form factor]], a wide, flat case form-factor used for computers and network switches; often sized for installation in a [[19-inch rack]].

===Components===
* [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|Hard disk drive form factors]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive
* [[Disc form factors|Hard disk enclosure form factor]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive enclosure

===Mobile form factors===
* [[Laptop]] or notebook, a form of portable computer with a "clamshell" form factor.
* [[Subnotebook]], [[ultra-mobile PC]], [[netbook]], and [[tablet computer]], various form factors for devices which are smaller and often cheaper than a typical notebook.
* [[Form factor (mobile phones)|Mobile phone form factor]], comprising the size, shape, layout, and style of mobile phones. Broad categories of form factors include bars, [[flip (form)|flip phones]], and sliders, with many subtypes and variations of each.

'''The Grand Opera House''', often called '''The Grand''' and originally known as the '''Academy of Music''', is a [[historic]] [[opera house]] located in [[Macon, Georgia]], United States.  Listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970, it is now the [[performing arts]] center of [[Mercer University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2009/090922Grand.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Academy of Music was constructed in 1884 with the largest [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] in the southeastern United States and seating for 2,418, almost one-fifth of Macon's population at the time.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"&gt;http://www.thegrandmacon.com/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was renovated in 1905; the present seven-story facade was added and the building reopened as the Grand Opera House.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;

The Grand has had numerous historic uses; live [[horse]]s and [[chariot]]s appeared in a 1908 production of ''[[Ben-Hur (play)|Ben-Hur]]'' and during World War I, actor [[Charlie Chaplin]] led the [[John Philip Sousa]] band for a fundraising effort. The theater has also hosted, among others, [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Will Rogers]], [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Bob Hope]], the [[Allman Brothers Band]], and [[Ray Charles]].

[[Magician (illusion)|Magician]] [[Harry Houdini]] was also a featured player at the Grand, leaving a well-known legacy: the stage sports a number of trap doors, one of which remains operational and is used occasionally today in performances such as annual production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' [[ballet]]. Local lore claims that the trap doors were installed specifically for Houdini.

In 1936, as the popularity of [[vaudeville]] waned, the Grand changed to a [[movie theater]], hosting Macon's only [[Hollywood]] [[premiere]], 1945's ''[[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|God is My Co-Pilot]]''.

== Revival ==

By the 1960s, the Grand had ceased showing movies and plans were made to replace it with a [[parking lot]].&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;  Those plans were blocked in 1967 by the Macon Arts Council, a group formed to save and restore the Grand; the group held a fundraising [[wiktionary:gala|gala]] featuring the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and had the property placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  Among the founders of the group was Macon architect [[Ellamae Ellis League]] who also supervised a restoration of The Grand so it could reopen as a live theater in 1969.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}  (The second balcony, or [[peanut gallery]], remained closed to the public and was dedicated to lighting equipment at this time, reducing the maximum seating to its current number of 1,030).  Fund-raising efforts continued through the next several decades, with ongoing physical plant upgrades, with another renovation taking place in 1985.

In 1995, [[Mercer University]] signed a [[lease]] with [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]] to manage the Grand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrandmacon.com/governors/&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, Mercer has invested in upgrading the facility to modern standards as well as making it a fixture for community events.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;  Today, the Grand hosts many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] touring companies, [[concert]]s (such as those of the Macon Symphony Orchestra, [[community theatre]] productions (including the aforementioned ''Nutcracker'' holiday show), and other performances and events.

Known originally as '''The Greenwich Society of Artists''', the '''Greenwich Art Society''' is an organization dedicated to promoting arts education in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].  It was founded in 1912 by artists affiliated with the "Cos Cob School," and many associated with the development of the American [[Impressionist]] movement, who sought “the promotion and maintenance of the fine arts and the exhibition of works of art in Greenwich.”&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenwich Art Society records, 1912-1987|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/greenwich-art-society-records-10263|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bruce /&gt;

== History ==
As wealthy New Yorkers looked to move out of the city at the end of the 19th century, Greenwich evolved from a rural village to a bustling suburb with an established artists’ colony and a growing market for art.  [[Theodore Robinson]] and [[John Henry Twachtman]] taught summer art classes at the [[Bush-Holley House]], and Twachtman and [[Leonard Ochtman]] were living in Greenwich full-time.&lt;ref name=bruce /&gt;   

The first president of the Greenwich Society of Artists was [[Edward Clark Potter]], best known as the sculptor of the lions at the [[New York Public Library]]; Leonard Ochtman served as the first vice-president.&lt;ref name=shipp&gt;{{cite book|last=Shipp|first=Steve|title=American art colonies, 1850-1930: a historical guide to America's original art colonies and their artists|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|pages=21|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/185705545}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other notable early Society members include John Plumer Ludlum, [[Elmer Livingston MacRae]], [[William Tubby|William Bunker Tubby]], [[Richard Howland Hunt|Joseph Howland Hunt, Sr.]], [[Dorothy Ochtman]], [[Mina Fonda Ochtman]], [[Matilda Browne]], [[Charles Henry Ebert]], [[Florence W. Gotthold]], [[George Wharton Edwards]], [[Henry Bill Selden]], J. Alden Twachtman (son of [[John Henry Twachtman]]) and other artists and patrons affiliated with the [[Cos Cob Art Colony]].  A number of these artists were active in other influential organizations at that time, including the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, the group responsible for the 1913 [[Armory Show]].  Dorothy Ochtman served as Secretary of the Society from 1928-1946, and President from 1947-1948.&lt;ref name=GAS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Greenwich Art Society|url=http://greenwichartsociety.org/pages/about-greenwich-art-society.html|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAA /&gt;

The Society held its first show in September 1912 in a house donated to the town by Robert M. Bruce, which would become the [[Bruce_Museum_of_Arts_and_Science|Bruce Museum]].  Until 1926, the Society continued to organize all of the Bruce Museum’s exhibitions, and the core of the museum's permanent collection grew through purchases and gifts from these exhibitions.&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite web|title=Coming Full Circle: The Greenwich Art Society Celebrates 100 at the Bruce Museum|url=http://brucemuseum.org/site/exhibitions_detail/100_years_of_the_greenwich_arts_society|work=Bruce Museum|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, the Annual Members' Exhibition of the society was moved to the art gallery of the Greenwich Library.&lt;ref name=GAS /&gt;

In 1956, the Society expanded its mission: “to further art education and to awaken and stimulate interest in arts and crafts in the Town of Greenwich by means of classes, demonstrations, lectures and exhibitions.”&lt;ref name=bruce /&gt;    The name was changed the Greenwich Art Society in 1958 when it was incorporated as a non-profit organization and began providing art instruction year-round.&lt;ref name=GAS /&gt;

== Present day ==

The Greenwich Art Society continues today as an active organization that continues to provide art classes and programs for adults and children, exhibitions for its members, workshops, and gallery trips.&lt;ref name=GAS /&gt;

'''Gustave Achille Guillaumet''' (26 March 1840 – 14 March 1887) was a French artist.  He is best known for his paintings of [[North Africa]].

==Early life==
Gustave Guillaumet was born in 1840 in [[Puteaux]] (now in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]], Paris).

==Career==
[[Image:Gustave Guillaumet- Le Sahara.jpeg|thumb|right|''Le Sahara'']]Guillaumet was initially a student of [[François-Edouard Picot]]&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet.  In 'Art Experts, Inc.'.

Retrieved 09:04, April 2, 2012, from http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=293&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857 he joined the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet. In 'The National Gallery'. Retrieved 19:13, April 1, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/gustave-guillaumet&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a student of [[Alexandre Abel de Pujol]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet.  In 'Art Experts, Inc.'. Retrieved 08:54, April 2, 2012, from http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/guillaumet.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Achille Guillaumet.  In 'Art Renewal Center Museum'. Retrieved 09:04, April 2, 2012, from http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=293&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 Guillaumet entered the Historical Landscape category of the [[Prix de Rome]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} for a scholarship to study at the [[Academy of France in Rome]].  On failing to win, he instead travelled across the Mediterranean to [[Algeria]], in north Africa.  While there he contracted malaria and had to spend three months at the military hospital in Biskra{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

Guillaumet visited Algeria ten times between 1861 and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;''Mountains in North Africa, with a Bedouin Camp''. In National Gallery.  Retrieved 18:45, April 2, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/gustave-guillaumet-mountains-in-north-africa-with-a-bedouin-camp&lt;/ref&gt;  He preferred to travel in the south{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and many of his works depict the life of the people of the desert.

Whereas [[Orientalism]] generally gave a deliberately idealised or anecdotal picture of north Africa, Guillaumet's work was notable for portraying the harshness of life in a desert region. ''The Sahara'' features the carcass of a camel in the foreground with a caravan - or mirage of one - on the horizon and empty desert in-between. It was first exhibited to considerable success at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Le Sahara also called Le désert.  In 'Musée d'Orsay'.  Retrieved 09:35, April 2, 2012, from http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/the-sahara-3070.html?tx_commentaire_pi1[pidLi]=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1[from]=841&amp;cHash=49c94776ae&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1879 and 1884 ''[[La Nouvelle Revue]]'' published tableaux of Algerian scenes collected together by Guillaumet.  These were later published as a book, ''Tableaux Algériens''.  It includes twelve echings by Guillaumet, Courtry, [[Paul Edmé Le Rat]], [[Adolphe-Alphonse Géry-Bichard]], [[August Müller (orientalist)|August Müller]] and Toussaint; six photogravures by Dujardin and one hundred and twenty-eight engravings in relief from drawings and sketches by Guillaumet, himself.  The book was published in 1888, after Guillaumet's death and is prefaced by a note on his life by [[Eugène Mouton]].&lt;ref&gt;GUILLAUMET (Gustave).  In 'Librería Anticuaria Comellas'.  Retrieved 22:51, April 2, 2012, from http://www.livres-rares.com/livres/GUILLAUMET_Gustave-_Tableaux_Algeriens_Ouvrage_illustre_de_douze_eaux-fortes_par_Guillaumet_Co-95885.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La Nouvelle Revue - 1875-1879."

In 1878, Guillaumet was made a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], the highest decoration in France.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine. ''Nineteenth-century Painters and Paintings: A Dictionary''. University of California Press, 1978, p102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
His son [[Gustave Guillaume]] (whose family name was changed), born in 1883, became a famous linguist.

==Death==
Guillaumet died in Paris in 1887. Speculation about the circumstances of his death, supposedly of peritonitis, was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 6.  The article claimed that Guillaumet had left his wife and son to live with "a lady who was his senior by many years" but that a few weeks before his death he had shot himself following an argument with his mistress.  {{quote|"The bullet lodged in his intestines, and he lingered from that moment in the agonies of a painful illness, terminated by death. His last words after the bullet had entered his body were for his wife and son, who, on being informed of the tragical occurrence, came and nursed him until his death.  The painter died in his studio, whither he was carried at his own request. He wanted to see his Oriental sketches for the last time."|unattributed|The New York Times, April 6, 1887&lt;ref&gt;''Painter Guillaumet's tragic death''. ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1887.  Retrieved 00:34, April 3, 2012, from https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/04/06/109788711.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Guilaumet is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]].  His tomb bears a sculpture by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]] of a ''Young girl from [[Bou Saâda]]'', dropping flowers onto a portrait of Guillaumet embossed on a medallion.&lt;ref&gt;P1070012 by jimread99.

'''HaNephesh Theater''' is a [[Jewish]] [[fringe theater]] established in 1978 by Howard Rypp and Gabriel Emanuel in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nepheshtheatre.co.il/en/about_us/about&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its founding, HaNefesh was the only professional Jewish [[theater]] in Canada, where it produced approximately 40 theatrical and television productions. 
In 1980 the theater produced its first play, ''Children of the Night''. The play, which tells the story of [[Janusz Korczak]], was featured in the first International Jewish Theater Festival in [[New York City]].

In 1983, Rypp [[Aliyah|immigrated to Israel]], bringing the theater with him. The theater's first production in [[Israel]] was Emanuel's joint production with [[Habima Theatre|Habima Theater]] called ''Einstein''. It was translated into several languages, and in 2005 was performed in New York on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

From 1988 to 1994 Yitzchak Meshel served as the theater's dramaturge and conducted 7 of its plays. Since 1995 Beatriz Hal serves as the theater's dramaturge.

The theater is recognized and supported by Israel’s Ministry of Culture. The theater conducts educational plays that focus on various social conflicts in Israeli society, for example between the religious and secular communities, new and veteran Olim, and [[Arab]]s and Jews. Its productions shed light on human experiences and promote the values of dialogue, tolerance, and mutual respect.

The theater's repertoire currently includes 16 plays in [[Hebrew]] and five in [[English language|English]], which the organization hopes to produce worldwide. The theater conducts roughly 300 plays every year all over Israel, for people of diverse backgrounds and age groups. In addition, the theater has conducted over 200 performances overseas at international festivals, professional conventions, and universities for Jewish audiences and other groups.

The '''Hamburg State Opera''' (in German: '''Hamburgische Staatsoper''') is a Germany [[opera]] company based in Hamburg.  Its theatre is located near the square of [[Gänsemarkt]].  Since 2015, the current ''Intendant'' of the company is [[Georges Delnon]], and the current ''Generalmusikdirektor'' of the company is [[Kent Nagano]].

== History == 
{{See also|Opera in German}} 
Opera in Hamburg dates to 2 January [[1678 in music|1678]] when the [[Oper am Gänsemarkt]] was inaugurated with a performance of a biblical Singspiel by Johann Theile. It was not a court theatre but the first public opera house in Germany established by the art-loving citizens of Hamburg, a prosperous member of the [[Hanseatic League]].

The Hamburg ''Bürgeroper'' resisted the dominance of the Italianate style and rapidly became the leading musical center of the German Baroque. In 1703, [[George Friedrich Handel]] was engaged as violinist and harpsichordist and performances of his operas were not long in appearing. In 1705, Hamburg gave the world première of his opera ''[[Handel's lost Hamburg operas|Nero]]''.

In 1721, [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], a central figure of the German Baroque, joined the Hamburg Opera, and in subsequent years [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and various Italian companies were among the guests.

[[File:Stadttheater Hamburg 1827.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Stadt-Theater, built in 1827]]
[[File:Hamburg Stadttheater um 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The same building, redecorated in 1890, destroyed in 1943]]
To replace the aging wooden structure, the first stone was laid on 18 May 1826 for the ''Stadt-Theater'' on the present-day site of the Hamburg State Opera. The new theater, with seating for 2,800 guest, was inaugurated less than a year later with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] incidental music to ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]''.

In 1873, both the exterior and interior of the structure were renovated in the reigning "[[Gründerzeit]]" style of the time, and again in 1891, when electric lighting was introduced.

Under the direction of Bernhard Pollini, the house mounted its first complete ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'' in 1879. In 1883, the year of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s death, a cycle comprising nine of his operas commenced. The musical directors [[Hans von Bülow]] (from 1887 to 1890) and [[Gustav Mahler]] (from 1891 to 1897) also contributed to the fame of the opera house.

In the beginning of the 20th century, opera was an important part of the theatre's repertoire; among the 321 performances during the 1907–08 season, 282 were performances of opera. The Stadt-Theater performed not only established repertoire but also new works, such as [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Sancta Susanna]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Soldier's Tale]]'', [[Ernst Krenek]]'s ''[[Jonny spielt auf]]'', and [[Leoš Janáček]]'s ''[[Jenůfa]]''. [[Ferruccio Busoni]]'s ''[[Die Brautwahl]]'' (1912) and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s ''[[Die tote Stadt]]'' (1920) both had their world premieres in Hamburg. In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power, the opera house was renamed ''Hamburgische Staatsoper''.

On the night of 2 August 1943, both the auditorium and its neighbouring buildings were destroyed during air raids by fire-bombing; a low-flying airplane dropped several petrol and phosphorus containers on to the middle of the roof of the auditorium, turning it into a conflagration.

[[File:Hamburg Staatsoper Zuschauerraum 03.jpg|thumbnail|Current interior]]
The current Staatsoper opened on 15 October 1955 with Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]''. Hamburg continued to devote itself to new works, such as [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[Der Prinz von Homburg (opera)|The Prince of Homburg]]'' (1960), Stravinsky's ''The Flood'' (1963), [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[Help, Help, the Globolinks!]]'' (1968), and [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Staatstheater'' (1971).

In 1967, under the direction of Joachim Hess, the Hamburg State Opera became the first company to broadcasts its operas in color on television, beginning with ''Die Hochzeit des Figaro'' (a German translation of ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'').  Ten of these television productions have been released on DVD by [[ArtHaus Musik]] as ''Cult Opera of the 1970s'', as well as separately.  All of these were performed in German regardless of the original language (six were written in German, one in French, two in English, and one in Italian).

More recently, Hamburg gave the world premières of [[Wolfgang Rihm]]'s ''[[Die Eroberung von Mexico]]'' (1992) and [[Helmut Lachenmann]]'s ''Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern'' (1997), for which it received much international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbort |first=Heinz Josef |date=14 February 1992 |title=Dieser Schrei ist ein Traum  |trans-title=This Scream is a Dream |url=http://www.zeit.de/1992/08/dieser-schrei-ist-ein-traum |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Umbach |first=Klaus |date=27 January 1997 |title=Qualm vom Quälgeist |trans-title=Smoke from a tormenting spirit |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8652148.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has won the "[[Opera house of the year|Opera House of the Year]]" award by the German magazine Opernwelt in 1997 and in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |trans-title=Hamburg is "Opera House of the Year", new project by Metzmacher / Konwitschny |date=23 September 2005 |title=Hamburg ist "Opernhaus des Jahres", neues Projekt von Metzmacher/Konwitschny |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article166450/Hamburg-ist-Opernhaus-des-Jahres-neues-Projekt-von-Metzmacher-Konwitschny.html |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Die Welt]] |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Her Majesty's Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]] situated on [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] in the [[City of Westminster]], London. The present building was designed by [[Charles J. Phipps]] and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who established the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] at the theatre. In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[J. M. Synge]], [[Noël Coward]] and [[J. B. Priestley]]. Since the [[First World War]], the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has specialised in hosting [[musical theatre|musicals]]. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''&lt;ref name=Guiness&gt;Larkin, Colin (ed). ''Guinness Who's Who of Stage Musicals'' (Guinness Publishing, 1994) {{ISBN|0-85112-756-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current production, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.

The theatre was established by architect and playwright [[John Vanbrugh]], in 1705, as the '''Queen's Theatre'''. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London [[patent theatre]]s, and so this theatre quickly became an [[opera house]].&lt;ref&gt;''theatrical monopoly'' in Banham, Martin ''The Cambridge guide to theatre'' pp. 1105 (Cambridge University Press, 1995) {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 operas by [[George Frideric Handel]] premiered here.&lt;ref&gt;D [http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm ''Handel's Compositions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130044046/http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm |date=30 January 2009 }} GFHandel.org, accessed 21 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], in 1847, and presented the first London performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Alfred. ''Mozart: His Character, His Work'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 1945)&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premieres of such operas as [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]''.

The name of the theatre changes with the sex of the monarch. It first became the '''King's Theatre''' in 1714 on the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. It was renamed Her Majesty's Theatre in 1837. Most recently, the theatre was known as '''His Majesty's Theatre''' from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. The theatre's capacity is 1,216&amp;nbsp;seats, and the building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in 1970. [[Really Useful Group#LW Theatres|LW Theatres]] has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a long-term lease from the [[Crown Estate]].

== History ==
[[File:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Vanbrugh]] painted by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]
The end of the 17th century was a period of intense rivalry amongst London's actors, and in 1695 there was a split in the [[United Company]], who had a monopoly on the performance of drama at their two theatres. Dramatist and architect [[John Vanbrugh]] saw this as an opportunity to break the duopoly of the [[patent theatre]]s, and in 1703 he acquired a former stable yard, at a cost of £2,000, for the construction of a new theatre on the Haymarket. In the new business, he hoped to improve the share of profits that would go to playwrights and actors. He raised the money by subscription, probably amongst members of the [[Kit-Cat Club]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To recover them [that is, [[Thomas Betterton]]'s company], therefore, to their due Estimation, a new Project was form'd of building them a stately theatre in the Hay-Market, by Sir John Vanbrugh, for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality, at one hundred Pounds each, in Consideration whereof every Subscriber, for his own Life, was to be admitted to whatever Entertainments should be publickly perform'd there, without farther Payment for his Entrance.

He was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager [[William Congreve]] and an actors' co-operative led by [[Thomas Betterton]].&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Downes, Kerry. ''Sir John Vanbrugh: A Biography'' (London: Sidgwick and Jackson 1987) {{ISBN|0-283-99497-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre provided the first alternative to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], built in 1663 and the [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincoln's Inn]], founded in 1660 (forerunner of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], built in 1728). The theatre's site is the second oldest such site in London that remains in use. These three post-[[English Interregnum|interregnum]] theatres defined the shape and use of modern theatres.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;Earl, John and Michael Sell. ''Guide to British Theatres 1750–1950'', p. 117 (Theatres Trust, 2000) {{ISBN|0-7136-5688-3}}. [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] was founded as a music room in 1683, and a theatre was built on the site in 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vanbrugh's theatre: 1705–1789 ===
The land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740 and was ultimately owned, as it is today, by the [[Crown Estate]]. Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage, and a three bay entrance led to a brick shell {{convert|130|ft|m|1}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m|1}} wide. [[Colley Cibber]] described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

Vanbrugh and Congreve received [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s authority to form ''a Company of Comedians'' on 14 December 1704, and the theatre opened as the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705 with imported Italian singers in ''Gli amori d'Ergasto'' (''The Loves of Ergasto''), an opera by [[Jakob Greber]], with an epilogue by Congreve. This was the first Italian opera performed in London.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Powell, Robin. ''Ivanhoe'', full score, Introduction, vol. I, p.

Congreve departed, Vanbrugh bought out his other partners, and the actors reopened the Lincoln's Inn Fields' theatre in the summer. Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music, a taste was growing amongst the nobility for [[Italian opera]], which was completely sung, and the theatre became devoted to opera. As he became progressively more involved in the construction of [[Blenheim Palace]], Vanbrugh's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement".&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, Judith.

In December of that year, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] ordered that "all Operas and other Musicall presentments be performed for the future only at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Hay Market"&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; and forbade the performance of further non-musical plays there.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage. The work was well received,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aam.co.uk/features/9901.htm Hicks, Anthony.

There were a first and second Royal Academy of Music, directed by Handel, each formed for a limited period – hence the need for two. From 1734 the Second Academy had to fight off the rival ''[[Opera of the Nobility]]''. These academies are not related to the modern [[Royal Academy of Music]] founded by [[John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]] in 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; Handel was also a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734, and he contributed to incidental music for theatre, including for a revival of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', opening on 14 January 1710.&lt;ref&gt;''Handel: A Documentary Biography'', [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] (Black, 1955) {{ISBN|0-306-70624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714, the theatre was renamed the King's Theatre and remained so named during a succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne. At this time only the two [[patent theatre]]s were permitted to perform serious drama in London, and lacking [[letters patent]], the theatre remained associated with opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/renaissance/restoration_patent.php ''Royal Patents'' (The Theatre Museum).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206114953/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/renaissance/restoration_patent.php |date=6 February 2008 }} [[Victoria and Albert museum]], PeoplePlayUK, accessed 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, [[Johann Christian Bach]] travelled to London to premiere three operas at the theatre, including ''Orione'' on 19 February 1763. This established his reputation in England, and he became music master to [[Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, Percy A.

[[File:Richard Sheridan.jpg|thumb|Actor-manager [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], painted by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]
In 1778, the lease for the theatre was transferred from [[James Brook]] to [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], stage manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and to the playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] for £22,000. They paid for the remodelling of the interior by [[Robert Adam]] in the same year. In November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' reported that Harris and Sheridan had
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... at a considerable expence&lt;!--sic--&gt;, almost entirely new built the audience part of the house, and made a great variety of alterations, part of which are calculated for the rendering the theatre more light, elegant and pleasant, and part for the ease and convenience of the company. The sides of the frontispiece are decorated with two figures painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], which are remarkably picturesque and beautiful; the heavy columns which gave the house so gloomy an aspect that it rather resembled a large mausoleum or a place for funeral dirges, than a theatre, are removed.

—November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]''&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts, and the partnership dissolved, with Sheridan buying out his partner with a mortgage on the theatre of £12,000 obtained from the banker [[Henry Hoare]].&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

One member of the company, [[Giovanni Gallini]], had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by [[Michael Novosielski]], formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, in the interests of the creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788, the [[Lord Chancellor]] observed "that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [the interested parties] seemed to apply for relief".&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. ''The World'' described a performance as follows: "... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly."&lt;ref name=Sanquine&gt;Bondeson, Jan. ''The London Monster: A Sanguinary Tale'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000) {{ISBN|0-8122-3576-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.&lt;ref name=Sanquine/&gt;

====Fire====
The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre]], and he entered into a partnership with [[R. B. O'Reilly]] to obtain land in [[Leicester Square|Leicester Fields]] for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the [[Oxford Street]] [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]]. This too, would burn to the ground in 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct connection with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in [[Greenwich]]. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

=== Second theatre: 1791–1867 ===
[[File:Opera House Haymarket edited.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of second theatre on the site, c. 1808. Drawing by [[Auguste Pugin]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]] for ''Ackermann's Microcosm of London'']]

Taylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791. Michael Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site, but the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
fronted by a stone basement in rustic work, with the commencement of a very superb building of the Doric order, consisting of three pillars, two windows, an entablature, pediment, and balustrade. This, if it had been continued, would have contributed considerably to the splendour of London; but the unlucky fragment is fated to stand as a foil to the vile and absurd edifice of brick pieced to it, which I have not patience to describe.

—The critic Malcolm, quoted in ''Old and New London'' (1878)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45193 "The Haymarket".] ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 216–26, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lord Chamberlain, a supporter of O'Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor. The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but was not allowed to open to the public. The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision. As a later manager of the theatre wrote, "In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread."&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Meetings were held at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties. On 24 August 1792 a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties. The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], who would then appoint a general manager. Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King's Theatre and the Pantheon. The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

The first public performance of opera in the new theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became the home of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous Judith, Dideriksen, Gabriella and Hume, Robert D.

From 1793, seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that [[Joseph Haydn]] gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of [[Johann Peter Salomon]], on his second visit to London in 1794–95.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Haydn's previous visit, the concerts had been presented at the Hanover Square Rooms with tremendous success.

With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' in 1806, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' in 1811, and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in 1816.

Ebers engaged [[Giuditta Pasta]] for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sadie|first=Stanley (ed)|year=1992|title=The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]| publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|pages = vol 2, p. 4|isbn=978-0-19-522186-2 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pierre François Laporte ====

In 1828, Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre François Laporte, who held the position (with a brief gap in 1831–33) until his death in 1841. Two of Rossini's Paris operas (''[[Le comte Ory]]'' and ''[[Le siège de Corinthe]]'') had their British premieres at the theatre during this period, and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]] (''[[La sonnambula]], [[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and ''[[I puritani]]'') and [[Gaetano Donizetti]] (''[[Anna Bolena]], [[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'') to the British public.

He was appointed in 1827 and remained for six years at this position.&lt;ref&gt;Faul, Michel. ''Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, harpiste, compositeur, escroc'' (editions Delatour France, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne in 1837, the name of the theatre was changed to Her Majesty's Theatre, Italian Opera House. In the same year, [[Samuel Phelps]] made his London début as [[Shylock]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' at the theatre, also playing in other [[Shakespeare]]an plays here.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Shirley S. ''Samuel Phelps and Sadler's Wells Theatre'' (Wesleyan, 1971) {{ISBN|0-8195-4029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 1840s, [[Dion Boucicault]] had five plays produced here: ''The Bastile'' [sic], an "after-piece" (1842), ''Old Heads and Young Hearts'' (1844), ''The School for Scheming'' (1847), ''Confidence'' (1848), and ''The Knight Arva'' (1848). In 1853, [[Robert Browning]]'s ''Colombe's Birthday'' played at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Victoria/&gt;

In 1841, disputes arose over Laporte's decision to replace the [[baritone]] [[Antonio Tamburini]] with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and the performers formed a 'revolutionary conspiracy'.

==== Benjamin Lumley ====
[[File:Image-Jenny Lind Lithograph 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jenny Lind]], ''The Swedish Nightingale'', 1850]]
Laporte died suddenly, and [[Benjamin Lumley]] took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' and ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. Initially, relations between Lumley and [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[Nabucco]]'' and ''[[I Lombardi]]'' received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned ''[[I masnadieri]]'' from the composer. This opera received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva [[Jenny Lind]] in the role of Amalia, and the British premieres of two more Verdi operas, ''[[I due Foscari]]'' and ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'', followed in 1847–48.&lt;ref name=Viking2&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Holden |editor1-first = Amanda |editor2-last=Kenyon|editor2-first=Nicholas|editor3-last=Walsh|editor3-first=Stephen |title = The Viking Opera Guide |year = 1993 |publisher = Viking |location = London |isbn = 0-670-81292-7 |pages = 1126–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/AbouttheHouse/Index.cfm?ccs=288&amp;cs=1017&amp;SubNavMenu=7&amp;login=0 ''Discover the History of the Royal Opera House''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330211124/http://info.royaloperahouse.org/AbouttheHouse/Index.cfm?ccs=288&amp;cs=1017&amp;SubNavMenu=7&amp;login=0 |date=30 March 2008 }} Royal Opera House, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Balfe (1808–1870): His Life and Career''.] Victorian Web, accessed 7 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and entered negotiations with [[Felix Mendelssohn]] for a new opera. Jenny Lind had made her English début on 4 May 1847 in the role of Alice in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]'', in the presence of the Royal family and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Such was the press of people around the theatre that many "arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn, and coats hanging in shreds, having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle".&lt;ref name=Headland/&gt; She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the ''Swedish Nightingale''.&lt;ref name=Headland&gt;Headland, Helen ''The Swedish Nightingale: A Biography of Jenny Lind'' (Kessinger Publishing, 2005) {{ISBN|1-4191-5538-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premieres of Verdi operas: ''[[La traviata]]'' in 1856 and ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' in 1858.&lt;ref name=Viking2/&gt;

From the early 1830s until the late 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the [[romantic ballet]], and the theatre's resident ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the [[Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] in Paris. The celebrated ballet master [[Jules Perrot]] began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him ''Premier Maître de Ballet'' (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842.&lt;ref name=Guest&gt;Guest, Ivor Forbes. ''The Romantic Ballet in England'', Wesleyan University Press, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of ballet that he staged were ''[[Ondine (Perrot)|Ondine, ou La Naïade]]'' (1843), ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (1844), and ''[[Catarina or La Fille du Bandit|Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit]]'' (1846), as well as the celebrated [[divertissement]] ''[[Pas de Quatre]]'' (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably [[Paul Taglioni]] (son of [[Filippo Taglioni]]), who staged ballets including ''Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant'' (1847) and ''Electra'' (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting).&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] staged such works as ''[[La Vivandière]]'' (1844), ''Le Violin du Diable'' (1849), and ''Le Jugement de Pâris'' (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to ''Pas de Quatre''.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;

The Italian composer [[Cesare Pugni]] was appointed ''Composer of the Ballet Music'' to the theatre in 1843, a position created for him by Lumley. From 1843 until 1850, he composed nearly every new ballet presented at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/italiandance/web4.html ''500 Years of Italian Dance''.] [[New York Public Library]], accessed 18 February 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207013614/http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/italiandance/web4.html |date=7 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre, having composed more than 100 original ballets, as well as composing numerous divertissements and incidental dances that were often performed as diversions during the intermissions of opera performances at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; Throughout the era of the romantic ballet, the theatre presented performances by notable [[ballerina]]s, including [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Lucile Grahn]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]], performing in the works of Perrot, Taglioni and Saint-Léon.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edgecombe&gt;Edgecombe, Rodney Stenning.

From 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by [[James Henry Mapleson]], presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premieres of ''[[La forza del destino]]'', ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor (opera)|The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, [[Ema Pukšec|De Murska]], [[Thérèse Tietjens]], [[Antonio Giuglini]], [[Charles Santley]] and [[Christine Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Maple&gt;Mapleson, J. H. ''The Mapleson Memoirs'', ed. H. Rosenthal, (London, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=Maple/&gt;

By the 1850s, with the era of the romantic ballet at an end, the principal personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar's]] [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet continued to be performed in London, but in the [[Music hall]]s and theatres as interludes and endpieces. The most notable of these were the corps at the [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra]], and its nearby rival, the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as [[Adeline Genée]] began performing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/dance_tour/ballet/romantic_intro.php ''Romantic Ballet''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207220442/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/dance_tour/ballet/romantic_intro.php |date=7 December 2007 }} PeoplePlayUK, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the [[Old Vic]] and soon took on the name of the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]]. Later, moving primarily to the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the [[Royal Opera House]] and became the [[Royal Ballet, London|Royal Ballet]], as it is known today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/ballet/index.cfm?ccs=473 ''History of The Royal Ballet''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422121540/http://info.royaloperahouse.org/ballet/index.cfm?ccs=473 |date=22 April 2004 }} Royal Opera House, accessed 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third theatre: 1868–1896 ===
[[File:Carl Rosa 1.png|thumb|left|[[Carl Rosa]]'s opera company performed at the third theatre.]]
A third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for [[William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]]. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash's]] practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/01/11/79212755.pdf "English Gossip".] ''[[New York Times]]'', 23 December 1873, accessed 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a [[Revivalism|Revivalist Christian]] group for £31,000.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

Mapleson returned to Her Majesty's in 1877 and 1878, after a disastrous attempt to build a 2,000-seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of [[Scotland Yard]]. On the return of the company, all the fittings of the theatre had been removed, including the seats, carpets and even the wallpaper. £6,000 was spent on fitting out the theatre, and on 28 April 1877 the building returned to theatrical use with the opening of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. The London premiere of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' occurred here on 22 June 1878, and in subsequent seasons the theatre hosted the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] (Rosa's wife, [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], had made her name in opera partly at Her Majesty's) and a programme of French plays and [[light opera]]. The company was the first to produce ''Carmen'' in English, at the theatre in February 1879, starring [[Selina Dolaro]] in the title role and [[Durward Lely]] as Don José.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, the theatre hosted the London premieres of [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring cycle]]''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

Mapleson returned in 1887 and 1889, but ''[[The Times]]'' commented that the repertoire comprised "works that had long ceased to attract a large public, the singers were exclusively of second-rate quality, and the standard of performance was extremely low".&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; ''[[Rigoletto]]'', on 25 May 1889, was the last operatic performance given in the house.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

== Phipps' theatre: 1897–present ==
[[File:Beerbohm tree wolsey 1910.jpeg|right|upright|thumb|[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] at the theatre, in a 1910 photograph]]
With the rapid advances in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still held by the Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The [[Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues]] (forerunners of the [[Crown Estate]]) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect [[Charles J. Phipps]] for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] for the erection of the theatre at a cost of £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{IoE|210129|Her Majesty's Theatre|accessdate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Hedley Fitton09.jpg|thumb|left|Phipps' new theatre]]
The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the [[Carlton Hotel, London|Carlton Hotel]] and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House.&lt;ref&gt;The Carlton Hotel, opened in 1899 by the chef [[Auguste Escoffier]] and hotelier [[César Ritz]] after they left the [[Savoy Hotel]], introduced the ''[[à la carte]] menu''.&lt;/ref&gt; The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the [[French Renaissance]]. The theatre has a [[Corinthian Order|Corinthian]] colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; The theatre lies on an east–west axis. The stage at the western end was {{convert|49|ft|m|1}} deep and {{convert|69.5|ft|m|1}} wide,&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; The interior was designed by the consulting architect, [[W. H. Romaine-Walker]] (1854–1940), after the Opera at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Gabriel]]. Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319&amp;nbsp;seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, "The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building."&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Edwin O. ''Modern Opera Houses and Theatres'' vol. ii, p. 36 (London, 1897) (Reprint Ayer Co Pub., 1968) {{ISBN|0-405-08906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern opinion of the theatre is more generous, with [[English Heritage]] describing the building as both Phipps' finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London. The building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] in January 1970.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects [[Robert Matthew]], Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the [[Commonwealth Institute]]. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/newzealand.html New Zealand House, Haymarket.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319001327/http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/newzealand.html |date=19 March 2008 }} The 20th century Society, accessed 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Edward, and Christopher Woodward.

The current theatre opened on 28 April 1897. Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the [[Haymarket Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Beerbohm Tree obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 3 July 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years. The theatre opened with a dramatisation of [[Gilbert Parker]]'s ''[[The Seats of the Mighty]]''. Adaptations of novels by [[Dickens]], [[Tolstoy]], and others formed a significant part of the repertoire, along with classical works from [[Molière]] and [[Shakespeare]]. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of [[J. M. Synge]]'s ''[[The Tinker's Wedding]]'' on 11 November 1909&lt;ref&gt;Synge, J. M. ''The Complete Plays'' (1st. New York: Vintage Books, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', with Tree as Henry Higgins and [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Eliza, in 1914.&lt;ref name=HBTree&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/managers_tree.php Herbert Beerbohm Tree.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202103125/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/managers_tree.php |date=2 December 2007 }} PeoplePlayUK, accessed 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tree's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects, often including live animals and real grass.&lt;ref name=HBTree/&gt; These remained both popular and profitable, but in his last decade, Tree's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded, and many of his plays received bad reviews.

In 1904, Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art (later [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art|RADA]]), which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].

'''Hermann Wilhelm Göring''' (or '''Goering''';{{efn|name=spelling}} {{IPA-de|ˈɡøːʁɪŋ|lang|De-HermannWGoering.ogg}}; 12 January 1893&amp;nbsp;– 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' ("The Blue Max"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].

An early member of the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].

By 1941, Göring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent [[Göring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.

After the war, Göring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] the night before the sentence was to be carried out.

== Early life ==

Göring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst Göring]] (31 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327–330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert Göring|Albert]]. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21–22}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann Göring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Göring in 1907, at age 14]]

Göring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25–45}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22–24}}

Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–25}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}

Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; Göring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, Göring was stationed at [[Mulhouse]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}}

== World War I ==
{{stack|[[File:Göring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of Göring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}

During the first year of World War I, Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[Mülhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' ("air combat forces") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&amp;nbsp;– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28–29}}

After completing the pilot's training course, Göring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Zähringer Lion|Zähringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–32}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165–166}}

On 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], Göring was made commander of the famed "Flying Circus", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–33}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}

In the last days of the war, Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34–36}}

Like many other German veterans, Göring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}

== After World War I ==

Göring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39–41}}{{efn|name=swastika}}

This was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin Göring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''née'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed Göring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After Göring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}

== Early Nazi career ==
[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|left|upright=1.0|thumb|Göring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]

Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-Führer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst Röhm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring:

{{quote|text="I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men."{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}

Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49–51}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Göring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57–58}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59–60}}

Personal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=61}} He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a [[straitjacket]], but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=404}} Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=62, 64}} Hitler, who had written ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' while in prison, had been released in December 1924.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=160}} Carin Göring, ill with [[epilepsy]] and tuberculosis,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=146}} died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.

Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]] as its head rather than Göring, and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In [[German federal election, 1928|the May 1928 elections]] the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=118–121}} Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=66}} The [[Great Depression]] led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and [[German federal election, 1930|in the 1930 election]], the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136, 138}} In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he met the future [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=74}}

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 election]], the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected Göring to the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}}

== Reichstag fire ==
The [[Reichstag fire]] occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]]—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329–330}}

The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=194}} Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but [[Rudolf Diels]], head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=331}} Some researchers, including [[William L. Shirer]] and [[Alan Bullock]], are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=192}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=262}}

At the [[Nuremberg trials]], General [[Franz Halder]] testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, Göring said, "The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=193}} In his own Nuremberg testimony, Göring denied this story.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial Proceedings, 18 March 1946}}

== Second marriage ==
During the early 1930s, Göring was often in the company of [[Emmy Göring|Emmy Sonnemann]], an actress from [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=111}} They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=139–140}} at which Hitler was best man.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=63}} Göring's daughter, [[Edda Göring|Edda]], was born on 2 June 1938.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}}

== Nazi potentate ==
{{Nazism sidebar}}

When Hitler was named [[chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933, Göring was appointed as [[minister without portfolio]], Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} [[Wilhelm Frick]] was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) [[Heinrich Himmler]] hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with [[Rudolf Diels]] at its head. The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}

Hitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst Röhm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=306}} Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=38}}

One of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the [[Luftwaffe]] was formally acknowledged,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=116–117}} with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=364}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C01410, Berlin, Göring auf der "Grünen Woche".jpg|thumb|left|Göring during the ''[[Berlin International Green Week|Grüne Woche]]'' in Berlin, 1937]]

During a cabinet meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357–360}} Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=311}} and [[Walther Funk]] took over the position, as well as control of the [[Reichsbank]]. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=361}} In July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=145}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17986, Schorfheide, Lord Edward Frederik Halifax, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|200px|thumb|Göring with [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] at Schorfheide, 20 November 1937]]

In 1938, Göring was involved in the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], which led to the resignations of the War Minister, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the army commander, General [[Werner von Fritsch]]. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=116}} Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=116, 117}} Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of ''Generalfeldmarschall''. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=642–644}}

{{main article|Anschluss}}
As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=646–652}}

{{main article|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
Although [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}} That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for [[Czechoslovakia]]. [[Neville Chamberlain]] was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the [[Nuremberg Rally]] that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=194–197}} Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the [[Sudetenland]] to Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=674}} In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president [[Emil Hácha]] with the bombing of [[Prague]]. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|2001|p=119}}

Although many in the party disliked him,{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} before the war Göring enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}}{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}} As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}} In Britain and the United States, some viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}}

== World War II ==

=== Success on all fronts ===

Göring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=197, 211}} The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=597}} Later in the day, speaking to the ''Reichstag'', Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany, "If anything should befall me",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=599}} with Hess as the second alternate.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the [[Polish Air Force]] was defeated within a week.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|pp=177–189}} The ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' seized vital airfields in [[Norway]] and captured [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium. Göring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Battles of the Netherlands]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=721, 723}}

After the [[Fall of France]], Hitler awarded Göring the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his successful leadership.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}} During the [[1940 Field Marshal Ceremony]], Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]] des Grossdeutschen Reiches'' (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Göring had already received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}}

The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=113, 136, 143}} Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech, "If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!",{{sfn|Oestermann|2001|p=157}} something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940.{{sfn|Selwood|2015}} Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Göring, like Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy),{{sfn|Raeder|2001|pp=324–325}} was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]]).{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p=337}} Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=144}} After their defeat in the [[Battle of Britain]], the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via [[strategic bombing]]. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=500}} By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by [[the Blitz]], though the bombings continued through May 1941.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=145}}

=== Decline on all fronts ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Reprich-012-08, Wolfschanze, Hitler, Ley, Porsche und Göring.jpg|thumb|Hitler meeting Göring and automotive engineer [[Ferdinand Porsche]] at the ''[[Wolf's Lair]]'' in 1942]]
In spite of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]]—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=178–179}} Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=187}} But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=201}} After the long, but successful, [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Battle of Smolensk]], Hitler ordered [[Army Group Centre]] to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the [[Battle of Moscow]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=207–213}}

Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=404–405}} The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a major turning point of the war,{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=421}} began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=409}} The [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixth Army]] entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in [[Operation Uranus]], Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=412–413}}{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=329}} The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=932}}

=== War over Germany ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1977-149-13, Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|Göring with Hitler and [[Albert Speer]], 10 August 1943]]
Meanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began [[Defence of the Reich|operations against German targets]]. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|on Cologne]] on 30 May 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=438, 441}} Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US [[fighter aircraft]]. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as [[Aachen]] in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=378}}

The American [[P-51 Mustang]], with a [[combat radius]] of over {{convert|1800|mi}} when using underwing [[drop tank]]s, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=461}} German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=447}} Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=296, 297, 299}} As he lost Hitler's trust, Göring began to spend more time at his various residences.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=510}} On [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=295, 302}}

=== End of the war ===
{{see also|Göring Telegram}}
[[File:Goeringcaptivity.jpg|thumb|Göring in captivity 9 May 1945]]

As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=725}} His last birthday, celebrated at the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} Göring arrived at his estate at [[Obersalzberg]] on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1115}}

OKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]], the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}

[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann Göring.ogv|left|thumb|Göring after his capture (May 1945)]]

The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}informing him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}

By 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so Göring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed [[Karl Dönitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320–325}} This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}

== Trial and death ==
[[File:GöringDetentionReport.png|thumb|325px|Prisoner's "mug shot" taken at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice|alt=]]

{{main article|Nuremberg trials}}

Göring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off [[dihydrocodeine]] (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320&amp;nbsp;mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost {{convert|60|lb}}. His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=31}} Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to [[Nuremberg]], which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=329–331}}

Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be "in the sense of the indictment not guilty".{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=336–337}} 

[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Göring (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg trial]]]]

The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defence{{mdash}}the first to be presented{{mdash}}lasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=337}} Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]], who was seated beside him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=341–342}} Göring told US psychiatrist [[Leon Goldensohn]] that the court was "stupid" to try "little fellows" like Funk and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}} He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}}

Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]], a German-speaking US intelligence officer and psychologist, interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} Gilbert kept a journal, which he later published as ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:

[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]

{{quote|sign=Cpt. Gustave Gilbert|source=|Sweating in his cell in the evening, Göring was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking. He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others, and that he had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not believed these atrocities, and that several Jews had offered to testify on his behalf.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=278}}}}

On several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343–347}} When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359–367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H. Jackson]] read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], a major [[pogrom]] in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} Later, [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell-Fyfe]] proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the [[Stalag Luft III murders]]{{mdash}}the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from [[Stalag Luft III]]{{mdash}}in time to have prevented the killings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=371}} He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the [[Hungarian Jews]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=374–375}}

[[File:Goering-corpse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Göring's corpse]]

Göring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:

{{quote|There is nothing to be said in mitigation. For Göring was often, indeed almost always, the moving force, second only to his leader. He was the leading war aggressor, both as political and as military leader; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races, at home and abroad. All of these crimes he has frankly admitted. On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony, but in terms of the broad outline, his own admissions are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt. His guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}}}

Göring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=392–393}} Defying the sentence imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a [[potassium cyanide]] capsule the night before he was to be hanged.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=964}}

One theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner,{{sfn|Taylor|1992|p=623}} after being bribed by Göring, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case.{{sfn|Botting|2006|p=280}} In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s [[26th Infantry Regiment]]{{mdash}}the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials{{mdash}}claimed he gave Göring "medicine" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring's suicide.{{sfn|BBC News|2005}}

Göring's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]], Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the [[Isar]] River.{{sfn|Darnstädt|2005}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}

== Personal properties ==
{{see also|Nazi plunder|Reichswerke Hermann Göring}}
[[File:Göering weapon and baton.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring's ''Reichsmarschall'' baton and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver. To the left is the silver-bound guest book from [[Carinhall]]. ([[West Point Museum]])]]
Göring's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List]]{{sfn|OSS Reports}} compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.{{sfn|NARA Records}}

The confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took [[Political corruption|kickbacks]] from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War]] via [[Pyrkal]] in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=366–368, 538}}

Göring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in [[Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve|Schorfheide Forest]], where he set aside {{convert|100000|acres|km2}} as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, [[Carinhall]], in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=120–123}} The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=244–245}}{{sfn|Rothfeld|2002}} Göring worked closely with the ''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' ([[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]]), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285}} Headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285, 291}} The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=281}}

[[File:Mundur Goeringa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Göring's uniform on display at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr]]'']]

Göring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=115–116}} his ''Reichsmarschall'' uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], the top ''[[Stuka]]'' pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red [[toga]] fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what "a high grade prostitute wears to the opera."{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24–25}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}

Göring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416–417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417–418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}

[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941–45).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Musée de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]

The design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' ("[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.

Though he liked to be called "''der Eiserne''" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that "he sits down on his stomach".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=409}}{{clear left}}

== Complicity in the Holocaust ==
{{see also|Luftwaffe#War crimes}}
[[File:Carta Göring.JPG|thumb|Göring's July 1941 letter to [[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]
[[Joseph Goebbels]] and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} His deputy, [[Erhard Milch]], had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}}

At the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}

In July 1941, Göring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the "Jewish Question". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. Göring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}

Göring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Białowieża Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261–262, 266}}

== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==
{{main article|Albert Göring}}

Göring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps. He was arrested four times, but Hermann secured his release each time. Hermann's daughter [[Edda Göring|Edda]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Albert "could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get."{{sfn|Burke|2010}}

The first location was opened in Paris in 2006 by Vincent Worms and Sandra Terdjman, and a San Francisco, California location was added in 2011 in the Mission District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Del Pesco|first=Joseph|title=about page|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kadist-Art-Foundation/105972509425490?id=105972509425490&amp;sk=info|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

* '''Exhibitions''': With a gallery space both in Paris and San Francisco, Kadist hosts exhibitions by international artists and curators, often in coordination with their residency program. Artists they have worked with include [[Ryan Gander]], [[Danh Vo]], [[Francis Alÿs]], and Roman Ondàk. Additionally they have co-produced large scale artist projects, including "Klau Mich" by [[Dora García]] and "Muster" by [[Clemens von Wedemeyer]] at [[DOCUMENTA (13)]].
* '''Residencies''': Kadist provides residencies for a wide range of creative activities including and not limited to new artistic productions, publications, writers and curators. Recent residents include artists [[Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries]], bookstore Ooga Booga and publications [[White Fungus (magazine)|White Fungus]], Nero, and [[Fillip]].
* '''Events''': Kadist San Francisco hosts an ongoing series of events,frequently on Wednesdays, which have involved screenings, performances, conversations, and game shows.

==Mission==

From their mission statement: "We believe contemporary artists make an important contribution to a progressive society, their work often addressing key issues of our time. KADIST is a non-profit organization that encourages this engagement and is dedicated to extending the reach of artists represented in its collection to a global audience, thus facilitating new connections across cultures. Its programs develop collaborations with artists, curators and many art organizations around the world. Local programs in KADIST’s hubs of Paris and San Francisco include exhibitions, public events, residencies and educational initiatives. Complemented by an  active online network, they aim at creating vibrant conversations about contemporary art and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worms|first=Vincent|title=mission|url=http://kadist.org/about/|publisher=kadist . org|accessdate=29 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

The Kadist collection was established in 2001 and includes film and video, performance, painting, photography, drawings and prints, sculpture, and installations. Ultimately the collection not bound by geography, but it focuses on four greater regions: the Middle East, Asia, The Americas and Europe. Kadist has also supported the production of artworks, and commissioned artworks through its residency program, and in collaboration with international biennials—some of which are part of the collection.

'''Modern sculpture''' is generally considered to have begun with the work of [[Auguste Rodin]], who is seen as the progenitor of modern [[sculpture]]. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture]", Palm Springs Desert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He "dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void".&lt;ref&gt;Giedion-Welcker, Carola, ‘’Contemporary Sculpture: An Evolution in Volume and Space, A revised and Enlarged Edition’’, Faber and Faber, London, 1961, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, "arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Robert, ‘’ARTSPOKE: A Guide to Modern Ideas, Movements and Buzzwords, 1848-1944’’ Abbeville Publishers, New York, 1993, p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] [[sculpture]] movements include [[Art Nouveau]], [[Cubist sculpture|Cubism]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[De Stijl]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop-Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Land art]], [[Conceptual art]], and [[Installation art]] among others.

The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] held in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his [[Burghers of Calais]], [[Balzac]], [[Victor Hugo]] statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his [[Gates of Hell]] which included [[The Thinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelope, ‘’Sculpture: 1900-1945’’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert L., ‘’Rodin’s Gates of Hell’’, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN, 1960 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cubist sculpture]], in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with [[Cubism|cubist painting]], and the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using [[collage]], sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze ''Head of a Woman'' as the first cubist sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too]", ''New York Times'', exhibition review 1982, Retrieved July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and [[Alexander Archipenko]], who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 ''Walking Woman'' were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kodnergallery.com/gallery/modernism/bios/archipenkobio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. [[Duchamp-Villon]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism", ''Readings in Art History 2'' (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Balas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture]'', American Philosophical Society, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was ''construction'' a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the "[[found object]]" (French: ''objet trouvé'') or ''readymade'' with pieces such as [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] (1917).

Similarly, the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture.&lt;ref name=edward&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Visual arts in the 20th century'', Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|0-8109-3934-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.&lt;ref&gt;"Constantin Brâncuși", ''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, 2008 http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Constantin_Brancusi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Ásmundur Sveinsson]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007,Original from the University of Michigan,{{ISBN|0-19-512878-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].

==Post-1950s==
Since the 1950s [[Modernist]] trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge, {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in [[Chicago]], known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.

In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features,  predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of [[Sir Anthony Caro]], as well as [[welded sculpture]] by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of [[John Angus Chamberlain|John Chamberlain]], and environmental installation scale works by [[Mark di Suvero]]. Other Minimalists and [[Postminimalist]]s include [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Giacomo Benevelli]], [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Robert Smithson]], and others like [[John Safer]] who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum Receives "Ascent" Sculpture for display at Udvar-Hazy Center [http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroomreleaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=49]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Arman]], [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Ernest Trova]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Manuel Neri]] and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] in a classic articulated style and [[Fernando Botero]] bringing his painting's "oversized figures" into monumental sculptures. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic]] sculpture as practiced by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Stephen De Staebler]], [[Kenneth Price]], and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.

Artists created [[environmental sculpture]] on expansive sites in the "[[Land Arts of the American West|land art in the American West]]" group of projects. These [[land art]] or "earth art" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[James Turrell]] ([[Roden Crater]]). [[Eva Hesse]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jackie Winsor]], [[Keith Sonnier]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others were pioneers of [[Postminimalist]] sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Chryssa]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Duane Hanson]], and [[John DeAndrea]] explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through [[video art]], environment, light sculpture, and [[installation art]] in new ways.

[[Conceptual art]] is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'', 1965, by [[Joseph Kosuth]], and ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', 1973, by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], and those of [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[James Turrell]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/craig-martin-an-oak-tree-l02262 Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodern art|Postmodern sculpture]] occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. [[Rosalind Krauss]] identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of [[Land art]], [[Minimalism|Minimalist sculpture]], and [[site-specific art]] into the category of "sculpture":

* Site-Construction: the intersection of landscape and architecture 
* Axiomatic Structures: the combination of architecture and not-architecture
* Marked sites: the combination of landscape and not-landscape
* Sculpture: intersection of not-landscape and not-architecture

====Contemporary genres====
Modern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in [[environmental art]] and [[environmental sculpture]], often in full view of spectators. [[Light sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. Site-specific [[work of art|artwork]] is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Athena Tacha]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, "Site Sculpture", ''Art News'', Oct. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Howett, ''New Directions in Environmental Art,'' Landscape Architecture, Jan. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art critic]] [[Lucy Lippard]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, ''Art Outdoors, In and Out of the Public Domain,'' Studio International, March–April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land art]], [[Earthworks (art)|Earthworks]], ([[Earth art]]) is an [[art movement]] that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of [[nature]] generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], logs, branches, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[water]], as well as man made materials like [[Chain-link fencing]], [[barbed wire]], [[rope]], [[rubber]], [[glass]], [[concrete]], [[metal]], [[asphalt]], and mineral [[pigments]]. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic sculpture]]s are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to {{convert|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.

[[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as [[aeolian harp]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)|Michael Leavitt]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Army by Michael Leavitt", '' hypediss.com'' [http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Biology teacher Devki is vivacious and popular among her students. In a class, a student, Mohit sends Devki's stepdaughter, Arya an offensive video and Devki throws his phone out of the window. At home, despite Devki's persistent and warm approach toward her, Arya remains frosty and distant, rebuffing her attempts to build a relationship. Arya is invited to a Valentine's Day party at a farmhouse; Devki permits this with great hesitation. Arya rebuffs Mohit and his hotshot buddy Charles at the party. Incensed by this very public snub, Charles, Mohit, Jagan and the watchman Babu attack Arya when she leaves the party. They brutally rape her and dump her in a drain along the side of a road, leaving her for dead after half-strangling her. She is found barely alive and brought to the hospital, where she undergoes various operations to save her. Devki and her husband Anand are shattered. Arya recovers and releases a statement naming her attackers.

Inspector Matthew quickly rounds up the attackers. However, the case falls apart when Arya was found to be drinking, thus building the argument that her memory is unreliable. The body samples were recovered very late and were too weak to match the attackers. The judge acquits the four attackers due to lack of evidence. Her lawyer suggests appealing to a higher court but Devki has lost faith. Arya, still in shock and broken by the court verdict, tears away from Devki. In sorrow, Devki realizes she has probably lost Arya forever.

Devki recalls the somewhat shady detective, DK, whom she'd met on the night Arya was raped. A father of a daughter himself, he understands her pain and agrees to help her as Devki wants to avenge Arya.

The watchman is first. Devki seeks the help of her former students - transgender people who understand her plight. They seduce the watchman and drug him. He awakes four days later, still drunk, and finds, to his horror, that he has been [[castrated]] and remembers nothing. The hotshot Charles is next. Devki breaks into his home and mixes crushed apple seeds &amp;ndash; a source of [[cyanide]] &amp;ndash; into his fitness powder. Charles is paralyzed. When Mohit visits Charles at the hospital, Devki, tipped off by DK, plants apple seeds and other evidence at Mohit’s home. Inspector Matthew quickly arrests Mohit; Charles will die soon and Mohit will be the murderer. As Devki takes down each of Arya's attackers, their situations make it on the news, which Arya follows with surprise. She believes it may be her father, and she is deeply grateful to him. Matthew also suspects the father but, although he has him tailed, cannot catch him out. Then he finds Devki’s glasses in Mohit’s apartment and starts suspecting her.

Matthew confronts Devki but there is no evidence. He warns her that the fourth man, Jagan, is a hard criminal: going after him is dangerous for her family. Jagan visits Charles and learns that it is "the mom" (Devki) who is retaliating. He goes after DK and discovers that Devki is on a holiday at a snow cottage in [[Kufri, India|Kufri]]. He kills DK and goes after Devki. Matthew discovers a hidden camera in DK’s sunglasses and hurries to save Devki.

Jagan cuts power at the cottage and shoots Anand. There is a scuffle and Arya runs out into the snow. Jagan pursues her and Devki tries to save her. As Jagan is about to kill Devki, Matthew intercepts and tackles Jagan. There is a standoff: Devki points a gun at Jagan and Matthew attempts to talk her down by telling her that Anand is alive and in the hospital and if she shoots him, she’ll go to jail. Arya, in the bushes, overhears Jagan when he angrily relates how Devki finished off the other attackers. Devki knows if Jagan is left alive he will come after her again. At this point, Matthew hands her his gun and urges her to kill him. Devki hesitates but when an overwhelmed Arya acknowledges Devki as ''‘Mom’'' for the first time, Devki shoots Jagan dead.

Created by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], and portrayed by actress [[Courteney Cox]], Monica appears in each of the show's [[List of Friends episodes|236 episodes]], from its [[The Pilot (Friends)|premiere]] on September 24, 1994, to its [[The Last One (Friends)|finale]] on May 6, 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] nature, Monica is the younger sister of [[Ross Geller]] and best friend of [[Rachel Green]], the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend [[Chandler Bing]], whom she marries. [[Infertility|Unable to conceive children]] on their own, the couple eventually adopts twins and moves out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.

The creators' first choice for the role of Monica was comedian [[Janeane Garofalo]]. Cox had originally been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress [[Jennifer Aniston]], Cox' co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before ''Friends'' aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive [[Don Ohlmeyer]] over whether or not this would make the character too [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with [[childhood obesity]], challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her [[Judy Geller|mother]] would eventually become popular staples of the show.

Several months before ''Friends'' premiered, NBC had conducted a [[research report]], the results of which determined that Monica was the only character to have been remotely well received by [[test audience]]s. When ''Friends'' first aired, critics initially perceived Monica – who was immediately established as the show's "[[Codependency|mother hen]]" – and Cox as the series' main character and star, respectively. Critics have been largely receptive towards both Cox and her character; the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' holds Cox's acting responsible for disproving the [[Social stigma|stigma]] that attractive women are incapable of delivering comedic performances. Revered as a television icon, Monica famously addressed several topics that were rarely discussed in [[Prime time|prime time television]] at the time, including [[safe sex]], [[casual sex]], and [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age disparity in relationships]]. Despite garnering positive reviews for her performance, Cox is the only main cast member to have never been nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] during ''Friends''{{'}} ten-year run.

Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan deliberately intended to keep Monica and Chandler's union "low-key" in order to further differentiate it from Ross and Rachel's, which had been very public.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; In order to get an idea how audiences would react to Monica and Chandler hooking up at Ross and Emily's wedding in London, the scene in which a clearly nude Monica suddenly emerges from under the sheets of Chandler's [[Hotel bedding|hotel bed]] was filmed in front of three separate test audiences, each of whom responded very enthusiastically to the surprise, several months before the episode was actually taped.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; Despite the warm reception received from the audience, Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan were at first uncertain as to whether or not they should continue expanding upon their relationship even further, and proceeded with caution by having Monica and Chandler initially keep their relationship hidden from their peers.&lt;ref name=":40"/&gt; Protective of their characters, Cox and Perry shared similar hesitations at first, but ultimately grew to accept Monica and Chandler as a couple.&lt;ref name=":40"/&gt; The characters' relationship is eventually revealed to their friends in the episode "[[The One Where Everybody Finds Out]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/the-top-10-friends-episodes|title = The Top 10 Friends Episodes|date = September 24, 2014|accessdate = September 15, 2015|website = IGN|publisher = Ziff Davis LLC|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150105061519/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/the-top-10-friends-episodes|archivedate = January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While each character very much approves of their union, Monica's parents initially resent their daughter's feelings for Chandler due to an age-old misunderstanding involving Chandler.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Bianco observed that "On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler would have been an act of desperation."

Despite consistently warm reception towards Cox and her character, some aspects of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The [[Friends (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies]]" sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment in order to have sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In her book ''Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice'', author Lynn M.

But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist."&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; Emma Tarver of Feminspire reflected that Fat Monica "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of [[Refinery29]] received Fat Monica positively as "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four [[flashback episode]]s, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a [[doughnut]] while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an [[internet meme]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

A challenge for museum architecture is the differing purposes of the building.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The museum collection must be preserved, but it also needs to be made accessible to the public. Climate control may be very important for the objects in the collection.

==History==
An early example of architecture for a purpose-built museum is the [[Museum of the History of Science]] building in [[Oxford]], [[England]], originally built to house the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

In the 20th century, museums have been combined with war memorials to serve multiple purposes. The [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]], for example, is a place of commemoration as well as for collection and display. It contains a museum, an archive and a shrine. It was designed by [[Emil Sodersten]] and [[John Crust]] in a contemporary [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style reminiscent of [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]] with detailing influenced by [[Art Deco]].

The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, USA (opened in 1959), by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is an important architectural landmark and icon of the 20th century. Another classic 20th century example of iconic museum architecture is the titanium-covered [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in Spain by [[Frank Gehry]] (opened in 1997). Gehry has undertaken many major museum architecture projects, including the [[Experience Music Project]] in Seattle, USA, the [[Weisman Art Museum]] in Minneapolis, USA, the [[Vitra Design Museum]] and [[MARTa Museum]] in Germany, and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, Canada.

Successful examples of modern architecture being married with existing museum buildings include the [[Louvre Pyramid]] by [[I. M. Pei]] in Paris, France (1989), and more recently the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] by [[Norman Foster]] at the [[British Museum]], London, England (2000).

[[David Chipperfield]] designed many notable museums, including the award-winning [[River and Rowing Museum]] in Henley-on-Thames, England, in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.architectural-review.com/home/ar-archive/ar-1997-january-david-chipperfields-river-and-rowing-museum/8611738.article | title=AR 1997 January — David Chipperfield's River and Rowing Museum | last=Richards | first=Ivor | journal=[[The Architectural Review]] | date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This won in 1999 the [[RIBA]] ''Architecture in Arts and Leisure Award'' and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] Trust/[[British Sky Broadcasting]] ''Best Building Award (England)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/74906CDF-4437-45C1-8470-4208CCD7901B/0/David_Chipperfield_CV.pdf | title=David Chipperfield | website=www.wakefield.gov.uk | publisher=[[Wakefield Council]] | location=UK | accessdate=October 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipperfield also designed the [[Figge Art Museum]] in Davenport, Iowa, USA (2005), the [[Museum of Modern Literature]] in Marbach, Germany (2006), and the reconstructed [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin, Germany (2009).

Museum architecture sometimes involves the [[Adaptive reuse|conversion]] of old buildings that have outlived their usefulness but that are still of historic interest. A notable example is the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] or the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] into the [[Tate Modern]] in 2000, based on design by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | title=Tate Modern | publisher=[[Carillion]] PLC | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130817/http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2483168510674278477 | title=Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern | publisher=[[Google Video]] | year=2008 | accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc]], an architecture firm based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, established in 1962, has undertaken museum architecture projects including [[Ellis Island|Ellis Island National Monument and Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/stli/serv02.htm STLI Service 2 Description], [[National Park Service]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; (Associated Architects with Beyer Blinder Belle Architects) and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (Associated Architects with Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28116">'''Music librarianship''' is the area of [[librarianship]] that pertains to music collections and their development, [[cataloging]], [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and maintenance, as well as [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] issues connected with musical works and music literature.  Music librarians usually have degrees in both music and librarianship (typically, a [[Master of Library and Information Science]] and at least a college-level music degree).  Music librarians deal with standard librarianship duties such as cataloging and reference, but the addition of [[Sheet music|music score]]s and recordings to collections complicates these tasks.  Therefore, music librarians generally read music and have at least a basic understanding of both [[music theory]] and [[music history]] to aid in their duties.

==History==

Most early written [[classical music]] was predominantly sacred; collections of written music and literature were held by monasteries, cathedrals, and other religious establishments, such as church music societies, offices, and seminaries.  As universities emerged in the 12th century, libraries formed throughout Europe, and obtained donations or gifts from monasteries and private collectors.  The advent of [[National library|national and centralized libraries]] two centuries later allowed for greater attention to special materials like music collections.  Up to the end of the 15th century, music collections had been limited to religious organizations, private collectors, or small areas of university libraries.  Public collections grew with the development of printing at the end of the 15th century and the surge of scholarly and artistic endeavors of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Rita. Libraries §2 Early History. Grove Music.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music librarianship since the Renaissance has grown alongside modern librarianship, but with more unique, dedicated facilities for materials.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the establishment of [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] created a need for music collections that supported learning at those institutions.  While the proliferation of [[Library classification|classification]] schemes has given music a niche in modern public and academic collections, other institutions maintaining music-only collections have contributed to the rise of music libraries.  These include conservatories, music information centers, composers' and performing rights associations, opera houses, music publishers, and media facilities involved with broadcasting and film.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Rita. Libraries §3 Types. Grove Music.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

In the United States, most librarianship degrees begin at the graduate level.  At the undergraduate level, potential music librarians study music at any number of schools and programs (theory, history, performance, production, business and education).  Following the coupling of an MLS and undergraduate music degree, many music librarians also elect to study music at the graduate level.  Additionally, doctorate programs are available in both music and library science.  In Masters level degrees of library science, typical music-oriented offerings examine the different materials of music collections, such as music-specific dictionaries, encyclopedias, bibliographies, indexes, and other music literature.  Music librarianship offerings may also address music reference, cataloging issues, [[Library collection development|collection development]] and maintenance, [[Bookbinding|binding]] and repair, preservation, evaluation methods of antiquarian material appraisal, and music librarianship education (teaching methods).  Certain music librarianship areas of practice do not require a library degree- performance library management, for example.&lt;ref&gt;MLA. "Music Librarianship- Is it for you?" Music Library Association- MLA Employment and Education. http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/employmentanded/musiclibrarianship.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Music Library Association published a set of qualifications for music librarians. The “minimum qualifications expected of a beginning music librarian” were restricted to knowledge of materials and resources of the music library, general librarianship skills, and general music knowledge which states that candidates for music librarian positions should have music degrees preferably a bachelor’s and a master's degree; a master’s in library science; courses in music librarianship and/or experience working in a music library; familiarity with foreign languages, and a commitment to continued growth and education as seen through work in professional organizations, such as the Music Library Association.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, J. (2004). Music Librarianship Education: Problems and Solutions. Music Reference Servis Quarterly, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians usually receive on-the-job training to become familiar with the inner workings of their collections.  This may include training in a particular classification scheme (such as [[Library of Congress Classification]] or ANSCR), binding procedures, or protocols regarding patron usage of materials.  Additionally, many librarians elect to participate in continuing education classes and programs available through professional organizations and other outlets.  For example, music librarians preparing for a large scale cataloging project might take a cataloging workshop focusing on a particular scheme or music cataloging issue.  Librarians training for a position that involves a new technology might apply to classes offered by external companies in specific software or hardware.

The ultimate goal of music library education is to engender core competencies in students preparing to enter the field.&lt;ref&gt;“Core Competencies and Music Librarians” Music Library Association, 2002. http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/pdf/Core_Competencies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Music Library Association maintains a list of library and information science schools that teach music librarianship or accept music credits as part of their library degree programs.  Note: this list is current as of November 2011. [http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/employment.aspx?id=77 "Directory of Library School Offerings in Music Librarianship"]

==Facilities==

''See [[Music library]]''

Music librarians work with collections in a variety of settings.  Music libraries take several forms, and often are maintained as a part of a larger collection or institution.  
The nature of a music library facility depends heavily on the role of the music library within its parent institution.  At academic institutions dedicated to music (such as a music conservatory), the music library may be the main library collection of the school.  In colleges or universities where music is only one aspect of academic focus, the music collection may be integrated into the greater library system, or a separate collection from the main library.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Malcolm. Music Librarianship. London: Clive Bingley, 1979. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Performance music libraries serve a unique function and are often housed with performance spaces.  Entirely digital music collections require server space and proper housing of digitization equipment, although many music libraries in the process of digitization have facilities for such services.  Other factors influencing facilities include the types of materials in the collection, the users who will access those materials, and budget constraints related to implementation, acquisition, maintenance, and service.

==Areas of Practice==

Most music librarians have an array of tasks to perform, depending on the nature of their collection and position.  General duties include cataloging and reference, acquisition and collection development.  It is common to specialize in one or more areas of music librarianship, particularly for work in special collections.

===Cataloging and Classification===

Music materials require different cataloging methods than other fields.  While music literature can be classified and cataloged following general cataloging rules that apply to all subjects, music scores and sound recordings present unique challenges of both description and access.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Brian. Organizing Music in Libraries. Vol. 2: Cataloging. London: Clive Bingley, Ltd., 1979. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include uniform titles, responsibility (composer versus performer), and how to classify sound recordings (by genre, composer, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Smiraglia, Richard. Bibliographic Control of Music, 1897-2000. MLA Index and Bibliography Series No. 32. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2006. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===References===

Music reference requires knowledge of music history, the ability to read music and have at least a basic understanding of music theory, and a strong grasp of music reference literature: dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, bibliographies and discographies, and music score formats.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Malcolm. Music Librarianship. London: Clive Bingley, 1979. 74-78.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reference also necessitates adeptness with electronic resources and tools.  Reading ability in German and Romance languages are practical skills to possess when working closely with western classical music.  When working with non-western music, an ethnomusicology background may be essential.&lt;ref&gt;MLA. "Music Librarianship- Is it for you?" Music Library Association- MLA Employment and Education. http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/employmentanded/musiclibrarianship.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition and Collection Development===

In order to grow their collections, music librarians purchase books and music reference materials, subscribe to serials, order music scores and sound recordings, and buy or license electronic resources.  This involves not only contact with publishers and other agencies that provide music materials, but also budgetary management of library funds.

===Preservation==

Preservation of music is the maintenance of musical compositions and preventing music from extinction.
Music collections require certain conditions for the preservation of printed materials.  Appropriate air regulation prevents the accumulation of moisture, and materials should be protected from the possibility of water or fire damage.  Music scores often need new binding either because of weak publisher bindings or due to age.  Although binding is done mainly for preservation, it also to provide uniformity (binding music allows for uniform barcode or call number placement, for example).  Music library staff usually allocate part of their duties to managing binding and processing of scores.  Some music libraries outsource binding to professional companies, and a few music libraries have dedicated binding staff and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Knowing the Score: Preserving collections of music. Comp. Mark Roosa and Jane Gottlieb. MLA Technical Reports No. 23. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1994. 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound recordings present another level of preservation.  Light protection, temperature and humidity control, and particular shelving, packaging, and cleaning procedures must be followed for proper storage for preserving physical materials.&lt;ref&gt;“Cylinder, Disc and Tape Care in a Nutshell (Preservation, Library of Congress).” Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronic files (documents and sound recordings) require preservation, too.  Migration, replication, emulation, and metadata attachment aid in preservation of [[electronic document|digital documents]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, J. "Ensuring the Longevity of Digital Documents." Scientific American 272, 1 (1995). http://www.clir.org/pubs/archives/ensuring.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Collections===

'''Performance'''

Performance music librarians act as support for performing groups by acquiring printed music and preparing it for performance.  Preparation involves managing multiple parts, collating and creating folders of music for each player, and usually marking specific notes or edits in the music, such as bowing directions for string instruments.  Performance libraries then store the music for future performance or return it (if the music has been rented).

'''Production'''

''See [[Production music|Production Music]]''

Production music librarians maintain collections that own licensed music.  This music is distributed on license to other institutions or performing groups for profit.

'''Antiquarian and Rare Collections'''

Antiquarian music collections are usually housed in very large music libraries, institutional special collections archives, or in private collections.  The antiquarian trade often involves purchasing materials from private collections at auctions.  Antiquarian and rare materials require extra care in handling and preservation.  The age of materials can reach back several hundred years and can have considerable value.

'''Digital Collections'''

''See [[Digital library]]''

[[Digitization]] is the process by which printed music or literature is converted to digital formats by a scanner.  Digitization is also the process of transferring audio formats (for example, converting music on an LP record to mp3).  Materials may also be born-digital; that is, created originally as a digital document or file.  Many music librarians dedicate part of their duties to digitizing elements of their collection.  Some libraries are entirely digital collections, and may not have physical access at all.  These are usually hosted on the Internet or a network, and most often electronic access is limited to specific user groups (sometimes by subscription).  Digital libraries deal with digital decay, security and access, and copyright issues involved with distributing and/or copying data to users.

==Technology==

Because of the nature of the materials in a music library, music librarians employ technologies related to audio delivery, access to digital material, and print music preservation and presentation.

Audio collections require dependable audio-delivery systems, including headphones, receivers, and audio players (CD, DAT, phonograph, etc.).  Attention is paid in particular to where listening stations are located in the library, to accommodate for noise, access to audio materials, and access to other technology like computers (especially if audio is streamed through a computer from an online digital collection).  Some libraries may opt for listening stations or rooms separate from the main library area.

Music libraries that digitize parts of their collection require scanners for printed materials, and devices for transferring analog audio to digital formats.  Computers are needed to control, convert, stream, store, preserve, or otherwise manipulate digitized material.  Entirely digital collections involve technology for connecting users to electronic materials, usually hosted on the Internet.  Information professionals involved with these projects deal with issues such as streaming, security and access, copy protection and copyright, and database management.

==Professional Organizations==

Professional organizations related to music librarianship include:

* The [[Music Library Association]] (MLA): the official organization for the music librarianship profession [http://musiclibraryassoc.org link]
* [http://www.iaml.info/ International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres] [[International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres|(IAML)]]: a group with a wide scope, sustaining the development of music library projects around the world.
* [http://www.mola-inc.org/ Major Orchestra Librarians' Association] (MOLA): Generally dedicated to performance music library issues, MOLA membership is open to conductors, musicians, and publishers, as well as performance music librarians.

* [http://www.ams-net.org/ American Musicological Society] [[American Musicological Society|(AMS)]]: The organization dedicated to research in different fields of music.
* [http://www.arsc-audio.org/ Association for Recorded Sound Collections] [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections|(ARSC)]]: supports all types of audio collections and professions related to sound recordings.  ARSC is geared particularly toward preservation and projects studying sound recordings and collections.
* [http://www.american-music.org/ Society for American Music] [[Society for American Music|(SAM)]]: The organization concerned with all aspects of North and Central American (and Caribbean) music.

Additionally, music librarians will find support from academic and corporate institutions that offer grants, continuing education, inter-institutional cooperation (such as interlibrary loan or out-sourced services like digitization), and resources aiding in the completion of tasks in the field.

==Current Issues==

Cataloging concerns remain constant topics for debate in music librarianship.  Digitization problems and electronic bibliographic, reference and archival tools are also at the front lines of the field as library technology moves forward.  Efficiency of digitization has been increasing as library storage space has been diminishing, so more libraries are turning toward digitization not only to preserve materials in electronic formats, but also to save space.  The open access movement is having an effect on music libraries, notably in subscription- or fee-based electronic services versus freely accessible electronic services.

Copyright is another major issue in this field.  As a score travels from the pen of a composer to the music stand of a performer, it changes many hands.  Composers may copyright and even distribute their own work, but it might also be distributed by a corporate publisher.  Music libraries pay for copies of works, but sometimes only rent the work through a license.  Because music copyright is an intricate issue, music librarians must carefully abide by copyright guidelines, such as those noted on the Music Library Association website.

Major field publications such as ''Notes'' (the MLA's quarterly journal), as well as email listservs, forums, and presentations at meetings of professional organizations, highlight and analyze key trends in music librarianship.

'''''Norma Rae''''' is a 1979 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Martin Ritt]] from a screenplay written by [[Harriet Frank Jr.]] and [[Irving Ravetch]]. Based on the true story of [[Crystal Lee Sutton]],&lt;ref&gt;Obituary [[New York Times]], September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary [[Los Angeles Times]], September 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which was told in the 1975 book ''Crystal Lee, a Woman of Inheritance'' by ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Henry P. Leifermann,&lt;ref&gt;''Crystal Lee, a Woman of Inheritance'', Henry P. Leifermann, Macmillan (1975), {{ISBN|0-02-570220-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the film stars [[Sally Field]] in the titular role. [[Beau Bridges]], [[Ron Leibman]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Barbara Baxley]] and [[Gail Strickland]] are featured in supporting roles.
The film's narrative follows Norma Rae, a factory worker from a small town in [[North Carolina]] who becomes involved in the [[trade union|labor union]] activities at the [[textile]] factory where she works after the health of her and her co-workers is compromised.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1896/year/1979.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Norma Rae |accessdate=2009-05-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Norma Rae'' premiered at the  [[1979 Cannes Film Festival|32nd Cannes Film Festival]] where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]], while Field received the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Prix d'interprétation féminine]]. The film was released theatrically on March 2, 1979, and upon its release was a critical and commercial success with critics appreciating the film's direction, screenplay, message and performances (in particular of Field's), while the film grossed $22 million on a production budget of $4.5 million.

It received six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[52nd Academy Awards]] including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Field) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for its theme song, "[[It Goes Like It Goes]]."&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;See film's entry at IMDb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected for preservation at the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2011, deemed as being "culturally, aesthetically or historically significant".

== Plot ==
Norma Rae Wilson is a worker in a cotton mill that has taken too much of a toll on the health of her family for her to ignore their poor working conditions. She is also a single mother with two children by different fathers, one dead and the other negligent, and frequently has flings with other men to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. Initially, management tries to divert her frequent protests by promoting her to "spot checker," where she is responsible for making sure other workers are fulfilling work quotas. She reluctantly takes the job for the pay hike, but when fellow employees, including her own father, shun her for effectively being a "fink" to the bosses, she demands to be fired. Instead, she is demoted back to the line.

Two men enter her life that change her perspective. A former co-worker, Sonny Webster, asks her out after earlier causing trouble for her at the mill. Divorced with a daughter, he proposes marriage after a short courtship; recognizing how long it has been since she met a non-selfish man to keep company with, she accepts his offer. And after a few charged encounters with a New York [[union organizer]], Reuben Warshowsky, Norma Rae listens to him deliver a speech that spurs her to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes conflict at home when Sonny observes she's not spending enough time in the home and is frequently exhausted when she is present. When her father drops dead at the mill, a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of wait for his allotted break, she is more determined to continue the fight.

Management retaliates against the organization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay, and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands she copy down the racist flier word for word in order to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management attempts to stop her, then fire her on grounds of creating a disturbance, and call the police to remove her from the plant. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word "UNION" on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room.  One by one, the other workers stop their mill machines, and eventually, the entire room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben.

Upon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and recent arrest, so that they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no, but acknowledges "he's in my head." Sonny, in turn, tells her there's no other woman in his head and he will always remain with her.

An election to [[labor union|unionize]] the factory takes place, with Norma and Reuben listening as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference shy of 100 votes, the result is a victory for the union. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite his being smitten with her throughout the movie, they only shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.

== Inspiration ==
The story is based on [[Crystal Lee Sutton]]'s life as a textile worker in [[Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina]], where the battle for the workers' union took place against a [[WestPoint Home|J.P. Stevens Textiles]] mill. Her actual protest in the mill is the scene in the film where she writes the sign "UNION" and stands on her worktable until all machines are silent. Although Sutton was fired from her job, the mill was unionized, and she later went to work as an organizer for the textile union.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Leif Davin, "Crystal Lee," ''In These Times'', March 5–18, 1980, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PHUNK''' is a [[Singapore]]-based [[contemporary art]] and [[design]] collective. PHUNK was founded in 1994 by four esteemed [[Singapore]]an artists/designers of various art practices: Alvin Tan, Melvin Chee, Jackson Tan, and William Chan, who met as fellow design students at [[LASALLE College of the Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/interviews/phunk Computer Arts Magazine Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== Style ==
Unlike other contemporary collectives or artists, PHUNK prides itself in blurring the lines between creative processes in their works of fine art and commercial design. Strongly believing in not differentiating between art and design, PHUNK explores, expresses and communicates its ideas through different mediums. With their multitude of projects, exhibitions, and collaborations spanning across art, design, publishing, fashion, music, film and interactive art pieces, they more often than not also intentionally blur the lines and challenge conventional boundaries that separate art and design, creativity and commerce, craft and technology, east and west, fantasy and reality, control and chaos, love and hate, friendship and partnership, and audio and visual works. PHUNK designs and artworks always been greatly influenced by popular culture. The artists believe that popular culture influences and informs consumers daily and has its own unique and comprehensive visual language and iconography. Utilising popular culture's ever-evolving series of metaphors, codes, symbols and icons that are widely recognised and embraced by the masses, PHUNK prides itself in experimenting with contexts and visual symbols in their works to create a unique visual language and system.

PHUNK's main access of inspiration and outlet of work is through visuals, information and cultural influences within our their collective interests and backgrounds. As kids, the artists started out as avid collectors and junkies of popular culture paraphernalia, the influences of which have since been a recurring theme in their work. Always returning to and remembering their roots, the artists were born in the '70s, the golden era of television, movies and pop culture. Even in their current works, allusions to influences  kids, they grew up having grown up watching plenty of film and television, including popular Hong Kong kung fu movies, Cantonese TV series, Japanese cartoon animes, and American TV programmes. It was also the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster era. They also read a lot of comic books ranging from Japanese manga, and American Superhero comics from DC and Marvel. As teenagers in the '80s, they were fascinated by British indie pop and new wave music, as well as American rock music and MTV. Upon entering art college in the '90s, they were heavily influenced by various art and design movements such as the Bauhaus, Fluxus, Situationism, Pop Art, Swiss Modernist and Postmodernist design. Nowadays, they are influenced and informed by travels to different parts of the world and meeting fellow creatives who share their interests and love for everything pop culture.

&lt;br /&gt;

== History ==
PHUNK was founded in 1994 but first and foremost born of friendship and common loves. Alvin, Melvin, Jackson, and William met as fellow design students studying Visual Communications at [[LASALLE College of the Arts]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Singapore. 

In 1995 to 1997, the artists served their time doing [[National service in Singapore|National Service]]. The four served the mandatory two years as full-time Military Policemen under the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. It was also during these years that they found time to experiment, jam, and create visual works in Jack's home over the weekends. Having realised they shared many common interests, ranging from old Hong Kong kungfu TV serials, Chinese mythology and Japanese manga, to British indie music, American pop culture, pretty girls, alcohol, and parties, the group started out trying to start a band. Their musical ventures were discontinued shortly after, but soon other modes of artistic expressions were born. The artists then proceeded to create visuals and graphics on the iMac in Jackson’s bedroom and sent these graphics out to friends and family. It was in these years too that they founded 'Guerilla Fonts' to create original digital typeface designs. These typeface designs were then sent to David Carson's [http://www.garagefonts.com/ Garage Fonts], Del Mar, California. Shortly after, in 1998 Garage Fonts officially distributed Guerilla Fonts' original typeface designs worldwide. PHUNK was then invited to write the introduction for the book, 'New Typographics 2', published by Japanese publishers, PIE books. Thereafter, the artists founded and launched 'Trigger' Magazine, of which 20,000 copies snapped out within a week. PHUNK also begun organising themed parties with Zouk, and the launch of ‘Trigger’ was cited as one of the top 10 Zouk parties of all time. PHUNK started long-standing working relationship with MTV Asia in 1999, and many of their works went on to win awards in various award shows. In the design sphere, PHUNK also created Phiz dingbats, marking the start of the collective's unique illustration style.

2000 marked the start of a series of milestones for PHUNK. PHUNK has bagged numerous design awards and recognitions both locally and internationally such as: Finalist, Macromedia International Type Design (1998), Finalist, Apple Design Competition (1998), Selected, American Center of Design - The 100 Show (2000), Finalist, D&amp;AD (2001), Finalist, One Show (2001), Finalist, Creative Circle Awards (2002), Merit, Singapore Design Awards (2002), Best of Show, Singapore Design Awards (2004), Best Visual Arts &amp; Best Of Show, Singapore StreetStyle Awards (2005). PHUNK has repeatedly been awarded by PROMAX ASIA, emerging with Gold and Silver medals in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. PHUNK was also awarded the ‘Designer of the Year’ at the President’s Design Awards 2017 in Singapore, making history as the youngest ever recipient of the award, the highest Singapore design accolade that can be attained. 

2011 marked a new era for the collective after a disastrous fire occurred during the moving of PHUNK's studio from Lasalle to Tanjong Katong destroyed everything in the studio. Initially identified as ':phunk', or 'Phunk Studio', the collective then officially changed its name to what we now still know as 'PHUNK'.

The collective subsequently went on to participate in various art shows locally, regionally, and internationally, as well as make their mark in the international design community through various collaborations and art shows.
&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16000">'''Post-postmodernism''' is a wide-ranging set of developments in [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[culture]] which are emerging from and reacting to [[postmodernism]]. Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].

==Periodization==
Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sadie Liza Frost''' (born 19 June 1965){{cn|date=October 2018}} is an English actress, producer and fashion designer, who ran fashion label [[Frost French]] (until its closure in 2011) and a film production company (Blonde to Black Pictures).

==Early life==
Frost was born in [[Islington]], north London, to [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] artist [[David Vaughan (artist)|David Vaughan]], who worked for [[the Beatles]], and his then-16-year-old muse, actress Mary Davidson.&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article2245713.ece Survivor: Sadie Frost] Sunday Times – 19 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

She has described her childhood as a "chaotic but positive experience,"&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; as she was born in [[Islington]] but spent much of her youth in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Lancashire]], after her parents separated. Her parents had six relationships between them, which gave her four sisters and five brothers, including fellow actresses [[Holly Davidson]] and Jade Davidson; primary school teacher Jessi Frost, brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet.&lt;ref name="Brant"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_n5_v25/ai_16869723 Frost's bite – interview with actress Sadie Frost] 1995 Brant Publications, Inc.  {{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2015}}
Frost appeared in a [[Jelly Tots]] advertisement in 1968 at age three and appeared with [[Morecambe and Wise]] in 1970 at age five. She attained a scholarship to the [[Italia Conti Academy]],&lt;ref name="Brant"/&gt; but after an early [[eating disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/Sadie+Frost-16212.html Sadie Frost Admits To Eating Disorder] Tatler/Femaleifrst.co.uk – 7 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; she gave up acting at 13 and attended [[Hampstead School]] instead.&lt;ref name="GardFilm"&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,68709,00.html The questionnaire: Sadie Frost] ''The Guardian'' – 20 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On graduation{{when|date=January 2015}}, she left home to escape her parents, and in 1984, at age 19, she appeared in the play ''Mumbo Jumbo'' at the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]], Manchester, directed by [[Nicholas Hytner]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As an actress, Frost has performed in ''[[Press Gang]]'' and ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000206/ai_n14287713 Why are they famous: Sadie Frost] ''The Independent'' – 6 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film role was in ''[[Empire State (1987 film)|Empire State]]'' (1987), although her most memorable{{opinion|date=January 2015}} film appearance is as [[vampire]] [[Lucy Westenra]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). She earned her living mainly through appearing in music videos, including for [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s song "[[Common People (song)|Common People]]", [[Planet Perfecto]] featuring [[Grace (band)|Grace]]'s "Not Over Yet '99", and various productions for [[Spandau Ballet]], where she met first husband [[Gary Kemp]]. Frost and Kemp appeared together in the film ''[[The Krays (film)|The Krays]]'' (1990). They appeared in two more films together. One of these films, ''[[Magic Hunter]]'' (1994), required them to participate in a love scene, although they were separated at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Frost took a role opposite [[Jude Law]] in [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s directorial debut ''[[Shopping (1994 film)|Shopping]]''. After marrying Law and having three children with him, she cut down on her acting commitments in the late 1990s, and moved into producing and co-founding the production company [[Natural Nylon]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1999, Frost co-founded the fashion label [[Frost French]] with her friend Jemima French. The label started in lingerie and expanded into clothing collections. Frost French won ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''{{'}}s Designers of the Year Award 2004. In 2004, she wrote, presented, and produced a short-lived series ''What Sadie did next...'' for [[E4 (channel)|E4]], and in 2005 appeared in ''Eating with...Sadie Frost'' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. In March 2006, Frost flew to South Africa to part-fund an orphanage for the ''Homes of Hope'' project. In September 2006, aged 41, she posed nude for Canadian photographer [[Bryan Adams]] for a [[PETA]] anti-fur advert to coincide with [[London Fashion Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.peta.org.uk/media/news-releases/sadie-frosts-naked-ambition-for-animals/ |title=Sadie Frost’S Naked Ambition For Animals |last= |first= |date=19 September 2006 |website=PETA UK |publisher= |access-date=10 February 2018 |quote=Sadie Unveils Sexy Ad Shot By Bryan Adams  During London Fashion Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she made her [[West End Theatre|West End]] debut in ''Touched ...

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' ({{lang-de|Der heilige Hieronymus im Gehäus}}) is an [[engraving]] of 1514 by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Saint [[Jerome]] is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the [[Renaissance]]. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the [[Resurrection]]. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional [[iconography]] of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (c. 1260), which contained fanciful [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of saints.

''St. Jerome in His Study'' is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings, the other two being the well-known ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514) and  ''[[Knight, Death and the Devil]]'' (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: ''Knight, Death, and the Devil'' belongs to the moral sphere and the "active life"; ''Melencolia I'' represents the intellectual; and ''St. Jerome'' the theological and contemplative life.

The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: "the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation" (94).  Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] comments on the perspective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jonah and the gourd vine==
Using a dried [[gourd]] hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's [[courage]], in the face of a long brewing [[Philology|philological]] controversy&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Parshall, "Albrecht Dürer's Saint Jerome in his Study: A Philological Reference," The Art Bulletin 53 (September 1971), pp. 303-5, [http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/DurerSt.Jerome.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[St. Augustine]] in his preference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon004.htm Chapter 4 of the Book of Jonah in concurrent Greek:English:Latin versions&lt;/ref&gt; for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the [[Book of Jonah]]. The [[Old Testament]] text closes abruptly ({{bibleverse|Jonah||4}}) with an epistolary warning&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia article titled '''Jonah''' http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[emblem]]atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of [[Aesop's fables]] such as [[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]. Jerome elected to use '''[[Hedera]]''' (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin '''[[cucurbita]]''' from which the related English plant name ''cucumber'' is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [[:it:File:Christ the True Vine icon (Athens, 16th century).jpg|''"I am the Vine you are the branches"'']]. In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.

'''''Supervising Women Workers''''' was a short social guidance film produced by the [[United States|US]] [[Office of Education]] and aimed at male foremen who now had to supervise women for war work.

The film depicts the social and gender relations and attitudes of its time. It notes that most of the women had never been in industry before, and were unfamiliar with the terminology and mores common to the plant. Each thing had to be broken down and explained in detail. The film also reminds men that women of the day have been at work in things like knitting and sewing, and that these skills could be appropriated for war work. In a short vignette the foreman returns home to his wife, complaining about all the women asking for time off. His wife then tells him she had to cook, clean, and take care of the children all day, at which point the foreman realizes that women really work two jobs, one in the factory and the other at home.

In another vignette a foremen gets into an argument about a woman not wearing a protective hat, and it is shown that he has to explain to her why the protective cap was necessary. Finally, there are four basic rules to supervising women workers:
*don't mix business with pleasure
*remember that women are awfully jealous of each other
*avoid undue familiarity
*women are more sensitive than men.

'''Maqasid al Falasifa''' ({{Lang-ar|مقاصد الفلاسفة}}), or '''The Aims of the Philosophers''' was written by [[Al-Ghazali]]. Influenced by [[Avicenna|Avicenna's]] works, he wrote this book presenting the basic theories of [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=maqasid+al+falasifah+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hg9oRLD9A3&amp;sig=Xbq0bqiYscPNaL-prFIi8Vzd7uQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyn-Dx1ILZAhVEYVAKHcmsDngQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=maqasid+al+falasifah+encyclopedia&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|first1=Mark|last1=Juergensmeyer|first2=Wade Clark|last2=Roof|date=31 January 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, he explained in detail about what philosophy is and described basic entities like [[judgement]], [[concept]], [[premise]], and [[logic]]. Al-Ghazali stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas. He also stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including [[physics]], [[logic]], [[astronomy]] or [[mathematics]] problematic.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghazali.org/books/chertoff.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Al|title=The Incoherence of the Philosophers|year=2000|publisher=Brigham Young UP|isbn=0-8425-2466-5 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After writing ''Maqasid al Falasifa'', he wrote another book [[The Incoherence of Philosophers|Tahāfut al-Falāsifa]], criticizing the Avicennian school of [[early Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-i|title=AVICENNA i.

'''Østofte Church''', located in the village of [[Nørreballe]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]], was built in the 14th century.  The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] apse, chancel and nave formed the original building while the tower and porch were added in the [[Gothic architecture|Late-Gothic]] period and the north wing was completed in 1656.&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Oestofte_kirke/oestofte_kirke.htm "Østofte Church"], ''Nordens kirker''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church was dedicated to [[St Peter]], probably in 1345. King [[Christopher of Bavaria]] transferred ownership to [[Maribo Abbey]] as first documented in 1451. That ownership remained after the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] when Maribo became a convent for women. After a period of ownership by [[Christian IV]]'s [[Sorø Academy]] until its closure in 1665, the church came under the Crown until 1687. It was then transferred to Eggert Christopher von Knuth (1643-1697). As a result, it came under the County of [[Knuthenborg]] on its formation in 1714 where it remained until it became independent in 1911. In 1881, Bandholm Parish was separated from Østofte after a new church was built in [[Bandholm]].&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0848-0867.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Østofte Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 848-867. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiskatlas.dk/Østofte_kirke_(5952) "Østofte kirke"], ''Historisk Atlas". {{da icon}} Retrieved 1 July 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[apse]], [[chancel]] and [[nave]] of this red-brick church were built in the Romanesque period, while the tower with its pyramidal spire and the porch were added at the beginning of the 15th century in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. The north wing was completed in 1656. The Romanesque sections are decorated with corner [[lesene]]s and are topped with saw-tooth friezes. The round-arched windows have either been enlarged or bricked in. Thin vertical blank windows decorate the top of the tower.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

==Interior and fittings==

In the 14th century, star-shaped vaults were completed in the chancel and nave while the apse retained its half dome. The [[altarpiece]], dated 1674, is rather unsophisticated baroque although the scenes in the central panel of the Last Supper and the Resurrection are somewhat earlier. The [[pulpit]] in the [[auricular style]] (c. 1650) presents cartouches of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Faith, Hope and Charity]].&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

Investigations in 1908 revealed frescos in the chancel and apsis from two periods, c. 1300 and c. 1400. The latter are mostly well preserved with scenes from the Creation including images of Adam and Eve, the Judgment of Christ as well as several dragons.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;
