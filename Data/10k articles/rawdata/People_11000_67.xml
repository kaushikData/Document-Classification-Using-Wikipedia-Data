'''Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru t͡siˈɡara samurˈkaʃ}}; also known as '''Al. Tzigara''', '''Tzigara-Sumurcaș''', '''Tzigara-Samurcash''', '''Tzigara-Samurkasch''' or '''Țigara-Samurcaș'''; April 4, 1872 – April 1, 1952) was a [[Romania]]n art historian, [[Ethnography|ethnographer]], [[Museology|museologist]] and cultural journalist, also known as local champion of [[art conservation]], [[Romanian Police]] leader and pioneer radio broadcaster. Tzigara was a member of the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, holding positions at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], the [[University of Bucharest]] and lastly the [[Chernivtsi University|University of Cernăuți]]. During his youth, he was secretary to [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], the [[King of Romania]]. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the [[Fundațiile Regale|Carol I Academic Foundation]], where he set up a large collection of [[photographic plate]]s. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the "National Museum", nucleus of the present-day [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], but was also involved in arranging and preserving the [[Theodor Aman]] art fund.

During [[World War I]], Tzigara-Samurcaș irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the [[Central Powers]]. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of [[collaborationism]] from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the [[interwar period]], but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several [[World's fair|world fairs]], the first-ever lecturer on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Romania]]'s staff, the editor in chief of ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy|Academy]]. His post-[[World War II]] years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]].

Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was alleged to be Carol I's illegitimate son, a rumor fueled by his closeness to court. He was himself the father of artist [[Ana Tzigara Berza]], and father in law of folklorist [[Marcu Berza]].

==Biography==

===Origins and early life===
A native of [[Bucharest]], Tzigara-Samurcaș was born on {{OldStyleDate|April 4|1872|March 23}},&lt;ref name="culturatzs"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/01/intre-orient-si-occident-%E2%80%93-arhiva-de-imagine-alexandru-tzigara-samurcas/ "Între Orient și Occident – Arhiva de imagine Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș"], in ''Cultura'', March 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Plămădeală]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23503 "''Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 519, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and baptized into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="abmoartea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Barnea, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/moartea-lui-carol-i-2874073/ "Moartea lui Carol I"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A popular rumor has him as the illegitimate son of ''[[Domnitor]]'' Carol I, the future King of Romania, to whom Tzigara was especially close in later years.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/mrturisirile_lui_tzigara-samurca "Mărturisirile lui Tzigara-Samurcaș"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vdcurtea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Docea, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna41.pdf "La curtea iubirilor reprimate"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 41/2004, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.327; Nastasă (2010), p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lucian Boia]] gives some credit to this piece of oral history, and notes that Tzigara, like [[Wilhelm Kremnitz|Wilhelm]] and [[Mite Kremnitz]], had "an unusually tight relationship" with the royal family.&lt;ref name="lb327"&gt;Boia, p.327&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Zigu Ornea]], who notes that Tzigara may have been spreading the story around, argues: "This legend is naturally hard to verify but, in any case, it is a possible one, since Tzigara-Samurcaș was born in 1872 and Carol I was present on our throne, as ''Domnitor'', from 1866."&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; Like Boia, Ornea notes that Tzigara's close relationship with the king, the king's repeated interventions on his behalf "every time [Tzigara's career] got stuck", and his contacts with the Kremnitzes (including Mite, Carol's alleged mistress) were some additional clues to a royal bloodline.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; Historian [[Vasile Docea]] criticizes Ornea's verdict, noting that it relies on questionable sources, and argues that, far from embracing this legend, Tzigara spoke "with evident pride" about his Tzigara roots.&lt;ref name="vdcurtea"/&gt; According to historian Lucian Nastasă, Docea effectively "disproved" the rumor of Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș{{'}}s royal descent.&lt;ref name="ln(10)89"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandru's mother and Carol's alleged mistress was Elena Samurcaș, married to Toma Tzigara.&lt;ref name="vdcurtea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ln(10)89"/&gt; Research into his maternal genealogy led the art historian to conclude that he was of noble [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Greeks in Italy|Italo-Greek]] descent: his supposed ancestor was ''[[Spatharios]]'' [[Zotos Tzigaras]], buried in [[Venice]] at [[San Giorgio dei Greci]] (1599).&lt;ref name="msr343-344"&gt;Rădulescu (2000), p.343-344&lt;/ref&gt; The Samurcaș family had aristocratic blood, being related to the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]] of [[Wallachia]]: the art historian's paternal line made him a relative of the Kretzulescu, Rallet, Bengescu and Crețeanu boyar families.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.162; (2010), p.89, 331&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tzigara-Samurcaș, combined arms.svg|thumb|240px|Combined arms of the Tzigara and Samurcaș families]]
Also of boyar rank, Alexandru's Samurcaș ancestors had a history on both sides of the [[Southern Carpathians]], in Wallachia and in then-[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]]. Active during the [[Age of Revolution]], Wallachian ''[[Vornic]]'' Constantin Samurcaș took part in [[Filiki Eteria|Eterist agitation]],&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu (2000), p.350&lt;/ref&gt; but later, fleeing the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 rural uprising]], settled in [[Brașov|Kronstadt (Brașov)]] to spy for the Austrians.&lt;ref name="dhradio"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Hîncu, [http://www.romlit.ro/al._tzigara-samurca_-_din_amintirile_primului_vorbitor_la_radio_romnesc "Al. Tzigara-Samurcaș - Din amintirile primului vorbitor la Radio românesc"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309113354/http://www.romlit.ro/al._tzigara-samurca_-_din_amintirile_primului_vorbitor_la_radio_romnesc |date=2014-03-09 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another ancestor, ''[[Postelnic]]'' Alecu Samurcaș, was a linguist, known for his work in the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.90&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting of two branches was recorded in the [[coat of arms]] that Tzigara-Samurcaș fashioned for himself, showing the ''[[spatha]]'' of Zotos Tzigaras, alongside a [[sable]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''samur'') and a stylized eyebrow.&lt;ref name="msr343-344"/&gt;

A while after Toma Tzigara's death, Alexandru was adopted by his childless uncle Ioan Alecu Samurcaș (he officially took the name ''Tzigara-Samurcaș'' years later, in 1899); he was also helped with his education by the Kremnitzes, who taught him [[German language|German]], introduced him to high society circles, and regarded him as a son.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.89-90, 347&lt;/ref&gt; His first contacts with history and folk art came by means of his extended family, which collected and preserved documents and art objects.&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu (2000), p.344&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from the [[Matei Basarab High School]] and taking his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]], he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; It was here that the young man was acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector [[Alexandru Odobescu]] and archeologist [[Grigore Tocilescu]], the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; He was a critic of the museum's underdevelopment under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|Egyptian mummy]], copies of frescoes from the [[Curtea de Argeș Cathedral|Cathedral Church]] in [[Curtea de Argeș]], items from the [[Pietroasele Treasure]], and works of [[Precolumbian art]], alongside a scale model of the [[Eiffel Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/ieri-cu-vedere-spre-azi/articol/casa-macca "Casa Macca"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 265, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1893,&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.327. See also ''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.265&lt;/ref&gt; the young graduate was in the [[German Empire]], where he studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University]], taking his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Munich]] with a dissertation on the [[Baroque painting|Baroque painter]] [[Simon Vouet]].&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; He received his diploma, ''[[magna cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="luc265"&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.265&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara-Samurcaș returned to his home country and, following a dispute with Tocilescu, gave up his position at the Antiquities Museum.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; He later specialized in museology in [[Paris]], hearing lectures at the ''[[École des Beaux-Arts]]'' and working for city museums,&lt;ref name="luc265"/&gt; before returning to Germany, where he studied with the preeminent [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswickian]] curator [[Wilhelm von Bode]].&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;

===Early academic career===
[[File:Palatul Fundatiei Universitare (Biblioteca Centrala Universitara).jpg|thumb|300px|Palace of the [[Fundațiile Regale|Carol I Academic Foundation]], ca. 1904 (photograph by Alexandru Antoniu)]]
Back in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully applied for the Archeology Chair created at the [[University of Iași]], but lost; according to scholar and diarist [[Teohari Antonescu]], who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara "had the good sense to come prepared."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.372&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899, he was librarian of the [[Fundațiile Regale|Carol I Academic Foundation]] and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.265-266; Boia, p.327&lt;/ref&gt; As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through a relationship with the Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called "my most generous protector" and "the sovereign ''[[Wiktionary:par excellence|par excellence]]''".&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen Consort]] and cultural patron, [[Elisabeth of Wied]], whom he called "the animator of [[Art of Romania|Romanian art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ciupală, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the ''Carmen Sylva'' signature.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.162-163&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in [[spiritism]] or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

In order to support his lectures at the Fine Arts School, Tzigara began gathering [[photographic plate]]s, a collection which grew in size over the following decades. It includes images of European monuments and works of art, as well as samples of [[Architecture of Romania|Romanian architecture]] (in some cases, the only surviving images of since-demolished buildings) and copies of maps.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; The images of local life are considered of particular importance, since they document the [[Westernization]] and [[modernization]] of Romania's landscape.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt; Mostly anonymous works, they most likely include some of Tzigara's own photographs.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; A few of them were inventoried by [[Editura Casa Școalelor]], and some were published, in Tzigara's lifetime, by ''Buletinul Comisiunii Monumentelor Istorice'' or other Romanian scientific magazines.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; His [[Image projector|image projections]] at the Carol I Foundation, supporting a students' elective course on sculpture and painting, became one of the better-known student summer activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/ieri-cu-vedere-spre-azi/articol/amintirile-unui-arhitect "Amintirile unui arhitect"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 216, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The young scholar was at the time also interested in the development of [[decorative arts]], which he wanted to reflect the local tradition of [[handicraft]]s and notions of national specificity.&lt;ref name="iv51"&gt;Vlasiu, p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian Ioana Vlasiu, Tzigara and painter-researcher [[Abgar Baltazar]] were in part responsible for fusing local folk art and international [[primitivism]] with [[Art Nouveau]], thus paving the way for the ''[[Neo-Brâncovenesc]]'' school of decorators and architects.&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in decorative works was a special focus of his visits to [[England]] and [[France]]—the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] impressed him greatly, as did the workshops of [[Eugène Grasset]] and [[Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]].&lt;ref name="iv51"/&gt;

===''Junimea'' debut===
Described by Lucian Nastasă as a case of social climbing, Tzigara's marriage to Maria (1900) brought him into the high circles of aristocracy: Maria, born into the [[Cantacuzino family]] (daughter of [[Alexandru Cantacuzino]], former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs Minister]]), was also the widow of [[Grigore Sturdza]], and as such inherited part of the [[Sturdza family]] fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.53-54, 109; (2007), p.162-163; (2010), p.90, 168, 347&lt;/ref&gt; Through her mother Coralia, Maria Tzigara-Cantacuzino was additionally related to [[boyar]] lines of [[Moldavia]], the Boldurs and the Costakis, as well as to Zulnia, mother of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.54, 71; (2010), p.90, 168, 331&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage was reportedly arranged by the Kremnitzes, the couple having as their best men-[[Godparent|godfathers]] two influential political figures: [[Lupu Kostaki]], [[Constantin C. Arion]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.90, 111, 346-347&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period, Tzigara-Samurcașș also began a cooperation with ''Junimea'', the literary society representing Romanian [[traditional conservatism]], and sympathized with the ''Junimist'' nucleus of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]]. The art historian was one of the young scholars fascinated with the personality of [[Titu Maiorescu]], the cultural critic and main ''Junimea'' leader, and joined a new ''Junimist'' critical elite which also comprised [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Pompiliu Eliade]], [[Mihail Dragomirescu]], [[P. P. Negulescu]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.151-152; (2007), p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; His work was featured, along with texts by other 50 ''Junimists'', in the [[Editura Socec]] volume ''Lui Titu Maiorescu omagiu, XV februarie MCM'' ("To Titu Maiorescu as Homage, February 15, 1900").&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.151-152&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu's diaries display his interest in Tzigara's private life, and claim that the scholar was by then lover of the widowed and much older [[Mite Kremnitz]], with whom Maiorescu himself had had an affair.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

Tzigara attended, in 1901, a major event in ''Junimist'' society: the wedding between Nicolae Iorga and Ecaterina, daughter of scholar [[Ioan Bogdan]], where Tzigara unofficially represented the royal court.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.39, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara was the couple's godfather at an [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] marriage service held outside the [[Kingdom of Romania]], in [[Șcheii Brașovului|Belgerei (Șcheii Brașovului)]], Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.71; (2007), p.323; (2010), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Iorga and Bogdan were both interested in obtaining Tzigara a better employment at the University of Bucharest, but their efforts were made useless by the ''Junimea'' adversary in government, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.321-323&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1903, Tzigara became a literary and art columnist at ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'' newspaper, headed at the time by Maiorescu.&lt;ref name="zo(98)122"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.122&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, ''Junimea'' popularized its causes through ''Epoca'', rather than through their main venue ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', and, according to Maiorescu's own pronouncement, Tzigara's work was a main asset.&lt;ref name="zo(98)122"/&gt; Around 1907, Tzigara's work was also regularly featured in ''Convorbiri Literare'', edited by Maiorescu's pupil [[Simion Mehedinți]]. At the time, Transylvania's ''Răvașul'' journal commented that Tzigara's art chronicle and [[Aurel Popovici]]'s political column were especially "rich" in information, and mentioned that Tzigara and Teohari Antonescu were debating, through the journal, about the characteristics of fortified houses (''cule'') from [[Oltenia]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/revasul/1907/BCUCLUJ_FP_279662_1907_005_021_022.pdf "Cărți, reviste, ziare"], in ''Răvașul'', Nr. 21-22/1907, p.382 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; As literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes, Tzigara-Samurcaș and architect [[Aurel Zagoritz]] centered their contributions here on the scientific study of [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folk art]], but their presence nevertheless coincided with ''Convorbiri Literare''{{'}}s decline in readership.&lt;ref name="tv11"&gt;[[Tudor Vianu]], ''Scriitori români'', Vol. II, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1970, p.11. {{OCLC|7431692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara also published his articles in Iorga's traditionalist magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', where he discussed the art exhibits of the ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' society.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1901, inspired by the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World Fair]], Tzigara and other Romanian ethnographers first took into consideration the establishment of a permanent ethnographic collection.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet, p.144; Vlasiu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Romanian intellectuals, Tzigara preserved his special interest in handicrafts, which, art conservator Isabelle Longuet argues, were "elevated to the status of 'national art' " in the belief that the peasantry represented "an authentic 'Romanianness' ".&lt;ref name="il144"&gt;Longuet, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; In similar terms, ethologist Ioana Popescu notes: "[Tzigara's] collections were to become the argument and the source of inspiration for the national ideology and creation."&lt;ref name="ipfragile"&gt;Ioana Popescu, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_a-fragile-collection-the-memory-of-glass-plates.html "A Fragile Collection - The Memory of Glass Plates"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 21/2004&lt;/ref&gt; His project came after a similar attempt on the part of art collector [[Nicolae Minovici]], founder of the private folk art museum ''[[Nicolae Minovici folk Art Museum|Casa Minovici]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Adina Dinițoiu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Vila-cu-clopotei-are-noi-prieteni*articleID_15315-articles_details.html " 'Vila cu clopoței are noi prieteni' "], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 319, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and an even earlier textile art archive, endorsed by Maiorescu (1875).&lt;ref name="ndiurban"&gt;Narcis Dorin Ion, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_urban-memory-museums-of-the-romanian-capital.html "Urban Memory: Museums of the Romanian Capital"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 32/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

1906 marked the start of Tzigara's chief work as an ethnographer. That year, he founded the "Museum of Ethnography and National Art", now [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]] (and which he intended to name "Museum of the Romanian People"),&lt;ref&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.60. On the other proposed names, see Vlasiu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Director for the next forty years. This project received support from Education Minister Haret and, on the other side of politics, from Haret's predecessor Maiorescu.&lt;ref name="ndiurban"/&gt; The institution was later known as "Museum of Ethnography and National Art" or "Carol I Museum of Ethnography and National Art".&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="il144"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abmeteor"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Barnea, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/meteorologie-si-etnografie-in-bucuresti-acum-99-de-ani-2876964 "Meteorologie și etnografie în București, acum 99 de ani"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Its original quarters were the abandoned National Mint building on [[Șoseaua Kiseleff|Kiseleff Road]], but plans were being made for a new, more adequate museum palace.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt;

As manager, Tzigara-Samurcaș ordered the collection into two distinct sections, dedicated respectively to ethnography-proper and [[sacred art]] (the latter chapter also took over the religious objects kept at the National Museum of Antiquities).&lt;ref name="il144"/&gt; An additional exhibit was to include the ''[[Tropaeum Traiani]]'' [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], attesting the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule over [[Dobruja]].&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; Tzigara's subsequent work as a collector and folk art historian received much appreciation. A 1914 article in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' journal stated: "[He] reorganized [the museum] and turned into a true national institution. The Museum's rich collections are owed to Mr. Tzigara-Samurcaș's industriousness."&lt;ref name="luc266"&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.266&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, folk art reviewer [[Mihai Plămădeală]] wrote that Tzigara's activity "impacted on everything that this Museum ever meant in the history of [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]]."&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt;

Tzigara's fieldwork also focused specifically on increasing the museum's ethnographic collection. Particularly active in Oltenia, he was, as Ioana Popescu notes, "more attracted by decorated, colorful objects, used at celebration time."&lt;ref name="ipfragile"/&gt; During one such trip to [[Gorj County]], he bought, disassembled and transported back to Bucharest the "Antonie Mogoș House", considered a masterpiece of Romanian woodcarving and the museum's centerpiece.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmetnogf"&gt;{{ro icon}} Miron Manega, [http://www.sfin.ro/articol_4743/stiri_pe_scurt.html "Etnografia românească în epoca de piață"], in ''[[Săptămâna Financiară]]'', April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first-ever such relocation in the history of Romanian museums.&lt;ref name="mmetnogf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgeta Stoica, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_a-landmark-on-the-european-map-the-dimitrie-gusti-national-village-museum.html "A Landmark on the European Map: the Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 24/2004&lt;/ref&gt; His photographic collection was expanded by an entire series on Oltenian carpets, which helps in their specific [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="ipfragile"/&gt;

The developments raised interest among the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] community of Transylvania, whose cultural body, the [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]], was in the process of creating its own permanent exhibit of folk architecture, later [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]]. ASTRA activist [[Octavian Tăslăuanu]] reported in 1909: "[Tzigara's] national art museum, although [...] important sums were spent on it, is at the early stage of its beginnings. Only two years ago did more systematic work begin for its endowment and presently, its national significance recognized, the state granted it a yearly sum of 14,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] [...]. And maybe in a few years those who are running it, so diligently, will manage to turn it into an institution of great importance for our national art."&lt;ref&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Tzigara himself wrote, in ''Convorbiri Literare'', that Tăslăuanu's work with ASTRA permanent exhibits was far more advanced than his when it came to storage and display, but noted that the ASTRA collections were not yet rich enough to validate the "museum" name.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1910/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1910_041_005.pdf "Însemnări.

===Aman Museum and Bucharest University===
[[File:Theodor Aman - In atelierul artistului.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Theodor Aman]], ''În atelierul artistului'' ("In the Artist's Studio")]]
During those years, Tzigara was also an inspector and evaluator of works collected from [[Secu Monastery]] and the [[Diocese of Buzău]], becoming both a Fellow of the Romanian Royal Society of Geography and the Architects' Society.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; Tzigara also served as representative of the Romanian curators in European colloquiums: the Public Art Congress of [[Liège]], [[Belgium]] (1905) and the [[Braunschweig]] Congress on Art Conservation (1906), where he presented a report on the efforts to preserve Romanian monuments.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Also in 1906, Tzigara-Samurcaș attended the 8th International Congress of Art History.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Once familiarized with the artistic fashions of the day, Tzigara reported to the National Liberal [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Spiru Haret]] about the need to reform the [[Education in Romania|educational system]] in such manner as to provide peasant children with an artistic education, citing reasons moral and economical.&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1908, Tzigara was also involved in the process of cataloging and preserving the body of works left by Romanian painter [[Theodor Aman]]. The Aman Museum appointed him director, and, under his leadership, opened its doors to the public for the very first time.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Tzigara was also involved in controversies marking the celebration of Carol I's 40th year on the throne, when he spoke out against politician [[Ioan Lahovary]], accused of mismanaging the [[Carol Park]] festivities.&lt;ref name="ln(07)37"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of a separate University of Bucharest Art History Department for Tzigara was a project which split the academic and political world. At the core of such disputes was Nicolae Iorga, from the History Department, who argued that his own courses also covered art, and who consequently became Tzigara's main adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.36-37, 323&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal of expanding University was also defeated in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] by Lahovary, the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] president, who probably still resented for his 1906 comments.&lt;ref name="ln(07)37"/&gt; The debates prolonged themselves over the following years. In 1909, Tzigara-Samurcaș, [[Grigore Tocilescu]] and [[George Murnu]] competed with each other for the Archeology Chair, and this created a dispute over whether art historians could not lecture in archeology (Murnu eventually won the contest, despite being exposed for [[plagiarism]] by Tzigara, in articles for the magazine ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.37, 310-311&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he was in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], where he visited the [[Skansen]], [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Bygdøy]] and [[Frilandsmuseet|Lyngby]] [[open-air museum]]s, but suggested that a similar project would be redundant at home, arguing that peasant society in Romania was only too visible around Bucharest.&lt;ref name="msrskansen"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/skansen_i_muzeele_etnografice_din_bucureti "Skansen și muzeele etnografice din București"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 36/2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was much more impressed with the [[Nordic Museum]], which reportedly became the template for his Bucharest museum.&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt;

In 1911 (or 1912), Tzigara eventually became a Substitute Professor of Art History at the University of Bucharest,&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.108, 327, 353; Nastasă (2007), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; attending the [[Great Berlin Art Exhibit|Great Art Exhibit]] of [[Berlin]] and, in [[Italy]], the ''[[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|Esposizione internazionale d'arte]]''.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; He lectured on folk art at the ''[[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]]'' and in [[Austria-Hungary]], at the [[Vienna]] ''[[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|Museum für angewandte Kunst]]''.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Overall, his mission was to introduce Romanian art to an international audience, as noted by ''Luceafărul'': "he arranged the Romanian pavilions, making known for the first time in history the artistic creations of our people. In all exhibits he registered successes".&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; A prestigious visitor of the National Museum was [[Raymund Netzhammer]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest|Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest]], who was introduced there by Tzigara, with whom he remained good friends.&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; Netzhammer was impressed with its ethnographic collection: "Nowhere can one acquire a better eye for Romanian folk art than in this establishment."&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt;

In support of his activities, Tzigara published a succession of art books. In 1906, ''Arta publică'' ("Public Art") appeared in Bucharest, while the [[German-language]] study ''Denkmalpflege in Rumänien'' ("Historical Preservation in Romania") saw print in [[Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Later, Tzigara contributed biographical and critical entries in the 1907 edition of ''[[Allgemeines Lexicon der Bildenden Kunstler|Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden Künstler]]''.&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; ''Catalogul Muzeului Aman'' ("The Aman Museum Catalog") of 1908 was followed the same year by the essay ''Ce se înțelege prin arheologia de azi'' ("The Present-day Meaning of Archeology") and the monograph ''Biserica din Filipeștii de Pădure'' ("The Church of [[Filipeștii de Pădure]]", co-authored with [[Nicolae Ghica-Budești]] and [[Gheorghe Balș]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.266, 268&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, he authored the album-study ''Arta în România'' ("Art in Romania"), comprising his collected ''Convorbiri'' essays and edited by [[Editura Minerva|Minerva]],&lt;ref name="goarta860"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Oprescu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1920/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1920_051_011.pdf "Arta țărănească la Români"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 11/1920, p.860 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; together with another monograph, ''Muzeul neamului românesc'' ("The Museum of the Romanian People").&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt;

The next year, he followed up with ''Discuțiuni în jurul arheologiei'' ("Debates on Archeology") and ''Rumänische Volkskunst'' ("Romanian Folk Art"); in 1911, with ''Casa românească de la Roma'' ("The [[Casa Romena|Romanian House]] of [[Rome]]"); in 1912, with ''Sonderaustellung Rumäniens'' ("Romania's Special Exhibit"), ''Istoria artei și însemnătatea ei'' (Art History and Its Significance"), ''Muzeul național din București'' ("The National Museum Bucharest").&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; Between 1909 and 1912, he also redacted Carol I's 17 volumes of memoirs, working from scattered notebooks.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; As an art critic for ''Epoca'' and ''Convorbiri'', Tzigara became one of those who opposed the new [[Primitivism|primitivist]] tendencies of the ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' group: in 1910, he chided the modern sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]] for his break with tradition, and even suggested that Brâncuși's works be hidden away from the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.78, 81&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions made Brâncuși decide to leave Romania and begin his international career.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Rome, Tzigara was reputedly offered membership in the [[Freemasonry]]'s [[Grand Orient de France]], to whom many of Romanian colleagues belonged (''see [[Freemasonry in Romania]]''). The offer, Tzigara later claimed, was made by sculptor [[Ettore Ferrari]], and included various perks and a promise that he would soon become a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Masonic Grand Master]].&lt;ref name="ln(07)102-103; (10)230"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.102-103; (2010), p.230&lt;/ref&gt; Although widely rumored to have taken up the offer, Nastasă writes, Tzigara was probably never a Freemason.&lt;ref name="ln(07)102-103; (10)230"/&gt; Also in 1911, he was briefly President of a newly created professional association, the [[Romanian Writers' Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.525&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910s projects and ASTRA conferencing===

Tzigara's honors for 1912 included the Romanian Kingdom's ''Bene Merenti'' medal for services to culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.134&lt;/ref&gt; During much of that year, after some campaigning to obtain state funds,&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; the art historian considered proposals for the Ethnography Museum's headquarters, also housed on Kiseleff. He and his colleagues looked into international proposals, from [[Heino Schmieden]], [[Louis Blanc (Swiss architect)|Louis Blanc]] and others, but eventually settled for a design proposed to them by the Romanian native Ghica-Budești.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; The Neo-Brâncovenesc features of the building, researchers note, where themselves an attempt to highlight the return to a peasant model.&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longuet, p.144, 146&lt;/ref&gt; This formed part of a greater [[urban planning]] effort undertaken, with Carol I's approval and the involvement of Neo-Brâncovenesc architects, throughout northern and central Bucharest, with the erecting of many new public buildings: the [[Palace of Justice (Bucharest)|Palace of Justice]], the [[CEC Palace]], the [[Geology Museum (Romania)|Geology Museum]] etc. (''see [[History of Bucharest]]'').&lt;ref name="apcaroli"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/ieri-cu-vedere-spre-azi/articol/tot-despre-carol-i "Tot despe Carol I"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 227, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the approval, and the ceremonial placement of a foundation stone,&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; construction was remarkably slow or under-financed, and Tzigara, who came to resent Ghica-Budești, did not live to see its completion.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt;

Tzigara's scientific work for 1913, when he also attended the ''[[Tentoonstelling De Vrouw 1813-1913|Tentoonstelling De Vrouw]]'' event in [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; includes a monograph on the [[Curtea de Argeș Cathedral|Curtea de Argeș Cathedral Church]].&lt;ref name="luc266"/&gt; That year, as Romania joined the [[Second Balkan War]] coalition against the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and although spared from [[conscription]], Tzigara volunteered for service in the [[Romanian Land Forces]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ln(07)91"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.91&lt;/ref&gt; He motivated this initiative by stating that his skill was needed for documenting the war and creating its archive.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; Tzigara served in the [[4th Infantry Division (Romania)|4th Army Corps]], under [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Crown Prince Ferdinand]] (Carol I's designated successor).&lt;ref name="ln(07)91"/&gt;

In 1914, Tzigara was appointed Director of the Carol I Foundation.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; At around the same time, he began a new series of conferences in Austria-Hungary, lecturing on art for the benefit of Romanians in Transylvania and [[Banat]] regions. He was also interested in the collection of Transylvanian Romanian artifacts, added to the Bucharest Museum collection.&lt;ref name="luc265"/&gt; Initially, he was in [[Lugoj|Lugosch (Lugoj)]], informing locals about Romanian folk art.&lt;ref name="luc265"/&gt; One other such event took place in [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt (Sibiu)]], where he was invited by ASTRA to speak about the 50 years of development in Romanian art.&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

This conference contained Tzigara' artistic credo: he believed that art was an objective reflection of social and cultural development, identifying the [[Westernization]] process, the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Romania|1881 Kingdom]] and later events with a profound transformation of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.266-267&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tzigara suggested, these efforts did not yet find a suitable answer in the artistic field, that is the birth of a specifically Romanian art phenomenon and the proper conservation of artistic legacies: he deplored the destruction of old Bucharest townhouses and their replacement with Westernized villas; he commended the restoration of [[Horezu Monastery]] in its original ''[[Brâncovenesc style|Brâncovenesc]]'' style, but criticized those who introduced [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] elements at [[Tismana Monastery|Tismana]], [[Bistrița Monastery|Bistrița]] or [[Arnota Monastery|Arnota]]; lastly, he expressed support for the "healthy" [[Neo-Brâncovenesc]] style of [[Ion Mincu]] and criticized muralist [[Octavian Smigelschi]] for his work on the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu|Sibiu Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.267-268&lt;/ref&gt; The conference included ample praise of Carol I as a patron of conservation, and nods in the direction of Carol's French architect, [[André Lecomte du Nouÿ]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.267, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Tzigara's Hermannstadt conference focused on the Romanian school of oil painting. He paid homage to its traditionalist founder, [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], and to Aman, before summarizing the later contributions of Ș[[Ștefan Luchian|tefan Luchian]], [[Arthur Verona]] and [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]].&lt;ref name="luc268"&gt;''Luceafărul'' (1914), p.268&lt;/ref&gt; The third part highlighted his own research of Transylvanian folk art, and spoke about Romania's Queen Elisabeth as a collector of folk art from Sibiu area.&lt;ref name="luc268"/&gt;

Tzigara preserved these principles during the rest of his professional life, and the themes of his conferencing resurface in his old age memoirs. These too shed light on Carol I's architectural role, and express approval for Lecomte de Nouÿ's since-criticized methods of conservation (including the decision to the tear down and rebuild Curtea de Argeș Cathedral).&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; They also return to Smigelschi's murals, criticizing his depiction of saints in [[Romanian dress|national Romanian dress]] as highly inappropriate.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

===World War I and Germanophilia===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R36187, Bukarest, Parade einziehender Truppen.jpg|thumb|350px|[[August von Mackensen]] reviewing [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] troops in occupied [[Bucharest]]]] 
Tzigara's international and scholarly activities suffered from the outbreak of [[World War I]] in summer 1914, even though Romania remained neutral until mid-1916. His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: "Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss".&lt;ref name="abmoartea"/&gt; By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. He found that Ferdinand was "gentle", "jocular" and usually self-effacing, "in all things the opposite of his uncle" Carol I.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciupală, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist]] sculptors [[Oscar Späthe]] and [[Friedrich Storck]] (whom, in 1903, he had called them "innovators of Romanian sculpture").&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Ferdinand and his [[Francophile]] circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the [[Entente Powers|Entente]] for the sake of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union with Transylvania]], Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the [[Germanophile]] lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, [[Constantin Litzica]].&lt;ref name="lb108"&gt;Boia, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romania in World War I|subsequent campaign]] ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the [[Central Powers]] (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to [[Iași]], they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lb327"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with [[August von Mackensen]], head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], [[Petre P. Carp]]. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple [[Lupu Kostaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.327; Ornea (1998), p.390-393&lt;/ref&gt; Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: "Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.393&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: "Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [Mackensen] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion S. Floru]], "Întâlniri cu Titu Maiorescu", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 1995, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|December 13|1916|November 30}}, the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's [[Interwar period|interwar]] career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved.&lt;ref name="lb327"/&gt; Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General [[Alexandru Mustață]], could not speak any [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lb327"/&gt; Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Education]] in spring 1917.&lt;ref name="lb108"/&gt; Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer [[I. A. Bassarabescu]] into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German [[internment]] and appointing him head of division.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher [[Mircea Florian]], who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

As recorded by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was open and cooperative in his relationship with the new authorities and the [[Regat Germans|German community]].&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]], who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the [[Curtea de Argeș Cathedral]], where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb.&lt;ref name="lb328"&gt;Boia, p.328&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private.&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby [[tie pin]].&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt;

Tzigara-Samurcaș nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Bucharest Royal Palace]] grounds.&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with [[Ioan Bianu]], a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] pressures on the [[Romanian Academy]] and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.175-176, 328&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.176, 328&lt;/ref&gt; Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, "the security of people and property", was competently met.&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: "the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue".&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 [[Athénée Palace]] gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet [[Luca Caragiale]], as the "nippers".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.203-204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborationism scandal and late 1920s===
In January 1918, while the Iași authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurcaș handed in his resignation to the Germans.&lt;ref name="lb327"/&gt; A [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace with the Central Powers]] followed: in March–April, the new [[national unity government]] of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918—that is, three days after the [[Armistice with Germany]] reshuffled Romania's commitments.&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;V. Liveanu, "Note și însemnări. Cu privire la evenimentele din 26(13) decembrie 1918", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1958, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania's sudden return to Francophilia had also brought Marghiloman's downfall, described by Tzigara as an anti-Conservative "''[[coup d'état]]''".&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; Zigu Ornea finds this expression of resentment especially problematic, since, he argued, it meant that Tzigara placed Germanopilia above the establishment of [[Greater Romania]]: "[he] understood next to nothing from the reality of the wartime political phenomenon."&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

The end of the war signified a slump in Tzigara's career. His imperial tie pin, Boia notes, became a "''[[corpus delicti]]''" for those accusing Tzigara of [[treason]].&lt;ref name="lb328"/&gt; Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector [[Ion Atanasiu]]'s essay ''Rătăciri naționale'' ("National Ravings", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own ''[[List of Latin phrases: P#pro domo|pro domo]]'', ''Mărturisiri silite'' ("Forced Confessions", 1920), and later by his posthumously published ''Memorii'' ("Memoirs").&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.328, 353&lt;/ref&gt; Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist [[Victor Babeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging "a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurcaș".&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

Tzigara was omitted from an early purge of University Germanophiles, but, on November 29, 1919, was subjected to questioning by Rector Atanasiu, Iorga and the Board of Professors. As he later recalled, his defense tactic was to recall that, back in 1906, Iorga himself was seen as a radical [[Francophobia|Francophobe]] (''see [[Sămănătorul]]'').&lt;ref name="lb353-354"&gt;Boia, p.353-354&lt;/ref&gt; On Iorga and Atanasiu's proposal, but against the advice of [[Ion Cantacuzino]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]], the Board took a vote to ban Tzigara-Samurcaș; the result was indecisive, and Tzigara preserved his chair.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.354, 355-356&lt;/ref&gt; Atanasiu however took the vote as evidence that Tzigara had lost his support, and requested a decision from higher authorities. As Boia notes, this was a political miscalculation: the anti-Germanophile lobby had been defeated in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] by [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], who could not be expected to grant Atanasiu a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.354-355&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Education Minister and zoologist [[Ioan Borcea]] sent a letter to Atanasiu, asking him to desist frustrating Tzigara "in his attributions without legal decision", adding: "Especially at this moment in time, we find it necessary that peace and harmony be restored for University to function properly."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.354&lt;/ref&gt; These and other moral defeats prompted Atanasiu to present his resignation, which came with his final protest that Minister Borcea had snubbed University during the "Tzigara-Samurcaș affair".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.355&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Tzigara took his main accusers, Iorga and journalist [[Stelian Popescu]], to court, in what became two celebrity trials.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;

As noted by literary critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: "Iorga is jealous that he sees you coming over to visit with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[G.

In 1923, he was the Inspector General of Museums, under the National Liberals' [[Ion I. C.

Despite his confirmation at the university, Tzigara-Samurcaș found it impossible to achieve [[tenure]],&lt;ref name="Boia, p.356"&gt;Boia, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; and was also ousted from the Fine Arts School over his Germanophilia.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; With the diplomatic recognition of Greater Romania came new opportunity, and, in 1926, Tzigara left for [[Bukovina]], taking over the art history department at [[Chernivtsi University|Cernăuți University]].&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.356; Nastasă (2007), p.297&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; Again touring Germany with a series of conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft|Radio Berlin]], making his debut in radio programming.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; Reportedly, his request of creating a special Romanian section on Berlin's [[Museum Island]] was granted by the [[Weimar Republic]] in early 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1927_004_003.pdf "Cronică măruntă"], in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 3/1927, p.33 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 1928, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș provided the first-ever [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Romania]] broadcast in history, with an art lecture specifically written for this purpose.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; This, Tzigara recalled, was a ''[[pro bono]]'' activity to please Radio Romania's president [[Constantin Angelescu]], but made the speaker himself very nervous: Tzigara thought his own text bland and his voice ill-adapted for the medium, but took pains to improve them in later broadcasts.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; In 1929, Tzigara was a first judge at the original [[Miss Romania]] beauty contest, in a panel which also included Vaida-Voevod, writers [[Liviu Rebreanu]] and [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]], woman activist [[Alexandrina Cantacuzino]] and other public figures.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana Zidărescu, [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/miss-romania-are-80-de-ani-840995.html "Miss România are 80 de ani"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', February 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian cabinets appointed him a national representative at the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|Universal Exposition]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and organizer of the folk art exhibit at the [[International Peace Bureau]]'s [[Balkans|Balkan]] Conference in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; He also attended the 13th International Congress of Art History in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], and organized the Romanian pavilion at an Art Conference in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; His efforts won international recognition, and the French state, through [[French Ambassador to Romania|Bucharest Ambassador]] [[Gabiel Puaux]], presented Tzigara with a gift of [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres porcelain]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; He was also awarded the [[Order of St. Sava]] by the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;

===1930s===
Tzigara's position was threatened in 1930, when Ferdinand's deposed son [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] retook his throne. It was alleged that Iorga, a supporter of the new king, asked for Tzigara to be removed from the royal Foundation, but that Carol had stated not being willing to sack "my own uncle."&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vdcurtea"/&gt; Iorga was however in a position to limit his rival's access to academia when, in 1931, he became Carol II's Prime Minister. His legislative proposal, limiting the number of academic positions an individual could hold, was probably aimed specifically at Tzigara and other personal enemies (as Lucian Nastasă writes, Iorga was himself collecting some five monthly salaries from his work with the state).&lt;ref name="ln(10)371"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, Tzigara became a contributor to the official literary and scientific magazine, ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.524&lt;/ref&gt; and again toured the country with lectures on folk art.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Grigore Bugarin, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1939_016_003.pdf "Stilul clădirilor publice"], in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 3/1939, p.103 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Simion Mehedinți]] and the ASTRA Society, he returned to the field of public activism with controversial lectures on the biology of the Romanian nation, which sometimes included overt advocacy of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Bucur]], ''Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania'', [[University of Pittsburgh Press]], Pittsburgh, 2002, p.33-34, 169. {{ISBN|0-8229-4172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialist]] theory had it that the [[geometric abstraction]] of peasant art, purported to have been strongly resistant to foreign influence, placed Romanians in the "[[Alpine race]]" cluster—an idea rejected in its day by anthropologist [[Henric Sanielevici]], who contrarily believed that Romanians were "[[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henric Sanielevici|H. Sanielevici]], "Supraviețuiri din mysterele&lt;!-- sic --&gt; dionysiace la ereticii din Basarabia", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11-12/1930, p.116-118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, he was briefly affiliated with the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|Romanian National Socialist Party]] and its "Romanian–German Cultural Institute".&lt;ref&gt;Mihai A. Panu, ''Capcanele ideologiei. Opțiuni politice ale etnicilor germani în România interbelică'', Editura Mega, Cluj-Napoca, 2015, p. 188.  {{ISBN|978-606-543-631-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving away from Germanophilia, Tzigara saluted the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels World Fair]] of 1935 by highlighting the special connection between Romania, on one hand, and, on the other France, [[Belgium]] and the Francophone countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.revista22.ro/imagini-si-identitate-nationala-piese-pentru-dosarul-unei-dezbateri-2150.html "Imagini și identitate națională: piese pentru dosarul unei dezbateri"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 816, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke on [[Radio France]] and the [[RTBF|INR]] (he found the [[Francophone]] services to be more relaxing, but less organized, than their German counterpart).&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; In the 1920s and '30s, Tzigara was host to several foreign researchers. [[Columbia University]] professor [[Charles Upson Clark]] called his institution "splendid", finding it partly responsible for a "distinct revival" in peasant crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; He described the museum as "a revelation of the artistic endowment of the Roumanian peasant."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; French archivist François de Vaux de Foletier visited his museum in 1934, later writing, in ''Monde et Voyages'' magazine, that it featured "very interesting galleries of Romanian ethnography".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/bordeie-obiceie/articol/impresiile-unui-oaspete-francez-ii "Impresiile unui oaspete francez (II)"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 344, September 2010.

Beginning 1933, Tzigara was several times interviewed by [[Eugen Wolbe]], the German biographer of Romanian kings, who had been sent to him by Carol II. Tzigara also reviewed Wolbe's texts, including his work on Queen Elisabeth (a "weak" study, in Tzigara's opinion), and described the visiting writer as an unreliable amateur: "that pensioned ex-''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiallehrer]]'' still had the audacity to select himself such august subjects, with the pretext of 'gaining many new friends for the beautiful country' of Romania, of which yet he himself knew so little!"&lt;ref name="afferdbio"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUian5.html "Istorie și istorii: o biografie a regelui Ferdinand"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061502/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUian5.html |date=2012-03-17 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Tzigara was upset to receive a copy of Wolbe's 1937 work on Ferdinand, which, he claimed, entirely ignored specific criticism; he also approved of Prime Minister [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]]'s decision to ban the volume in its Romanian edition (the censoring left Wolbe indifferent, a fact noted in one of his letters to Tzigara).&lt;ref name="afferdbio"/&gt; Tzigara's rival Iorga, probably incited by this controversy and by his own work with Wolbe, gave the book a positive review in his journal ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'', calling the government measure "regrettable", and receiving further criticism from Tzigara, through ''Convorbiri''.&lt;ref name="afferdbio"/&gt;

The Carol I Museum increased in size throughout the interwar, organized several exhibits,&lt;ref name="il146"&gt;Longuet, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1931, inaugurated its Ethnographic Section at the new Kiseleff location.&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; In parallel, Tzigara popularized Romanian handicrafts abroad with his new French-language tract, ''Tapis Roumains'' ("Romanian Carpets").&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Erdmann, ''Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, 1970, p.233. {{ISBN|0-520-01816-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributions, published by ''Convorbiri Literare'' in 1934, include an introduction to [[Alexandru Odobescu]]'s posthumous texts, ''Ineditele lui Odobescu'' ("Odobescu's Unpublished Texts")&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.996&lt;/ref&gt; and an edition of Odobescu' 1895 suicide note.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.442-443&lt;/ref&gt; Another work, grouping his articles in defense of the Museum's construction, was published in 1936 as ''Muzeografie românească'' ("Romanian Museography").&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt; Tzigara and cultural historian [[Nicolae N. Condeescu]] also left a monograph on the [[Peleș Castle]], Carol I's residence in [[Sinaia]].&lt;ref name="dapolul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Arsenie, [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/povestea-polului-lui-carol-o-moneda-de-100000-de-euro-910716.html "Povestea polului lui Carol, o monedă de 100.000 de euro"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', October 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As editor of ''Convorbiri Literare'', Tzigara also entered a polemic with a younger Maiorescu disciple, the critic and novelist [[Eugen Lovinescu]]. At the root of this debate stood Lovinescu's book on [[Mite Kremnitz]] and her affair with [[national poet]] (and ''Junimist'' herald) [[Mihai Eminescu]]. Joining in with other conservatives who accused Lovinescu of being a "[[Pornography|pornographer]]", Tzigara claimed to defend Eminescu's image from the book's impiety.&lt;ref name="goglose"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriela Omăt, [http://www.romlit.ro/glose_la_o_fotografie_e._lovinescu_...victim_a_mitului_eminescian "Glose la o fotografie: E. Lovinescu ...victimă a mitului eminescian"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 49/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu offered his replies in the daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', accusing Tzigara of "literary incompetence", and deploring the decline of ''Convorbiri'' beyond the threshold of professionalism: "if, under previous directions, the magazine steered away from its stated mission [...], the deviance was at least made in an honorable direction, that is to say in the direction of history writing; the scientific seriousness of its two former directors had made it possible for ''Convorbiri'' to have valid contributions in areas other than literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.adevarul.ro/cultura/literar_si_artistic/retro/Adevaruri_de_altadata-_Reactie_la_o_critica_0_242976107.html "Adevăruri de altădată: Reacție la o critică"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', April 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to claims of irreverence, he derided his adversary's artistic expertise as being about "[[Easter egg]]s", and defended his narrative as a sample of respect for Eminescu's life and legacy.&lt;ref name="goglose"/&gt;

Tzigara met significant opposition in his bid for [[Romanian Academy]] membership, primarily from Academy member Iorga.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.356. See also Nastasă (2007), p.510&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually elected a corresponding member&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; in 1938, when Iorga's influence was being challenged by his younger peers.&lt;ref name="Boia, p.356"/&gt; The same year, he was pensioned from his positions at Cernăuți University and the Foundation.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ln(10)409"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he dedicated himself to completing his homage to the memory of Carol I, on his 100th birthday: ''Din viața regelui Carol I. Mărturii contemporane și documente inedite'' ("From the Life of King Carol I. Contemporary Testimonials and Never-before Published Documents"), called "splendid" by Lucian Nastasă.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.88&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from his editorial office at ''Convorbiri'', which was taken over by writer and linguist [[I. E. Torouțiu]]. Tzigara announced this change with a final editorial piece, which read: "Satisfied to have insured the magazine's future, we announce at this moment that we are placing our directorial office in the hands of a new generation, which is led by Professor I. E. Torouțiu, [...] who with his valuable and sizable published works, appreciating ''Junimea''{{'}}s role in the movement to renew the Romanian literary language, will know how to carry on the ever-lasting flame of ''Junimist'' ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAian4.html "Eminescu la 1939"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point in life, Tzigara was also pleased with the state and popularity of museology in Greater Romania; in 1937, he had claimed: "all the country is presently a museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Tita Chiper]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/dileme-line/articol/ce-se-pastreaza-convorbire-cu-horia-bernea "Ce se păstrează?"], in ''[[Dilema Veche|Dilema]]'', Nr. 347, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His hostility to [[open-air museum]]s was by then a thing of the past, since, it was argued, Greater Romania's peasant society seemed threatened by modern urbanization.&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt; In the late 1930s, this judgment prompted sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]] to create the [[Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum in Bucharest|National Village Museum]], located a short distance away from Tzigara's own building site.&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt;

===World War II and final years===
A final moment of preeminence in Tzigara's career occurred during [[World War II]]. Initially, with war looming, [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]] [[Florea Țenescu]] tasked Tzigara with drafting an ''Ex-ante International Convention Project for the Protection of Monuments and Works of Art'', which was never put into motion.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; In summer 1940, during a period when Carol II was trying to calm tensions between Romania and [[Nazi Germany]], Tzigara, [[Ion Nistor]], [[Grigore Antipa]], [[Ion Sân-Giorgiu]] and other academics greeted a Nazi visitor, scholar [[Herbert Cysarz]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank-Rutger Hausmann, ''»Auch im Krieg schweigen die Musen nicht«: die Deutschen Wissenschaftlichen Institute im Zweiten Weltkrieg'', [[Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht]], Göttingen, 2001, p.75-76. {{ISBN|3-525-35181-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1940, Romania ousted Carol II's [[National Renaissance Front]] government, replacing it with an openly [[Fascism|fascist]], pro-[[Axis Power|Axis]] regime, the [[National Legionary State]]. In parallel, Tzigara managed to gather political support for terminating [[Nicolae Ghica-Budești]]'s contract and, in 1941, hired architect Gheorghe Ionescu to finalize the Museum's construction.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; Late in the same year, he was one of the Romanian scholars who welcomed German [[Romance studies]] expert [[Ernst Gamillscheg]] on his visit to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1941/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1941_020_009.pdf "Cronici.

Shortly after the [[King Michael's Coup|August 1944 Coup]] deposed Antonescu, the daily ''[[România Liberă]]'', which was at the time a [[Romanian Communist Party]] tribune, featured Tzigara's name on a list of "national betrayal", which also included Germanophile or fascist intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Diac, [http://www1.jurnalul.ro/scinteia/jurnalul-national/comunism-artisti-si-ziaristi-in-febra-epurarilor-23564.html "Comunism - Artiști și ziariști în febra epurărilor"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', April 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the pro-communist cabinet of [[Petru Groza]] sidelined Tzigara-Samurcaș, appointing him honorary director of the museum, but effectively stripping him of his responsibilities.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; At that stage, plans were being examined for the disestablishment of the Peasant Art Section at the Museum, but Tzigara obtained support from Communist Party man [[Emil Bodnăraș]] and from [[President of Romania|Presidium Chief]] [[Constantin Ion Parhon]].&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; Tzigara attended the clandestine meetings of the [[Mihai Eminescu]] Association, an [[anti-communist]] group formed through the efforts of critic [[Pavel Chihaia]], and which disappeared in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/destinul_unui_rezistent_pavel_chihaia "Destinul unui rezistent: Pavel Chihaia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2001&lt;/ref&gt; His chief activity, from 1948 to 1952, was the writing of his memoirs.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;

The official establishment of [[Communist Romania|Romania's communist regime]] was the start of several new problems for the aging scholar: many of his belongings were taken away during [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]], others were sold in [[public auction]], while he himself was taken to court by some of his former employees.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; In 1948, he was also [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|stripped of his Academy membership]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.511&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, his pension was suspended,&lt;ref name="ln(10)409"/&gt; although, in 1950, he was elected to the International Committee of the History of Art.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt; The National Museum was reopened in 1951 as a "National Museum of Folk Art", under new management.&lt;ref name="il146"/&gt;

Marginalization aggravated Tzigara's illnesses, and he died on April 1, 1952.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; He was buried at [[Bellu Cemetery]], with a small ceremony attended by family and a few of his intellectual friends: ''Convorbiri'' colleague Mehedinți, ''Junimist'' philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], physician [[Daniel Danielopolu]] and writer [[Gala Galaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.470&lt;/ref&gt; He had lost his public profile, and the international community was left uninformed of his death: in 1955, an invitation to the 18th Art History Congress was mistakenly addressed to him.&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Tzigara's contribution as an art historian has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian Nastasă, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the "somewhat organized" attempts on Odobescu's part.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1920, art historian [[Gheorghe Oprescu]] also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's "intelligent articles" were the only ones in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste.&lt;ref name="goarta860"/&gt; [[Charles Upson Clark]] also rated "Tzigara-Samurcash" as one of Romania's "best-known modern writers" in the field of archeology or ancient art, with [[Alexandru Lapedatu]], [[George Murnu]] and [[Abgar Baltazar]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist [[Romulus Vulcănescu]] rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of "ethnological essayistics and cultural [[microhistory]]", who lacked a global approach to folk art research.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/profesorul_alexandru_dima "Profesorul Alexandru Dima"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128092355/http://www.romlit.ro/profesorul_alexandru_dima |date=2009-11-28 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 39/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dumitru Hîncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once "a first-rate cultural figure", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș "no longer says a great deal for your average present-day reader".&lt;ref name="dhradio"/&gt;

The art historian's figure inspired literary critic [[George Călinescu]] in writing his novel ''[[Scrinul negru]]'', about the decline of Romanian aristocracy.&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt; A more unusual trace of his activity is preserved in ''Tzigara-Samurkasch'', the name of a fictional place in the writings of Bukovina native [[Gregor von Rezzori]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Corbea-Hoișie, "''Maghrebinien''—ein Gedächtnisort ''ex negativo''", in Jacques Lajarrige (ed.), ''Austriaca 54: Gregor von Rezzori'', [[University of Rouen]], 2003, p.17. {{ISBN|2-87775-340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comment left by Tzigara in his [[Peleș Castle]] book has fueled [[cyberculture]] speculation and an urban legend about the existence of 20 lei coins from the 1860s, which are supposedly extremely valuable items.&lt;ref name="dapolul"/&gt;

Tzigara-Samurcaș's Museum building was only finished after his death, later in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; By the time of its completion, however, the building's purpose had changed, and, historian [[Andrei Pippidi]] writes, it "passed through the most humiliating of its stages".&lt;ref name="apcaroli"/&gt; Its collections were moved to a new location, and, in 1978, merged into the Village Museum.&lt;ref name="ndiurban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="il146"/&gt; The Kiseleff building was assigned to the "[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] Museum", which later became the Communist Party Museum.&lt;ref name="abmeteor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="il146"/&gt; Shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] toppled communism, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|Salvation Front]] Minister of Culture [[Andrei Pleșu]] created, on National Museum grounds, a Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which he placed under the direction of painter [[Horia Bernea]].&lt;ref&gt;Longuet, p.146-147&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially inaugurated in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; Although sometimes described as Tzigara's successor, Bernea, helped by ethnologist [[Irina Nicolau]], merged the scientific function into a [[conceptual art]] project, which is described by various commentators as a radical break with the interwar National Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Bercea, Ioana Popescu, [http://www.revista22.ro/scandal-la-mtr-1085.html "Scandal la MȚR"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 754, August 2004; [[Vintilă Mihăilescu]], Maria Bercea, [http://www.revista22.ro/mtr-e-mai-mult-decat-un-muzeu-e-o-institutie-culturala-2364.html "MȚR e mai mult decât un muzeu: e o instituție culturală"], in ''Revista 22'', Nr. 827, January 2006. See also Longuet, p.146sqq&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucian Boia, Tzigara's work with the Germans in World War I continues to be perceived as a stain on his career, and was as such omitted from official histories which deal with the period. This, Boia notes, happened especially during the latter, [[Nationalism|nationalist]], stage of Romanian communism, when World War I was presented as a moment of anti-German "unanimity".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt; However, the period also brought the publication of Tzigara's collected ''Scrieri despre arta românească'' ("Writings on Romanian Art", 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa, p.28; Vlasiu, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; The first installment of Tzigara-Samurcaș's memoirs was first published in 1999, ten years after the Revolution, by Grai și Suflet imprint.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.328; Ciupală, p.137, 139, 140; Nastasă (2007), p.37, 91, 103; (2010), p.230&lt;/ref&gt; Later volumes saw print with [[Editura Meridiane]].&lt;ref name="lb353-354"/&gt; These works have raised interest for their historical and biographical content, but, [[Zigu Ornea]] contends, are largely without literary value.&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; Ornea also criticized the two editors, Ioan and Florica Șerb, for only including some citations from Tzigara's contemporaries as notes, instead of a more complete [[critical apparatus]].&lt;ref name="zomarturisiri"/&gt; [[Editura Vitruviu]] also published another volume of Tzigara's memoirs, as ''Lupta vieții unui octogenar'' ("An Octogenarian's Lifelong Combat", 2007).&lt;ref name="msrskansen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ln(10)371"/&gt;

A large part of his [[photographic plate]]s ended up as a special fund of the [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism]]. In May 2010, they were inventoried and published, in print and [[DVD]] format, as ''Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș''.&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; A selection of these works was displayed in 2011, during a special Museum of the Romanian Peasant exhibit, sponsored by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]].&lt;ref name="culturatzs"/&gt; The rest, preserved by the Fine Arts School, were donated to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2000.&lt;ref name="mparhiva"/&gt; A Tzigara-Samurcaș Foundation was created with the goal of preserving folklore and handicrafts.

Tzigara's son, Sandu Tzigara-Samurcaș, was a poet, known for his 1943 volume ''Culesul de apoi'' ("The Latter-day Reaping");&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1032&lt;/ref&gt; his wife was poet Adrienne Prunkul.&lt;ref name="ln(10)327"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.327&lt;/ref&gt; His Bucharest salon braved communist censorship and, in the 1950s, hosted poets such as [[Ion Barbu]] and [[Nichita Stănescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Condeescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/nichita_stnescu_-_debutul_poetic "Nichita Stănescu - Debutul poetic"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326202809/http://www.romlit.ro/nichita_stnescu_-_debutul_poetic |date=2012-03-26 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Sandu had two sisters, of whom [[Ana Tzigara Berza|Ana Tzigara]] became, in 1935, the wife of folklorist [[Marcu Berza]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p.51, 109; (2007), p.162-163; (2010), p.90-91, 244, 331, 390&lt;/ref&gt; Settled with her husband in [[Italy]] until her death in 1967, she established her reputation as a [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter and, after the 1989 Revolution, had her retrospective exhibition at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant.&lt;ref name="ln(10)327"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cronicaromana.ro/index.php?editie=1816&amp;art=93005 "Expoziție feminină la Muzeul Țăranului Român"], in ''[[Cronica Română]]'', February 19, 2009; Florian Băiculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/La-zi*articleID_21294-articles_details.html "La zi"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 463, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Maria, Tzigara's other daughter, was a violinist for the [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian Film Orchestra]], married into the Berindei family (and thus became related to historians [[Dan Berindei|Dan]] and [[Mihnea Berindei]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p.91, 327, 390&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bela Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]] on [[The CW Television Network]]'s drama/horror television series [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|''Supernatural'']], portrayed by [[Lauren Cohan]]. Appearing only in the [[Supernatural (season 3)|third season]], she uses knowledge of the supernatural world to her advantage rather than to help those in need. Self-centered and a thorn in the side of the series' protagonists, Bela makes her living by stealing occult objects and selling them to wealthy clients.  Critical reaction to the character was mixed, with negative responses from fans ultimately leading to her departure at the end of the season.

==Plot==
In her first appearance, "Bad Day at Black Rock", Bela Talbot hires two crooks to steal a cursed [[rabbit's foot]] from a storage container owned by the deceased [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John Winchester]], a [[Characters of Supernatural#Hunters|hunter]] of supernatural creatures. Anyone who touches the foot is granted good luck, but will die within a week if the foot is lost. She intends to sell it and shows no concern for the fate of the thieves. John's sons, series protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester|Dean]], retrieve the foot but are cursed by it. Bela interferes when they attempt to destroy it, and shoots Sam in the shoulder. Dean, however, tricks her into touching it. She gives the foot up for destruction to save herself, but manages to steal $46,000 in winning lottery tickets from Dean that he had purchased using the foot's granted luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Bad Day at Black Rock |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Ben Edlund, Director: Bob Singer|network=CW |airdate=October 18, 2007 |season=3 |number=3 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She next appears in "Red Sky at Morning", an episode in which the Winchesters track down a ghost ship responsible for local deaths. Bela fools them into helping her again, with the three of them working together to steal the precious and magical [[Hand of Glory]]. The Winchesters plan to destroy the artifact to end the curse, but Bela steals it from them to sell to a client. However, Bela then witnesses the ghost ship, which only appears to those who have spilled the blood of a family member. Condemned to death, she turns to the Winchesters for help. Dean is prepared to leave her behind to die, but Sam comes up with a plan to save Bela's life. This time, Bela gives them $10,000 as a "thank you" before she leaves because she does not like being indebted to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Red Sky at Morning |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Laurence Andries, Director: Cliff Bole|network=CW |airdate=November 8, 2007 |season=3 |number=6 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Fresh Blood", hunter and recently escaped felon [[Gordon Walker (Supernatural)|Gordon Walker]] tracks Bela down and threatens to kill her unless she reveals the location of the Winchesters, as he plans to kill Sam. Bela agrees to find out their location in exchange for his priceless [[Mojo (African American culture)|mojo]] bag, and has an unsuspecting Dean disclose their whereabouts to her. After Dean threatens to kill her, she uses a [[Ouija board]] to placate him by obtaining information on Gordon's location so the Winchesters can neutralize the other hunter first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Fresh Blood |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Laurence Andries, Director: Sera Gamble|network=CW |airdate=November 15, 2007 |season=3 |number=7 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Dream a Little Dream of Me", Bela returns when the Winchesters contact her for help in saving fellow hunter and family friend [[Bobby Singer]] after he falls into a mystical coma. They need dream root to enter Bobby's dreams and find out what is keeping him asleep. She claims nothing from them in compensation, explaining she is helping them in order to repay a debt to Bobby. However, the Winchesters discover after Bobby awakens that she was lying, having helped them only in order to gain access to [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)#The Colt|the Colt]], a mystical gun capable of killing any being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Dream a Little Dream of Me |series=Supernatural |credits=Story: Sera Gamble &amp; Cathryn Humphris, Teleplay: Cathryn Humphris, Director: Steve Boyum|network=CW |airdate=February 7, 2008 |season=3 |number=10 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged at the theft, Dean and Sam attempt to track her down in "[[Jus in Bello (Supernatural)|Jus in Bello]]", but instead are led into a trap she has set up; police arrest the Winchesters and place them in jail. Though the demonic overlord [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]] sends her forces, Sam and Dean eventually make their escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Jus in Bello |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Sera Gamble, Director: Kim Manners|network=CW |airdate=February 21, 2008 |season=3 |number=12 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela no longer has the Colt. He later gets her criminal record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a [[Crossroads Demon (Supernatural)|Crossroads Demon]]; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape [[Child abuse|abuse]] from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried to get out of the deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Time Is On My Side |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Sera Gamble, Director: Charles Beeson|network=CW |airdate=May 8, 2008 |season=3 |number=15 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bela's death&amp;mdash;and her soul's resulting descent into [[Hell]]&amp;mdash;is inevitable, but not shown.&lt;ref name="sendoff"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a95470/supernatural-creator-talks-season-four.html| title='Supernatural' creator talks season four |accessdate=2008-05-08 |work=Digital Spy| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508230112/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a95470/supernatural-creator-talks-season-four.html| archivedate= 8 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
Described by her actress, [[Lauren Cohan]], as "a female [[Humphrey Bogart]]",&lt;ref name="femme"/&gt; Bela is "a little bit manipulative" and she "always wants to be in control".&lt;ref name="femme"/&gt; According to series creator [[Eric Kripke]], the writers conceptualized the character as "someone [the Winchesters have] really never come across before" because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting".&lt;ref name="onetree"/&gt; Writer and producer [[Sera Gamble]] summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy "mercenary that ''[sic]'' just [doesn't] give a shit about the cause".&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Knight, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Gamble believed that Bela "finds it quite amusing" that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/writer-shares-thoughts-on-supe-14059.aspx|title=Writer Shares Thoughts on 'Supernatural' Girls|last=Claustro|first=Lisa|date=November 22, 2007|publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=2009-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418091535/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/writer-shares-thoughts-on-supe-14059.aspx|archive-date=2008-04-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohan viewed Bela as "a young woman trying to make a living and find some kind of reason in her world" who was "a little damaged." The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's behavior being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from "real strong connections". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela "would have loved to be able to have a normal relationship". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having "fits of conscience" offscreen throughout the third season. In the actress's opinion, Bela "would have loved to go around fighting evil with those boys."&lt;ref name="p118"/&gt;

==Development==
''Supernatural'' producers originally intended for Bela to be a recurring character. Having already created a new female lead in the form of the demon [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]], they chose to upgrade Bela to series regular after [[Dawn Ostroff]]&amp;mdash;at the time, the CW President of Entertainment&amp;mdash;requested a second female lead for the season, because they "[loved Bela]" and already planned for her to return in future episodes. To avoid the "mistake" they had made in the [[Supernatural (season 2)|previous season]] in introducing [[Jo Harvelle]] as a [[love interest]],&lt;ref name="onetree"/&gt; the writers planned to introduce Bela as "a character in [her] own right" who would act as an [[antagonist]] "with [her] own interests and [her] own motives".&lt;ref name="adjust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/zap-story-nosupernaturalslippersforruby,0,7993836.story|title=No 'Supernatural' Slippers for Ruby|last=O'Hare|first=Kate|date=October 11, 2007|work=Newsday|accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were, however, willing to add in a romantic involvement with Sam or Dean should they and the fans both want it. The writers also planned for Bela to be "very separate and very different" from Ruby, and for the characters to "[serve] very different storylines."&lt;ref name="onetree"/&gt;

Cohan auditioned for Ruby, but ultimately received the part of Bela.&lt;ref name="onetree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernatural-exec-we-8522.aspx |title=Supernatural Exec: "We Won't Be One Tree Hill with Monsters!" |date= July 21, 2007 |work=TV Guide | author= Michael Ausiello |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british"/&gt; Upon learning of Cohan's British accent, a "really psyched" Kripke reworked the character to be British. The actress herself later pictured Bela that way, feeling she "has some kind of cool shading and sneakiness, which fits the British accent".&lt;ref name="british"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554 |title=Supernatural Welcomes New Girls|last=White|first=Cindy|date=July 23, 2007|publisher=Sci Fi Wire|accessdate=2009-04-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080114073550/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554 |archivedate = 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Cohan's casting, however, she had been given little exposure to the character script-wise, and was unaware she would play a "nasty person". It was not until The CW up-fronts that Kripke gave her a "good spiel" about Bela  because she would be interviewed.&lt;ref name="p118"&gt;Knight 3, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; The actress later turned down an offer from him to provide more of the character's backstory, and instead opted to learn it as the episodes were filmed.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Irvine | first = Alex | title = To Catch a Thief | date = February 2008 | year = | periodical = Supernatural Magazine | publisher = [[Titan Magazines]] | issue = 2 | pages = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare for her role, Cohan received training in weaponry to be "well equipped with swords and a lot of instruments&amp;mdash;sharp instruments",&lt;ref name="femme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/new-supernatural-femme-fatales-11344.aspx|title=New 'Supernatural' Femme Fatales Provide Inside Dish on Their Characters|last=Santiago|first=Rosario|date=September 24, 2007|publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=2009-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126202455/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/new-supernatural-femme-fatales-11344.aspx|archive-date=2009-11-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in kickboxing alongside Ruby's actress [[Katie Cassidy]]. Cohan and Cassidy also decided to catch up on ''Supernatural'' before filming for the third season began, by watching the first two seasons together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554|title=Supernatural Welcomes New Girls|last=White|first=Cindy|date=July 23, 2007|publisher=[[SciFi.com]]|accessdate=2009-01-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114073550/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554 |archivedate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to "protective and occasionally nervous" fans, Kripke meant for Bela to be introduced in "small doses".&lt;ref name="tv.com"/&gt; He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, "[Ruby and Bela are] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys."&lt;ref name="tv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/story/10682.html |title=TV.com Q&amp;A: Supernatural creator Eric Kripke |last=Surette |first=Tim |date=January 10, 2008 |publisher=[[TV.com]] |accessdate=2009-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69eg2jtBo?url=http://www.tv.com/news/tv-com-q-and-a-supernatural-creator-eric-kripke-10682/ |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it "was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show".&lt;ref name="tv.com"/&gt; The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." They were eventually "crushed under the weight of the absurdity of it" because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative.&lt;ref name="pp1011"&gt;Knight, pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers.&lt;ref name="pp1011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adjust"/&gt; The writers, "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="pp1011"/&gt; They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" which would "show a couple of cards [they have] been holding onto all season" by revealing her backstory "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story."&lt;ref name="sendoff"/&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to the character has been mixed. ''BuddyTV'' staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a "cheap ploy" to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her to a combination of [[Catwoman]] and "the equally annoying [[Gwen Raiden (Angel)|Electro-Gwen]] from ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''".&lt;ref name="donwilliams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-ditch-the-girls-a-14535.aspx |title=Supernatural: Ditch the Girls and Bring Back Brotherly Love |date=December 7, 2007 |work=BuddyTV |accessdate=2009-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510130940/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-ditch-the-girls-a-14535.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later admitted Bela was "a great comic foil".&lt;ref name="donwilliams2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-female-trouble-20681.aspx |title=Supernatural: Female Trouble |date=June 20, 2008 |work=BuddyTV |accessdate=2009-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020034345/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-female-trouble-20681.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Steenbergen of [[IGN]] became "increasingly frustrated" with the "unlikable and manipulative" Bela throughout her appearances.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="season3review"&gt;http://tv.ign.com/articles/876/876511p1.html&lt;/ref&gt; She found the character's tragic backstory to be "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel "even a tiny bit sorry for [Bela]" during her death scene.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Writing that "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/06/supernatural-flashback-shadow-review&lt;/ref&gt; Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&amp;mdash;"not either annoying or downright contemptible"&lt;ref name="season3review"/&gt;&amp;mdash;and deemed her "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/872/872864p1.html|title=Supernatural: "Time Is on My Side" Review |last=Steenbergen|first=Diana |date=May 9, 2008|publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karla Peterson of ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale "[[No Rest for the Wicked (Supernatural)|No Rest For The Wicked]]" that Bela "got gone just as [she was] getting interesting".

From the start, fans were very wary of bringing in female characters to the male-dominated show;&lt;ref name="waryfans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/print/index.jsp?uuid=824db740-21ba-440d-8632-f37d3bfe815b&amp;contentType=watchWithKristin|title=Supernatural's "Troublemakers" Spill on What's Ahead |last=Dos Santos|first=Kristin |date=November 15, 2007|publisher=E!

According to Kripke, the fan reaction was the characters "really look like they suck".&lt;ref name="UGO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvblog.ugo.com/index.php/tvblog/more/supernaturals_eric_kripke_on_bonding_cute_girls_and_which_winchester_would/ |title=Supernatural's Eric Kripke on Bonding, Cute Girls, and Which Winchester Would Win in a Fight |last=Lachonis |first=Jon |date=February 5, 2008 |publisher=UGO |accessdate=2009-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011100144/http://tvblog.ugo.com/index.php/tvblog/more/supernaturals_eric_kripke_on_bonding_cute_girls_and_which_winchester_would/ |archivedate=October 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bela's overly-antagonistic actions throughout the season did not calm the viewers' fears. "[Bela screwed] over the boys so badly," Kripke explained, "that she became unlikeable to the fans because she was irredeemable".&lt;ref name="pp1011"/&gt; Kripke has confessed  part of the decision to kill the character off was due to the negative reaction from the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-convention-brings-18107.aspx|title=Creator Eric Kripke Talks 'Supernatural' Season 4|last=Williams|first=Don|date=September 8, 2008|publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=2009-04-11|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69eg9BqaE?url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-convention-brings-18107.aspx|archive-date=2012-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bradford James Cox''' (born May 15, 1982) is an American singer-songwriter and [[musician]], best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the [[indie rock]] band [[Deerhunter]]. He also pursues a solo career under the moniker '''Atlas Sound'''.

Cox formed Deerhunter with drummer Moses Archuleta in 2001.  The band has released 7 studio albums along with several singles and EPs. Atlas Sound is a name Cox has used since he was ten to refer to his own music, but his first full-length production under the name was ''[[Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel]]'' (2008). Cox's method of creating music is [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]], and he does not write lyrics in advance.

He made his film acting debut in 2013's ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.

==Music career==

===Deerhunter===
{{Main article|Deerhunter}}
Cox founded Deerhunter with bassist Paul Harper and drummer Dan Walton (who named the band) in early 2001. The band expanded after Cox met a teenage transient, Moses Archuleta, who was sleeping on the floor of Cox's friends. Archuleta initially played [[Ace Tone]] Organ and electronics. The band's first shows were experimental and based on improvisation. Cox continued recording slightly more structured material and releasing it on CD-R and cassette using the name Atlas Sound. Paul Harper moved to Ohio and was replaced by Justin Bosworth. At this point Colin Mee also joined the band on guitar. Dan Walton left and Cox suggested Archuleta move to drums. The band's live shows and recordings became more song-oriented. They recorded their debut 7" for Die Slaughterhaus. Josh Fauver joined the band in 2004 after Bosworth died in a freak skateboarding accident. This lineup recorded Deerhunter's debut LP on Atlanta label [[Stickfigure Records]]. Cox suggested Lockett Pundt, whom he befriended while attending [[Harrison High School (Georgia)|Harrison High School]] in Kennesaw, Georgia, join the band on guitar so that he could concentrate on vocals and electronics. This lineup recorded their breakthrough record, 2007's ''Cryptograms'' until 2010's ''Halcyon Digest.'' Colin Mee left the band after failing to show up for a North American tour. Josh Fauver subsequently left the band and was replaced by Josh McKay. The band is now a four piece consisting of Cox on guitar and vocals, Pundt on guitar and occasional vocals, McKay on bass, and Archuleta on drums.

===Atlas Sound===

Atlas Sound is the musical solo project of Cox, although he has used the name to represent his music since he was a child.  He had access to a cassette player with two tape decks, which he used to layer guitar and drum sounds, and his own voice.  In listening to some of these old tapes (of which Cox believes he has over five hundred in storage) he found "Some of it is absolutely, terrifyingly bad, but sometimes I'm just like, 'Wow, that's cool.' That's actually how some Deerhunter songs happened. 'Spring Hall Convert' [from ''[[Cryptograms (album)|Cryptograms]]''] was like that. That was a tape I made in ninth or tenth grade."  Cox writes his music [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]], not writing lyrics in advance, and constructing songs by adding more parts until he feels "it's getting crowded."&lt;ref name="prefix-interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/atlas-sound/interview/17319/ |title=Atlas Sound: Interview |first=Jeff |last=Klingman |date=2008-02-20 |publisher=Prefix Magazine |accessdate=2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of his project is derived from the brand of tape player he used, Atlas Sound.&lt;ref name="vimeo-interview"&gt;{{cite video |people=Cox, Bradford |url=http://vimeo.com/3110785 |title=ATLAS SOUND in series: SXSW - All Roads Lead to Austin 2008 |publisher=Dig For Fire, [[Vimeo]] |accessdate=2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox began Atlas Sound in the wake of his work with Deerhunter because "I have ideas that I can't make work with a five piece rock band...There's kind of this palette of sounds that I use that I don't necessarily get to use with Deerhunter."&lt;ref name="pitchfork-interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42945-deerhunters-cox-talks-lp3-atlas-sound-dresses |title=Deerhunter's Cox Talks LP3, Atlas Sound, Dresses |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730045242/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42945-deerhunters-cox-talks-lp3-atlas-sound-dresses |archivedate=2008-07-30 |date=2007-05-15 |first=Paul |last=Thompson |author2=Tyler Grisham |accessdate=2009-11-24 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the music Deerhunter makes is a collaborative effort, Cox does not want to assert himself as its principal songwriter.  "I might have an idea for a fragment of a song, but I want to leave it skeletal so the guys can fill it out. Whereas with Atlas Sound, everything is done in an hour."  Cox created the music for his first record in the software [[Ableton Live]], utilizing an array of computer-based instruments, as well as his own live recordings.&lt;ref name="atlassound-interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interviews: Atlas Sound |accessdate=2009-11-24 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |first=Marc |last=Hogan |date=2008-01-14 |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47762-interview-atlas-sound |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218034541/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47762-interview-atlas-sound |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there have been four major releases by Cox as Atlas Sound: ''[[Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel]]'' (2008), ''[[Logos (album)|Logos]]'' (2009), a four-album set of previously unreleased songs called Bedroom Databank (2010), and finally "[[Parallax (Atlas Sound album)|Parallax]]" in 2011. The lyrics of ''Let the Blind Lead'' are autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of Cox.&lt;ref name="atlassound-interview" /&gt;  In discussing his second album, Cox characterized his first as being a "bedroom laptop type thing" and "Very introverted."  In contrast, ''Logos'' was written in several parts of the world, and is "not about me. There are collaborations with other musicians. The lyrics are not autobiographical. The view is a lot more panoramic and less close-up. I became bored with introspection."&lt;ref name="pitchfork-newalbum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35863-deerhunters-bradford-cox-announces-new-atlas-sound-album/ |title=Deerhunter's Bradford Cox Announces New Atlas Sound Album |first=Ryan |last=Dombal |date=2009-07-09 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An unfinished version of ''Logos'' was [[Internet leak|leaked]] onto the internet in August 2008, over a year before its release date.&lt;ref name="pitchfork-albumleak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/30015-deerhunters-imicrocastlei-available-now-on-itunes/ |title=Deerhunter's Microcastle Now Available Now on iTunes |first=Paul |last=Thompson |date=2008-08-19 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Cox almost ceased production on the record, later saying "I did not react well to the leak, in retrospect. It became the kind of internet-fueled drama that I was quickly learning to despise."&lt;ref name="pitchfork-newalbum" /&gt;

In late 2010, Cox published four volumes of demos on his [[blog]], entitled "Bedroom Databank". These demos were taken down from [[Mediafire]] by Sony, but they later apologized to Cox, stating that the files "were mistakenly removed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40827-atlas-sound-demos-taken-down-by-sony/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|title=Atlas Sound Demos Taken Down by Sony|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40848-sony-apologizes-to-bradford-cox/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|title=Sony Apologizes to Bradford Cox|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas Sound was chosen by [[Animal Collective]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival that they curated in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpanimalcollective.php ATP: All Tomorrow's Parties]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Cox has also recorded as part of other bands, such as the short lived "Wet Dreams", an otherwise all-girl garage / noise band in which he played drums. He also recorded several tracks on the [[Black Lips]] second album ''[[We Did Not Know the Forest Spirit Made the Flowers Grow]]'', playing drums on the song "Notown Blues" from that album.

He also is a part of the "Avant-Garage" band [[Ghetto Cross]], with Cole Alexander from [[Black Lips]], Frankie Broyles, and Asha Lakra.

Cox contributed to the [[Karen O]]-scored [[Where the Wild Things Are: Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the 2009 film ''[[Where the Wild Things Are (film)|Where the Wild Things Are]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/15784/94201|publisher=Rolling Stone|title=Karen O and the Kids: The Rockers of "Where the Wild Things Are"|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, it was announced that Cox would portray [[Jared Leto]]'s lover in the feature film, ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]],'' co-starring [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Jennifer Garner]]; this is Cox's film debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48728-bradford-cox-to-play-jared-letos-lover-in-new-movie/|title=Bradford Cox to Play Jared Leto's Lover in New Movie|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|last=Pelly|first=Jenn|date=November 27, 2012|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He Currently uses a [[Fender Hot Rod DeVille]] 410.&lt;ref name="uberproaudio.com"/&gt;

== Songwriting ==
Cox describes his mode of songwriting as 'automatic or stream-of-consciousness'. "Usually I go into a sort of trance and I'll have five or six songs afterwards", he said, speaking to Victoria Segal of ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' in November 2010. "What is interesting is seeing how the band adapts them and mutates them into the final product. Lots of accidents and primitive irrational things happen. It can be difficult trying to explain the process to a producer or engineer. They generally want to help you polish things and I tend to want to sabotage that", he added.&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Segal''. [[Q magazine]], November 2010. Q &amp; A. Halcyon Digest album review. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cox was born with the genetic disorder [[Marfan syndrome]].&lt;ref name="allmusic-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1007210|pure_url=yes}} |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;((( Atlas Sound &gt; Biography )))&lt;/nowiki&gt; |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he dropped out of high school (although later earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]]) and his parents divorced, leaving him "to live in my childhood home alone. I literally lived in this large suburban house by myself."  Cox has called his changing music taste growing up reflective of his life and mental state.  Around the age of ten, Cox's disorder began to affect his body in more visible ways; this is the point at which he "first started looking awkward."  With no friends, Cox became interested in how music could sound "heartbreaking or nostalgic or melancholy"; he identified with the title character of the film ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', and especially enjoyed the soundtrack, which was composed by [[Danny Elfman]].  Cox's tastes shifted to music that was more "monotonous or hypnotic", such as the [[Stereolab]] album ''[[Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements]]''.  Around twenty years of age, his life situation brought about "a period", during which he became "only interested in this certain sort of suburban psychedelic pastoral thing. It was escapism. I didn't want as much emotional manipulation. It's kind of the opposite of ''Edward Scissorhands.''"&lt;ref name="pitchfork-510"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35001-5-10-15-20-bradford-cox/ |title=5-10-15-20: Bradford Cox |first=Tom |last=Breihan |date=2009-04-10 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox has described himself as [[gay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Aaron|first1= Charles|year= 2008|title= Pretzel Logic|journal= Spin Magazine|publisher= Spin Media LLC|issue= April 2008|pages= 76–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he previously has stated that he leads a non-sexual/[[asexuality|asexual]] lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Mosi. "Bradford Cox: Boy wonder." ''Creative Loafing''. February 13, 2008. [http://clatl.com/atlanta/bradford-cox-boy-wonder/Content?oid=1272094]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Logan K. Young''. [http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=deerhunter Deerhunter @ Trouser Press.] - ''...a non-practicing homosexual.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' Cox said that he no longer identifies as asexual but rather as queer: "For a long time I just said I was asexual, but now I just realized that… I'm still, I guess… I mean, I'm queer. I just sort of, don't really have a very big self-esteem, so asexuality is sort of like a comfort zone where you don't get rejected."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150626184126/http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport/2011/11/bradford-cox-press-tour-continues-says-he-no-longer-asexual-now-queer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cox stated in an October 19, 2016 radio interview: "There's so many types of sexuality, but one that I think is overlooked is to be asexual. I am absolutely asexual. I am a virgin at 34 years old."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papermag.com/deerhunters-bradford-cox-says-he-is-asexual-and-a-virgin-2054327814.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Cox was hospitalized after being hit by a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57723-bradford-cox-hospitalized-after-being-hit-by-car/ | title=Bradford Cox Hospitalized After Being Hit By Car | publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=December 6, 2014 | author=Gordon, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chandralekha Prabhudas Patel''' (6 December 1928 – 30 December 2006), commonly known as just '''Chandralekha''', was a dancer and choreographer from India. The niece of [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], India's first deputy Prime Minister, she was an exponent of performances fusing [[Bharatanatyam]] with [[Yoga]] and martial arts like [[Kalarippayattu]].

She was conferred the highest award of the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, the [[List of Sangeet Natak Akademi fellows|Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship]] in 2004.

==Early life and education==
She was born to an [[agnostic]] doctor father and a devout [[Hindu]] mother in [[Vada, Palghar|Vada]], [[Maharashtra]]. She spent her childhood in her native [[Gujarat]] and in Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/09/guardianobituaries.india|title=Chandralekha: Controversial Indian dancer whose ideas challenged convention|date=9 February 2007|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing high school, Chandralekha studied law, but quit her studies midway to learn dance instead. She started with [[Dasi Attam]], a form of dance practiced by temple dancers in southern India, under the tutelage of [[Ellappa Pillai]]. She was also influenced by [[Balasaraswati]] and [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] in her dance education, but her choreography shows that she was more influenced by the former.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt; Although Chandralekha received her early training in [[Bharatanatyam]], she went on to change her focus to postmodern fusion dances that incorporated elements from other dances, martial arts like [[Kalarippayattu]], and performing arts.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/arts/07chandralekha.html|title=Chandralekha, 79, Dancer Who Blended Indian Forms, Dies|date=7 January 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=30 November 2009 | first=Jennifer | last=Dunning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/68457787.html?dids=68457787:68457787&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+21%2C+1998&amp;author=Clive+Barnes&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=HANDSOME+%27RAGA%27-BAG+OF+THESES&amp;pqatl=google|title=HANDSOME 'RAGA'-BAG OF THESES|date=21 November 1998|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=30 November 2009 | first=Clive | last=Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Joseph Bohm''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}}&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{cite journal | author = B. J. Hiley | authorlink = Basil Hiley | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1997.0007 | title = David Joseph Bohm. 20 December 1917 – 27 October 1992: Elected F.R.S. 1990 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 43 | pages = 107–131 | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|m}}; December 20, 1917 – October 27, 1992) was an American scientist who has been described as one of the most significant [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] [[physicist]]s of the 20th century&lt;ref name="DavidPeat"&gt;F. David Peat, ''Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm'', Reading, Massachusetts: Addison Wesley, 1997, pp. 316-317. {{ISBN|0-201-32820-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and who contributed unorthodox ideas to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[neuropsychology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

Bohm advanced the view that quantum physics meant that the old [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian model]] of reality&amp;nbsp;– that there are two kinds of substance, the mental and the physical, that somehow interact&amp;nbsp;– was too limited. To complement it, he developed a mathematical and physical theory of [[Implicate and explicate order|"implicate" and "explicate" order]].&lt;ref name="wholeness"&gt;David Bohm: ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order'', Routledge, 1980 ({{ISBN|0-203-99515-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the brain, at the cellular level, works according to the mathematics of some quantum effects, and postulated that thought is distributed and non-localised just as quantum entities are.&lt;ref name="holo"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}}

Bohm warned of the dangers of rampant reason and technology, advocating instead the need for genuine supportive dialogue, which he claimed could broaden and unify conflicting and troublesome divisions in the social world. In this, his [[epistemology]] mirrored his [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm: On Dialogue (2004) Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his [[Communist]] affiliations, Bohm was the subject of a federal government investigation in 1949, prompting him to leave the United States. He pursued his scientific career in several countries, becoming first a [[Brazil]]ian and then a [[British citizen]]. He abandoned Marxism in the wake of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956.&lt;ref&gt; Adam Becker: ''What is Real?: The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics'', Basic Books, 2018. P.115 ({{ISBN|978-0-465-09605-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm's main concern was with understanding the nature of reality in general and of consciousness in particular as a coherent whole, which according to Bohm is never static or complete but rather an unfolding process.&lt;ref&gt;''Wholeness and the Implicate Order'', Bohm - July 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and college==
Bohm was born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pennsylvania]], to a [[Hungarian Jewish]] immigrant father, Samuel Bohm,&lt;ref&gt;http://ed.augie.edu/~wjdelfs/381bohm.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - By the Numbers – David Bohm&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Lithuanian Jewish]] mother. He was raised mainly by his father, a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi. Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he became an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] in his teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Infinite Potential: The Life And Times Of David Bohm |year=1997 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=978-0-201-32820-2 |author=[[F. David Peat]] |page=21 |quote=If he identified Jewish lore and customs with his father, then this was a way he would distance himself from Samuel. By the time he reached his late teens, he had become firmly agnostic.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 April 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bohm attended [[Pennsylvania State University#Early years|Pennsylvania State College]] (now Pennsylvania State University), graduating in 1939, and then the [[California Institute of Technology]], for one year. He then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Radiation Laboratory, where he obtained his doctorate.

Bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of Oppenheimer's other graduate students ([[Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz]], Joseph Weinberg, and Max Friedman) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics. He was active in communist and communist-backed organizations, including the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]], the Campus Committee to Fight Conscription, and the [[American Peace Mobilization|Committee for Peace Mobilization]]. During his time at the Radiation Laboratory, Bohm was in a relationship with the future [[Betty Friedan]] and also helped to organize a local chapter of the [[Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians]], a small labor union affiliated to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).&lt;ref name=Garber&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garber |first1=Marjorie |last2=Walkowitz |first2=Rebecca |date=1995 |title=Secret Agents: The Rosenberg Case, McCarthyism and Fifties America |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ae2OAQAAQBAJ |location=New York|publisher=Routledge |pages=130–131 |isbn=9781135206949 |author-link1=Marjorie Garber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and doctorate==
===Manhattan Project contributions===
During [[World War II]], the [[Manhattan Project]] mobilized much of Berkeley's physics research in the effort to produce the first [[atomic bomb]]. Though Oppenheimer had asked Bohm to work with him at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] (the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb), the project's director, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie Groves]], would not approve Bohm's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with Weinberg, who had been suspected of [[espionage]].

During the war, Bohm remained at Berkeley, where he taught physics and conducted research in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], the [[synchrotron]] and the [[synchrocyclotron]]. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1943 by an unusual circumstance. According to biographer [[F. David Peat]] (see reference below, p.&amp;nbsp;64), "The scattering calculations (of collisions of protons and deuterons) that he had completed proved useful to the Manhattan Project and were immediately classified. Without security clearance, Bohm was denied access to his own work; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis, he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place!" To satisfy the University, Oppenheimer certified that Bohm had successfully completed the research. Bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the [[Calutron]]s at the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] facility in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], which was used for the [[Isotope separation#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic enrichment of uranium]] for the bomb dropped on [[Hiroshima]] in 1945.

===McCarthyism and leaving the United States===
After the war, Bohm became an assistant professor at [[Princeton University]]. He also worked closely with [[Albert Einstein]] at the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In May 1949, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] called upon Bohm to testify because of his previous ties to suspected communists. Bohm invoked his [[Fifth amendment rights of witness|Fifth Amendment]] right to refuse to testify, and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues.

In 1950, Bohm was arrested for refusing to answer the committee's questions. He was acquitted in May 1951, but Princeton had already suspended him. After his acquittal, Bohm's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at Princeton, but Princeton President [[Harold W. Dodds]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell Olwell: [http://web.mit.edu/sts/pubs/pdfs/MIT_STS_WorkingPaper_20_Olwell.pdf ''Physics and Politics in Cold War America: The Two Exiles of David Bohm''], Working Paper Number 20. Program in Science, Technology, and Society. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; decided not to renew Bohm's contract. Although Einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the Institute, Oppenheimer (who had served as the Institute's president since 1947) "opposed the idea and [...] advised his former student to leave the country."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1TutRoSE2XcC&amp;pg=PR130&amp;dq=bohm+einstein+oppenheimer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjonqfJspreAhVJt1MKHZdRBdsQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=bohm%20einstein%20oppenheimer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; His request to go to the [[University of Manchester]] received Einstein's support but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein to Patrick Blackett, 17 April 1951 (Albert Einstein archives).

===Quantum theory and Bohm diffusion===
{{main article|Bohm diffusion|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}
[[File:doppelspalt.svg|thumb|180px|The Bohmian trajectories for an electron going through the two-slit experiment. A similar pattern was also observed for single photons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1170.figures-only – Observing the Average Trajectories of Single Photons in a Two-Slit Interferometer&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During his early period, Bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics, particularly [[quantum mechanics]] and [[relativity theory]]. As a postgraduate at Berkeley, he developed a theory of [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], discovering the [[electron]] phenomenon now known as [[Bohm diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Bohm: ''The characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields'', in: A.&amp;nbsp;Guthrie, R.&amp;nbsp;K. Wakerling (eds.), McGraw–Hill, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, ''Quantum Theory'', published in 1951, was well received by Einstein, among others. But Bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book. Starting from the realization that the [[WKB approximation]] of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory, he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice A. de Gosson]], Basil J. Hiley: ''Zeno paradox for Bohmian trajectories: the unfolding of the metatron'', January&amp;nbsp;3, 2011 ([http://www.freewebs.com/cvdegosson/ZenoPaper.pdf PDF]&amp;nbsp;– retrieved 16 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm's aim was not to set out a deterministic, mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality, in contrast to the conventional approach.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Hiley: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/History_of_Bohm_s_QT.pdf ''Some remarks on the evolution of Bohm's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics''], 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He began to develop his own interpretation (the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]], also called the [[pilot wave]]  theory), the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory. He initially called his approach a [[hidden variable theories|hidden variable]] theory, but he later called it ''ontological theory'', reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found. Bohm and his colleague [[Basil Hiley]] later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an "interpretation in terms of hidden variables" to be too restrictive, especially since their variables, position, and momentum "are not actually hidden."&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'', edition published in the Taylor &amp; Francis e-library 2009 (first edition Routledge, 1993), {{ISBN|0-203-98038-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9XKjc4WAQC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm's work and the [[EPR paradox|EPR argument]] became the major factor motivating [[John Stewart Bell]]'s [[Bell's inequality|inequality]], which rules out [[locality principle|local]] hidden variable theories; the full consequences of Bell's work are still being investigated.

===Brazil===
After Bohm's arrival in Brazil on October 10, 1951, the US Consul in [[São Paulo]] confiscated his passport, informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country, which reportedly frightened Bohm&lt;ref&gt;Russell Olwell: ''[http://web.mit.edu/sts/pubs/pdfs/MIT_STS_WorkingPaper_20_Olwell.pdf Physics and politics in cold war America: the two exiles of David Bohm]'', Working Paper Number&amp;nbsp;2, Working Program in Science, Technology, and Society; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly lowered his spirits, as he had hoped to travel to Europe. He applied for and received [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazilian citizenship]], but by law, had to give up his [[US citizenship]]; he was able to reclaim it only decades later, in 1986, after pursuing a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="freire"&gt;[[Olival Freire, Jr.]]: ''[http://www.controversia.fis.ufba.br/index_arquivos/Freire-Bohm-HSPS.pdf Science and Exile: David Bohm, the cold war, and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326192406/http://www.controversia.fis.ufba.br/index_arquivos/Freire-Bohm-HSPS.pdf |date=26 March 2012 }}'', HSPS, vol.&amp;nbsp;36, Part&amp;nbsp;1, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–34, ISSN 0890-9997, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of São Paulo]], Bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952. [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] traveled to [[São Paulo]], where he worked with Bohm for three months; Ralph Schiller,  student of cosmologist [[Peter Bergmann]], was his assistant for two years; he worked with Tiomno and Walther Schützer; and [[Mario Bunge]] stayed to work with him for one year. He was in contact with Brazilian physicists [[Mário Schenberg]], [[Jean Meyer]], [[José Leite Lopes|Leite Lopes]], and had discussions on occasion with visitors to Brazil, including [[Richard Feynman]], [[Isidor Rabi]], [[Léon Rosenfeld]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Donald Kerst]], [[Marcos Moshinsky]], Alejandro Medina, and the former assistant to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Guido Beck]], who encouraged him in his work and helped him to obtain funding. The Brazilian [[CNPq]] explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around Bohm. His work with Vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and [[Louis De Broglie]], in particular, on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by [[Erwin Madelung|Madelung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb/fb13/Dateien/paf/paf73.html | title=Erwin Madelung 1881–1972 | publisher=[[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main]] | date=12 December 2008 | accessdate=May 8, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212130742/http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb/fb13/Dateien/paf/paf73.html | archivedate=12 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism, with many physicists holding the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="freire"/&gt;

From 1951 to 1953, Bohm and [[David Pines]] published the articles in which they introduced the [[random phase approximation]] and proposed the [[plasmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pines, D  |author2=Bohm, D.

===Bohm and Aharonov form of the EPR paradox===
In 1955 Bohm relocated to Israel, where he spent two years working at the [[Technion]], at [[Haifa]]. There, he met Sarah ("Saral") Woolfson, whom he married in 1956.

In 1957, Bohm and his student [[Yakir Aharonov]] published a new version of the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox]], reformulating the original argument in terms of spin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bohm, Y. Aharonov (1957), Discussion of Experimental Proof for the Paradox of Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky, Phys. Rev., vol.&amp;nbsp;108, no.&amp;nbsp;4, pp.&amp;nbsp;1070–1076 ([http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v108/i4/p1070_1 abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; It was that form of the EPR paradox that was discussed by [[John Stewart Bell]] in his famous paper of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.S. |last=Bell |title=On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox |journal=Physics |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=195–200 |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/111654/files/vol1p195-200_001.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aharonov–Bohm effect===
{{main article|Aharonov–Bohm effect}}
[[File:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|right|210px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid.]]
In 1957, Bohm relocated to the United Kingdom as a research fellow at the [[University of Bristol]]. In 1959, Bohm and Aharonov discovered the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded, but its vector potential did not vanish there. That showed for the first time that the [[magnetic vector potential]], hitherto a mathematical convenience, could have real physical (quantum) effects. 

In 1961, Bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the [[University of London]]'s [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], becoming emeritus in 1987. His collected papers are stored there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=3070&amp;inst_id=33 collected papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicate and explicate order===
{{main article|Implicate and explicate order}}
At Birkbeck College, much of the work of Bohm and [[Basil Hiley]] expanded on the notion of implicate, explicate, and generative orders proposed by Bohm.&lt;ref name="wholeness"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, Basil J. Hiley, Allan E.&amp;nbsp;G. Stuart: ''On a new mode of description in physics'', International Journal of Theoretical Physics, vol.&amp;nbsp;3, no.&amp;nbsp;3, pp.&amp;nbsp;171–183, {{doi|10.1007/BF00671000}}, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l2474245pw272842/ abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, F. David Peat: ''[[Science, Order, and Creativity]]'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Bohm and Hiley, "things, such as particles, objects, and indeed subjects" exist as "semi-autonomous quasi-local features" of an underlying activity. Such features can be considered to be independent only up to a certain level of approximation in which certain criteria are fulfilled. In that picture, the [[classical limit]] for quantum phenomena, in terms of a condition that the [[action (physics)|action function]] is not much greater than [[Planck's constant]], indicates one such criterion. They used the word "[[holomovement]]" for the activity in such orders.&lt;ref&gt;Basil J. Hiley: ''Process and the Implicate Order: their relevance to Quantum Theory and Mind.'' ([http://www.ctr4process.org/publications/Articles/LSI05/Hiley%20paper.pdf PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212330/http://www.ctr4process.org/publications/Articles/LSI05/Hiley%20paper.pdf |date=26 September 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holonomic model of the brain===
{{main article|Holonomic brain theory}}
[[File:Holography-reconstruct.png|thumb|200px|right|In a holographic reconstruction, each region of a photographic plate contains the whole image.]]
In collaboration with [[Stanford University]] neuroscientist [[Karl H. Pribram]], Bohm was involved in the early development of the [[holonomic model]] of the functioning of the brain, a model for human cognition that is drastically different from conventionally-accepted ideas.&lt;ref name = "holo"&gt;[http://www.acsa2000.net/bcngroup/jponkp/#chap4 Comparison between Karl Pribram's "Holographic Brain Theory" and more conventional models of neuronal computation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2014}} Bohm worked with Pribram on the theory that the brain operates in a manner that is similar to a [[hologram]], in accordance with quantum mathematical principles and the characteristics of wave patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/pribram.htm The holographic brain], with Karl Pribram&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consciousness and thought===
In addition to his scientific work, Bohm was deeply interested in exploring the nature of consciousness, with particular attention to the role of thought as it relates to attention, motivation, and conflict in the individual and in society. Those concerns were a natural extension of his earlier interest in [[Marxist ideology]] and [[Hegelian philosophy]]. His views were brought into sharper focus through extensive interactions with the psychological philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], beginning in 1961.&lt;ref name="Years"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Mary Lutyens]]|title=[[Krishnamurti: The Years of Fulfillment]]|chapter=Freedom is Not Choice|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.nz/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=WKmJndX5B8wC&amp;q=208#v=snippet&amp;q=208&amp;f=false|year=1983|publisher=Krishnamurti Foundation Trust Ltd.|isbn=0-900506-20-2|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uncommon"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Edmund Moody|title=An Uncommon Collaboration: David Bohm and J.

Bohm's prolonged involvement with the philosophy of Krishnamurti was regarded somewhat skeptically by some of his scientific peers.&lt;ref name="Infinite"&gt;{{cite book|author= F. David Peat|title=Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pobZMUmZbAEC|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0201328202|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; A more recent and extensive examination of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that Bohm's work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="Uncommon"/&gt;

The mature expression of Bohm's views in the psychological field was presented in a seminar conducted in 1990 at the [[Oak Grove School (Ojai, California)|Oak Grove School]], founded by Krishnamurti in [[Ojai, California]]. It was one of a series of seminars held by Bohm at Oak Grove School, and it was published as ''Thought as a System''.&lt;ref name="Thought"&gt;{{cite book|author= David Bohm|title=Thought as a System|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Thought_as_a_System.html?id=9Q-3WN0LajsC|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0415110303|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seminar, Bohm described the pervasive influence of thought throughout society, including the many erroneous assumptions about the nature of thought and its effects in daily life.

In the seminar, Bohm develops several interrelated themes. He points out that thought is the ubiquitous tool that is used to solve every kind of problem: personal, social, scientific, and so on. Yet thought, he maintains, is also inadvertently the source of many of those problems. He recognizes and acknowledges the irony of the situation: it is as if one gets sick by going to the doctor.&lt;ref name="Uncommon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thought"/&gt;

Bohm maintains that thought is a system, in the sense that it is an interconnected network of concepts, ideas and assumptions that pass seamlessly between individuals and throughout society. If there is a fault in the functioning of thought, therefore, it must be a systemic fault, which infects the entire network. The thought that is brought to bear to resolve any given problem, therefore, is susceptible to the same flaw that created the problem it is trying to solve.&lt;ref name="Uncommon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thought"/&gt;

Thought proceeds as if it is merely reporting objectively, but in fact, it is often coloring and distorting perception in unexpected ways. What is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought, according to Bohm, is a form of proprioception, or self-awareness. Neural receptors throughout the body inform us directly of our physical position and movement, but there is no corresponding awareness of the activity of thought. Such an awareness would represent psychological proprioception and would enable the possibility of perceiving and correcting the unintended consequences of the thinking process.&lt;ref name="Uncommon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thought"/&gt;

===Further interests===
In his book ''On Creativity'', quoting the work of Korzybski, Bohm expressed the view that "metaphysics is an expression of a world view" and is "thus to be regarded as an art form, resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others, rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bohm|title=On Creativity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcd4SsIjVKUC&amp;pg=PA118|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76818-7|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm was keenly aware of various ideas outside the scientific mainstream. In his book ''Science, Order and Creativity'', Bohm referred to the views of various biologists on the evolution of the species, including [[Rupert Sheldrake]].&lt;ref name="BohmPeat2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bohm|author2=F. David Peat|title=Science, Order and Creativity Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZTsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83546-2|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also knew the ideas of [[Wilhelm Reich]].&lt;ref name="Peat1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. David Peat|title=Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JPvAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-40635-1|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to many other scientists, Bohm did not exclude the [[paranormal]] out of hand. Bohm temporarily even held [[Uri Geller]]'s bending of keys and spoons to be possible, prompting warning remarks by his colleague [[Basil Hiley]] that it might undermine the scientific credibility of their work in physics. [[Martin Gardner]] reported this in a ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' article and also critiqued the views of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], with whom Bohm had met in 1959 and had had many subsequent exchanges. Gardner said that Bohm's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter (on one occasion, he summarized, "Even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781134914173|page=443|editor1=Hiley, Basil|editor2=Peat, F.

===Bohm dialogue===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Change management]]. --&gt;
{{main article|Bohm Dialogue}}
To address societal problems during his later years, Bohm wrote a proposal for a solution that has become known as "[[Bohm Dialogue]]", in which equal status and "free space" form the most important prerequisites of communication and the appreciation of differing personal beliefs. An essential ingredient in this form of dialogue is that participants "suspend" immediate action or judgment and give themselves and each other the opportunity to become aware of the thought process itself. Bohm suggested that if the "dialogue groups" were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale, they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that Bohm observed in society.

==Later life==
Bohm continued his work in quantum physics after his retirement, in 1987. His final work, the posthumously-published ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'' (1993), resulted from a decades-long collaboration with [[Basil Hiley]]. He also spoke to audiences across Europe and North America on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy, a concept he borrowed from London psychiatrist and practitioner of [[Group Analysis]] [[Patrick de Maré]], and he had a series of meetings with the [[Dalai Lama]]. He was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

Near the end of his life, Bohm began to experience a recurrence of the [[depression (mood)|depression]] that he had suffered earlier in life. He was admitted to the [[Maudsley Hospital]] in [[South London]] on 10 May 1991. His condition worsened and it was decided that the only treatment that might help him was [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Bohm's wife consulted psychiatrist David Shainberg, Bohm's longtime friend and collaborator, who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option. Bohm showed improvement from the treatments and was released on 29 August, but his depression returned and was treated with medication.&lt;ref name="F.&amp;nbsp;David Peat 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;308–317"&gt;F.

Bohm died after suffering a [[heart attack]] in [[Hendon]], London, on 27 October 1992, at 74.&lt;ref name="F. David Peat 1997, pp. 308–317"&gt;F.

== Reception of causal program ==
In the early 1950s, Bohm's causal quantum theory program was mostly negatively received, with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both Bohm personally and his ideas. There was a significant revival of interest in Bohm's ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s; the Ninth Symposium of the Colston Research Society in Bristol in 1957 was a key turning point toward greater tolerance of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|date=2017|title=The missing history of Bohm’s hidden variables theory: the Ninth Symposium of the Colston Research Society, Bristol, 1957|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219817300539|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2017.06.003|bibcode=2018SHPMP..62...85K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rai Bahadur]] '''Daya Ram Sahni''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]]&lt;/small&gt; (16 December 1879 &amp;ndash; 7 March 1939) was an Indian archaeologist who supervised the excavation of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus valley site]] at [[Harappa]] in 1921-22. A protege of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], in 1931, Sahni became the first Indian to be appointed Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), a position in which he served till 1935.

== Early life and education ==

Daya Ram Sahni hailed from the city of [[Bhera]] in [[Shahpur district]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] where he was born on 16 December 1879. Sahni graduated in [[Sanskrit]] from the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] with a gold medal. He also topped the M. A. examination from the Oriental College in 1903. As a result of this accomplishments, Sahni won the Sanskrit scholarship sponsored by the Archaeological Survey of India and recruited by the survey on completion of his education.

== As archaeologist ==

In 1903, Sahni was posted to the Punjab and United Provinces circle where he worked under [[J. Ph. Vogel]]. Sahni was involved in the excavation of Kasia in 1905 and [[Rajgir]] in [[Bihar]] under John Marshall in January–February 1906. In September 1907, Sahni assisted Marshall in the excavation of a ''[[stupa]]'' at [[Rampurva]] in [[Champaran district]]. He also prepared a catalogue of archaeological ruins at [[Sarnath]].

Sahni worked as [[curator]] of [[Lucknow Museum]] from 1911 to 1912, when he was transferred to the archaeology department of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir state]]. Sahni returned to Lahore in 1917 and was made incharge of United Provinces and Punjab. While working as Assistant Superintendent, Sahni excavated the Indus Valley site at Harappa, the first of the Indus Valley sites to be excavated.

In 1925, Sahni was transferred to [[Delhi]] as Deputy Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India and in July 1931, he succeeded Hargeaves as the Director-General of the ASI. Sahni was the first native Indian to be appointed to the post.

== Honours ==

Sahni was awarded a "Rai Bahadur" medal in March 1920 by the Governor of Punjab at a durbar in [[Rawalpindi]]. Soon after his retirement from the ASI in 1935, Sahni was made a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire]]. archaeologist

'''Diogo Alves '''(1810 – February 19, 1841) was a Spanish-born Portuguese [[serial killer]]. Between 1836 and 1840, he killed several dozen people. The crimes he committed were all in the area of the [[Águas Livres Aqueduct]], thus earning the "Aqueduct Murderer". He was [[sentenced to death]] and hanged on February 19, 1841. The head of the killer was separated from the body and placed in a flask to preserve it for scientific purposes, where it is now a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pereulki.com/2015/06/ubijtsa-s-akveduka-istoriya-diogo-alvesha-samogo-izvestnogo-prestupnika-portugalii/ The 'Aqueduct Murderer' Diogo Alves: Famous Portuguese Murderer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in a peasant family, Alves fell from the family horse while at a young age and hit his head, earning the nickname Pancada ("blow"). At the age of nineteen, his parents sent him to work in Lisbon. After changing several jobs and ceasing to write to his parents, he began to drink and gamble, meeting up with innkeeper Maria "Parreirinha" Gertrudes. It is believed that this connection instigated Alves to kill. He began to commit crimes, earning a second nickname "The Aqueduct Murderer". He robbed poor passers-by, and then dumped them from a height of 60 meters to simultaneously avoid identification and present the deaths as suicides, which he initially succeeded in.

Murders on the aqueduct remained unproven, but the jury sentenced Alves and his gang for other crimes, in particular, murdering the four family members of a doctor. Maria's 11-year-old daughter, Maria de Conceicao, testified in court against the gang. Her mother was eventually sent to a lifelong exile in [[Africa]]n colonies.

Alves became the penultimate (often mistakenly claimed to be the last) hanged criminal in Portugal. His actions at the time intrigued scientists from the then Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon. After his hanging, in an attempt to study his brain, Alves' head was cut off and studied. To this day it is still preserved in a glass vessel, where a [[solution]] of [[formaldehyde]] has perpetuated the image of calm man—quite contrary to what he really was. Scientists could never explain what led him to buy a false key for the Aqueducts, where he was hiding, and how many people he had robbed and killed.The severed head is currently in the [[anatomical]] theater of the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Medicine, following the formation of a [[phrenology]] cabinet made by José Lourenço da Luz Gomes, which allowed the preservation of Alves' skull, along with that of Matos Lobo (being one of the last subjects to whom the [[Capital punishment in Portugal|death penalty in Portugal]] was applied, something quite significant for the judicial history of Portugal) in the old medical-surgical school. The head of Diogo Alves was one of the most significant—and undoubtedly horrific—objects of the passage in ''One hundred pieces for the Museum of Medicine'', which took place in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art]] in 2005.

He taught for two years thereafter in the public schools of Iberia and [[St. Martin Parish|St. Martin]] parishes.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;"Edwin Sidney Broussard", ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'', Vol. 1 (1988), [[Louisiana Historical Association]] publication, pp. 113–14.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], Broussard volunteered for the [[United States Army]]. A [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in [[Cuba]], in 1898 and 1899, he accompanied the [[Taft Commission]] to the [[Philippine Islands]] in 1899 and served as an assistant secretary. He returned to the United States in 1900 and graduated the next year from the [[Tulane University Law School]] in [[New Orleans]]. In 1901, he was admitted in 1901 to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and established his practice in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], the Iberia Parish [[County seat|seat of government]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Broussard was [[prosecuting attorney]] for the Louisiana 19th Judicial District from 1903 to 1908. Between 1914 and 1916, he affiliated with the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], formed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had gained national attention for organizing the [[Rough Riders]] in the Spanish–American War. Broussard opposed the New Orleans Democratic party machine, known as the [[Regular Democratic Organization|Old Regulars]]. Broussard ran unsuccessfully in 1916 for [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]] on an intra-party Progressive [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] with [[governor of  Louisiana|gubernatorial]] candidate [[John M. Parker]], another Roosevelt loyalist. Broussard lost to Fernand Mouton. Parker was defeated that year too by [[Ruffin G. Pleasant]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], but rebounded to victory for governor in 1920 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1920, Broussard was elected as a Democrat to fill the seat vacated two years earlier by his late brother, U. S. Senator [[Robert F. Broussard]]. He defeated [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] former Governor [[Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.]] Broussard was a strong advocate of the sugar [[tariff]] and federal [[flood control]] projects important to his state. He was reelected in 1926 by defeating Sanders once again and with the then support of [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]er and later Governor [[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]] The [[Ku Klux Klan]] rallied against Broussard because of his [[Roman Catholicism]] in support of Sanders. He was denied renomination in the 1932 Democratic [[primary election]] by Huey Long's choice for the position, [[John H. Overton|John Holmes Overton]] of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Long had backed Broussard in 1926 and Broussard had supported Long for governor in 1928 but not for senator in 1930. Broussard had called upon Long as senator-elect to resign as governor and turn over the office to Lieutenant Governor [[Paul N. Cyr]], a Long former ally turned opponent. Long remained senator-elect for more than a year, however, and did not work well with Broussard as his fellow senator. Broussard even praised his own former opponent, Jared Y. Sanders, whom Long had helped Broussard to defeat. Long by then considered Broussard "a conservative" in the mold of Sanders and favored the more moderate Overton as Broussard's Senate replacement.&lt;ref name=hpl/&gt; 

In his [[autobiography]], ''[[Every Man a King]]'', Long took credit for Broussard's re-election to his second Senate term: "I supported him, and he hasn't a friend in the state who would say that he could have been elected to the Senate in 1926 if it had not been for me. ... Are his attacks on me a return of such favors? Is that the way some people have of repaying others for help that they get from them? ... Now Senator Broussard attacks me, without cause, and praises J. Y. Sanders. ..."&lt;ref name=hpl&gt;[[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], ''Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long'' ([[New Orleans]]: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his defeat, Broussard resumed his law practice and tended to [[banking]] and financial affairs in New Iberia, where he died in 1934 and is interred there at St. Peter's Cemetery.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Personal life==
On June 5, 1904, Broussard married Marie Clair Patout (1878{{ndash}}1945),&lt;ref name=mcp/&gt; the daughter of Felix Patout (1834{{ndash}}1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Patout&amp;GSfn=Claire&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=28935612&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Felix Patout|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French people|French]] woman Claire Tate (1854{{ndash}}1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Patout&amp;GSfn=Claire&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=28935612&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Claire Tate Patout|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had six children, including Mary Louise Broussard Brown (1910–2010); John Dorville Broussard (1913–1989); Edwin S.

'''Elie Yossef''' (also Eli Joseph, {{lang-he|אֵלִי יוֹסֵף}}) is a London-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] educator and political activist.

Eli Yossef grew up in [[London]] and attended the [[Hasmonean High School]] where he established [[Betar]] [[England]] in 1973. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 1975, Yossef emigrated to [[Israel]] and served in the [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] and [[Paratroopers]] brigades of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. After completing his military service, Yossef studied at [[Machon Meir]] and [[Hebrew University]]. In 1988, Yossef founded a [[Youth Aliyah]] (Aliyat haNoar) high school for new immigrants from France. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}In 1997, he organized a military preparatory program for [[Jewish]] students from abroad interested in volunteering in Israel's army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajerusalemhome.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=57 Eli Joseph Biography - Eli Joseph's Jerusalem Real Estate Homepage and Buyer's Guide - A Jerusalem Home.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
One of his major causes is freeing [[Jonathan Pollard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/68367 Special Pollard Session Next Week - Inside Israel - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000, Yossef conducted a hunger strike on Pollard's behalf outside of Israel's Parliament. He argued that anyone who passes classified information to the State of Israel regarding enemy intentions to harm Israel is morally innocent even if technically guilty by American law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafi.org.il/agenda/english/index4.asp#4 Agenda-English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Yossef traveled to numerous Israeli high-schools and spoke of Pollard's plight as a moral national issue. Yossef's efforts to free Pollard has led him to collaborate with former Prisoners of Zion [[Natan Sharansky]] and Rabbi [[Yosef Mendelevitch]] over the years, highlighting the similarities between their situations in the Soviet Union and Pollard's in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estherpollard.org/2003/112403.htm Eli Joseph to Speak on Pollard at Manhigut Yehudit Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanpollard.org/2004/041304.htm Mendelovitch and Joseph Arrested Last Night; Another Pollard Demo Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yossef has urged the Israeli government to establish what happened to [[Raoul Wallenberg]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomat who saved countless Jews from the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] but was arrested following the war by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents and disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/71805 For Pollard: Classes, Prayers, Visits and Hunger Strike - Jewish World - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the violent confrontation at [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]] between the [[Israeli police]] and [[settler]] teenagers in early 2006, Yossef led [[Magshimey Herut|Mehi]] activists on a three-week hunger strike vigil protesting violence between Jews. The activists displayed banners and handed out fliers calling on the Israeli government and settler leadership to seek out ways to avoid future bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=98602 on A7radio: New Hunger Strike, Gush Katif Refugee Speaks - On A7 Radio - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yossef has called on the government of Israel to cut diplomatic ties to [[Russia]] due to Russia's involvement in [[Iran]]'s nuclear development program.&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews.com"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/121699 Russia Moves in Support of Syria, Iran, Hamas-Led PA - Defense/Middle East - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/121706 Jewish Cowardliness Exposed - On A7 Radio - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   Yossef told [[Israel National Radio]]'s [[Yishai Fleisher]] that "the Jewish People must find the moral courage to stand up to super-powers in such situations."&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews.com"/&gt;

Yossef actively opposed the [[Camp David Accords]] with [[Egypt]] and Israel's subsequent withdrawal from the [[Sinai Peninsula]]).  Yossef has referred to himself as a "Humanitarian Zionist".

Yossef now works as a [[real estate agent]]. In August 2005 he founded the Eli Joseph Jerusalem Real Estate company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajerusalemhome.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 Home - Eli Joseph's Jerusalem Real Estate Homepage and Buyer's Guide - A Jerusalem Home.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gao Yu''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|高瑜}}}}; born 23 February 1944)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nchrd.org/2014/12/prisoner-of-conscience-gao-yu/ |title=Gao Yu (高瑜) |date=2 December 2014 |website=[[Chinese Human Rights Defenders]] |access-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Chinese [[journalist]] and [[dissident]] who has been repeatedly imprisoned.&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt;

==Early life==
Gao was born in [[Chongqing]]. She attended the Language and Literature Department at the [[Renmin University of China]], where she majored in [[Literary theory|Literary Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrohk.com.hk/index.php?cmd=detail&amp;id=232859|title=爆機密拘高瑜|publisher=metrohk.com.hk|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gao began her journalism career in 1979, as a reporter for the [[China News Service]].&lt;ref name=IPI&gt;Michael Kudlak, [http://www.freemedia.at/Heroes_IPIReport2.00/17Gao.htm IPI World Press Freedom Heroes: Gao Yu], ''IPI Report'', June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, she became deputy chief editor of ''Economics Weekly'', edited by dissident intellectuals.&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt; She also worked as a [[freelance journalist]] for different newspapers in [[China]] and in [[Hong Kong]]. In November 1988, she published an article in Hong Kong’s ''Mirror Monthly'', which was described by [[Beijing]]'s Mayor [[Chen Xitong]] as a "political program for turmoil and rebellion". He even branded her as a "people's enemy".&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt; She was arrested in 1989, after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Issues: Press Freedom {{!}} IWMF - Part 9532|url = http://www.iwmf.org/press/9532|website = www.iwmf.org|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released 15 months later because of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Document {{!}} Amnesty International|url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA17/016/1999/en/|website = www.amnesty.org|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gao was arrested again in October 1993, and in November 1994 was sentenced to six years, accused of having "published state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Chinese dissident gets medical parole|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/279946.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 1999-02-15|access-date = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China: "Leaking State Secrets": The Case of Gao Yu|url = https://www.hrw.org/summaries/s.china957.html|website = www.hrw.org|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, she was given parole in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA170161999?open&amp;of=ENG-2S2 AI, 4 February 1999, Gao Yu: People's Republic of China]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EST LIBÉRÉE POUR RAISONS MÉDICALES|url = http://www.ifex.org/1999/02/16/est_lib_r_e_pour_raisons_m_dicales/fr/|website = IFEX|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA17/016/1999/en/ "China: Update Medical Letter Writing Action: Gao Yu"]. Amnesty International, 5 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Gao was arrested again a few weeks ahead of the 25th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square crackdown]]. The detention of the outspoken 70-year-old journalist was just one of several detentions of government critics over the previous days ahead of the politically sensitive 4 June anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gao Yu arrested by Chinese authorities|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/gao-yu-arrested-by-chinese-authorities|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-26|first = Associated Press in|last = Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Beijing's high court convicted Gao of leaking state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/asia/china-journalist-gao-yu-gets-7-year-sentence.html |title=Chinese Journalist Sentenced to 7 Years on Charges of Leaking State Secrets |date=16 April 2015 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], the authorities accused Gao of sending "[[Document Number Nine]]" to a foreign news organization, although the document had already been posted online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.rsf.org/china-reporters-without-borders-reveals-17-04-2015,47785.html "Reporters Without Borders Reveals State Secrets In Reaction To Gao Yu’s Sentence"]. Reporters Without Borders, 17 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Following an appeal, her sentence was reduced to five years on 26 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Imprisoned Chinese journalist's jail time reduced|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/imprisoned-chinese-journalist-jail-time-reduced-151126054722547.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours later, Chinese state media announced she has been released on medical parole, however the conviction for leaking state secrets was not overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jailed Chinese journalist Gao Yu released on medical parole|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/26/jailed-chinese-journalist-gao-yu-sentence-cut-appeal|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, she is serving a five-year sentence under house arrest.&lt;ref name="ej160401"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beijing police ransack dissident’s home after praise by Germany|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20160401-beijing-police-ransack-dissidents-home-after-praise-by-germany/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German president [[Joachim Gauck]], on his first state visit to China in March 2016, raised the plight of Gao with the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="nytimes160324"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatlow|first1=Didi Kirsten|title=German President Presses China on Political Prisoners During Visit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/asia/china-germany-joachim-gauck.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gao once wrote for the German broadcaster [[Deutsche Welle]].&lt;ref name="nytimes160324"/&gt; Days after Gauck's comments on Gao, Beijing municipal authorities and police raided her home, demolishing her study which they claimed was an illegal structure, and ransacking the rest of her home.&lt;ref name="ej160401"/&gt; Gao put up a fight but collapsed due to apparent high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="ej160401"/&gt; Gao stated that the raid was illegal and the authorities gave no advance notice.&lt;ref name="ej160401"/&gt; Sources claimed that the raid was conducted in retaliation for the German premier's comments.&lt;ref name="ej160401"/&gt; Gao's home has been ransacked by the police before, when they came to arrest her in 2014.&lt;ref name="ej160401"/&gt;

==Awards==
While incarcerated, Gao Yu received the [[WAN-IFRA]] (World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers) [[Golden Pen of Freedom]] and the [[IWMF]] (International Women's Media Foundation) ''Courage in Journalism Award'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Press Freedom Resolution: Calling for the Release of Golden Pen Laureates and All Jailed Journalists - WAN-IFRA|url = http://www.wan-ifra.org/articles/2015/05/25/press-freedom-resolution-calling-for-the-release-of-golden-pen-laureates-and-all|website = www.wan-ifra.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Courage in Journalism Awards: Awardees 1990-2015 {{!}} IWMF|url = http://www.iwmf.org/our-impact/courage-in-journalism-awards/award-winners/|website = www.iwmf.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, she became the first journalist to receive the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1997 - Gao Yu, China: UNESCO-CI|url = http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=5709&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|website = portal.unesco.org|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 she was named one of [[International Press Institute]]'s 50 [[World Press Freedom Heroes]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt;

Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;/March 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Obrenovitch, The Boy Pretender to the shaky throne of Servia. | newspaper = [[Detroit Free Press]] | pages = D5 | date = 25 February 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 9 October 1925)&lt;ref name=last/&gt; born '''Obren Christich''' was the [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] son of King [[Milan I of Serbia]] and his [[Greeks|Greek]] mistress Artemisia Hristić (née Joanides). After the [[regicide]] of his half brother King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander]] in 1903 George became a claimant to the Serbian throne in opposition to the new king, [[Peter I Karadordevic]] before ending his life in obscurity.

==Birth and family background==
Although commonly known as George Obrenović he was born in [[Belgrade]]&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; as Obren Hristić. Acknowledged by King Milan as his son, he was given the name Obren at birth to underline his kinship to the ruling [[House of Obrenović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Ex-King Milan | volume = LV | issue = 6 | newspaper = [[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | pages = 5 | date = 8 January 1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband of George’s mother was Milan Hristić, the king’s private secretary and son of the Serbian statesman [[Filip Hristić]].

The relationship between the parents of George and the fact his mother was living in the Royal Palace, caused a great scandal and resulted in Queen [[Natalie of Serbia|Natalie]] fleeing Belgrade with her son Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander]] for [[Wiesbaden]] in the German Empire. His mother’s husband was subsequently removed from his position as private secretary and sent abroad as Serbian Minister to [[Berlin]] on condition his wife stays in Belgrade. This appointment fell through however after the Berlin court made it clear he was unwelcome so he was instead sent to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Servia is a hotbed of wicked plots | newspaper = The Dupuyer Acantha | pages = 18 | date = 21 September 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although King Milan had given a written promise of marriage to Artemisia his attempts to divorce Queen Natalie were opposed by Michael, the [[Metropolitan of Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Milan's new intrigue | newspaper = [[The Evening Telegram]] | pages = 3 | date = 10 January 1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually both of George’s parents secured divorces from their respective spouses. Five months after his divorce on 6 March 1889 King Milan abdicated from the Serbian throne angering George’s mother. After eventually growing tired of ex-King Milan’s demands for money from her, Artemisa took George to live in [[Constantinople]] where her father lived and had acquired substantial wealth first as a landscape gardener and architect to the [[Ottoman sultan]] and later in Banking.&lt;ref name=MDF1908&gt;{{Citation | title = Marquise de Fontenoy | newspaper = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] | pages = 10 | date = 18 April 1908 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-King Milan then broke off his promise of marriage and turned instead to the Serbian government for financial assistance&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; and was eventually even reconciled with his ex-wife Queen Natalie on 8 March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = [[Almanach de Gotha]] | publisher = [[Justus Perthes]] | edition =159th | year = 1922 | pages = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbian pretender==

With the breakdown of the relationship of his parents George was raised in a privileged environment by his mother in Constantinople.&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; Following the death in 1901 of his father in exile in [[Vienna]], George’s life changed. Some of his late father’s friends who were appalled by his half brother King Alexander’s treatment of King Milan took an interest in him as a possible candidate for the Serbian throne. One friend, the Hungarian count Eugene Zichy, assumed the role of his guardian. Count Eugene generally treated him as his own son and attempted to get the agreement of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] to enrol George in the [[Theresian Military Academy]].&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; However, as his pretensions to the Serbian throne were not viewed favourably in Vienna the emperor refused to allow his enrolment.&lt;ref name=MDF1903&gt;{{Citation | title = Letter of Marquise de Fontenoy | newspaper = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] | pages = 6 | date = 20 October 1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the natural son of King Milan and even though his half brother and his consort [[Draga Mašin|Queen Draga]] were without an heir George was not seen by his half brother as a possible successor to the throne. Instead the queens brother Nikodije Lunjevica and [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro]], who was married to [[Natalija Konstantinović]] (granddaughter of [[Princess Anka Obrenović]]) were talked of as being named the heir.

After the regicide of his half brother King Alexander and his consort Queen Draga in 1903 the throne of Serbia was offered to Prince [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Karageorgevich]] whose family had a decades long feud with the Obrenović’s over the throne. As the sole male line descendant of the Obrenović’s, George’s guardian Count Eugene claimed that his father King Milan had legally adopted him and as such this was enough to legitimise him, and his claims to the throne and make him the heir to his father and half brother.&lt;ref name=MDF1903/&gt; George had support within Serbia in the aftermath of the regicide with his supporters posting proclamations in Belgrade and fighting with supporters of the newly elected king, Peter Karageorgevich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Peter Accepts | newspaper = The Chenango Semi-Weekly Telegraph | pages = 4 | date = 17 June 1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were reports that George and his mother were to cross over into Serbia nothing came of this&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Porte Notified | newspaper = The Deseret News | pages = 1 | date = 16 June 1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ottoman sultan advised his mother that he should be kept off the streets over fears that he would be assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fears attempt to kill young Milan | newspaper = Easton Free Press | pages = 1 | date = 17 June 1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, three years after the death of his half brother and the accession of King Peter Karageorgevich, George made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the throne of Serbia.&lt;ref name=adg&gt;{{Cite book | title = [[Almanach de Gotha]] | publisher = Almanach de Gotha | volume = 1 |edition=186th | year = 2003 | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June while studying in [[Klausenburg]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] a dispute in a coffee shop led to a [[duel]] with swords being fought between George and a university student. Although he survived the duel he came off worse sustaining injuries to his head, shoulder and breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = King's son is wounded in duel with student |page=4 | newspaper = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 19 June 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a further blow at the end of that year when his guardian Count Eugene Zichy died on Boxing Day&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Count Eugene Zichy | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 27 December 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving George little in his will having used his own money to support his pretensions, as King Milan had left nothing to his son.&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; All was not lost however as he still had a large inheritance to look forward to from his grandfather in Constantinople.

==Fall into obscurity==

Back in the Ottoman capital in February 1907 George survived an assassination attempt when a man wielding a dagger attempted to stab him in his chest, however he escaped with just a scratch after the dagger hit a thick pocket book he was carrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Tries to kill Milan's son | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 7 February 1907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five months later in July 1907 a bomb went off outside the US Embassy in Constantinople. As George lived in a house adjourning the embassy word spread that it was an assassination attempt by agents of King Peter Karageorgevich. This explanation for the bombing was met with some scepticism and viewed by some as an attempt to use the explosion to keep George in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bomb not for Leishman | newspaper = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | pages = 7 | date = 17 July 1908 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month it was reported that he had attempted to take his own life after the Ottoman authorities had refused to allow him to assume the surname Obrenović.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Cable News | volume = XXIX | issue = 7268 | newspaper = [[Ashburton Guardian]] | pages = 2 | date = 8 January 1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There may however have been other issues on his mind as an investigation into the bombing concluded that George had set it up himself to make it look like an attempt on his life. As a result, he was expelled from Turkey by the Sultan. The discovery also cost George his inheritance from his grandfather who was furious at his grandsons actions wrote him out of his will. His grandfather died later that year before any chance for reconciliation could ever take place.&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt;
         
Now banished from Turkey George made his way to Paris before heading to [[Austria-Hungary]] where he received some support from his late father’s friends&lt;ref name=MDF1908/&gt; who saw the potential that he may oneday ascend the Serbian throne.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;{{Citation |last= Spencer |first=James | title = Traded claim to throne to lead life of dishonour | newspaper = [[The Atlanta Constitution]] | pages = B1 | date = 18 April 1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help boost his finances failed attempts were also made to secure a rich wife from Austria-Hungary or America for him. When the support came to an end he largely disappeared from view travelling around Europe and falling into debt.&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt; Eventually he fell into comparative poverty and tried his hand at a number of different jobs to survive.&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{Citation | title = Son of King Milan is waiter on dining car | newspaper = [[The Miami News]] | pages = 7 | date = 19 August 1916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his attempt to work in the Austro-Hungarian state ministries failed due his lack of qualifications he worked at various jobs such as a stable boy and professional jockey&lt;ref name=last&gt;{{Citation | title = Last Obronovitch Dies | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 11 October 1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before trying his hand at singing in Café’s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = King's son a cafe singer | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 28 January 1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on stage, until he was forced to abandon that career by the police due to the fact he had been billing himself as a prince.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt; He then went on to work as a waiter, and a porter in sleeping cars on the [[Orient Express]].&lt;ref name=last/&gt; His name reappeared in connection to his old pretensions during the [[World War I]] when it was falsely reported in January 1916 that he had been proclaimed [[King of Serbia]] by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Proclaim new Serb King?; Italian Story That Teutons Have Chosen Natural Son of Milan | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 13 January 1916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

George later went on to become a writer however the only book he ever wrote, which was about the life of his father King Milan, was suppressed by the Serbian government. George Obrenović died penniless in a Hungarian [[poorhouse]] on 9 October 1925.&lt;ref name=last/&gt;

==Possible descendants==

According to a 2003 article by the Serbian media company [[Novosti AD]], George had a son called Stefan who served as a cavalry captain in the [[French Army]]. Stefan in turn had a son named Panta (Panka) Obrenović (also known as Mark Eme) who served as chairman of the "Fund Obrenović" until his death in [[Paris]] in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nasleđe umesto krune |author=Milorad BOŠNJAK |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:143406-Nasle273e-umesto-krune |newspaper=[[Novosti AD]] |date=11 January 2003 |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- two paragraphs: one to cover radio up to and including the 'hamish &amp; andy show' and the second to cover their specials and shows outside of the 'hamish &amp; andy show' since 2006 --&gt;
The duo began [[Radio personality|presenting radio]]&lt;!-- in 0000, --&gt; on the [[Student Youth Network]], in the Friday afternoon drivetime slot&lt;!-- , which Lee/Blake says equipped him/them with ''useful experience and the ability to cope with most situations'' --&gt;. In 2003, soon after Hamish began writing for the [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|Fox FM]] breakfast show ([[The Matt &amp; Jo Show]]), the pair began hosting a Monday night late-night radio program called ''Almost Tuesday'' on the same station. &lt;!-- ''Unpaid, difficulties.'' --&gt; The duo then hosted the Fox FM program, ''Almost Midday'' on Saturday mornings, which was so successful it was syndicated nationally across the [[Today Network]]. &lt;!-- ''Ratings improved.'' --&gt;From 2006, they host the two-hour afternoon program, ''[[Hamish &amp; Andy (radio show)|Hamish &amp; Andy]]'', formerly ''The Hamish &amp; Andy Show'', on the [[Today Network]] in all [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] of Australia and in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2009/01/05/hamish-andy-take-on-tasmania/ |title=Hamish &amp; Andy take on Tasmania |accessdate=17 February 2010|work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekly highlights package is also broadcast in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/radio-duo-hamish-and-andy-beam-into-britain/story-e6frf96o-1225811894156 |title=Radio duo Hamish and Andy beam into Britain |accessdate=17 February 2010|work=[[The Herald Sun]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo have presented two radio specials on [[BBC 6 Music]] in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2009 and 26 January 2010&lt;!-- , consisting primarily of excerpts/segments from the duo appearances on previous episodes of ''The Hamish &amp; Andy Show'' --&gt;. On Friday 11 June it was announced on the Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show that Hamish &amp; Andy would be presenting three shows in London during July 2010 to cover Christian's holiday. Hamish and Andy signed a deal to present a series of shows to air on [[Absolute Radio]] Sunday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/22/absolute-radio-hamish-and-andy|title=Absolute Radio signs Australian duo Hamish &amp; Andy|date=22 June 2010|last=Busfield|first=Steve|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Business Brunch''/''Happy Hour''===
As of January 2013, the pair moved their weekly drive show from Fridays to Mondays from 4 p.m, and added a one-hour show from 9 a.m. Tuesdays through Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/2012/big-announcement/ | title=Big announcement | publisher=Hamish &amp; Andy | date=23 November 2012 | accessdate=23 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This second show is known as ''[[Hamish &amp; Andy (radio show)#Hamish &amp; Andy's Business Brunch|Hamish &amp; Andy's Business Brunch]]'', during which they cover every single topic in the world, one topic per show. The list of topics for every week is updated the week before and listeners are encouraged to contribute any 'expertise' or assistance to the discussion of any particular topic covered on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/topics|title=Business Brunch Topics|publisher=Hamish &amp; Andy|accessdate=12 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330231130/http://www.hamishandandy.com/topics/|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement lasted six months, until they shifted to a one-hour program at 3 p.m. every weekday afternoon called ''[[Hamish &amp; Andy (radio show)#Hamish &amp; Andy's Happy Hour|Hamish &amp; Andy's Happy Hour]]''. Similar to the Business Brunch, it address one topic each day, but this topic is merely a starting point for the day's conversation.

===Early days===
Blake united with Lee in 2003 when they developed a [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]] [[sketch show]], called ''Radio Karate'', with friends [[Ryan Shelton]] and Tim Bartley. Blake reunited with Lee in 2004 when they were named hosts of a new [[Seven Network]] variety program, ''The Hamish and Andy Show'', a show described as a successor to ''[[Big Bite]]''. It premiered in &lt;!-- on 00 Month --&gt;2004, and steadily built a moderate cult audience. However the show did not rate well and was cancelled after its initial run of six episodes.&lt;ref name="the age"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Nancarrow |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/culture/hamish-amp-andy/2007/04/02/1175366136794.html?page=fullpage |title=Hamish &amp; Andy |accessdate=17 February 2010|work=[[The Age]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Lee says he was not saddened by ''The Hamish and Andy Show'''s cancellation as he believed it was primarily controlled by the network which would have achieved ratings success if they had been given greater creative control. --&gt;

===''Rove'' and guest appearances===
[[File:Hamish Blake and Andrew G - Joker Poker 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Hamish Blake, with [[Andrew Günsberg]], appearing on ''[[Joker Poker]]'' in 2005.]]

In 2005, they were recruited by comedian [[Rove McManus]], to develop the [[Satire|satirical]] television comedy series, ''[[Real Stories]]'', which aired on Network Ten in 2006. From 2007 to 2009, the duo appeared fortnightly on ''Rove'' in a mixture of pre-recorded segments and live appearances. They hosted the [[Logie Awards|Logie awards]] in 2007 and 2008 (and went on to open the 2013 and 2014 ceremonies), and the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA awards]] in 2008. They appeared on ''[[Joker Poker]]'' and ''[[Australia's Brainiest|Australia's Brainiest Comedian]]'' in 2005, ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Good News Week]]'' in 2010&lt;!-- 10 May 2010 --&gt;. The group appeared on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' twice in 2009, &lt;!-- 16 September 2009 and 3 November 2009 --&gt; and on ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The 7pm Project]]'' numerous times from 2009,&lt;!-- 10 September 2009, 5 February 2010 and 8 February 2010--&gt; in a similar manner as they did on ''Rove''. They appeared on UKs ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' in June 2010.

===Network Ten specials===
The duo have presented numerous televised [[clip show]] [[television special|specials]] on Network Ten. ''Hamish and Andy: Re-Gifted'' at the end of 2008, and ''Hamish &amp; Andy: Re-Gifted - Another Very Early Christmas Special'' at the end of 2009, were both produced in conjunction with [[Roving Enterprises]] and consisted mostly of highlights of their fortnightly appearances on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]. Their 2010 ''Hamish &amp; Andy's Reministmas Special'' recapped their adventures during the year, mostly as part of their radio show.

In addition to these, they produced three travel specials for Ten. ''[[Caravan of Courage (series)#American Caravan of Courage (2009)|Hamish &amp; Andy's American Caravan of Courage]]'' in 2009 (another [[Roving Enterprises]] co-production) summarised their two-week road-trip across the [[United States of America|United States]]. Similarly, 2010's ''[[Caravan of Courage (series)#Caravan of Courage: Great Britain and Ireland (2010)|Hamish &amp; Andy's Caravan of Courage: Great Britain and Ireland]]'' recapped their next caravan trip made as part of their radio show. Their third travel special, ''Learn India with Hamish &amp; Andy'', aired as part of the network's lead-up to the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/09/airdate-2010-commonwealth-games.html|title=Airdate: 2010 Commonwealth Games|work=TV Tonight|last=Knox |first=David|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nine Network and ''Gap Year''===
Following a series of media reports, the pair confirmed in February 2011 that they had joined the [[Nine Network]] on a two-year contract, to produce ''[[Hamish and Andy's Gap Year]]''.&lt;ref name="joinnine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2011/04/hamish-andys-gap-year-for-nine.html&lt;/ref&gt; The show first aired on 28 July 2011. The show premiered to strong ratings and has since gone onto three more seasons (''[[Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year#Hamish &amp; Andy's Euro Gap Year|Hamish &amp; Andy's Euro Gap Year]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year#Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year Asia|Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year Asia]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year#Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year South America|Hamish &amp; Andy's Gap Year South America]]'' in 2014).

The pair also filmed a fifth [[Caravan of Courage (series)#Caravan of Courage: Australia v New Zealand (2012)|Caravan of Courage]] adventure in 2012, in which they compared their home country, [[Australia]], to their neighbours New Zealand in two 90-minute specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caravan of Courage Aus Vs NZ, Ep1|url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/2012/caravan-courage-australia-vs-new-zealand-episode-1/|publisher=chris &amp; nelson|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the duo announced that 2017 would be their last year on radio, in order to focus on television. They also announced an as yet unnamed TV show to be aired on the Nine Network in mid 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/radio/hamish-and-andy-confirm-popular-duo-are-quitting-radio-at-the-end-of-2017/news-story/19e0dc7e93665ff96121fcd90b2db3c0&lt;/ref&gt; The duo advertised on their website and radio show, for listeners to contribute "great stories" for "The Great Stories Project"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamishandandy.com/contact/great-stories-project/&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis of their 2017 television show ''[[True Story with Hamish &amp; Andy]]'' on the Nine Network.

'''Ian Dev Singh''' is an [[Cricket in India|Indian cricketer]] who plays predominantly as a [[batsman]]. He was captain of [[Jammu and Kashmir cricket team|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the [[Ranji Trophy]] in [[2013–14 Ranji Trophy|2013-14]].

== Early life ==
Ian Dev Singh was born in [[Gandhinagar]], and named after [[Ian Botham]] and [[Kapil Dev]], his father's two favourite cricketers. He completed his [[Bachelor of Engineering]] degree at [[D. Y. Patil]] University in [[Navi Mumbai]] while simultaneously playing Ranji Trophy cricket, occasionally necessitating flying in to sit an exam directly between Jammu and Kashmir fixtures.&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/icc-world-cup-2015/top-stories/JK-skipper-Ian-Dev-is-another-talent-on-the-rise/articleshow/22606442.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jammu and Kashmir's cricketing infrastructure remains somewhat underdeveloped, and Dev Singh developed as a cricketer by playing club cricket in Mumbai. He noted in 2012 that, '[t]he competition even at the club level [in Mumbai] is very tough whereas back in our state, we get limited opportunities. We rarely get solid preparation before the Ranji season commences.'&lt;ref name=Zeenews&gt;http://zeenews.india.com/sports/cricket/bedi-has-changed-mindset-of-jandk-cricketers-says-ian-dev-singh_736353.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major influence on the development of his game was former India captain [[Bishan Bedi]], coach of Jammu and Kashmir between 2011 and 2014. With Bedi's guidance helping him overhaul his mental approach to batting, Dev Singh scored 406 runs at 67.66 in first-class matches in 2011-12, and earned selection for North Zone in the [[Duleep Trophy]].&lt;ref name=Zeenews /&gt; For his part, Bedi described Dev Singh as 'a very good shorter version batsman and a brilliant fielder' who was 'definitely ready for a break', either in the form of an international call-up or an [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] contract.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; As of 2017, however, such honours have eluded him.

'''Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda''', commonly known as '''Ibrahim Ssemujju''', is a Ugandan journalist and politician. He is the [[member of Parliament]] representing Kyaddondo County East in the 9th Parliament (2011 to 2016).&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web | date=2011 | url=http://www.parliament.go.ug/mpdata/mps.hei?p=f&amp;n=t&amp;details=t&amp;j=756.000000&amp;const=Kyadondo++County+East+&amp;dist_id=13.000000&amp;distname=Wakiso | title=Profile of Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda, Member of Parliament for Kyaddondo County East, Wakiso District | accessdate=17 March 2015 | last=POU | publisher=[[Parliament of Uganda]] (POU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Ssemujju was born in Bijaaba Village, [[Kyazanga|Kyazanga Municipality]], [[Lwengo District]], on 23 September 1973. At that time, Lwengo District was still part of [[Masaka District]]. He is the son of Hajji Ali Nganda Nkwanga and Hajati Sophia Nalwooga, one of his forty-eight children and one of her sixteen offspring.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 March 2015 | 
url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11678:ssemujju-ibrahim-nganda-all-that-you-didnt-know-about-this-journalist-turned-politician&amp;catid=34:news&amp;Itemid=59 | title=Ssemujju Ibrahim Nganda: All That You Didn’t Know About This Journalist-Turned-Politician | date=13 January 2011 | publisher=[[The Observer (Uganda)]] | first=Richard M. | last=Kavuma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the Bijaaba Islamic Institute, "a few meters from his birthplace", obtaining the Primary Leaving Certificate while there. After the institute started a secondary school section, Ssemujju joined. However, by Senior 2, most of his female classmates had found husbands and dropped out, while his male cohorts left for odd jobs in nearby [[Masaka|Masaka Town]]. He raised whatever little capital he could and convinced his father to enroll him in [[Masaka Secondary School]] for his Senior 3 studies. At that time, he barely spoke any English, but they admitted him anyway.

He progressively did well and passed his O-Level examinations in 1992. He went on to pursue his A-Level education, also at Masaka Secondary School. He graduated at the top of his class in 1995. He was admitted to [[Makerere University]], on a full Ugandan government scholarship to study [[mass communication]]. He graduated in 1998 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] mass communication.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==Career==
Straight out of Makerere, he was hired as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Monitor]]'', one of the two leading English language daily newspapers in Uganda, serving in that role until 2004. His beat was coverage of the [[Parliament of Uganda|Ugandan parliament]]. From 2000 until 2001, he taught journalism at the [[Islamic University in Uganda]]. In 2004, he left the ''Daily Monitor'' to join ''[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]'', both as a reporter and as a shareholder. He was assigned the role of political editor at the ''Weekly Observer'', serving in that role until 2011. In 2009, he was assigned additional duties as the editor, educational news. In 2011, he resigned from his journalism assignments to contest the parliamentary seat of Kyaddondo County East. He ran on the [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) political party platform. He won and is the current [[incumbent]].&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Prior to the February 2016 presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, [[Kira Town|Kira Municipality]] was awarded a parliamentary seat, separate from Kyaddondo East. Ssemujju is contesting for that seat under the FDC political party banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=22 January 2016 | location=Kampala | first=Mercy | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Elections/Ssemujju-setting-the-pace-in-contest-for-new-Kira-municipality/-/859108/3043440/-/item/0/-/1grcewz/-/index.html | last=Nalugo | date=22 January 2016 | title=Ssemujju setting the pace in contest for new Kira municipality | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
In parliament, he chairs the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises. He is also a member of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs and of the Business Committee.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; He is married to Faridah Ssemujju, and together are the parents of two daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

'''James Arthur Lovell Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|v|əl}}; born March 25, 1928) is a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]], [[Naval Aviator]], and retired [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]]. Lovell is known for being the commander of the ill-fated [[Apollo 13]] mission, which suffered a critical failure en route to the [[Moon]] but was brought back safely to Earth through the efforts of the crew and mission control.  In addition to being part of the Apollo 13 crew, Lovell was the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]] pilot of [[Apollo 8]], the first Apollo mission to enter lunar orbit.

He is one of only [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing|24 people to have flown to the Moon]] and the first of only three people to fly to the Moon twice as well as the only one to have flown there twice without making a [[Moon landing|landing]]. Lovell was the first person to fly in space four times.

He is a recipient of the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] (in 1970, one of 17 recipients in the group Space Exploration).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lovell-ja.html|title=Astronaut Bio: James A.

==Early life==
Born in 1928 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], James Lovell was the only child of his mother Blanche (Masek), who was of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent, and his father, James, Sr., an [[Ontario]], Canada-born coal furnace salesman, who died in a car accident in 1933.&lt;ref name="SMS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Uh8foEYDQlAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20lovell%20Czech%20mother%20%20blanche |title=Selecting the Mercury Seven: The Search for America's First Astronauts |last=Burgess |first=Colin |website=books.google.ca |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about two years, Lovell and his mother lived with a relative in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. After relocating with his mother to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], he graduated from [[Solomon Juneau Business High School|Juneau High School]]. A member of the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] during his childhood, Lovell eventually achieved [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], the organization's highest level.&lt;ref name="SMS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Collecting the Final Frontier: Ohio Historical Society's Collections Blog | publisher=ohiohistory.org | url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/collecting-the-final-frontier/ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331034731/http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/collecting-the-final-frontier/ | archivedate=March 31, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Newsletter Spring 2000: Notable Americans with Czech Roots | publisher=afocr.org | url=http://www.afocr.org/newsletters/spring2000.htm | accessdate=November 29, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123234750/http://www.afocr.org/newsletters/spring2000.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="honor"&gt;{{cite book | last=Townley | first=Alvin | date=December 26, 2006 | title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts | publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=80–86|isbn=0-312-36653-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="honor2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ray | first=Mark |year=2007 | url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0701/a-what.html | title=What It Means to Be an Eagle Scout | work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovell became interested in rocketry and built flying models as a boy.&lt;ref name=lostmoon&gt;{{cite book | last=Lovell | first=Jim |author2=Kluger, Jeffrey | title=Apollo 13: Lost Moon | location=New York | publisher=Pocket Books | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-53464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, he attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for two years under the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)#Aviation Midshipman (AVMIDN) Program (1946–1950)|"Flying Midshipman" program]] from 1946 to 1948.  While at Madison, he played football and pledged to the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.

While Lovell was attending pre-flight training in the summer of 1948, the navy was beginning to make cutbacks in the program, and cadets were under a great deal of pressure to transfer out. There were concerns that some or most of the students who graduated as Naval Aviators would not have pilot billets to fill. This threat persisted until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.  Lovell  applied and was accepted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] in the fall of 1948. During his first year he wrote a treatise on the liquid-fueled rocket engine. He attended Annapolis for the full four years, graduating as an ensign in the spring of 1952 with a B.S. degree. He then went to flight training at [[NAS Pensacola]] from October 1952 to February 1954.&lt;ref name="SMS"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1952, following his graduation from the Naval Academy, Lovell married his high school sweetheart, Marilyn Lillie Gerlach (born July 11, 1930), the daughter of Lillie ([[née]] Nordrum)  and Carl Gerlach. The two had attended Juneau High School in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/02/24/page/50/article/lovells-given-big-reception-in-milwaukee Lovells Big Reception in Milwaukee] accessed July 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  While she was a college student, Gerlach transferred from [[Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee|Wisconsin State Teachers College]] to [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington D.C.]] so she could be near him while he was training in [[Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K1HN-CM5 Marilyn Lovell public record] accessed July 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19700410&amp;id=EsNOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I0gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1145,657505 |title=Lovell, Haise married high school sweethearts |website=news.google.com |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple have four children: Barbara, James, Susan, and Jeffrey.  The 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' portrayed the family's home life during the [[Apollo 13]] mission of 1970 with actress [[Kathleen Quinlan]] being nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|supporting actress Oscar]] for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19620918&amp;id=B_8pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7197,4432820 |title=Selection of Lovell Puts Kin Into Orbit  |website=news.google.com |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the Lovell family opened "Lovell's of Lake Forest", a fine dining restaurant in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]]. The restaurant displayed many artifacts from Lovell's time with NASA, as well as from the filming of ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''. The restaurant was sold to son and executive chef James ("Jay") in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovellsoflakeforest.com/ |title=Lovells of Lake Forest |publisher=Lovells of Lake Forest |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The restaurant was put on the market for sale in February 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Blaser |url=http://lakeforest.suntimes.com/news/business/lovells-LFR-02132014:article |title=Lovell family confirms sale of Lake Forest restaurant |newspaper=Lake Forester |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222042230/http://lakeforest.suntimes.com/news/business/lovells-LFR-02132014%3Aarticle |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |date=February 19, 2014 |accessdate=July 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed in April 2015, with the property auctioned the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lovellsoflakeforest.com/events |title=Lovells of Lake Forest Easter Brunch Sunday, April 5, 2015 |website=lovellsoflakeforest.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429051440/http://www.lovellsoflakeforest.com/events |archive-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=yes |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Navy==
Lovell was designated a Naval Aviator on February 1, 1954. Upon completion of pilot training, he was assigned to [[VFAW-3|VC-3]] at [[Moffett Field]] near San Francisco, California. From 1954 to 1956 he flew [[F2H Banshee|F2H-3 Banshee]] night fighters. This included a WestPac deployment aboard the carrier {{USS|Shangri-La|CVA-38|6}}, when the ship emerged from refit as only the second USN carrier with the new angled deck. Upon his return to shore duty, he was reassigned to provide pilot transition training for the [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epnaao.com/BIOS_files/REGULARS/Lovell-%20James%20A.pdf|title=The Golden Eagles, Regulars: James A. Lovell jr, Capt USN (Ret)|website=epnaao.com|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1958, Lovell entered a six-month [[test pilot]] training course at what was then the Naval Air Test Center (now the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]]) at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]]. Two of his classmates were [[Pete Conrad|Charles (Peter) Conrad]] and [[Wally Schirra]]; Lovell graduated first in his class.&lt;ref name=lostmoon /&gt;

Later that year, Lovell, Conrad, and Schirra became three of 110 military test pilots selected as potential [[astronaut]] candidates for [[Project Mercury]]. Schirra went on to become one of the [[Mercury Seven]], with Lovell and Conrad failing to make the cut for medical reasons: Lovell because of a temporarily high [[bilirubin]] count in his blood&lt;ref name=lostmoon /&gt; and Conrad for refusing to take the second round of invasive medical tests.

At NAS Patuxent River, Lovell was assigned to Electronics Test (later Weapons Test), with his assigned [[Aviator call sign|call sign]] being "Shaky", a nickname given him by Conrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuC82VWpa30C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=lovell%20instructor%20pax%20river |title=James Lovell: The Rescue of Apollo 13 |last=Goldberg |first=Jan |website=books.google.com |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F4H]] program manager, during which time [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] served under him. In 1961 he received orders for [[VFA-101|VF-101 "Detachment Alpha"]] as an F4H instructor for the first East Coast squadron personnel assigned to that aircraft.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==NASA career==
In 1962 NASA needed a second group of astronauts for the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs. Lovell applied a second time and was accepted into [[NASA Astronaut Group 2]], "The New Nine", as was Conrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaspace.com/2012/09/15/the-best-all-around-group-nasas-astronauts-of-62/|title="The Best All-Around Group": NASA's Astronauts of '62|last1=Evans|first1=Ben|publisher=AmericaSpace|access-date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gemini program===
[[File:Lovell and Aldrin on Deck - GPN-2000-001356.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] and Lovell on the deck of their recovery ship after Gemini 12.]]
Lovell was selected as backup pilot for [[Gemini 4]]. This put him in position for his first space flight three missions later, as pilot of [[Gemini 7]] with Command Pilot [[Frank Borman]] in December 1965. The flight's objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drewexmachina.com/2015/12/04/rendezvous-in-space-the-launch-of-gemini-7/|title=Rendezvous in Space: The Launch of Gemini 7 {{!}} Drew Ex Machina|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fourteen-day flight set an endurance record making 206 orbits. It was also the target vehicle for the first [[space rendezvous]] with [[Gemini 6A]].&lt;ref name="nasa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1965-100A|title=Gemini 7, NSSDCA/COSPAR ID: 1965-100A|access-date=May 28, 2017|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovell was later scheduled to be the backup command pilot of [[Gemini 10]]. But after the [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew]] [[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett]], he replaced [[Thomas P. Stafford]] as backup commander of [[Gemini 9A]]. This again positioned Lovell for his second flight and first command, of [[Gemini 12]] in November 1966 with Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. This flight had three [[Extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]], made 59 [[orbit]]s, and achieved the fifth space rendezvous and fourth [[Docking and berthing of spacecraft|space docking]] with an [[Agena target vehicle]]. This mission was successful because it proved that humans can work effectively outside the spacecraft, paved the way for the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions, and helped reach the goal of getting man on the Moon by the end of the decade.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Apollo program===

====Apollo 8====
[[File:Apollo 8 Lovell at Guidance and Navigation station.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lovell at the Command Module Guidance and Navigation station during the Apollo 8 mission.]]
{{Main|Apollo 8}}
Lovell was originally chosen as [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilot (CMP) on the backup crew for Apollo 9 along with [[Neil Armstrong]] as commander and Buzz Aldrin as [[lunar module]] pilot (LMP). Apollo 9 was planned as a high-[[apogee]] Earth orbital test of the Lunar Module (LM). Lovell later replaced [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] as CMP on the Apollo 9 prime crew when Collins needed to have surgery for a [[bone spur]] on his spine. This reunited Lovell with his Gemini 7 commander Frank Borman, and LM pilot [[William Anders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4205/ch11-3.html  |title=Selecting and Training Crews |website=history.nasa.gov |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction delays of the first manned LM prevented it from being ready in time to fly on Apollo 8, planned as a [[low Earth orbit]] test. It was decided to swap the Apollo 8 and [[Apollo 9]] prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as Apollo 9, when the LM would be ready. A lunar orbital flight, now Apollo 8 replaced the original Apollo 9 medium Earth orbit test. Borman, Lovell and Anders were launched on December 21, 1968, becoming the first men to travel to the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="augsep1968"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |title=The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205020128/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |volume=IV |year=1969–1978 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |id=NASA SP-4009 |oclc=23818 |lccn=69060008 |chapter=Part 2 (N): Recovery, Spacecraft Redefinition, and First Manned Apollo Flight: August through September 1968 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2n.htm |display-authors=2 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As CM Pilot, Lovell served as the navigator, using the spacecraft's built-in [[sextant]] to determine its position by measuring star positions. This information was then used to calculate required mid-course corrections. The craft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve and made a total of ten orbits, most of them circular at an altitude of approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} for a total of twenty hours. They broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to Earth. Lovell took his turn with Borman and Anders in reading a passage from the Biblical creation story in the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html|title=The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast|publisher=NASA|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They began their return to Earth on Christmas Day with a rocket burn made on the Moon's far side, out of radio contact with Earth. (For this reason, the lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection burns were the two most tense moments of this first lunar mission.) When contact was re-established, Lovell was the first to announce the good news, "Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]." The crew splashed down safely on Earth on December 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/apollo_8.html|title=Apollo 8: Christmas at the Moon|date=December 18, 2014|publisher=NASA|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Apollo 13}}
Lovell was backup commander of [[Apollo 11]] and was scheduled to command [[Apollo 14]]. Instead, he and his crew swapped missions with the crew of Apollo 13, as it was felt the commander of the other crew, [[Alan Shepard]], needed more time to train after having been grounded for a long period by an ear problem.&lt;ref name="slayton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Deke!

During a routine [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic oxygen]] tank stir in transit to the Moon, a fire started inside an oxygen tank. The most probable cause determined by NASA was damaged electrical insulation on wiring that created a spark that started the fire.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cortright |first=Edgar M. |title=Report of the Apollo 13 Review Board |date=June 15, 1970 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700076776_1970076776.pdf |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |format=PDF }} Text (.TXT) file of report [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_13_review_board.txt here].

In just over two hours, all on-board oxygen was lost, disabling the hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s that provided electrical power to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] ''Odyssey''. This required an immediate abort of the Moon landing mission; the sole objective now was to safely return the crew to Earth.

Apollo 13 was the second mission not to use a [[free return trajectory]], so that they could explore the western lunar regions.{{sfn|Chaikin|2008|p=298}} Using the LM as a "life boat" providing battery power, oxygen, and propulsion, Lovell and his crew re-established the free return trajectory that they had left, and swung around the Moon to return home.{{sfn|Chaikin|2008|pp=304–305}} Based on the flight controllers' calculations made on Earth, Lovell had to adjust the course twice by manually controlling the Lunar Module's thrusters and engine.{{sfn|Chaikin|2008|pp=314, 322}} Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth on April 17.{{sfn|Chaikin|2008|p=611}}

Lovell is one of only three men to travel to the Moon twice, but unlike [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Eugene Cernan]], he never walked on it. He accrued over 715 hours, and had seen a total of 269 sunrises from space, on his Gemini and Apollo flights. This was a personal record that stood until the [[Skylab 3]] mission in July through September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;The Skylab 3 crew spent 1427 hours in space, in addition to commander [[Alan Bean]]'s over 244 hours on [[Apollo 12]], giving him the second record.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 13's flight trajectory gives Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/pressroom/lovell/lovell_timeline.pdf | title=Captain James A.

==Later career==
[[File:Jim_Lovell.jpg|thumb|right|Lovell speaking at the [[North Carolina Science Festival]] in April 2017]]
Lovell retired from the Navy and the space program in 1973 and went to work at the Bay-Houston Towing Company in [[Houston, Texas]], becoming [[CEO]] in 1975. He became president of Fisk Telephone Systems in 1977, and later worked for [[Centel]], retiring as an executive vice president on January 1, 1991. Lovell, a recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]],&lt;ref name="desalista"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf |title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts |publisher = Scouting.org|accessdate = November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later served as the President of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]] in the mid-1990s. He was also recognized by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] with their prestigious [[Silver Buffalo Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyecouncil.org/Scouting/Awards/Service/Silver-Buffalo-Award|title=Silver Buffalo Award|publisher=Boy Scouts of America: Buckeye Council|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Jeffrey Kluger]], Lovell wrote a book about the Apollo 13 mission, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]''.&lt;ref name=lostmoon /&gt; It was the basis for the [[Ron Howard]] movie ''Apollo 13''. Lovell's first impression on being approached about the film was that [[Kevin Costner]] would be a good choice to portray him, given the physical resemblance,&lt;ref name="DVDLovellCommentary"&gt;{{cite video | title = Apollo 13: 2-Disc Anniversary Edition (Disc 1), Special Features:Commentary track by Jim and Marilyn Lovell | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Universal Studios]]  | date=March 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Tom Hanks]] was cast in the role. In order to prepare, Hanks visited Lovell and his wife at their home in Texas and even flew with Lovell in his private airplane.

In the film, Lovell has a cameo as the captain of the [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']], the naval vessel that led the operation to recover the Apollo 13 astronauts after their successful [[splashdown]]. Lovell can be seen as the naval officer shaking Hanks' hand, as Hanks speaks in [[voice-over]], in the scene where the astronauts come aboard the ''Iwo Jima''. Filmmakers initially offered to make Lovell's character an admiral aboard the ship (presumably Rear Admiral [[Donald C. Davis]], Commander Task Force 130 (CTF 130), who was the senior officer aboard and welcomed them home). However, Lovell said "I retired as a Captain and a Captain I will be." He was cast as the ship's skipper, Captain Leland E. Kirkemo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001318.html |title=NASA photographic archive |publisher=Grin.hq.nasa.gov |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306040121/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001318.html |archivedate=March 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his wife Marilyn, who also has a cameo in the film, he provided a commentary track on both the single disc and the two-disc special edition DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/fullcredits|title=Apollo 13 Full Cast and Crew|publisher=IMDb|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovell also visits colleges and universities where he gives speeches on his experiences as an astronaut and businessman. He strongly urges students to get involved in science and the space program, and he credits NASA in the 1960s with bringing much of the country together for a common goal.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==In popular culture==

About a month after the return to Earth of Apollo 13, Lovell and his crewmates, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with host [[Johnny Carson]]. The introduction of this segment of the show is featured on ''Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13'' on the single disc DVD version of the movie. In 1976, Lovell made a cameo appearance in the Nicolas Roeg movie ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074851/fullcredits|title=The Man Who Fell to Earth: Full Cast and Crew|publisher=IMDb|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, actor [[Tom Hanks]] portrayed Lovell in the hit movie ''Apollo 13'', based on Lovell's book ''Lost Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/20320-astronaut-jim-lovell-apollo-13-biography.html|title=Astronaut Jim Lovell: Apollo 13 Commander|last1=Howell|first1=Elizabeth|publisher=Space.com|date=March 20, 2013|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell himself makes a cameo in this movie, playing the captain of the USS ''Iwo Jima'' at the end of the film. In 1998, actor [[Tim Daly]] portrayed Lovell in portions of the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/movies/television-review-boyish-eyes-on-the-moon.html|title=Television Review; Boyish Eyes on the Moon|work=The New York Times|date=April 3, 1998|access-date=August 5, 2018|last1=James|first1=Caryn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts Lovell during his missions aboard Gemini 12, Apollo 8, and Apollo 13, though he is not seen on screen during the latter mission.

Lovell is one of the astronauts featured in the book and documentaries ''[[In the Shadow of the Moon (film)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]'' and ''[[When We Left Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233514/fullcredits|title=When We Left Earth: Full Cast and Crew|publisher=IMDb|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2008, Lovell and fellow Apollo 8 crew members Frank Borman and [[Bill Anders]] appeared on the [[NASA TV]] channel to discuss the Apollo 8 mission. The three former astronauts later appeared together for a panel discussion centering on Apollo 8 at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library]] on April 23, 2009, a discussion that was videotaped by [[C-SPAN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/jameslovell |title=C-SPAN Apollo 8 Reunion |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2014, the 45th anniversary of Apollo 11's landing on the Moon, ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' correspondent [[Lee Cowan]] and his crew did a piece called "Astronaut wives: The other space pioneers" featuring James Lovell and his wife Marilyn. They celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/astronaut-wives-the-other-space-pioneers-2/ |title=Astronaut wives: The other space pioneers|accessdate=July 20, 2014 | work=CBS News|date=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Tom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|John Nichols Thom]]
'''John Nichols Tom''' (sometimes spelt '''Thom'''; 1799 – 31 May 1838) was a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] wine-merchant and maltster who re-invented himself as Sir William Courtenay, stood for parliament in Canterbury, was convicted of perjury in a smuggling case, spent three years in the Kent County Lunatic Asylum, and, following his release, gathered a small band of followers and paraded in the Kent countryside. He, using the title ''Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtney, King of Jerusalem''&lt;!-- ambiguous spelling from audio source --&gt;,&lt;ref name="WGT"&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Who Goes There - Episode 6, Season 4 |publisher = [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0075zbk |year=1984 |series=4|time= 14:45}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several of his followers, was killed in a confrontation with soldiers in Bossenden Wood, in what has sometimes been called the  [[Battle of Bossenden Wood|last battle to be fought on English soil]].

==Early life==
John Nichols Tom (or Thom) was born the son of innkeepers in 1799 at [[St Columb Major]], Cornwall. He was baptised in the parish church on 10 November 1799. His parents were William and Charity Tom who kept the Joiners' Arms.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Tom went to school in [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], attending Bellevue Academy (a "Classical and Commercial Academy"). At the age of about fourteen he transferred to the private school in [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] that was run by [[Richard Cope (minister)|Reverend Richard Cope]], pastor of the local Congregational Church.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom stayed at school until he was eighteen and was then articled to solicitor Mr Paynter of St Columb. He decided, however, against a career in the law and left after three years. After a short spell as an innkeeper in [[Wadebridge]] he settled down as a clerk in the firm of Lubbock and Co, wine merchants of [[Truro]], and took over the business when the partners retired, extending it to include [[malting]]. In 1821 he married Catherine Fisher Fulpitt, the daughter of a market gardener in Truro.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 3&lt;/ref&gt; Tom was a tall, strongly built, good-looking man, who became known in Truro for his skill as a cricketer. During a visit to London he joined the [[Thomas Spence|Spencean Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tom was in his late twenties a series of disasters struck. His mother Charity was removed to Cornwall Lunatic Asylum in 1827, and died there. Then, in 1828, his business premises in Pydar Street burnt down. Tom claimed the insurance and was able to rebuild the premises.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Quarter Sessions]] held at [[Bodmin]] on 15 July 1828, Tom applied successfully for the return of £304 paid in [[excise duty]] on [[malt]] destroyed in the fire at his malthouse on 17 June 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornwall Record Office]], Sessions held at Bodmin  QS/1/11/370-397  15 July 1828, abstract at National Archives online, [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=021-qs_6&amp;cid=1-1-14#1-1-14 QS/1/11/387]: "Application by John Nicholls Tom of Truro, maltster, who stated that on 17 June last his malthouse in Truro contained 2,358 "Winchester bushels" [a standard weight] of malt, the duty on which he had paid £304.11s.6d. His warehouse had been destroyed by fire together with the contents: Collector of Excise to allow John Nicholls Tom full amount of duty paid."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831 Tom received treatment from a surgeon for an attack of insanity but recovered and the following spring sailed from Truro to Liverpool with a cargo of malt. He wrote to his wife from Liverpool to tell her he had sold the malt, and wrote again from Birmingham to tell her he was going to France. Nothing more was heard from him until over a year later, when his family heard that a man who fitted his description and went by the name of Sir William Courtenay was being held in Maidstone prison.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 7-8; Reay: 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canterbury==

In September 1832 Thom arrived in [[Canterbury]], dressed in exotic costumes and wearing long hair and a beard. He put up at the Rose Inn at the junction of Rose Lane and the main street and went first by the name of Count [[Rothschild]], and then by the name of Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, heir to the [[Earl of Devon]] and the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 8-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many people realized he was an imposter he nevertheless became a colourful and popular figure in the town, partly because he frequently made comical and insulting speeches directed at the unpopular mayor and magistrates of the city and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so strong that the Conservatives decided not to field candidates. Stung by jeers about not standing, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for [[Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Canterbury]], hoping he would inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for [[Richard Watson (politician)|Richard Watson]] and 802 for [[George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper|Viscount Fordwich]], the Liberal candidates).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 20-24&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to stand in the [[East Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|East Kent]] election, but polled only three votes, and turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, ''The Lion''. Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 32&lt;/ref&gt; Tom's biographer described the views expressed in ''The Lion'' as showing "amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although these "occasional shafts of light" were surrounded by "turgid nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barming Heath==

At the beginning of March 1833, Thom intervened in the case of some Faversham smugglers, acting as a witness for the defence. The smugglers were nevertheless convicted, and Tom was prosecuted for [[perjury]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 40-45&lt;/ref&gt; His trial took place on 25 July at the Kent Summer Assizes at [[Maidstone]] before Mr Justice Parke and a crowded court. Evidence was heard from the Vicar of [[Boughton-under-Blean]] that Tom had been at church when he claimed to have witnessed events off the [[Goodwin Sands]]. In spite of the testimony of a number of character witnesses, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and Tom was sentenced to three months imprisonment and seven years [[penal transportation|transportation]] to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 57-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom's family in Truro had heard about the trial and Catherine Tom arrived in Maidstone in August to see if Courtenay was her missing husband. He was produced by the governor of Maidstone Gaol and she made a positive identification. Although Tom always denied any connection with the Truro family, Catherine Tom was believed. She told the authorities about her husband's previous attack of insanity; he was then examined by two surgeons who declared him of unsound mind. Tom was transferred to [[Oakwood Hospital|Barming Heath Asylum]] on 28 October 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom was a model patient in the asylum and in 1837 the superintendent suggested to his wife that she should petition the home secretary for his release. Tom's father in Truro brought his son's case to the attention of [[Richard Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian|Sir Hussey Vivian]], the Liberal candidate for [[East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cornwall]] in the August 1837 election. Vivian, after his election, took the matter up with the home secretary, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], and Tom was granted a free pardon by [[Queen Victoria]], on condition he was returned into the care of his family in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 74-80&lt;/ref&gt; Thom was still refusing to acknowledge the Cornish family and, instead of returning to Cornwall, went to live with a local farmer and supporter, Mr Francis of Fairbrook, Boughton-under-Blean, who had offered to be his guardian. This was permitted, due to some ambiguous wording on the pardon, and in October 1837, four years after his admission to the asylum, Tom was released.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle and death==
{{Main|Battle of Bossenden Wood}}
[[Image:Plaque in Hernhill Churchyard.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in [[Hernhill]] churchyard]]

By January 1838, Tom had fallen out with Mr Francis, and he spent the next few months riding through East Kent, relying on the hospitality of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 89&lt;/ref&gt; With promises of a better future, fairer distribution of wealth and greater equality, he attracted a following of agricultural labourers, artisans and small-holders. In particular, he addressed their concerns about low wages, lack of work, and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|New Poor Law]], which ordered all able-bodied men to [[workhouse]]s if they could not find work.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lowerson, ed. Charlesworth, ''An Atlas of Rural protests in Britain, 1548-1900'' (1983), pp. 139-141: "The 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act was designed specifically to cope with the severe problems of rural England and to prevent... a repetition of the 1830s incidents in the epicentres of Kent... There, complex soil patterns, small-scale farming and low investment rates combined with a rapid population surge to produce... dependence on permanent relief of 25% of population... groups of labourers (1835) ...besieged local magistrates in the workhouse... 37 labourers were imprisoned for... up to two years."&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of May, the activities of Tom and his small band of followers were entirely peaceful as they marched around the local countryside trying to drum up support amongst the workers. Some wealthier landowners were however becoming alarmed and, on 31 May 1838, a local magistrate, Dr Poore, issued a warrant for Tom's arrest for inciting workmen to leave their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 93-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on the morning of 31 May, the parish constable of Boughton-under-Blean enlisted the help of his assistant and also of his brother, Nicholas Mears, and set off to find Tom. When they arrived at Bossenden Farm, where Tom and his followers were staying, Tom shot and killed Nicholas Mears. The constable and his assistant fled.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 110-112&lt;/ref&gt; News of the murder reached the magistrates and soldiers were called out from the barracks at Canterbury. A detachment of the [[45th (Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|45th Infantry]] under Major Armstrong, with three junior officers and about one hundred men, met up with the magistrates and tracked Tom and his followers down to a clearing in Bossenden Wood. Tom's followers numbered between thirty and forty (a few having managed to escape after the killing of the constable), and, with the exception of Tom and one other who had pistols, were armed only with sticks. As the soldiers advanced, Lieutenant Bennet was shot dead by Tom. In the ensuing confrontation, which lasted only a few minutes, Tom and eight of his followers were killed or mortally wounded by the soldiers, and a young special constable who was helping the soldiers was caught in their fire and killed. One soldier was slightly injured by a stick.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 128-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==

Tom's body, together with those of his followers who had been killed, was taken to the Red Lion Inn at [[Dunkirk, Kent|Dunkirk]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 139&lt;/ref&gt; The inn was besieged by souvenir and relic hunters, and the simply curious. The landlord of Red Lion claimed 20,000 people had visited the neighbourhood over the next few days.&lt;ref&gt;Reay: 155&lt;/ref&gt; Tom's biographer describes public feeling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This was an insignificant casualty list as battles go; but it was a terrible price to pay for the capture, dead, of one man. When the disastrous results of the affray became known, public opinion was deeply shocked at what seemed an unnecessary loss of life. The repercussions of the Battle of Bossenden wood were soon, in fact, to reach Westminster itself."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An inquest was held at the White Horse, Boughton, the Saturday after the battle, with the jury returning a verdict of "justifiable homicide" on the deaths of Tom and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; On the following Tuesday Tom was buried in [[Hernhill]] cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 154-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Few of Tom's followers had been arrested at the scene of the battle, but some were picked up over the next few days.&lt;ref&gt;Reay: 153&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty men and two women were arrested, and of these ten were tried for murder - two for the murder of the constable's brother and nine for the murder of Bennett (with Thomas Mears being charged with both).&lt;ref&gt;Reay: 159&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mears and William Price were convicted of the murder of the constable's brother, then the rest pleaded guilty. Thomas Mears and William Wills were transported for life, William Price for ten years, and the others received one year's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Reay: 161-164&lt;/ref&gt;

Local magistrates and politicians, especially Lord John Russell, were attacked for their role in the affair. There were accusations that Sir Hussey Vivian had requested Tom's release in return for his father's vote. A parliamentary select committee was appointed and sat for three days in June.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: 170-178&lt;/ref&gt; Barrister Frederick Liardet was sent to survey the area for the Central Society of Education, and a school and a church were built in Dunkirk. Journalists talked of the ignorance and moral degradation of the area. [[Feargus O'Connor]] suggested a monument should be erected in memory of Courtenay's followers.&lt;ref&gt;Reay: 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asprey was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], on March 19, 1919, the son of Gladys Brown Asprey and Peter Asprey Jr.
He had an older sister and a younger brother: [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]] [[Winifred Asprey]], founder of [[Vassar College]]'s computer science department,&lt;ref&gt;

Asprey received a [[B.S.]] in [[chemical technology]] at [[Iowa State University]] in 1940, after which he took a job as an industrial chemist with the [[Campbell Soup Company]] in [[Chicago]]. He was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] in 1941, and posted to [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|Fort Warren]], [[Wyoming]]. He applied for and was accepted into the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], which allowed soldiers to continue their education for a time, and went to [[Ohio State University]] to continue his chemistry studies. In January 1944, he was assigned to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Special Engineer Detachment]],{{sfn|Asprey|2014|pp=105–106}} with the rank of [[technician third grade]].{{sfn|Asprey|2014|p=111}}

Asprey was posted to the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (Met Lab) at the [[University of Chicago]], where he joined the effort under [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] to devise techniques to separate and purify plutonium. There, with [[Herbert H. Anderson]], he developed the [[PUREX]] process (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction); their patent "Solvent Extraction Process for Plutonium" was filed in 1947.&lt;ref name=eller&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the atomic-bomb scientists who signed the [[Szilárd petition]] in July 1945 to ask U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] to exercise extreme care in any decision to use the atomic bomb in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dannen.com/decision/45-07-17.html | title = A Petition to the President of the United States |first=Gene |last=Dannen |website=dannen.com |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Asprey and [[Winston Manning]] measured the half-life of the synthetic isotope 95&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt; at about 16 hours; the transient isotope was made by irradiating an early sample of the as-yet-unnamed relatively stable 95&lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt; with neutrons.  The product after [[beta decay]] was yet another new element, 96&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;.  These new unnamed elements created in the Met Lab in Chicago were announced to the world by [[Glenn Seaborg]] on November 11, 1945, on the radio show ''[[Quiz Kids]]''.  Elements 95 and 96, originally called "pandemonium" and "delirium", were eventually named [[americium]] and [[curium]] by analogy with the chemically related elements [[europium]] and [[gadolinium]]. Asprey's later discovery, with [[S. E. Stephanou]] and [[Robert A. Penneman]] at Los Alamos, of the hexapositive, fluoride-soluble oxidation state of americium was one of the keys to the subsequent discovery of element 97, [[berkelium]], at [[Berkeley, California]], in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Leon C. Negruzzi''' (June 5, 1840 &amp;ndash; July 15/16, 1890) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n politician and writer.

Born in [[Iași]],&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"/&gt; he was the first child of [[Constantin Negruzzi]].&lt;ref name="Lecca363"&gt;Lecca, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education at ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'', but completed high school in Berlin, where he was sent with his brother [[Iacob Negruzzi|Iacob]] in 1853. He wanted to study medicine at [[Berlin University]], but was too revolted by the anatomical dissections, and switched to philosophy and law. He attended lectures at Berlin and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], but did not graduate. He returned home in 1864, where he was named a judge at the Iași tribunal. He gradually advanced to become a member of the appeals court as well as general prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"/&gt;  A member of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref name="Maiorescu346"/&gt; he was [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Iași County]] under the [[Lascăr Catargiu]] government (1871-1876), resuming this office in March 1888.&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"/&gt; He also served as mayor of Iași, as [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] and as [[Romanian Senate|senator]].&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maiorescu346"&gt;Maiorescu (2001), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, he was administrator of [[Sfântul Spiridon Hospital]]. He died at the family estate in [[Trifești, Iași|Hermeziu]] village.&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"/&gt;

Also interested in literature, he belonged to the cultural milieu surrounding ''[[Junimea]]'' and ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', which his brother edited.&lt;ref name="Rosetti137"&gt;Rosetti, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote six novellas: ''Vântul soartei'' (1867), ''Evreica'' (1868-1869), ''O răzbunare'' (1874), ''Țiganca'' (1877), ''Serghie Pavlovici'' (1881) and ''Osândiții'' (1881-1882). All appeared in his brother's magazine, and were judged by [[Titu Maiorescu]] as "distinguished neither by the originality of their concept nor through their style".&lt;ref name="Maiorescu654"&gt;Maiorescu (2005), p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; He had five daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="Lecca363"/&gt;

{{Chinese|showflag=poj|t=林語堂|s=林语堂|j=lam4 jyu5 tong4|p=Lín Yǔtáng|gr=Lin Yeutarng|poj=Lîm Gí-tông}}
'''Lin Yutang''' ({{zh|t=林語堂|p=Lín Yǔtáng}}; October 10, 1895 – March 26, 1976) was a [[List of Chinese authors|Chinese writer]], translator, linguist, philosopher and inventor. His informal but polished style in both Chinese and English made him one of the most influential writers of his generation, and his compilations and translations of [[Chinese classic texts|classic Chinese texts]] into English were bestsellers in the West.

==Youth==
Lin was born in 1895 in the town of [[Banzai Town|Banzai]], [[Pinghe County|Pinghe]], [[Zhangzhou]], [[Fujian]]. The mountainous region made a deep impression on his consciousness, and thereafter, he would constantly consider himself a child of the mountains (in one of his books he commented that his idea of hell was a city apartment).

His father was a Christian minister. His journey of faith from [[Christianity]] to [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], and back to Christianity in his later life was recorded in his book ''From Pagan to Christian'' (1959).

==Academic career and Shanghai intellectual world==
Lin studied for his bachelor's degree at [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|Saint John's University]] in [[Shanghai]], then received a half-scholarship to continue study for a doctoral degree at [[Harvard University]]. He later wrote that in the [[Widener Library]] he first found himself and first came alive, but he never saw a Harvard-Yale game.&lt;ref name="sinologist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=E Bruce|title=Lin Yutang |archive-date=2013-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809193313/http://www.umass.edu/wsp/sinology/persons/lin.html |website=Sinology |date=9 August 2013 |url=http://www.umass.edu/wsp/sinology/persons/lin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Harvard early, since he couldn't afford to study in Harvard anymore,and moved to work with the [[Chinese Labor Corps]] in France and eventually to Germany, where he completed his requirements for a doctoral degree in Chinese philology at the [[University of Leipzig]]. From 1923 to 1926 he taught English literature at [[Peking University]].

Enthusiastic about the success of the [[Northern Expedition]], he briefly served in the new [[Kuomintang|Nationalist government]], but soon turned to teaching and writing. He found himself in the wake of the [[New Culture Movement]] which criticized China's tradition as feudal and harmful. Instead of accepting this charge, however, Lin immersed himself in the Confucian texts and literary culture which his Christian upbringing and English language education had denied him.&lt;ref name="HamrinBieler2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yang|first=Rain Liu|editor=Carol Lee Hamrin| editor2=Stacey Bieler|title=Salt and Light, Volume 3: More Lives of Faith That Shaped Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HutMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=2011|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1-61097-158-4|pages=164-166|chapter=Lin Yutang: Astride the Cultures of East and West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His humor magazine, ''Lunyu banyuekan'' (The Analects Fortnightly, 1932-40, 1945-49) featured essays by prominent writers such as [[Hu Shi]], [[Lao She]], [[Lu Xun]], and [[Zhou Zuoren]] and attracted a wide readership. He was a key figure in introducing the Western concept of [[humor]], which he felt China had lacked. Lin coined the term ''youmo'' (humor) in 1924 and used The Analects to promote his conception of humor as the expression of a tolerant, cosmopolitan, understanding and civilized philosophy of life.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "The Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China" (California, 2015), chapter 6: "The Invention of Humor"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qian, Suoqiao, "Discovering 'Humor' in Modern China: The Launching of the Analects Fortnightly Journal and the 'Year of Humour' (1933)," in Chey and Davis, "Humour in Chinese Life and Letters: Classical and Traditional Approaches" (Hong Kong University Press, 2011), ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Lu Xun attacked the ''Analects'' for being apolitical and dismissed Lin's elegant xiaopin wen 小品文, or small essays, as "bric a brac for the bourgeoisie." Lu Xun nevertheless maintained a cordial relationship with Lin and continued to contribute to his journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mclc.osu.edu/rc/bios/lxbio.htm Kirk A. Denton, "Lu Xun Biography," MCLC Resource Center, (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin's writings in Chinese were critical of the [[History of the Republic of China|Nationalist government]] to the point that he feared for his life. Many of his essays from this time were later collected in ''With Love and Irony'' (1940). In 1933, he met [[Pearl Buck]] in Shanghai, who introduced him and his writings to her publisher, [[Richard Walsh (publisher)|Richard Walsh]], head of [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]], who published Lin's works for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lin Yutang|editor-last=Qian |editor-first=Suoqiao|title=Selected bilingual essays of Lin Yutang|date=2010|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789629964351|edition=Traditional Chinese-English bilingual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suoqiao|first1=Qian|title=Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity|date=2011|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004192133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin's relation with Christianity changed over the years. His father, of course, was a second-generation Christian, but at Tsinghua, Lin asked himself what it meant to be a Christian in China. Being a Christian meant acceptance of Western science and progress, but Lin became angry that being a Christian also meant losing touch with China's culture and his own personal identity.

On his return from study abroad, Lin renewed his respect for his father, yet he plunged into study of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism and did not identify himself as Christian until the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Stacey Bieler, Lin Yutang"&gt;[http://www.bdcconline.net/en/stories/l/lin-yutang.php Stacey Bieler, "Lin Yutang"] ''Biographical Dictionary of Christianity in China''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after leaving China and death==
[[File:The Lin Yutang House 20120907.jpg|thumb|[[Lin Yutang House]] in [[Taipei]]]]
After 1935, Lin lived mainly in the United States, where he became known as a "wise and witty" popularizer of Chinese philosophy and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Says Our Virtues Are Our Vices|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19370414&amp;id=VxoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jeIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2666,3155368|accessdate=9 December 2017|publisher=[[Reading Eagle]]|date=4 April 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's first best sellers were ''My Country and My People'' ({{zh|t=吾國與吾民|labels=no}}) (1935) and ''The Importance of Living'' ({{zh|t=生活的藝術|labels=no}}) (1937), written in English in a charming style. Others include ''Between Tears and Laughter'' ({{zh|t=啼笑皆非|labels=no}}) (1943), ''The Importance of Understanding'' (1960, a book of translated Chinese literary passages and short pieces), ''The Chinese Theory of Art'' (1967). The novels ''[[Moment in Peking]]'' (1939), ''[[A Leaf in the Storm]]'' (1940), and ''The Vermilion Gate'' ({{zh|t=朱門|labels=no}}) (1953) were well received epics of China in turmoil while ''[[Chinatown Family]]'' (1948) presented the lives of Chinese Americans in New York. Partly to avoid controversial contemporary issues, Lin in 1947 published ''The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo'', which presented the struggle between [[Su Dongpo]] and [[Wang Anshi]] as parallel to the struggle between Chinese liberals and totalitarian communists.

Lin's political writings in English sold fewer copies than his cultural works and were more controversial. ''Between Tears and Laughter'' (1943) broke with the genial tone of his earlier English writings to criticize Western racism and imperialism.

After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Lin traveled in China and wrote favorably of the war effort and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in ''Vigil of a Nation'' (1944). American [[China Hands]] such as [[Edgar Snow]] criticized the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qian|first1=Suoqiao|title=Representing China: Lin Yutang vs. American "China Hands" in the 1940s|journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations|date=1 October 2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=99–117|doi=10.1163/187656110X528974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ming Kwai 1952 US 2613795 A.png|thumb|Lin's Mingkwai [[Chinese typewriter]] played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research.]]
Mechanics had been a long time avocation. Since Chinese is a character-based rather than an alphabet-based language, with many thousands of separate characters, it was difficult to employ modern printing technologies. Many doubted that a [[Chinese typewriter]] could be invented. Lin, however, worked on this problem for decades and eventually came up with a workable typewriter, brought to market in the middle of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|war with Japan]].

The Mingkwai "Clear and Quick" Chinese-language typewriter played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsu|first1=Jing|title=Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora |date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0674055407 |chapter=Lin Yutang's Typewriter |pages=49–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin also invented and patented several lesser inventions, such as a toothbrush that dispensed toothpaste.

In the mid-1950s, he served briefly and unhappily as president (or chancellor) of the [[Nanyang University]], which was newly created in [[Singapore]] specifically for Chinese studies as parallel to the English-oriented [[National University of Singapore|University of Singapore]]. He did not, however, choose to continue in that role when the faculty resisted his plans to demolish and rebuild the new school building (which though grand, was not "Western" enough), his demands to have sole control over finances, and a budget clearly beyond its means. Lin accepted a dismissal fee of $305,203, entirely contributed by [[Tan Lark Sye]], to prevent depleting the university's funds.

He would later claim that Nanyang (South Seas) University became a focus of the struggle for control of Singapore between the Communist-directed left and the liberal, social democratic right and that he was too old for the conflict. The episode left a bad taste in the Malayan Chinese community, who felt betrayed by his actions during and after the fiasco.

After he returned to New York in the late 1950s, Lin renewed his interest in Christianity. His wife was a devout believer, and Lin admired her serenity and humility. After attending services with her at the [[David H. C. Read|Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]] for several months, he joined the church and announced his return to the faith.&lt;ref name="Stacey Bieler, Lin Yutang"/&gt; His 1959 book ''From Pagan to Christian'' explained this move, which many of his readers found surprising.

With his facility for both Chinese and English idiom, Lin presided over the compilation of a Chinese-English dictionary, ''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' (1972), which contains a massive English index to definitions of Chinese terms. The work was undertaken at the newly founded [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

His many works represent an attempt to bridge the cultural gap between the East and the West. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1940 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He continued to live up his work until his death in 1976. Lin was buried at his home in [[Yangmingshan]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. His home has been turned into a museum, which is operated by Taipei-based [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]]. The town of Lin's birth, Banzai, has also preserved the original Lin home and turned it into a museum.

==Lin's reputation and scholarship on Lin==
[[File:Lin Yutang.jpg|left|thumb|Lin Yutang]]
Although his major books have remained in print, Lin is a thinker whose place in modern Chinese intellectual history has been overlooked until recently.&lt;ref&gt;William Sima, "New Scholarship: The Cross-Cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America," China Heritage Quarterly 29 (2012). {{cite web |url=http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/scholarship.php?searchterm=029_sima.inc&amp;issue=029 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129192030/http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/scholarship.php?searchterm=029_sima.inc&amp;issue=029 |archivedate=2012-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin themed conventions have been organized in Taiwan and Lin's native Fujian, and in December 2011, the International Conference on the Cross-cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America was held at City University of Hong Kong, with professional and private scholars from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Germany and Slovakia. The organizer of the conference was Dr. Qian Suoqiao, author of the book, ''Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity'' (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;International Conference on
the Cross-cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America

The first full-length academic study of Lin in English is Diran John Sohigian's "The Life and Times of Lin Yutang" (Columbia University Ph.D. diss., 1991). Jing Tsu's Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010) gives a detailed account of Lin Yutang's typewriter and its role in the context of late 19th century script reform, Chinese national language reform in the early twentieth century and the fascinating story of his typewriting keyboard and [[machine translation]] research during the [[Cold War]].

==Family==
His wife, Liao Tsui-feng (廖翠鳳), was an author, who, along with her daughter Lin Hsiang Ju, wrote three cookery books which popularized [[Chinese cuisine]] in the English speaking world. Dr. Lin wrote introductions which explained the historical background and relevance for American life.

His first daughter [[Adet Lin|Lin Feng-ju]] (林鳳如; 1923–1971), known as Adet, was an author who also used the pseudonym Tan Yun.

His second daughter [[Tai-yi Lin|Lin Taiyi]] (林太乙; 1926–2003) was also known as Anor Lin in her earliest writing, and had the Chinese name Yu-ju 玉如. She was an author and the general editor of Chinese [[Reader's Digest]] from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. She also wrote a biography of her father in Chinese (林語堂傳), which shows some signs of her father's literary flair.

His third daughter Lin Hsiang-ju (林相如; born 1931), was referred to as MeiMei in childhood. She was co-author of cookbooks with her mother, and was a biochemist at Queen Mary hospital in Hong Kong.

The daughters all had names containing the character 如 (Ju): Adet 鳳如, Anor 玉如, and HsiangJu 相如.

The '''Mecklenburg Ancestral Table''' ({{lang-da|den Mecklenburgske anetavle}}) is an illustrated 17th-century genealogical table of 63 ancestors of [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow|Queen Sophie of Denmark]] (1557–1631). It hangs in the [[Abbey Church, Nykøbing Falster|Abbey Church]] in [[Nykøbing Falster|Nykøbing]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Falster]].&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0206-0241.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Nykøbing Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 206–241. {{da icon}} Retrieved 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Queen Sophie's genealogical table was the work of [[Antonius Clement]] from [[Odense]]. It was donated by the queen to Nykøbing's Abbey Church. Evert Decker, Clement's closest pupil, began the work in 1622, receiving a partial fee of 500 [[Danish rigsdaler|courant daler]] in 1624. The table, however, was not completed until 1626 when Frantz Kraeg received payment for the upper sections, one of which bears the date of fitting, 1627.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

The table consists of boards of oak (top sections in pine) which are arranged into two halves. Its surface, covering {{convert|33|m2|abbr=on}} is painted with oils on a chalk base. It shows Queen Sophie (in the centre below the two halves) with five generations of her ancestors, 63 in all, with half-length portraits, coats-of-arms and name plates. Each row covers a generation with the queen's paternal relatives on the right and the maternal ancestors on the left.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

[[File:Mecklenburgske anetavle.jpg|thumb|left|Antonius Clement: Mecklenburg ancestral table, detail of paternal ancestors]] 

The value of the images as portraits is however limited to the closest family members, especially those of the queen dowager herself and her parents, which are considered reliable portrayals. By contrast, those of the older generations are imaginative works, often wearing equally imaginative clothing. Inscriptions are in gilded capitals on a dark background. The frame is in the [[Auricular style]] with [[putto|putti]] and angels. On the [[cornice]] below, there are small female figures representing the virtues. Both the upper sections are crowned with angels, one blowing a [[bassoon]], the other waving a palm branch. The German inscription at the top states (in summary):&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

:Sophie, Queen of Denmark, Frederik II's widow, has had this table drawn up and installed in the year 1627 in honour of her parents and for the memory of her descendants, after giving birth with the same lordly highness to seven children, Christian IV, King of Denmark, Ulrich and Johan, Dukes of Schleswig Holstein, and Elisabeth, Duchess of Braunschweig and Lüneburg, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, Augusta, Duchess of Schleswig Holstein and Hedvig, Electress of Saxony.

The table has been restored on several occasions, most recently in 1943 by N. H. Termansen. Cracks were repaired and the original base tone was revealed after being completely covered over during an earlier restoration, probably that of 1874. The table hangs on the church's north wall, on a U-shaped iron support.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2732">'''Munīr al-Rayyis''' (1901–1992) was a prominent Syrian newspaper editor and writer.

Munir was born in Damascus. He studied literature at Damascus University and in 1919 began to work for the Ministry of Education. In the same year, be began writing for the newspapers ''al-Ayyam'' (Damascus) and ''al-Hayat'' (Beirut). Munir opposed the [[French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon]] imposed in 1920 and in 1925 left his job to join the revolt of [[Sultan al-Atrash]]. At the end of the revolt, in 1927, Rayyes returned to Damascus, where he was a regular writer for ''al-Hayyat''. In August 1933 Rayyes became a founder member of the [[League of Nationalist Action]], whose goal was to remove foreign political influence in the region. With the fading of the League in 1935, Rayyes moved to Palestine from 1936-38 to join [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. In 1938 he became the director of political affairs at the Damascus police department.

In 1945, Munir founded a newspaper, ''Barada'', working as its editor-in-chief, and another in support of [[Husni al-Za'im]]'s 1949 coup, called ''al-Inkilab'' (''The Coup d'Etat''). His journalism included campaigning for women's emancipation (including giving his wife, [[Thuraya Al-Hafez]], a platform; he also encouraged her to stand for election in 1953). On August 25, 1952, Barada merged with the Damascus daily paper ''al-Manar al-Jadid'' on the orders of [[Adib Shishakli]], becoming ''al-Liwaa''. The owner of ''al-Manar al-Jadid'', [[Bashir al-Ouff]], became editor-in-chief of the new paper, and Rayyes the director, until in 1954 the papers were split again. 1954 also saw a short-lived experiment with running a shareholding company to print Syria's four main papers, ''[[al-Qabas]]'', ''[[Al-Ayyam (Damascus)|al-Ayyam]]'', ''[[Alif Ba']]'', and ''[[al-Sham]]''. Rayyes supported Arab nationalist movements in the 1950s and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt both during and after the [[United Arab Republic]]. Rayyes supported the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état]] but once their power was established, the Baath party closed ''Barada''.

Rayyes is also noted for his book ''Al-Kitāb al-Dhahabī li'l-Thawrāt al-Waṭaniyya fī al-Mashriq al-ʿArabī: al-Thawra al-Sūriyya al-Kubrā'' (''The Golden Book of Nationalist Revolutions in the Arab East'').&lt;ref&gt;(Beirut: Dār al-Ṭalīʿa li'l-Ṭabāʿa wa'l-Nashr, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelson Fu''' or '''Fu Lianzhang''' ({{zh|s=傅连暲}}; 1894–1968) was a Chinese doctor. He was one of the few Western-trained doctors to have made the [[Long March]] and later, in Beijing, a Vice-Minister of Public Health, to be responsible for the health of the Communist Party elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Zhisui]], Anne F. Thurston, Hongchao Dai, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm9xAAAAMAAJ The private life of Chairman Mao: the memoirs of Mao's personal physician], {{ISBN|0-679-40035-4}}, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, he was awarded the rank of [[lieutenant general]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]].

In the 1920s and 1930s, Fu lived and worked in the then-prefectural seat of [[Changting County|Changting]] (now [[Tingzhou, Longyan|Tingzhou town]]) in western [[Fujian]] Province. He was a senior doctor at its British Christian missionary ''Hospital of the Gospel''.
 
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Fu was severely persecuted and tortured by Vice Chairman [[Lin Biao]] and his subordinates, particularly [[Qiu Huizuo]]. He died in prison on March 29, 1968, at the age of 74.&lt;ref name="YanGao1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Yan Jiaqi]] |author2=Gao Gao |title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bNooFMV12sC&amp;pg=PA229 |date=January 1996 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1695-7 |pages=229–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pennsylvania ministries==
[[File:RichardRossiHealingService.JPG|right|thumb|Richard Rossi prays for the sick at one of his [[faith healing]] services, September, 1990.]]

Rossi moved to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] at age 18 to study at [[Liberty University]], where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in biblical studies.&lt;ref name="Backstage"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwitch|first1=Lauren|title=Actor Chad Allen's lead role in a $30 million|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/actor-chad-allens-lead-role-in-a-30-million/|accessdate=January 27, 2016|agency=Backstage, LLC|publisher=Backstage|date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rented movie theaters and showed films as an evangelistic outreach. Dramatic faith healings allegedly occurred.  The healing services, called "Healing Clinics,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Having faith: Adams pastor holds fifth healing clinic|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/41729162/|accessdate=December 24, 2015|publisher=North Hills News Record|date=December 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew from 200 to 2000.

In 1988, Rossi tried and failed to change both the name of the Church of the Three Rivers and its affiliation.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08125/878975-85.stm|title=Rev.

In September 1991, Rossi began broadcasting his nightly radio show ''Rich Rossi Live'' on Pittsburgh's [[WPIT|WPIT-FM]]. The program created controversy when Rossi called other evangelical churches "whores" who sell out the gospel for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodgers-Melnick|first1=Ann|title=Revivalist accuses rivals of selling out for money, fame|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19911020&amp;id=KN8cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1146,1418887|accessdate=December 25, 2015|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|date=October 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossi appeared on the [[Jerry Springer Show]] in 1994 to discuss faith healing, exorcism, and ESP.&lt;ref name="ppg60494"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/89380661/|title=Museum Fetes Fred Rogers|date=June 4, 1994|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 1994, Rossi's wife, Sherrie Lynn, was found near death in a coma on the side of a Pennsylvania road.

Sherrie Rossi testified in the trial that her attacker was a different man with brown eyes and that Rossi's eyes are blue.

After his release from jail, Rossi and his wife hosted a free Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Ranch House in Pittsburgh's North Park.

His tenure as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church was interrupted when parishioners discovered his attempted murder charges and alleged that he had misused church money; litigation ensued, and the parties settled out of court.&lt;ref name="levin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

Though some considered it a sensationalized depiction, it won the Angel Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for best documentary.&lt;ref name="charisma"/&gt;

In 2005, Rossi revisited Sister Aimee's story in the low-budget feature biographical film ''[[Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story]]'', (aka ''Aimee Semple McPherson''), featuring [[Mimi Michaels]] in the lead and [[Rance Howard]] as the preacher's father.

On November 28, 2014, Rossi was in the news again regarding the controversy over the [[shooting of Michael Brown]]. Rossi wrote and recorded a [[protest song]] expressing his feelings about a grand jury's decision not to charge a white police officer in the death of the unarmed black teen in [[Ferguson, Missouri]]. "I wrote the song in five minutes as a way to express my emotions about the danger of trigger-happy police," Rossi said. "I filmed it on my laptop at my kitchen table and uploaded it to YouTube." Rossi uploaded the video on November 26, and provided the song's lyrics in the video description. Here is a sample from the song's beginning, printed in the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'': "Down at the courthouse on a Monday afternoon/Justice was thrown right out the window when a young white cop entered the room."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valley Village singer responds to Ferguson with YouTube protest song|url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20141128/valley-village-singer-responds-to-ferguson-with-youtube-protest-song|accessdate=December 24, 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossi continues to host his radio talk-show "''Richard Rossi Live''" as a [[podcast]] on [[BlogTalkRadio]]. In 2015, the format of the program changed from its Christian roots on [[WPIT]], a [[Salem Radio Network]] station, by broadening its content for a general audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodgers-Melnick|first1=Ann|title=Revivalist accuses rivals of selling out for money, fame|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19911020&amp;id=KN8cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1146,1418887&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 22, 2015|publisher=Pittsburgh Press|date=October 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rossi still on occasion discusses religion, the program's focus is on known artists, writers, and celebrity guests.

Following the positive Pittsburgh reception to Rossi's Roberto Clemente project, Rossi said enough time had passed for him and his wife to forgive the media in his hometown for writing untruths about them.  Rossi said they were finally coming home, living "bicoastal," maintaining homes in [[Hollywood]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. "We'd like to spend more time in our home, where most of our family and friends live, in the North Hills of Pittsburgh," Rossi said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurutz|first1=Daveen Rae|title=Minister Jailed for Beating Wife in '94 Plans Return to Pittsburgh|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16989077.html|accessdate=January 8, 2016|agency=High Beam Research|publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|date=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Richard Rossi playing guitar in scene from new film Canaan Land.

[[File:Romani daci.jpg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Map showing the area where [[Dacian language|Dacian]] was spoken. The blue area shows the Dacian lands conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. The orange area was inhabited by Free Dacian tribes and others.]]

Inhabited by the ancient [[Dacians]], part of today's territory of [[Romania]] was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106,&lt;ref&gt;Rita J. Markel, The Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 17, Twenty-First Century Books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Trajan]]'s army defeated the army of [[Dacia]]'s ruler [[Decebalus]] (''see [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]''). The [[Roman Dacia|Roman administration]] withdrew two centuries later, under the pressure of the [[Goths]] and [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]].

Two theories account for the origin of the Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Province of [[Dacia]], while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of [[Illyria]], [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]], and [[Macedon]], and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the Danube into the area which they inhabit today.

According to the first theory, the Romanians are descended from indigenous populations that inhabited what is now Romania and its immediate environs: [[Thracians]] ([[Dacians]], [[Getae]])  and Roman legionnaires and colonists. In the course of the two wars with the Roman legions, between AD 101–102 and AD 105–106 respectively, the emperor [[Trajan]] succeeded in defeating the Dacians and the greatest part of Dacia became a Roman province. 

[[File:Vatra.jpg|upright=0.9|left|thumb|Map showing the area where [[Latin language]] was spoken in pink during the Roman Empire in the 4-7th century.]]

The colonisation with Roman or Romanized elements, the use of the [[Latin]] language and the assimilation of Roman civilisation as well as the intense development of urban centres led to the Romanization of part of the autochthonous population in Dacia. This process was probably concluded by the 10th century when the assimilation of the [[Slavs]] by the Daco-Romanians was completed.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2009, O.Ed. "The ethnogenesis of the Romanian people was probably completed by the 10th century. The first stage, the Romanization of the Geto-Dacians, had now been followed by the second, the assimilation of the Slavs by the Daco-Romans".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the south-of-the-Danube origin theory, the Romanians' ancestors, a combination of Romans and Romanized peoples of Illyria, Moesia and Thrace, moved northward across the Danube river into modern-day Romania. Small population groups speaking several versions of Romanian (Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Aromanian) still exist south of the Danube in Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia, but it is not known whether they themselves migrated from more northern parts of the Balkans, including Dacia. The south-of-the Danube theory usually favours northern [[Albania]] and/or [[Moesia]] (modern day Serbia and Northern Bulgaria) as the more specific places of Romanian [[ethnogenesis]].

Small genetic differences were reportedly&lt;ref name = "Varzari2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1007/s10038-007-0113-x|pmid= 17387576|title= Population history of the Dniester–Carpathians: Evidence from Alu markers|journal= Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 52|issue= 4|page= 308|year= 2007|last1= Varzari|first1= Alexander|last2= Stephan|first2= Wolfgang|last3= Stepanov|first3= Vadim|last4= Raicu|first4= Florina|last5= Cojocaru|first5= Radu|last6= Roschin|first6= Yuri|last7= Glavce|first7= Cristiana|last8= Dergachev|first8= Valentin|last9= Spiridonova|first9= Maria|last10= Schmidt|first10= Horst D.|last11= Weiss|first11= Elisabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; found among [[Southeastern Europe]]an (Greece, Albania) populations and especially those of the [[Dniester]]–[[Carpathian]] (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region. Despite this low level of differentiation between them, tree reconstruction and principal component analyses allowed a distinction between Balkan–Carpathian (Romanians, Moldovans, Ukrainians, Macedonians and Gagauzes) and Balkan Mediterranean (Greeks, Albanians, Turks) population groups. The genetic affinities among Dniester–Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships. According to the report, the results indicate that the ethnic and genetic differentiations occurred in these regions to a considerable extent independently of each other.

During the [[Middle Ages]] Romanians were mostly known as [[Vlachs]], a blanket term ultimately of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, from the word [[Walha]], used by ancient Germanic peoples to refer to [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking and [[Celts|Celtic]] neighbours. Besides the separation of some groups ([[Aromanians]], [[Megleno-Romanians]], and [[Istro-Romanians]]) during the [[Great migration of the Slavs|Age of Migration]], many Vlachs could be found all over the [[Balkans]], in [[Transylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peoples of Europe| publisher= Marshall Cavendish Corporation | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7614-7378-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=gwqL95lflz4C&amp;pg=PA408&amp;dq=vlachs+maramures#PPA391,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; across [[Carpathian Mountains]]&lt;ref name="boundary"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|title=International Boundary Study Hungary – Romania (Rumania) Boundary|volume=47|publisher=US Office of the Geographer Bureau of Intelligence and Research|url=http://archive.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS047.pdf|date=15 April 1965|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001050145/http://archive.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS047.pdf|archivedate=1 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as far north as [[Poland]] and as far west as the regions of [[Moravia]] (part of the modern [[Czech Republic]]), some went as far east as [[Volhynia]] of western [[Ukraine]], and the present-day [[Croatia]] where the [[Morlachs]] gradually disappeared, while the Catholic and Orthodox Vlachs took Croat and Serb national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Slavonian Census of 1698.

Because of the migrations that followed – such as those of [[Slavs]], [[Bulgars]], [[Hungarians]], and [[Tatars]] – the Romanians were organised in agricultural communes ([[Obște|obști]]), developing large centralised states only in the 14th century, when the [[Danubian Principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] emerged to fight the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

During the [[late Middle Ages]], prominent medieval Romanian monarchs such as [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Moldavia]], [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]], [[Michael the Brave]], or [[Vlad the Impaler]] took part actively in the history of [[Central Europe]] by waging tumultuous wars and leading noteworthy crusades against the then continuously expanding Ottoman Empire, at times allied with either the [[Kingdom of Poland]] or the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in these causes.

&lt;/center&gt;

Eventually the entire [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] was annexed by the Ottoman Empire. However, Moldavia and Wallachia (extending to Dobruja and Bulgaria) were not entirely subdued by the Ottomans as both principalities became autonomous (which was not the case of other Ottoman territorial possessions in Europe). Transylvania, a third region inhabited by an important majority of Romanian speakers, was a vassal state of the Ottomans until 1687, when the principality became part of the Habsburg possessions. The three principalities were united for several months in 1600 under the authority of Wallachian [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]].&lt;ref name=Stoica1&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=18|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/18/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transhumance ways of the Vlachs.jpeg|thumb|right|Romanian and Vlach [[transhumance]] in Eastern and Southeastern Europe]]
Additionally, in medieval times there were other lands known by the name 'Vlach' (such as [[Great Vlachia]], situated between [[Thessaly]] and the western [[Pindus]] mountains, originally within the [[Byzantine Empire]], but after the 13th century autonomous or semi-independent; [[White Wallachia]], a Byzantine denomination for the region between the Danube River and the Balkans; [[Moravian Wallachia]], a region in south-eastern Czech Republic).

Up until 1541, Transylvania was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], later (due to the conquest of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire) was a self-governed Principality governed by the Hungarian nobility. In 1699 it became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg lands]]. By the 19th century, the [[Austrian Empire]] was awarded by the Ottomans with the region of [[Bukovina]] and, in 1812, the Russians occupied the eastern half of Moldavia, known as [[Bessarabia]].

=== Late Modern Age to Contemporary Era ===
[[File:RomaniaBorderHistoryAnnimation 1859-2010.gif|thumb|right|Animated history of Romania's borders (mid 19th century—present)]]

In the context of the 1848 [[Romantic nationalist|Romanticist]] and [[national liberalism|liberal]] revolutions across Europe, the events that took place in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Grand Principality of Transylvania]] were the first of their kind to unfold in the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the [[Austrian Empire]]) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being [[Avram Iancu]] and [[Stephan Ludwig Roth]].

On the other hand, the Wallachian revolutions of [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|1821]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848]] as well as the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848]], which aimed for independence from Ottoman and Russian foreign rulership, represented important impacts in the process of spreading the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal ideology]] in the eastern and southern Romanian lands, in spite of the fact that all three eventually failed. Nonetheless, in 1859, [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] elected the same ruler, namely [[Alexander John Cuza]] (who reigned as ''[[Domnitor]]'') and were thus unified ''de facto'', resulting in the [[United Principalities|United Romanian Principalities]] for the period between 1859 and 1881.

During the 1870s, the United Romanian Principalities (then led by [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] Domnitor [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]) fought a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|War of Independence]] against the Ottomans, with Romania's independence being formally recognised in 1878 at the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Although the newly founded [[Kingdom of Romania]] initially allied with [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]] refused to enter [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], because it was obliged to wage war only if Austria-Hungary was attacked. In 1916, Romania joined the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]]. 

As a result, at the end of the war, Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina were awarded to Romania, through a series of international peace treaties, resulting in an enlarged and far more powerful kingdom under King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]]. As of 1920, the Romanian people was believed to number over 15 million solely in the region of the Romanian kingdom, a figure larger than the populations of [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]] combined.&lt;ref name=Stoica2&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=50|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/50/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interwar period, two additional monarchs came to the Romanian throne, namely [[King Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. This short-lived period was marked, at times, by political instabilities and efforts of maintaining a [[constitutional monarchy]] in favour of other, totalitarian regimes such as an [[absolute monarchy]] or a [[military dictatorship]].

[[Romania during World War II|During World War II]], the Kingdom of Romania lost territory both to the east and west, as [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of [[Hungary]] through the [[Second Vienna Award]], while Bessarabia and northern Bukovina were taken by the Soviets and included in the [[Moldavian SSR]], respectively [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The eastern territory losses were facilitated by the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop German-Soviet non-aggression pact]]. 

After the end of the war, the Romanian Kingdom managed to regain territories lost westward but was nonetheless not given Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the aforementioned regions being forcefully incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union imposed a Communist government and [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] was forced to abdicate and leave for exile. [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] became the head of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1965 and his draconian rule of the 1980s was ended by the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].

The 1989 revolution brought to power the dissident communist [[Ion Iliescu]]. He remained in power as head of state until 1996, when he was defeated by [[Romanian Democratic Convention|CDR]]-supported [[Emil Constantinescu]] at the [[Romanian general election, 1996|1996 general elections]], the first in post-Communist Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power. Following Constantinescu's only term as president from 1996 to 2000, Iliescu was re-elected in late 2000 for another term of four years. In 2004, [[Traian Băsescu]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Party (Romania)|PD]] candidate, was elected president. Five years later, Băsescu was narrowly re-elected for a second term at the [[Romanian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]]. 

In 2014, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|PDL]] candidate [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]] won a surprise victory over former prime minister and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]]-supported contender [[Victor Ponta]] in the second round of the [[Romanian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential elections]]. Thus, Johannis became the first Romanian president stemming from an ethnic minority (as he belongs to the [[Germans of Romania|Romanian-German community]], being a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]]).

In the meantime, Romania's major foreign policy achievements were the alignment with [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States of America|United States]] by joining the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] in 2004 and the [[European Union]] three years later, in 2007.

From a group of 178 males from 9 [[Counties of Romania|Romanian counties]], mainly from Transylvania, most of them belong to the [[Paleolithic]] European lineage [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]] (17% I2a1b, 2% I2a2, 3% I2*), to [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] (20%) and to [[Haplogroup E-V68|E1b1b1a1b]] (19%).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Haplogroup J2]] is represented at 16% among them, unlike the structure in the [[Apennine Peninsula]], among Romanians the J2b clade prevails.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About 10% of these belong to [[Haplogroup R1b]] in all counties. R1b-U152, the specific Alpino-Italic clade, is represented at 3% among them, the prevailing branches are eastern, except for [[Brașov]] where Germanic U106 is most frequent. U106 is also prevalent clade of R1b in [[Buhuși]] and [[Piatra Neamț]]. In [[Brașov County|Brașov]] and [[Dolj County|Dolj]] I2 prevails, in [[Cluj]] – R1a. Another 6% of these belong to I1 and 2% to G2a. T, N, Q are also represented by frequencies of less than a percent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite negligible Roman genetic traits in general, one study&lt;ref name="Stefan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stefan|first1=et al|title=Y chromosome analysis reveals a sharp genetic boundary in the Carpathian region|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=27–33|date=2001|doi= 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200580|pmid=11175296|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v9/n1/pdf/5200580a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 219 Romanians found strong indications in other parts of [[Transylvania]], in the region corresponding to [[Roman Dacia]]. The highest frequency of R1b (31–32%) in Eastern Europe only behind [[Trebic]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (32.7%) was found in the Romanian counties [[Arad County|Arad]] and [[Alba County|Alba]], that experienced [[Celts in Transylvania|Celtic settlement]], the [[Roman Dacia#Colonists|heaviest and only Roman colonisation]] with a significant number of colonists from [[Noricum]] and West [[Pannonia]], and later German settlement. 

The subclade of R1b was not revealed in the case, but no similar high or prevailing frequency of Eastern subclades of R1b has ever been found in Europe. Three of the ten towns that were almost exclusively populated by Roman citizens ([[Alba Iulia|Apulum]], [[Ampelum]] and [[Potaissa]]) were in present Alba Iulia county, not far from the Roman capital [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]].  Genetic isolate due to migration from unattested migration from the Middle East would not be a plausible historic-geographical event as even the eastern branch of R1b in Europe is different than these in the Middle East.  The only ethnic groups with higher frequencies of R1b in the East are the [[Aromanians]] due to their main ancestry from the Roman West. In some occasions the U106 branch, which is minimal among Romanians, rises to the prevailing clade in some cities, but still at a low frequency. The high frequency of R1b was found in other places in Transylvania – 25% in [[Maramureș County|Maramureș]] and [[Harghita County|Harghita]], 20% in [[Mehedinți County|Mehedinți]], 14% in [[Bihor County|Bihor]], 11% in [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]], 0% in [[Neamț County|Neamț]]. Excluding Arad and Alba Iulia, Haplogroup I+G was found as most frequent in all, except Maramureș, where Haplogroup J was found to be prevalent.

According to an [[autosomal]] analysis of eastern Europeans and adjacent peoples, the group of Bulgarians and Macedonians is located together with Romanians.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; Most [[West Slavs]], [[Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] tend to share as many identical by-descent segments with [[South Slavs]] as with Romanians, [[Torbeshi]] and [[Gagauzes]].&lt;ref name=slav/&gt;

== Language ==
{{Main article|Romanian language}}
[[File:Scrisoarea lui Neacsu.jpg|thumb|[[Neacșu's letter]] to Johannes Benkner (former mayor of Kronstadt/Brașov) is the oldest document written in Romanian discovered to date]]

The origins of the [[Romanian language]], a [[Romance language]], can be traced back to the Roman colonisation of the region. The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin,&lt;ref name=Stoica2/&gt; although there are some [[substratum]] words that are sometimes assumed to be of [[Dacian language|Dacian]] origin. Romanian language has retained the inflected structure of Latin grammar.

During the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby [[Slavic languages]] (see [[Slavic influence on Romanian]]). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ayfer AKTAŞ, Türk Dili, TDK, 9/2007, s. 484–495, Online: [http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/YENI%20TURK%20DILI/ayfer_aktas_gunumuz_rumence_turkce_kaynakli_sozler.pdf turkoloji.cu.edu.tr]&lt;/ref&gt; During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], though the language has increasingly begun to adopt [[English language|English]] borrowings.

The [[Moldovan language]], in its official form, is practically identical to Romanian, although there are some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of [[Transnistria]], the official script used to write Moldovan is Cyrillic.

As of 2017, an [[Ethnologue]] estimation puts the (worldwide) number of Romanian speakers at approximately 24.15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron Romanian language] on [[Ethnologue]].&lt;/ref&gt; The 24.15 million, however, represent only speakers of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], not all of whom are necessarily ethnic Romanians. Also, this number does not include ethnic-Romanians who no longer speak the Romanian language.

=== Surnames ===

Many Romanian [[surname]]s have the suffix ''-escu'' or (less commonly) ''-aşcu'' or ''-ăscu'' which corresponds to the Latin suffix ''-iscus'' and means "belonging to the people". For example, ''Petrescu'' used to be ''Petre's keen''.  Similar suffixes such as ''-asco'', ''-asgo'', ''-esque'', ''-ez'', etc. are present in other Latin-derived languages. Many Romanians in France changed this ending of their surnames to ''-esco'', because the way it is pronounced in French better approximates the Romanian pronunciation of ''-escu''.

Another widespread suffix of Romanian surnames is ''-eanu'' (or ''-an'', ''-anu''), which indicates the geographical origin. Here some examples: Moldoveanu/Moldovan/Moldovanu, from the region of [[Moldavia]] or from [[Moldova River|river Moldova]], Munteanu "from mountains", Jianu "from Jiu river region", Prut''eanu'', meaning from the [[Prut]] river, Mureș''anu'', meaning from the [[Mureș River|Mureș]] river, Petr''eanu'' (meaning the son of Petre) etc..

Other suffixes are ''-aru'' (or ''-oru'', ''-ar'', ''-or''), which indicates an occupation (like Feraru "smith", Morar "miller"), and ''-ei'', usually preceded by ''A-'' in front of a female name, which is a Latin inherited female genitive, like in '' Amariei'' ''"of Maria"'', ''Aelenei'' ''"of Elena"''. These matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of Moldavia.

The most common surnames are ''Pop'' / ''Popa'' ("the priest")—almost 200,000 Romanians have this surname&lt;ref name=name-freq&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&amp;id=1946 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106020531/http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&amp;id=1946 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-01-06 |title=Romanii au nume "trasnite" |date=December 2007|publisher=Ziua|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;—''Popescu'' ("son of the priest") —almost 150,000 have this name&lt;ref name=name-freq/&gt;— and ''Ionescu'' ("John's (Ion's) son").

== Names for Romanians ==
In English, Romanians are usually called Romanians, Rumanians, or Roumanians except in some historical texts, where they are called Roumans or [[Vlachs]].

=== Etymology of the name Romanian (român) ===
{{Main article|Name of Romania}}
[[File:Tricolore1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Romanian revolutionaries of 1848 waving the tricolor flag]]

From the Middle Ages, Romanians bore two names, the [[exonym]] (one given to them by foreigners) ''Wallachians'' or ''Vlachs'', under its various forms (vlah, valah, valach, voloh, blac, olăh, vlas, ilac, ulah, etc.), and the [[endonym]] (the name they used for themselves) ''Romanians'' (Rumâni/Români).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/48209/1/Pop%2bIoan%2bAurel-Despre%2bsemnificatia%2bunor%2bnume-2009.pdf|title=On the Significance of Certain Names: Romanian/Walllachian and Romania/Wallachia|author=Pop, Ioan-Aurel|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Romanian" is derived from Latin "''Romanus''". Under regular phonetical changes that are typical to the Romanian languages, the name ''romanus'' over the centuries transformed into "rumân" {{IPA-ro|ruˈmɨn|}}. An older form of "român" was still in use in some regions. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 18th century led to a gradual preponderance of the "român" spelling form, which was then generalised during the [[National awakening of Romania]] of early 19th century.

Until the 19th century, the term Romanian denoted the speakers of the Daco-Romanian dialect of the Romanian language, thus being a much more distinct concept than that of Romania, the country of the Romanians. Prior to 1867, the (Daco-)Romanians were part of different statal entities: with the Moldavians and the Wallachians being split off and having shaped separate political identities, possessing states of their own, and with the rest of Romanians being part of other states. However, they retained their Romanian cultural and ethnic identity.

==== Daco-Romanian ====

To distinguish Romanians from the other Romanic peoples of the Balkans (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians), the term [[Daco-Romanian]] is sometimes used to refer to those who speak the standard [[Romanian language]] and live in the territory of ancient [[Dacia]] (today comprising mostly Romania and Moldova), although some Daco-Romanians can be found in [[Vlachs of Serbia|the eastern part of Central Serbia]] (which was part of ancient [[Moesia]]).

=== Etymology of the term Vlach ===
{{Main article|Vlachs}}

The name of "[[Vlachs]]" is an [[exonym]] that was used by Slavs to refer to all Romanized natives of the Balkans. It holds its origin from ancient Germanic—being a cognate to "Welsh" and "Walloon"—and perhaps even further back in time, from the [[Latin|Roman]] name Volcae, which was originally a [[Celt]]ic tribe. From the Slavs, it was passed on to other peoples, such as the [[Hungarians]] (''Oláh'') and [[Greeks]] (''Vlachoi'') (see the Etymology section of [[Vlachs]]). [[Wallachia]], the Southern region of Romania, takes its name from the same source.

Nowadays, the term Vlach is more often used to refer to the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak [[Romanian language|Daco-Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]].

=== Anthroponyms ===

These are family names that have been derived from either ''Vlach'' or ''Romanian''. Most of these names have been given when a Romanian settled in a non-Romanian region. Examples: Oláh (37,147 Hungarians have this name), Vlach, Vlahuta, Vlasa, Vlasi, Vlašic, Vlasceanu, Vlachopoulos, Voloh, Volyh, Vlack, Flack and Vlax.

{{Main article|Romanian diaspora}}

[[File:2015-04-08 09.26.08 pm.png|thumb|right|350px|Charts depicting share of Romanians living abroad within other states of the European Union]]

Most Romanians live in [[Romania]], where they constitute a majority; Romanians also constitute a minority in the countries that neighbour Romania. Romanians can also be found in many countries, notably in the other EU countries, particularly in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]; in [[North America]] in the  [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Israel]]; as well as in [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], and [[New Zealand]] among many other countries. Italy and Spain have been popular emigration destinations, due to a relatively low [[language barrier]], and both are each now home to about a million Romanians. With respect to geopolitical identity, many individuals of Romanian ethnicity in Moldova prefer to identify themselves as [[Moldovans]].&lt;ref name="davidlevinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coutryst"/&gt;

The contemporary total population of ethnic Romanians cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. A disparity can be observed between official sources (such as [[census]] counts) where they exist, and estimates which come from non-official sources and interested groups. Several inhibiting factors (not unique to this particular case) contribute towards this uncertainty, which may include:

*A degree of overlap may exist or be shared between Romanian and other ethnic identities in certain situations, and census or survey respondents may elect to identify with one particular ancestry but not another, or instead identify with multiple ancestries;&lt;ref name="refcitizenship"&gt;In an ever more globalized world the incredibly diverse and widespread phenomenon of migration has played a significant role in the ways in which notions such as "home," "membership" or "national belonging" have constantly been disputed and negotiated in both sending and receiving societies. – ''Rogers Brubaker, Citizenship and Nationhood '' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Counts and estimates may inconsistently distinguish between Romanian nationality and Romanian ethnicity (i.e. not all Romanian nationals identify with Romanian ethnicity, and vice versa);&lt;ref name="refcitizenship"/&gt;

*The measurements and methodologies employed by governments to enumerate and describe the ethnicity and ancestry of their citizens vary from country to country. Thus the census definition of "Romanian" might variously mean Romanian-born, of Romanian parentage, or also include other ethnic identities as Romanian which otherwise are identified separately in other contexts;&lt;ref name="refcitizenship"/&gt;

For example, the decennial [[US Census]] of 2000 calculated (based on a [[statistical sampling]] of household data) that there were 367,310 respondents indicating Romanian ancestry (roughly 0.1% of the total population).&lt;ref name="USCensus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on|title=2000 U.S. Census, ancestry responses|work=US Census Bureau|accessdate=13 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125030840/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on|archivedate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual total recorded number of foreign-born Romanians was only 136,000 [http://www.migrationinformation.org/ Migration Information Source] However, some non-specialist organisations have produced estimates which are considerably higher: a 2002 study by the Romanian-American Network Inc. mentions an estimated figure of 1,200,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211190118/http://www.ro-am.net/index.php?page=ro-am-communities Romanian Communities Allocation in United States: Study of Romanian-American population (2002)], Romanian-American Network, Inc. Retrieved 14 October 2005. Their figure of 1.2 million includes "200,000–225,000 Romanian Jews", 50,000–60,000 Germans from Romania, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; for the number of [[Romanian-American]]s. 

This estimate notes however that "...other immigrants of Romanian national minority groups have been included such as: [[Armenians of Romania|Armenians]], [[Germans of Romania|Germans]], [[Romani people in Romania|Gypsies]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]], and [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainians]]". It also includes an unspecified allowance for second- and third-generation Romanians, and an indeterminate number living in Canada. An error range for the estimate is not provided. For the [[United States 2000 Census]] figures, almost 20% of the total population did not classify or report an ancestry, and the census is also subject to undercounting, an incomplete (67%) response rate, and sampling error in general.

=== Contributions to humanity ===
{{Main article|List of Romanians}}

Romanians have played and contributed a major role in the advancement of the [[arts]], culture, [[sciences]], technology and [[engineering]].

In the history of aviation, [[Traian Vuia]] and [[Aurel Vlaicu]] built and tested some of the earliest aircraft designs, while [[Henri Coandă]] discovered the [[Coandă effect]] of fluidics. [[Victor Babeş]] discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, [[babesiosis]]; biologist [[Nicolae Paulescu]] discovered [[insulin]]. Another biologist, [[Emil Palade]], received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to [[cell biology]]. [[George Constantinescu]] created the [[theory of sonics]], while mathematician [[Ştefan Odobleja]] is regarded as the ideological father behind [[cybernetics]] – his work ''The Consonantist Psychology'' (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for [[N. Wiener]]'s ''Cybernetics'' (Paris, 1948). [[Lazăr Edeleanu]] was the first chemist to synthesize [[amphetamine]] and also invented the modern method of [[Oil refinery|refining]] [[crude oil]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the arts and culture, prominent figures were [[George Enescu]] (music composer, violinist, professor of Sir [[Yehudi Menuhin]]), [[Constantin Brâncuși]] (sculptor), [[Eugène Ionesco]] (playwright), [[Mircea Eliade]] (historian of religion and novelist), [[Emil Cioran]] (essayist, Prix de l'Institut Francais for stylism) and [[Angela Gheorghiu]] (soprano). More recently, filmmakers such as [[Cristi Puiu]] and [[Cristian Mungiu]] have attracted international acclaim, as has fashion designer [[Ioana Ciolacu]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In sports, Romanians have excelled in a variety of fields, such as football ([[Gheorghe Hagi]]), gymnastics ([[Nadia Comăneci]], [[Lavinia Miloşovici]] etc.), tennis ([[Ilie Năstase]], [[Ion Ţiriac]], [[Simona Halep]]), canoe racing ([[Ivan Patzaichin]]) and handball (four times men's [[World Men's Handball Championship|World Cup]] winners).
[[Count Dracula]] is a worldwide icon of Romania. This character was created by the Irish fiction writer [[Bram Stoker]], based on some stories spread in the late [[Middle Ages]] by the frustrated German trademen of Kronstadt ([[Braṣov]]) and on some [[Vampire_folklore_by_region#Romania|Vampire folk]] tales about the historic Romanian figure of Prince [[Vlad III Dracula|Vlad Ţepeş]].

=== Religion ===
{{See also|History of Christianity in Romania}}

Almost 90% of all Romanians consider themselves religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.evz.ro/ires-aproape-9-din-10-romani-se-considera-religiosi-dar-doar-10-tin-post.html|title = IRES: Aproape 9 din 10 români se consideră religioși, dar doar 10% țin post|date = 11 April 2015|accessdate = |website = Evenimentul Zilei|publisher = |last = Marian|first = Mircea|language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority are [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, belonging to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] (a branch of Eastern Orthodoxy, or Eastern Orthodox Church, together with the Greek Orthodox, Orthodox Church of Georgia and Russian Orthodox Churches, among others). 

According to the 2011 census, 93.6% of ethnic Romanians in [[Romania]] identified themselves as Romanian Orthodox (in comparison to 86.8% of Romania's total population, including other ethnic groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ |title=Populația stabilă după religie – județe, municipii, orașe, comune |work=Institutul Național de Statistică}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual rate of church attendance is significantly lower and many Romanians are only nominally believers. For example, according to a 2006 [[Eurobarometer]] poll, only 23% of Romanians attend church once a week or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_ro_nat.pdf|title=National Report: Romania – Autumn 2006|language=ro|page=25|publisher=European Commission, [[Eurobarometer]]|date=2006|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615180142/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_ro_nat.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 poll conducted by the [[Open Society Foundation]] found that only 33% of Romanians attended church once a ''month'' or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.fundatia.ro/sites/default/files/BOP-perceptii%20despre%20mass%20media.pdf|title=Barometrul de Opinie Publică|trans-title=Barometer of Public Opinion|work=[[Open Society Foundation]]|date=May 2006|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian Catholics are present in [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]], [[Bukovina]], [[Bucharest]], and parts of [[Moldavia]], belonging to both the [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic Church]] (297,246 members) and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Catholic Church]] (124,563 members). According to the 2011 census, 2.5% of ethnic Romanians in [[Romania]] identified themselves as Catholic (in comparison to 4.3% of Romania's total population, including other ethnic groups). Around 1.6% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identify themselves as [[Pentecostal]], with the population numbering 276,678 members. Smaller percentages are Protestant, Jews, Muslims, agnostic, atheist, or practice a traditional religion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are no official dates for the adoption of religions by the Romanians. Based on linguistic and archaeological findings, historians suggest that the Romanians' ancestors acquired polytheistic religions in the Roman era, later adopting Christianity, certainly by the 4th century CE when decreed by Emperor Constantine as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Like in all other Romance languages, the basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, such as ''[[God]]'' ("[[Dumnezeu]]" &lt; Domine Deus), ''church'' ("biserică" &lt; basilica), ''[[cross]]'' ("cruce" &lt; crux, -cis), ''angel'' ("înger" &lt; angelus), ''saint'' (regional: "sfân(t)" &lt; sanctus), ''Christmas'' ("Crăciun" &lt; creatio, -onis), ''[[Christian]]'' ("creştin" &lt; christianus), ''Easter'' ("paşte" &lt; paschae), ''sin'' ("păcat" &lt; peccatum), ''to baptise'' ("a boteza" &lt; batizare), ''priest'' ("preot" &lt; presbiterum), ''to pray'' ("a ruga" &lt; rogare), ''faith'' ( "credinţă" &lt; credentia ), and so on.

After the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], there existed a Catholic Bishopric of [[Cumania]] (later, separate bishoprics in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]). However, this seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, as in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.

According to a survey that took place in 2011, despite 94% of respondents answered positively for believing in God, 42% support the vision of Christian dogma that there is a God incarnated into a human being. While 34% of respondents said that there is only one true religion, 38% believe that there is one true religion and that other religions contain some basic truths, according to 18% there is one true religion and all major world religions contain some fundamental truths. 88% of Romanians believe in the existence of a [[soul]], 87% believe in [[sin]] and the existence of [[heaven]], 60% believe in an "[[evil eye]]", 25% believe in [[horoscopes]] and 23% in [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundatia.ro/dumnezeu-nu-%C3%AEnseamn%C4%83-acela%C8%99i-lucru-pentru-toti-rom%C3%A2nii|title=Dumnezeu nu înseamnă același lucru pentru toți românii|publisher=Soros.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=10 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713050024/http://www.fundatia.ro/dumnezeu-nu-%C3%AEnseamn%C4%83-acela%C8%99i-lucru-pentru-toti-rom%C3%A2nii|archive-date=13 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 survey, 80% consider themselves not superstitious and the same amount believe in [[angels]], about 40% believe they have had dreams that became [[deja vu]] and 19% believe in [[ghosts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/romanians-not-superstitious-but-believe-in-miracles/|title=Romanians, not superstitious, but believe in miracles|date=3 November 2014|website=Romania-insider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other ethnic groups ==
The closest ethnic groups to the Romanians are the other Romanic peoples of Southeastern Europe: the [[Aromanians]] ([[Macedonia (region)|Macedo]]-Romanians), the [[Megleno-Romanians]], and the [[Istro-Romanians]]. The Istro-Romanians are the closest ethnic group to the Romanians, and it is believed they left [[Maramureș]], [[Transylvania]] about a thousand years ago and settled in [[Istria]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istro-romanian.net/articles/art020105.html|title=Istro-Romanians in Croatia|author=Bogdan Banu|website=Istro-romanian.net|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numbering about 500 people still living in the original villages of Istria while the majority left for other countries after World War II (mainly to Italy, United States, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia), they speak the [[Istro-Romanian language]], the closest living relative of Romanian.

The Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians are Romanic peoples who live south of the Danube, mainly in [[Greece]], [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]], although some of them migrated to Romania in the 20th century. It is believed that they diverged from the Romanians in the 7th to 9th century, and currently speak the [[Aromanian language]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language]], both of which are [[Eastern Romance language|Eastern Romance]] languages, like Romanian, and are sometimes considered by traditional Romanian linguists to be dialects of Romanian.

'''Rudolf II''' (18 July 1552 &amp;ndash; 20 January 1612) was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1576–1612), [[King of Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]] (as '''Rudolf I''', 1572–1608), [[King of Bohemia]] (1575–1608/1611) and [[Archduke of Austria]] (1576–1608). He was a member of the [[House of Habsburg]].

Rudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways:&lt;ref name=hotson&gt;Hotson, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the [[Thirty Years' War]]; a great and influential patron of [[Northern Mannerist]] art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the [[scientific revolution]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Archdukerudolf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Archduke Rudolf, aged 15, painted by [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]]]]

Rudolf was born in [[Vienna]] on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], Holy Roman Emperor, King of [[Bohemia]], and King of Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]; his mother was [[Maria of Spain]], a daughter of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Isabella of Portugal]]. He was the elder brother of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.

Rudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563–1571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf's aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;Marshall, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf would remain for the rest of his life reserved, secretive, and largely a homebody who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of state.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the [[Renaissance]] period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of "[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.

==Personal life==

Like his near contemporary, [[Elizabeth I of England]] (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.&lt;ref name=rowse&gt;Rowse, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; He had several illegitimate children with his mistress [[Catherina Strada]]. Their eldest son, [[Don Julius Caesar d'Austria]], was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father.&lt;ref name="Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate|url=http://www.castle.ckrumlov.cz/docs/en/zamek_oinf_dojuda.xml|publisher=State Castle and Chateau Český Krumlov|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at [[Český Krumlov]] in Bohemia (in the modern-day [[Czech Republic]]), a castle which Rudolf purchased from the last of the [[House of Rosenberg]] ([[Peter Vok of Rosenberg|Peter Vok/Wok von Rosenberg]]) after he fell into financial ruin.  Julius lived at Český Krumlov when in 1608 he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son's act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.  However, Julius died in 1609 after showing signs of [[schizophrenia]], refusing to bathe, and living in squalor; his death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.&lt;ref name="Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate"/&gt;

Many artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 116-120&lt;/ref&gt;  The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the [[Catholic Church]] in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 121-123. Trevor-Roper mentions many stories and rumours, but not those of Rudolf's homosexuality&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
Historians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign.&lt;ref name=hotson/&gt; More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.&lt;ref name=hotson/&gt;

[[Image:Rudolf2c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[Aegidius Sadeler]] (1603)]]

Although raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of [[Protestantism]] and other religions including [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind [[conciliarist]]s, [[irenicist]]s and [[humanists]]. When the papacy instigated the [[Counter-Reformation]], using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.&lt;ref name=hotson/&gt;

His conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new [[Crusade]], he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Craft, Kimberly L. (2011) ''The Private Letters of Countess Erzsébet Báthory'', pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  This war lasted till 1606, and was known as "[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|The Long War]]".&lt;ref name=hotson/&gt; By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by [[Stephen Bocskay]] ([[Bocskai Uprising]]). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]. Matthias by 1606 forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels ([[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]]) and the Turks ([[Peace of Zsitvatorok]]). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'' in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague, until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.

==Death==
[[Image:Krone Kaiser Rudolf II Kaisertum Österreich.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Crown of Rudolf II]] later became the imperial crown of the [[Austrian Empire]].]]

Rudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the [[Defenestration of Prague]], the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the ''Letter of Majesty'', threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) started.

==Patron of arts, collector of curiosities==
Rudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Brueghel]]. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the [[Northern Mannerist]] style, such as [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], [[Hans von Aachen]], [[Giambologna]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Aegidius Sadeler]], [[Roelant Savery]], and [[Adrian de Vries]], as well as commissioning works from Italians like [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled.&lt;ref name=hotson/&gt; The adjective '''Rudolfine''', as in "Rudolfine Mannerism" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.

Rudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.

He patronized [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as the botanist [[Charles de l'Ecluse]], and the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the [[Rudolphine Tables]] (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as [[Jost Bürgi]], [[Erasmus Habermel]] and [[Hans Christoph Schissler]]. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ralf|last= Kern|title= Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Volume 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck|location= Cologne|year= 2010|pages=366 and 370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], a writer of [[Renaissance Latin]] poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.

Rudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive "[[cabinet of curiosities]]"&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; (''Kunstkammer'') incorporating "the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man". It was housed at [[Prague Castle]], where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections.&lt;ref&gt;Wendell E. Wilson, Joel A. Bartsch &amp; Mark Mauthner, Masterpieces of the Mineral World: Treasures from the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston Museum of Natural Science Harry N. Abrams/New York, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8109-6751-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lion and a tiger were allowed to roam the castle, documented by the account books which record compensation paid to survivors of attacks, or to family members of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Winder. Danubia. pp 129-130. Picador, Pan Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-330-52279-3}}. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolf was even alleged by one person to have owned the [[Voynich manuscript]], a codex whose author and purpose, as well as the language and script and posited cipher remain unidentified to this day. According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold [[ducat]]s. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The [[Codex Gigas]] was also in his possessions. 

As was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in the Rozmberk room.
[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|left|Richly ornamented [[celestial globe]] with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579]]
By 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated ''Kunstkammer''. ''Naturalia'' ([[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]]s) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.&lt;ref name=minhistory&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Mineral Collecting, 1530–1799 |last=Wilson |first=Wendell |editor=Wilson, Wendell |year=1994 |publisher=Mineralogical Record |url=http://www.minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |access-date=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326044645/http://minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |archive-date=2013-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolf's ''Kunstkammer'' was not a typical "cabinet of curiosities" – a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine ''Kunstkammer'' was systematically arranged in an [[encyclopaedic]] fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt|Anselmus Boetius de Boodt]] (''c.'' 1550–1632), to [[curator|curate]] the collection. [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the [[mining]] regions of Germany, [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], often accompanied by his Bohemian [[naturalist]] friend, [[Thaddaeus Hagecius]]. Between 1607 and 1611, [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] catalogued the ''Kunstkammer'', and in 1609 he published ''Gemmarum et Lapidum'', one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.&lt;ref name =minhistory/&gt;
[[File:Praha Hoefnagel 1595 DSCN0730.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Prague Castle]] in 1595 by [[Joris Hoefnagel]]]]

As was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the [[Emperor]], artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European [[philosophy]], the "[[Age of Reason]]".

Rudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the ''Kunstkammer'' gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to [[Vienna]]. The collection remaining at [[Prague]] was looted during the last year of the [[Thirty Years War]], by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the [[Orléans Collection]] after the death of [[Christina of Sweden]]. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. One of the surviving items from the ''Kunstkammer''  is a "fine chair" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]] in England;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, J. F., 1980. A Chair from the 'Kunstkammer' of the Emperor Rudolf II. The Burlington Magazine, 122(927), 428 to 432.

==Occult sciences==
{{HRE Arms|rudolf2}}
[[Astrology]] and [[alchemy]] were regarded as mainstream scientific fields in Renaissance [[Prague]], and Rudolf was a firm devotee of both. His lifelong quest was to find the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; When Rudolf was a prince, [[Nostradamus]] prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'. In the 1590s [[Sendivogius]] was active at Rudolph's court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.udu.cas.cz/en/archive/alchemy-and-rudolf-ii-searching-for-the-secrets-of-nature-in-central-europe-in-the-16th-and-17th-centuries|title=Alchemy and Rudolf II.

Rudolf gave Prague a mystical reputation that persists in part to this day, with [[Alchemists' Alley]] on the grounds of Prague Castle a popular visiting place and [[tourist attraction]].

Rudolf is also the ruler in many of the legends of the [[Golem of Prague]], either because of, or simply adding to, his occult reputation.

'''{{nihongo|Sai On|蔡温|}}''' (1682–1761), or '''Cai Wen''' in Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://chinajapan.org/articles/11.1/11.1steben39-60.pdf |title=The Transmission of Neo-Confucianism to the Ryukyu (Liuqiu) Islands and Its Historical Significance| last=Steben|first=Barry D.|date=1998 |journal=Sino-Japanese studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |OCLC= 695209537}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''{{nihongo|Gushi-chan Bunjaku|具志頭文若|lit. Bunjaku, head of [[Gushikawa, Okinawa|Gushi]]}}''',&lt;ref&gt;See [[Okinawan family name]] for an explanation of the multiple names typically held by the aristocracy of the Ryūkyū Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[scholar-bureaucrat]] official of the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], serving as [[regent]], instructor, and advisor to King [[Shō Kei]]. He is renowned for the many reforms he initiated and oversaw, and is among the most famous figures in Okinawan history. He edited ''[[Chūzan Seifu]]'', a rewrite of ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'' by his father Sai Taku.

==Life and career==
Sai On was born in [[Kumemura]], the village within the major port city of [[Naha]] which served as the chief center of classical Chinese learning in [[Okinawa]], and the source of the vast majority of the scholar-bureaucrats who were raised to serve in the administration of the kingdom. His father had likewise been a scholar-bureaucrat of Kumemura, educated in the [[Confucianism|Confucian classics]], and had served on several [[tribute]] missions to China. Sai On's father wrote the ''Chūzan Seifu'' by rewriting the ''Chūzan Seikan'' in 1701. Unlike ''Chūzan Seikan'', which was written in Japanese [[Kanbun]], ''Chūzan Seifu'' is written in [[Classical Chinese]]. Sai On edited ''Chūzan Seifu'' in 1724, and it is believed that this was to give the work a pro-Chinese point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Smits, presentation at "Interpreting Parades and Processions of Edo Japan" symposium, University of Hawaii at Manoa, 11 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 27, Sai On traveled to [[Guangzhou]] in China, where he studied economics, geography, and political administration alongside the more traditional Chinese classics.&lt;ref name=jinmei&gt;"Sai On." ''Okinawa rekishi jinmei jiten'' (沖縄歴史人名事典, "Encyclopedia of People of Okinawan History"). Naha: Okinawa Bunka-sha, 1996. p30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George H. (2000). ''Okinawa: the History of an Island People''. (revised ed.) Boston: Tuttle Publishing. p199.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning from China, Sai On was made instructor to the Crown Prince; upon the prince's accession to the throne as King Shō Kei in 1713, Sai On was elevated in position and power, and led the [[investiture]] mission to China in 1716. In 1728, he became a member of the ''[[Sanshikan]]'', the Council of Three chief royal advisors. Though Sai On was not of royal blood and so could not be named ''[[Sessei]]'' (a post which historian George Kerr translates as "prime minister"), reorganizations were undertaken within the government allowing Sai On extensive authority and powers.&lt;ref name=Kerr200&gt;Kerr. p200.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance, a number of land reforms were put into place, including the reclamation of land for agriculture, relocation and establishment of settlements, irrigation, flood control, and the planting of trees.&lt;ref name=jinmei/&gt; In a series of reforms very similar to those implemented in Japan around the same time, strict limitations were placed on farmers moving to the cities, and on the amount of craft work, such as woodworking and metalworking, which farmers were permitted to do. Thus, agricultural production was intensified and made more efficient while artisans were focused in the twin cities of Naha and [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. pp205–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years of the beginning of the implementation of Sai On's economic reforms and construction, reclamation and conservation projects, the kingdom was producing more than ever before.&lt;ref name=Kerr200/&gt;

In addition, the ''[[anji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'', hereditary lords of territories throughout the kingdom, were given stipends from the government in the form of rice, beginning in 1723. This tied them closer to the central government and also safeguarded to some extent their economic well-being, as they would no longer need to rely solely on inheritance for their relative wealth. Aristocrats were also encouraged to become artisans, with no loss of court rank or status, and in 1734, taxes upon artisans in the cities were eliminated, further encouraging an expansion of craft production. In addition, various forms of official government recognition for exemplary artisans, artists, and performers were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. pp206–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sai On Stele.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Stele]] dedicated to Sai On, at the [[Shiseibyō]] Confucian temple in Naha.]]
Okinawa's demand for wood outstripped the ability of the forests to renew themselves on their own, naturally, and the combination of [[deforestation]] and rainy weather including regular [[typhoon]] seasons led to extensive erosion and landslides. Sai On is particularly known for the forestry and soil conservation efforts undertaken under his guidance to combat these problems. Particular trees and sections of forest throughout the islands are still today called　"Sai On pines" (蔡温松, ''Sai On matsu''; 蔡温並木, ''Sai On namiki''), and his essays on the subject of forestry and conservation remained so valued that the [[post-war]] [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]] translated, published, and distributed them abroad in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. p207.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these essays, Sai On produced a number of other documents, including a handbook for administrative officials in the provinces entitled ''Yomui-kan'', and ''Ryokōnin Kokoroe'' (旅行人心得), or "Travelers' Advice", a guide for Okinawans abroad in China to help them in obscuring from the Chinese the relationship between Okinawa and Japan's [[Satsuma Domain]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. pp203,205.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rival government faction rose up against Sai On in 1734, accusing him of being too pro-Chinese, led by a pair of scholar-bureaucrats, [[Heshikiya Chōbin]] and [[Tomoyose Anjō]]. Before any plots against Sai On could be executed, however, Chōbin and fourteen others were arrested and put to death.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. p208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai On retired from his ministerial post in 1752, the year after Shō Kei's death, but remained influential until his own death at the age of 79 in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr. p209.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is known for her "Semi-Homemade" cooking concept, which Lee describes as using 70 percent pre-packaged products and 30 percent fresh items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sandra Lee: The Woman in White|url = http://www.vogue.com/865456/sandra-lee-the-woman-in-white/|website = Vogue|accessdate = 2016-01-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Christiansen was born in [[Santa Monica, California]],&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt; the daughter of Vicky and Wayne Christiansen. When Sandra was 2, her mother had her and her younger sister Cindy live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine.&lt;ref name="gma-excerpt"/&gt; By 1972, the girls' parents had divorced; their mother remarried, moving them to [[Sumner, Washington]]. When Lee was 11, her mother divorced for a second time. Lee by this time had three additional siblings, Kimmy, Richie and Johnny. At 15, following a beating by her mother, Lee moved in with her boyfriend, Duane, and on June 30, 1982, left for Wisconsin to live with her father and his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="gma-excerpt"/&gt; She graduated from Onalaska High School in [[Onalaska, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onalaskaalumni.com/sandra-lee/|title=Onalaska High School Alumni Association   –  Sandra Lee|work=Onalaska High School Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later attended the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]].&lt;ref name="gma-excerpt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Recipes/story?id=3799773&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true|title=Excerpt: 'Made From Scratch'|work=[[Good Morning America]]|date=October 31, 2007|publisher=ABC|accessdate=July 12, 2010|archivedate=May 12, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512170317/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Recipes/story?id=3799773&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sandraleepictures.com/press/FC_1107.htm|title=Recipe for Success|journal=Family Circle|date=November 1, 2007|last=Lee|first=Sandra|accessdate=2010-07-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716002837/http://sandraleepictures.com/press/FC_1107.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20091203/Sandra+Lee+and+Andrew+Cuomo+Love+Story|title=Sandra Lee and Andrew Cuomo: A Love Story|newspaper=Page Six Magazine|publisher=New York Post|location=New York|accessdate=July 12, 2010|last=Karni|first=Annie|date=December 3, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802023113/http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20091203/Sandra+Lee+and+Andrew+Cuomo+Love+Story|archivedate=August 2, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised as a [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] and later her family became [[Jehovah's Witness]].&lt;ref name=Tablet&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hoffman  |first= Allison |authorlink=   |title=Semi-Homemade, Totally Jewish - Turns out Sandra Lee converted a decade ago   |publisher=[[The Tablet]]|date=April 5, 2011 |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/64047/the-jewish-martha-stewart  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December of her junior year, she left college to live near family in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name="gma-excerpt"/&gt; She later attended a two week recreational course at [[Le Cordon Bleu]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada which she did not finish.&lt;ref name=Vogue02222011&gt;{{cite news|first=Gully|last=Wells|url=http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/sandra-lee-the-woman-in-white/|title=Sandra Lee: The Woman in White|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=November 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223151013/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/sandra-lee-the-woman-in-white/|archivedate=December 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the early 1990s, Lee created a product called "Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains", a home-decorating tool that used a wire rack and sheets or other fabric samples to create decorative drapery. The product was sold via [[infomercial]]s and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network [[QVC]] hired her as on-air talent; in her first 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2003/09/goodbye |title=Good-bye To All That|last=Rochlin|first=Margy|magazine=Gourmet|date=September 2003 |publisher=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee'' premiered on the [[Food Network]] in 2003. Each episode contains an [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] element, in which Lee decorates the table setting in accordance with the theme of the meal that she just prepared. She refers to these as "tablescapes". Lee's second Food Network series, ''Sandra's Money Saving Meals'', began airing on May 10, 2009.&lt;ref name="fn-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/sandra-lee/index.html|title=Sandra Lee|work=Hosts &amp; Chefs|publisher=[[Food Network]]|accessdate=October 12, 2010|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825054222/http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/sandra-lee/index.html|archivedate=August 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has released 25 books, including Sandra Lee ''Semi-Homemade: Cool Kids Cooking'' (October 2006) and a memoir, ''Made From Scratch'', which was released in November 2007.&lt;ref name="fn-bio"/&gt; A magazine based on her show, ''Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade'', was released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS125788+17-Feb-2009+PRN20090217|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201065903/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS125788+17-Feb-2009+PRN20090217|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 1, 2013|title=Television Star and Best-Selling Author Sandra Lee and Hoffman Media, Launches New Magazine Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade Today|publisher=Hoffman Media|agency=Reuters.com|accessdate=October 12, 2010|date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Lee won the [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Host for Semi-Homemade Cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Frazier|title=Daytime Emmys 2012 Winners Revealed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/23/daytime-emmys-2012-winners_n_1621807.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-09-19|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, she started a new monthly lifestyle magazine in partnership with TV Guide. She is also starring in two new shows: ''Sandra’s Restaurant Remakes'' and ''Sandra Lee’s Taverns, Lounges &amp; Clubs.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shain|first=Michael|title=Sandra Lee expands empire|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/sandra_lee_getting_out_from_behind_VYD2l1irJrfb1ncYsiEZaI|work=New York Post|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Lee won the [[Women's Entrepreneurship Day]] [[Women's Entrepreneurship Day#List of Pioneer Award Winners| Pioneer Award]] held at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.womenseday.org/community/wed-annual-pioneer-awards/|title=Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization Pioneer Awards 2016 Winners |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |author=Wendy Diamond |publisher=WED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
When the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' ran a review of Lee's cookbook ''Semi-Homemade Cooking'' that criticized both her recipe and her "Semi-Homemade" concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/food/92388_chou23.shtml|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|title=On Food: 'Semi-Homemade' is a halfhearted view of cooking|last=Chou|first=Hsiao-Ching|date=October 23, 2002|accessdate=October 12, 2010|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media|location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the review's author received a response "that was more impassioned than I anticipated", with most readers agreeing with the article. However, a number of readers disagreed with the column. One reader wrote, "Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/food/95256_chou13.shtml|title=On Food: Column on Sandra Lee really stirred the pot|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|last=Chou|first=Hsiao-Ching|date=November 13, 2002|accessdate=October 12, 2010|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media|location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Soller, writing for ''[[Newsweek]]'', compared Lee's impact upon television cooking with that of [[Julia Child]], noting that although Lee's show "is the furthest from Child's methods", both women "filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored".&lt;ref name="anti-julia"/&gt;

===Kwanzaa Cake===
Much of the criticism of Lee has coalesced around a recipe for "[[Kwanzaa]] Cake" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of ''Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee''. The recipe consisted of [[Angel food cake|angel food]] cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and [[Corn nut|corn nuts]] (all store-bought), with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/article/this-cake-will-make-your-eyeballs-burst-into-flame-25176 This Cake Will Make Your Eyeballs Burst Into Flames], Amelie Gillette ''The Onion AV Club'', March 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Food writer [[Anthony Bourdain]], who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as "eye searing" and "a war crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eat this, Anthony Bourdain!|first=Moriah |last=Balingit|work=McClatchy – Tribune Business News|location=Washington|date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ripping Rant on Food and Restaurant Business; Surly celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain spouts off about his likes, and mostly passionate dislikes, in the eminently entertaining Medium Raw.|first=Colette|last=Bancroft|work=St. Petersburg Times|location=Florida|date=July 7, 2010|page=E2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bourdain|first1=Anthony|title=Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook|publisher=Ecco|isbn=978-0-06-171894-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cake was called "scary" by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrity Chefs/Foodies with groupies|first=Mary|last=Vuong|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=Texas|date=May 17, 2006|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most ghastly-sounding dish in Lee's culinary repertoire" by ''Tulsa World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perhaps Democrats should taste Sandra Lee's cooking|first=Charlotte|last=Allen|work=[[Tulsa World]]|location=Oklahoma|date=December 5, 2010|page=G.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salon.com'' wrote that the video "takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just how offensive is Sandra Lee's crazy Kwanzaa cake?|date=December 26, 2010|first=Francis|last=Lam|publisher=Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/food/francis_lam/2010/12/26/sandra_lee_kwanzaa_cake_offensive|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cookbook author Denise Vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, wrote a humorous post in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' in December 2010 stating that she was responsible for the recipe (though she said that the candles were Lee's idea), and apologizing for it. She also wrote that Lee "has incredibly bad food taste".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurweb.com/2010/12/woman-behind-sandra-lee%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98kwanzaa-cake%E2%80%99-explains-debacle/ Woman behind ‘Sandra Lee Kwanzaa Cake’ Explains Debacle], ''Lee Bailey's EURweb''&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the post was removed, after Lee's lawyer threatened legal action.&lt;ref name="ravenous"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/sandra-lee-2011-4/index6.html|title=The Ravenous and Resourceful Sandra Lee|first=Benjamin|last=Wallace|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee has said this recipe is the only one of hers whose criticism she has taken to heart, and that the recipe was partly due to the Food Network dictating the show's content at the time.&lt;ref name="ravenous"/&gt;

==Personal life==
From 2001 to 2005, she was married to [[KB Home]] CEO and philanthropist [[Bruce Karatz]]&lt;ref name="Barbaro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/nyregion/15sandralee.html?pagewanted=all|title=A TV Cook’s Next Serving?

'''Sediqeh Dowlatabadi''' ({{lang-fa|صدیقه دولت‌آبادی}} {{Audio|Sediqeh Dowlatabadi (pronunciation).ogg|listen}}; 1882 in [[Isfahan]] &amp;ndash; July 30, 1961), was a [[Iran|Persian]] [[feminism|feminist]] activist and [[journalism|journalist]] and one of the pioneering figures in the [[Persian women's movement]].

Dowlatabadi published the first women's gazette in [[Esfahan]] called ''Zaban-e Zanan'' in 1919. Sediqeh Dowlatabadi was a pioneer in the unveiling of women. In 1925, there was a debate within the intellectual community, newspapers and women's magazines about the unveiling of women as a method of modernizing Iran and increasing women's participation in society, and rumors that the government planned to introduce such a policy: though this reform did not come about, some women from intellectual circles started to appear unveiled in public for the first time, possibly with silent encouragement by the government, and Sediqeh Dowlatabadi is believed to have been the first woman to have done so.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Beck, Guity Nashat, ''[https://books.google.se/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=women+in+shah+iran&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrqMHIn7_YAhUEJlAKHSC6CGkQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic]''&lt;/ref&gt; When the second [[Congress of Women of the East]] was arranged in Teheran in 1932, Princess [[Shams Pahlavi]] served as its president and Dowlatabadi as its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Beck, Guity Nashat, ''[https://books.google.se/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=women+in+shah+iran&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrqMHIn7_YAhUEJlAKHSC6CGkQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic]''&lt;/ref&gt; When the shah banned the veil in 1936, Sediqeh Dowlatabadi was an active supporter of the reform, and engaged in the new women's committee [[Kanun-e banovan]] formed by the government and the shah's daughter Shams to unite women organisations and prepare women for unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Beck, Guity Nashat, ''[https://books.google.se/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=women+in+shah+iran&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrqMHIn7_YAhUEJlAKHSC6CGkQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teru''' (stylized as '''TERU''') is a Japanese [[visual kei]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] musician, songwriter and artist. He is best known as guitarist for the [[symphonic metal]] band [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]. He is also a member of [[Jupiter (band)|Jupiter]]. Before Versailles he was previously in [[Aikaryu]] and supported his future bandmate [[Hizaki]] in his solo project.

==Biography==
Teru joined {{Nihongo|[[Aikaryu]]|藍華柳}} in 2002, replacing guitarist Death.&lt;ref name=Aikaryu&gt;{{cite web| title = Aikaryu JaME biography| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/artists-biography-400-aikaryu.html| date = 2009-01-29| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003 they signed to Crow Music (the same label as [[Hizaki]]'s band Crack Brain) and released their first single the following month.&lt;ref name=Aikaryu/&gt; For the next three years they toured extensively, had numerous releases and several line-up changes. But in early 2006, they were involved in a car accident with most members having serious injuries.&lt;ref name=Aikaryu/&gt; While the members recovered Teru participated in Hizaki's solo project, Hizaki Grace Project.&lt;ref name=Aikaryu/&gt; In December Aikaryu regrouped and performed a small tour. But in April 2007, they decided to disband.&lt;ref name=Aikaryu/&gt;

Teru joined Hizaki's solo band, Hizaki Grace Project, in October 2006. Which also included [[Jasmine You|Yuu]] (Jakura) on bass, Mikage (Babylon) on drums and [[Shaura|Juka]] ([[Moi dix Mois]]) on vocals. They released three albums; ''Dignity of Crest'', ''Ruined Kingdom'' and ''Curse of Virgo'', and on December 24, 2007 had their latest live performance.

In 2007, he was recruited for [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]] by Hizaki and [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], after being recommended by the Rock May-Kan venue. They quickly developed a large following worldwide, having their debut EP released domestically in Europe,&lt;ref name="European"&gt;{{cite web| title = Versailles mini-album Japan &amp; Europe Release| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/uk/news-24289-versailles-mini-album-japan-europe-release.html| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to date have gone on two world tours, which took them across Asia, Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Versailles reveals dates for their World Tour| work = tokyofever.com| url = http://www.tokyofever.com/2011/07/versailles-updates-with-locations-for-world-tour-2011/| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teru is also an artist, having designed many releases for Kamijo's record label [http://artist-society.com/ Sherow Artist Society] under the alias "Wait a Minute" (stylized as wait A minute), including for Versailles, Hizaki Grace Project and [[Matenrou Opera]]. He even gave a lecture at a seminar on the development of Japanese pop culture, held by the [[Kyoto University of Art and Design]] on November 25, 2010.&lt;ref name="KyotoUniv"&gt;{{cite web| script-title=ja:コンテンツ業界セミナー開催| language = Japanese| work = kyoto-art.ac.jp| url = http://www.kyoto-art.ac.jp/student/career/news/101118-001859.html| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed the artwork for the 2015 album, Venom, by American heavy metal band, [[Impellitteri]]

In January 2011, he and the rest of Versailles started starring in their own TV mini drama called {{Nihongo|''Onegai Kanaete Versailles''|おねがいかなえてヴェルサイユ||"Fulfill My Wish Versailles"}}. The show also starred [[Rina Koike]] and aired on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]] and [[TV Kanagawa]] until March.&lt;ref name="TV Show"&gt;{{cite web| title = Versailles to act in a drama| work = shattered-tranquility.net| url = http://shattered-tranquility.net/index.php/01/03/versailles-to-act-in-a-drama/| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Teru and Hizaki participated in the Blue Planet Japan project, which was created in response to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The project is comprised on many [[visual kei]] artists, including members of [[DaizyStripper]], [[heidi.]], Matenrou Opera, and [[Dolly (Japanese band)|Dolly]]. They performed live at Shibuya O-West on June 25 and released the single "Hitotsu Dake ~We are the One~" on September 14, with the proceeds from the single donated to the victims.&lt;ref name="BPJ live"&gt;{{cite web| title = Visual-Kei Collab Band BLUE PLANET JAPAN Peforms &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; "We Are The One"| work = jpopasia.com| url = http://www.jpopasia.com/news/visual-kei-collab-band-blue-planet-japan-peforms-we-are-the-one::7658.html| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BPJ single"&gt;{{cite web| title = Visual Kei Charity Single| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/uk/news-78383-visual-kei-charity-single.html| accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2011, the second anniversary of [[Jasmine You]]'s death, Teru composed and dedicated the song "「For You」" to his former bandmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|aNIii2KLOQ8|TERU /「for you」}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2012, Versailles announced they were stopping all activities at the end of the year. On April 1, 2013, every member of Versailles minus singer Kamijo announced they had formed a new band named [[Jupiter (band)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="Jupiter"&gt;{{cite web| title = New Band from Versailles Members| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-95031-new-band-from-versailles-members.html| accessdate = 2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jupiter 2"&gt;{{cite web| title = Versailles members create new band, ‘Jupiter’| work = tokyohive.com| url = http://www.tokyohive.com/2013/04/versailles-members-create-new-band-jupiter/| accessdate = 2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recruited Zin as vocalist and released their debut single, "Blessing of the Future", in the summer.&lt;ref name="Jupiter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jupiter 2"/&gt;

The '''''Prophecies of the Nun of Dresden''''', under the original Italian title of ''Le profezie della monaca di Dresda'', is a novel by Renzo Baschera which takes the form of an essay analyzing several manuscripts purportedly found at the beginning of the 19th century.  These manuscripts contain prophecies about the last Popes, the great European dynasties, technological progress, several disasters and the end of time, from the end of the 17th century to the end of the 30th century.

==Structure of the book==

===Introduction===
The ''Prophecies of the [[Nun]] of [[Dresden]]'' begins with an introduction, which shows the few historical notes of the prophetic manuscripts. These writings, according to Baschera's novel, were mentioned for the first time by a certain [[Abbot]] Nicolas Holb in 1808 in [[Vienna]]. The author of the manuscripts, written in the form of letters, was a [[Germans|German]] nun and [[clairvoyant]] whose actual name is not known.  Of her, it is only known that she was “a pious [[Religious (Catholicism)|Religious]] born in Dresden in 1680 and died in 1706” and that  “ . . . her [[convent]] was on the banks of the [[Elbe]]” River.&lt;ref name="pag7"&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the letters were written in [[German language|German]], some more in [[Latin]] and the others in both languages. This is surprising, especially considering the humble origins of the nun, who is thought to be illiterate.&lt;ref name="pag8"&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 8.  According to an unreferenced description by Baschera, in a convent in Dresden there was "a young nun, from a humble family, chosen by a celestial voice to send messages to the rulers of Earth".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third edition of the novel, the author adds a premise which claims to interpret the contemporary events (1986) in the light of the writings of the Nun, expecting the fulfillment of the predictions by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of the letters===
In the main section of the novel, the author analyzes the documents in his possession, a series of thirty-one letters written to the people who lived at the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century.  Some of them are in good condition, some are very damaged and others are copied. The analysis is divided into three groups:

Letters to the [[King]]s and [[Pope]]s:
* [[Pope Clement XI]]&lt;ref name="clementeXI"&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 15.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  "To Clement XI {{!}} Vicar on Earth of Our Lord”.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Charles XII of Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 29.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  :  “To Charles XII {{!}} King of Sweden”|p. 29|baschera&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peter I of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 33.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To Peter I {{!}} Caesar of Holy Russia”.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Frederick I of Prussia]]&lt;ref name="federicoI"&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 39.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To you, Frederick I {{!}} Great King of Prussia”.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philip V of Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 43.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To you, Philip {{!}} King of Spain”.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne of England]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 49.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “For Anna {{!}} Queen of England and of Scotland”.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis XIV of France]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 55.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To Louis XIV {{!}} Lord of France”.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro|Francesco Maria de’ Medici]]&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 67.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To Francesco Maria de' Medici {{!}} Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church”.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A certain abbot Argoth&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 75.

Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To the Very Reverend {{!}} Abbott Argoth”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 119.  Saluation quoted by Baschera:  “To the Very Reverend {{!}} Abbott Argoth”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', p. 149.

In letters to the historical figures several major events are predicted to happen to them and later their descendants or their country. In letters to the others, religious events are predicted general concern that some historical developments, some disasters and some technical progress. Letters of the Nun of Dresden prophesy events through a period of time from the end of the 17th century to the end of the 30th century.

===Conclusion===
The paper ends with a brief analysis of a particular aspect: the characters speak in a voice that suggests to the nun almost all of what to write.&lt;ref name="pag8" /&gt;  At first, the authority of the nun is posted with this entry, as is the case for most of the clairvoyants; subsequently, unlike the others that kept the detachment from all their visions, the woman accepted more and more the presence of what became the “sweet voice” letters, even when it promised catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', pp. 201-203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophecies==

===Prophecies for the Popes of the Catholic Church===
According to the author, like the [[Prophecy of the Popes|Prophecies of St. Malachy]], the Nun of Dresden even gives a motto for the Popes, but only for the last eleven of them:&lt;ref name="clementeXI" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Motto of the Nun !! Who is supposed to be !! &lt;small&gt;Motto of [[Saint Malachy|St. Malachy]]&lt;/small&gt;

|-

|}

The author points out that the name chosen by each of the several popes is connected to the sign prophesied by the motto. The author also notes a link between the color of the horses, according to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], and the historical period in which the pope lived:

* white horses correspond to the victory of the spiritual power of the Church;
* black horses correspond to a period of justice and balance;
* yellow horses correspond to death
* red horses correspond to the rider who takes away peace and represents a period of preparation for war.&lt;ref&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', pp. 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Frederick I of [[Prussia]], the nun predicts that “the last Peter will come from your land”.&lt;ref name="federicoI" /&gt;  Prussia is the name of a historical region that now lies between the borders of [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] with parts of eastern [[Germany]].

===Prophecies for the House of Savoy===
In her letter to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, the visionary German made several prophecies about the [[House of Savoy]].  The letter is divided into three parts. In the first part, the nun warns the Duke about his conduct and is more a moral poem than a prophecy. The second part contains the prophecies about the Duke himself: already at the beginning, the nun turns to Victor Amadeus II, calling him the "future king", as he would very soon become the “king of an island” (that did really happen in 1713, in [[Sicily]]), then the king of another island (that happened in 1720, in [[Sardinia]]), and the “king of the mountains” (which, however, did not happen).&lt;ref name="amedeoIIb"&gt;Baschera, ''op cit.'', pp. 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of the letter, the prophecies of the House of Savoy are contained. Savoy's reign is likened to a parade of horse-drawn carriages.  There are actually two.  In the first of them, each carriage was pulled by eight smaller horses (i.e., the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]) and, in the second, each carriage had five larger horses (i.e., the [[Kingdom of Italy]]). So far, the total of the rulers of the House of Savoy is eleven.  Eight of them were the Kings of Sardinia, from Victor Amadeus II to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], and the other four were the Kings of Italy, from Victor Emmanuel II to [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]].  According to the author,  the total would be eleven, if one counts twice Victor Emmanuel II, who was both the King of Sardinia and the King of Italy. The nun predicts that, between the fourth and fifth “big horse-drawn carriage” (i.e., between the fourth and fifth Kings of Italy), there would be a pause, during which the carriage was driven by “black horses”, which the author interprets as a republican or oligarchic government.  According to the interpretation of this prophecy by Baschera, Italy would now be in this moment of pause so, in the future, there could be a fifth King of Italy, the twelfth and last king of the House of Savoy.  He would be represented by a horse with a white cross and reign for a short time.&lt;ref name="amedeoIIb" /&gt;  

The nun gives an indication of the duration of both the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of Italy, before the Republican break: the first would have a duration of “twelve times twelve years” (144, three years more than the actual total of 141 years), while the second would have a duration of "the year upside down" for the first king of Italy (who died at the age of almost 58 years, after the reign of little more than 85 years). The nun also includes, for the five Kings of Italy from the House of Savoy, how they would die:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Nun's prophesy !! Whom was meant!! Actual cause of death
|-
| &lt;center&gt;die of the plague&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;fever caused by a lung infection&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| &lt;center&gt;die in the fire&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;[[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]]&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;killed by a gunshot&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| &lt;center&gt;die from grief&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;[[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]]&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;in exile, a natural death&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| &lt;center&gt;die from grief&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;[[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]]&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;in exile, a natural death&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| &lt;center&gt;die from grief&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;?&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;?&lt;/center&gt;
|}
She, as interpreted by the author, also prophesied that the fifth and last king of the House of Savoy of Italy would die in exile, a natural death.&lt;ref name="amedeoIIb" /&gt;

==Background and Representatives==
The Three Princes represented three different political views held during the [[Laotian Civil War]].

===Prince Boun Oum Na Champasak===
Right-wing Prince Boun Oum, cousin to the other two princes, overthrew the Phouma Government in 1960. Supported by [[Phoui Sananikone]], General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] and the Hmong Leader, General [[Vang Pao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/airamerica/best/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719082255/http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/airamerica/best/ |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince Souvanna Phouma===

===Prince Souphanouvong===
Half brother of Souvanna Phouma, Prince Souphanouvong, a staunch communist and the leader of the [[Pathet Lao]], was supported by [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] (later Prime Minister and President of the [[LPDR]]) and the North Vietnamese. By 1972, the Pathet Lao found it unacceptable to form a coalition with rightist members, mostly military generals and the rich and powerful [[Na Champassak]] and [[Sananikone]] families.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:PBDlk_WDN1oJ:jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%2520Materials/Peace%2520Negotiations-POWs/POWs%25201424.pdf+powerful+sananikone+family&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShp6c16cDh1duCjN9X3zzWui_XIrJBlR1Yu7uJU-YC3MMGw6z1cjsKo9Pvjata-78U3LV_Ei6E02djxm0Uq4Unsep9lrMRENnB2RSDnKLWA2waEo6DFCQPxzHPT5RK3po7qdJiI&amp;sig=AHIEtbQkKngE1M-yTn5smwL4Ccr0faDAnQ&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Traditions of Albania''' refers to the [[tradition]]s, [[belief]]s, [[value (ethics)|value]]s and [[Convention (norm)|custom]]s that belong within the [[Culture of Albania|culture]] of the [[Albanian people]]. Those traditions have influenced daily life in [[Albania]] for centuries and are still practiced throughout Albania, [[Balkans]] and [[Albanian diaspora|Diaspora]]. The Albanians have a unique culture, which progressed over the centuries of its strategic geography and its distinct historical evolution.

Albania is home to various [[Religion in Albania|religious communities]] such as [[Muslim]]s, [[Christian]]s and [[Jews]] and [[religious tolerance]] is among the most important values of the Albanian tradition. It is widely accepted, that Albanians are well known for those important values; the peaceful coexistence among the believers of different religions and beliefs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Island of Peace: Documentary on Religious Coexistence in Albania|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/member-states/single-view/news/island_of_peace_documentary_on_religious_coexistence_in_alb/|website=unesco.org|accessdate=22 July 2011|page=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BBC|title=The country that's famous for tolerance|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20161024-the-worlds-most-tolerant-country|website=bbc.com|page=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania is a hospitable culture; [[hospitality]] is a fundamental custom of the local society and [[Albanian cuisine|serving food]] is integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian [[Kanun (Albania)|code of honor]], called [[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]], resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mirjona SADIKU|title=Page 1 A Tradition of Honor, Hospitality and Blood Feuds:Exploring the Kanun Customary Law inContemporary Albania.|url=http://js.ugd.edu.mk/index.php/BSSR/article/download/861/833.|website=js.ugd.edu.mk|pages=11-14|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Mansouri began his career at ''Tinqueux SC'', a small team from [[Tinqueux]] who were playing in the sixth division. At age 17, he left the club and signed with [[Le Havre AC]] who were playing in [[Ligue 1]], where he spent his first two seasons playing in the reserve side. He made his debut in the first game of the 1997–1998 season, coming as a second-half substitute against [[Olympique de Marseille]]. He would slowly assert himself at the club and would eventually go on to make 134 appearances and scoring 2 goals in 6 seasons in both [[Ligue 1]] and [[Ligue 2]].

At the start of the 2003–2004 season, Mansouri was loaned out for the season to English [[Championship]] side [[Coventry City F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/coventry/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/03/08/20/manual_170140.html&amp;TEAMHD=coventry ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629213102/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/coventry/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F03%2F08%2F20%2Fmanual_170140.html&amp;TEAMHD=coventry |date=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansouri made 14 appearances in the first half of the season before leaving, against the clubs wishes, to play for [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] at the [[2004 African Cup of Nations]] in Mali. His contract was subsequently terminated and he remained without a club for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coventrycity-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;id=137182 |title=Mansouri Contract Terminated – Coventry City FC – Coventry MAD |publisher=Coventrycity-mad.co.uk |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040310203353/http://www.coventrycity-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;id=137182 |archivedate=10 March 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2004, Mansouri signed with [[Ligue 2]] side [[LB Châteauroux]] where he easily imposed himself in the middle of the park. He would go on to make 63 appearances for the club, starting every one of them, and scoring 2 goals. He was also the captain of the team in the 2005–2006 season.
