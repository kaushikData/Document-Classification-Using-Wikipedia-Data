      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3280">'''Alcohol in Bangladesh''' is regulated and restricted in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has one of the lowest alcohol consumption in Asia according to a World Bank that came out in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh among abstinent countries when it comes to drinking|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/world/asia/bangladesh-among-abstinent-countries-when-it-comes-drinking-alcohol-liquor-consumption-south-korea-pakistan-1509166|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=23 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first distillery was setup in what is today Bangladesh in 1887 by an Englishman named Robert Russell Carew. The company was called [[Carew &amp; Co (Bangladesh) Ltd]] and it was nationalised by the government of Bangladesh in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carew: Serving liquor since 1897|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2017/08/01/carew-serving-liquor-since-1897/|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=dhakatribune.com|publisher=Dhaka Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distillery is part of the Darsana Sugar Mill owned by the state owned enterprise [[Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation]]. It is the only sugar out of 15 state-owned mills that make a profit due to the distillery. The distillery produces rum, brandy, gin and whisky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carew: The discreet distillery|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/business/2017/08/01/carew-discreet-distillery/|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=dhakatribune.com|publisher=Dhaka Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Products_of_Darsana_Distilary.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Products_of_Darsana_Distilary.jpg|thumb|Products of Darsana Distilary]]

In 2003 the government of Bangladesh gave Jamuna Distillery Limited of [[Jamuna Group]] the licence to produce alcoholic beverages. Jamuna Distillery Limited was the first private company to be given licence to produce alcohol which ended the monopoly of the state owned Carew &amp; Co (Bangladesh) Ltd. Alcohol is sold in 5 star hotels and government licensed bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh grants private liquor licence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2022883.stm|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=3 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Jamuna launched [[Hunter (beer)|Hunter]] branded beer in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-109468|title=First local beer debuts|date=2009-10-12|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Law==
Under Bangladeshi law, any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol is considered an alcoholic beverage. A government permit is necessary for selling, storing and the transport of alcohol. To drink alcohol in Bangladesh, one must have a legal permit. Muslims will need a medical prescription to obtain an alcohol permit. The prescription must be given by an associate professor of the medical college or a civil surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Law and Our Rights|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/law/2010/03/04/advocate.htm|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">An '''animal nutritionist''' is a person who specializes in [[animal nutrition]], which is especially concerned with the dietary needs of [[animals in captivity]]: [[livestock]], [[pets]], and animals in [[wildlife rehabilitation]] facilities.

The science of animal nutrition encompasses principles of [[chemistry]] (especially [[biochemistry]]), [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[ethology]] (animal behavior). An animal nutrition in the [[food industry]] may also be concerned with [[economics]] and [[food processing]].

==Education==
A [[Bachelor of Science]] in agricultural, biological or related life sciences is usually required. A typical course would study [[metabolism]] of [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[minerals]], [[vitamin]]s and water, and the relationship of these nutrients and animal production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp Cal Poly - Areas of Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103022826/http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp |date=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Master’s degree]] in nutrition is often seen in animal nutrition and the field  often requires a [[Ph.D.]] in the science of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students&amp;Adv/graduate_programs.html Auburn University Animal Sciences]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016175854/http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students%26Adv/graduate_programs.html |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career activities ==
Those with an educational background can expect to be employed in the following areas:
*Evaluating the chemical and [[nutritional value]] of various [[animal feeds]], feed supplements, [[grass]] and [[forage]] for livestock, recreational animals such as [[horse]]s and [[pony|ponies]], [[pet food]]s for companion animals, [[fish]], and [[bird]]s
*Nutritional disorders and the preservation of feeds
*Diet formulation and ration size
*Diets for performance and health
*Diets for reproduction of animals
*Economics of feeding systems
*Dietary regimens
*Animal studies and laboratory trials
*Marketing strategies for new food formulas
*Quality control and performance of feeds
*Investigating nutritional disorders and diet related diseases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;pageno=1&amp;idno=17 Exploring job types: Animal nutritionist]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4990">In [[epidemiology]] and [[biomedicine]], the term '''biological plausibility''' refers to the proposal of a causal association — a relationship between a putative cause and an outcome — that is consistent with existing biological and medical knowledge.

Biological plausibility is one component of a method of reasoning that can establish a cause-and-effect relationship between a biological factor and a particular disease or adverse event. It is also an important part of the process of evaluating whether a proposed therapy (drug, vaccine, surgical procedure, etc.) has a real benefit to a patient. This concept has application to many controversial public affairs debates, such as that over the causes of [[Vaccine controversy|adverse vaccination outcomes]].

Biological plausibility is an essential element of the intellectual background of epidemiology. The term originated in the seminal work of determining the causality of smoking-related disease (''[[The Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health]]'' [1964]).

==Applications==

===Disease and adverse event causality===
It is generally agreed that to be considered “causal”, the association between a biological factor and a disease (or other bad outcome) should be biologically coherent. That is to say, it should be plausible and explicable biologically according to the known facts of the natural history and biology of the disease in question.

Other important criteria in evaluations of disease and adverse event causality include '''consistency''', '''strength of association''', '''specificity''' and a meaningful '''temporal relationship'''. These are known collectively as the [[Bradford-Hill criteria]], after the great [[English people|English]] [[epidemiologist]] who proposed them in 1965. However, [[Austin Bradford Hill]] himself de-emphasized "plausibility" among the other criteria:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be helpful if the causation we suspect is biologically plausible. But this is a feature I am convinced we cannot demand. What is biologically plausible depends upon the biological knowledge of the day. To quote again from my Alfred Watson Memorial Lecture [1962], there was

:"…no biological knowledge to support (or to refute) [[Percivall Pott|Pott]]’s observation in the 18th century of the excess of cancer in [[chimney sweep]]s. It was lack of biological knowledge in the 19th that led to a prize essayist writing on the value and the fallacy of statistics to conclude, amongst other “absurd” associations, that 'it could be no more ridiculous for the strange who passed the night in the steerage of an emigrant ship to ascribe the [[typhus]], which he there contracted, to the [[vermin]] with which bodies of the sick might be infected.' And coming to nearer times, in the 20th century there was no biological knowledge to support the evidence against [[rubella]]."

In short, the association we observe may be one new to science or medicine and we must not dismiss it too light-heartedly as just too odd. As [[Sherlock Holmes]] advised [[Dr. Watson]], "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Austin Bradford (1965), [http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill “The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?”], ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'', 58, 295-300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Treatment outcomes===
The preliminary research leading up to a [[randomized clinical trial]] (RCT) of a [[drug]] or [[biologic medical product|biologic]] has been termed "plausibility building". This involves the gathering and analysis of biochemical, tissue or animal data which are eventually found to point to a mechanism of action or to demonstrate the desired biological effect. This process is said to confer biological plausibility. Since large, definitive RCTs are extremely expensive and labor-intensive, only sufficiently promising therapies are thought to merit the attention and effort of final confirmation (or refutation) in them.

In distinction to ''biological plausibility'', clinical data from [[epidemiological studies]], [[case report]]s, [[case series]] and small, formal open or [[controlled clinical trial]]s may confer ''clinical plausibility''. According to the strictest criteria, a therapy is sufficiently scientifically plausible to merit the time and expense of definitive testing only if it is either biologically or clinically plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, L. John (2003), [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/168/2/180 “Complementary or alternative medicine: the need for plausibility”], ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]''; 168 (2) [January 21 issue].&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been observed that, despite its importance, biological plausibility is lacking for most [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]]  therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, ''[[Op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biomagnification.svg|thumb|In biomagnification the concentration of the persistent toxins (crosses) increases higher up the food chain.]]
[[File:Bio-magnification in a pond ecosystem.svg|thumb|In this scenario, a pond has been intoxicated and as we go further into the food chain the toxin concentration increases causing the top consumer to eventually live off intoxication.]]
'''Biomagnification''', also known as '''bioamplification''' or '''biological magnification''', is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic [[chemical substance|chemical]], in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of tolerant organisms at successively higher levels in a [[food chain]]. This increase can occur as a result of:
* Persistence – where the substance cannot be broken down by environmental processes
* [[Food chain]] [[bioenergetics|energetics]] – where the substance's concentration increases progressively as it moves up a food chain 
* Low or non-existent rate of internal degradation or excretion of the substance – often due to water-insolubility

[[File:The build up of toxins in a food chain.svg|thumb|Biomagnification is the build up of toxins in a food chain. The DDT concentration is in parts per million. As the trophic level increases in a food chain, the amount of toxic build up increases. The x's represent the amount of toxic build up accumulating as the trophic level increases. Toxins build up in organism's fat and tissue. Predators accumulate higher toxins than prey. ]]
Biological magnification often refers to the process whereby certain substances such as pesticides or heavy metals work their way into lakes, rivers and the ocean, and then move up the [[food chain]] in progressively greater concentrations as they are incorporated into the diet of aquatic organisms such as [[zooplankton]], which in turn are eaten perhaps by fish, which then may be eaten by bigger fish, large birds, animals, or humans. The substances become increasingly concentrated in tissues or internal organs as they move up the chain. Bioaccumulants are substances that increase in concentration in living organisms as they take in '''contaminated air, water, or food''' because the substances are very slowly metabolized or excreted.

==Processes==
Although sometimes used interchangeably with "[[bioaccumulation]]", an important distinction is drawn between the two, and with bioconcentration.
* '''Bioaccumulation''' occurs ''within'' a [[trophic level]], and is the increase in the concentration of a substance in certain tissues of organisms' bodies due to absorption from food and the environment.
* '''[[Bioconcentration]]''' is defined as occurring when uptake from the water is greater than excretion.&lt;ref&gt;Landrum, PF and SW Fisher, 1999. Influence of lipids on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of organic contaminants in aquatic organisms. Chapter 9 in MT Arts and BC Wainman. Lipids in fresh water ecosystems. Springer Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation occur within an organism, and biomagnification occurs across trophic (food chain) levels.

[[Biodilution]] is also a process that occurs to all trophic levels in an aquatic environment; it is the opposite of biomagnification, thus when a pollutant gets smaller in concentration as it progresses up a food web.

[[Lipid]], ([[lipophilic]]) or fat soluble substances cannot be diluted, broken down, or excreted in [[urine]], a water-based medium, and so accumulate in [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of an organism, if the organism lacks [[enzyme]]s to degrade them. When eaten by another organism, fats are absorbed in the gut, carrying the substance, which then accumulates in the fats of the predator. Since at each level of the food chain there is a lot of energy loss, a predator must consume many prey, including all of their lipophilic substances.

For example, though [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is only present in small amounts in [[seawater]], it is absorbed by algae (generally as [[methylmercury]]). Methyl-mercury is the most harmful variation of mercury. It is efficiently absorbed, but only very slowly excreted by organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, M., S. N. Luoma, and A. R Stewart. 2005. Trophic transfer of metals along freshwater food webs: Evidence of cadmium biomagnification in nature. Limnol. Oceanogr. 50 (5): 1511-1519.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration result in buildup in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels: [[zooplankton]], small [[nekton]], larger fish, etc. Anything which eats these fish also consumes the higher level of mercury the fish have accumulated. This process explains why predatory fish such as [[swordfish]] and [[shark]]s or birds like [[osprey]] and [[eagle]]s have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone. For example, herring contains mercury at approximately 0.01 parts per million (ppm) and shark contains mercury at greater than 1 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). 1997. Mercury Study Report to Congress. Vol. IV: An Assessment of Exposure to Mercury in the United States . EPA-452/R-97-006. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and Office of Research and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT is thought to biomagnify and biomagnification is one of the most significant reasons it was deemed harmful to the environment by the [[EPA]] and other organizations. DDT is stored in the fat of animals and takes many years to break down, and as the fat is consumed by predators, the amounts of DDT biomagnify. DDT is now a banned substance in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210501/http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
In a review of a large number of studies, Suedel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Suedel, B.C., Boraczek, J.A., Peddicord, R.K., Clifford, P.A. and Dillon, T.M., 1994. Trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of contaminants in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology 136: 21–89.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that although biomagnification is probably more limited in occurrence than previously thought, there is good evidence that [[DDT]], [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[toxaphene]], and the organic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]] do biomagnify in nature. For other contaminants, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation account for their high concentrations in organism tissues. More recently, Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray, J.S., 2002. Biomagnification in marine systems: the perspective of an ecologist. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 45: 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt; reached a similar substances remaining in the organisms and not being diluted to non-threatening concentrations. The success of top predatory-bird recovery ([[bald eagle]]s, [[peregrine falcon]]s) in North America following the ban on DDT use in agriculture is testament to the importance of biomagnification.

== Substances that biomagnify ==
There are two main groups of substances that biomagnify. Both are lipophilic and not easily degraded. Novel organic substances are not easily degraded because organisms lack previous exposure and have thus not [[evolved]] specific detoxification and excretion mechanisms, as there has been no selection pressure from them. These substances are consequently known as "[[persistent organic pollutant]]s" or POPs.

Metals are not degradable because they are elements. Organisms, particularly those subject to naturally high levels of exposure to metals, have mechanisms to sequester and excrete metals. Problems arise when organisms are exposed to higher concentrations than usual, which they cannot excrete rapidly enough to prevent damage. Some persistent [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] are especially dangerous and harmful to the organism's reproductive system.

[[File:A calm by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|''A Calm'', by [[James Gillray]]]]
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|200px|Doing [[meditation]] could help people be in a calm state.]]
'''Calmness''' is the mental state of [[Inner peace|peace of mind]] being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calmness|title=Calm – Definition of Calm by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquillity, or peace.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Calmness|title=Calmness – definition of calmness by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states.{{CN|date=December 2017}} Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.

Calmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513144845/http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are [[prayer]], [[yoga]], [[relaxation training]], breath training, and [[meditation]]. [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] states that “Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/calmness|title=Quotes About Calmness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term usually associated with calmness is "Peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/calmness?show=0&amp;t=1303344553|title=Calmness Synonyms, Calmness Antonyms – Merriam-Webster Thesaurus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce "good" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98658&amp;page=2|title=Study: Bad Hormones Lead to Bad Marriages|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx#|title=Controlling Anger — Before It Controls You|work=apa.org|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.

==Etymology==
The term comes from [[Middle English]] calme, from [[Old French]], from [[Old Italian]] calmo, from [[Late Latin]] cauma, "heat of the day", the "resting place in the heat of the day", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

'''Carl Georg Lucas Christian Bergmann''' (18 May 1814 – 30 April 1865) was a German [[Anatomy|anatomist]], [[physiologist]] and biologist who developed the [[Bergmann's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/797.html Bergmann's rule] at Who Named It&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1838 Bergmann received his medical doctorate at the [[University of Göttingen]], and later on, served as ''Obermedicinalrath'' and as a professor of anatomy and physiology at the [[University of Rostock]]. Between 1839 and 1862 he published a series of papers on [[comparative anatomy]] in [[Johannes Peter Müller]]'s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000637683 ''Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin''].&lt;ref name=WN&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/843.html Karl Georg Lucas Christian Bergmann] at Who Named It&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his [[habilitation]] at the University of Göttingen and was named an associate professor in 1843. From October 1852 he was a full professor and a member of the Medicinal Commission in Rostock. In 1861 he was appointed ''Obermedicinalrath''. He died in [[Geneva]] on April 30, 1865, on his return from [[Menton]], where he had spent the winter because of health problems.&lt;ref name=WN/&gt;

A '''contagious disease''' is a subset category of transmissible [[diseases]], which are transmitted to other persons, either by physical contact with the person suffering the disease, or by casual contact with their secretions or objects touched by them or airborne route among other routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Contagious+disease Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of contagious disease. Accessed Nov. 27, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-contagious infections, by contrast, usually require a special mode of transmission between persons or [[Host (biology)|host]]s. These include need for intermediate vector species ([[mosquito]]es that carry [[malaria]]) or by non-casual transfer of bodily fluid (such as [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s, [[needle sharing]] or [[Sexual intercourse|sexual contact]]).
The boundary between contagious and non-contagious infectious diseases is not perfectly drawn, as illustrated classically by [[tuberculosis]], which is clearly transmissible from person to person, but was not classically considered a contagious disease. In the present day, most sexually transmitted diseases are considered contagious, but only some of them are subject to medical isolation.

== Historical meaning ==

Originally, the term referred to a ''contagion'' (a derivative of 'contact') or disease transmissible only by direct physical contact. In the modern day, the term has sometimes been broadened to encompass ''any'' communicable or infectious disease. Often the word can only be understood in context, where it is used to emphasise very infectious, easily transmitted, or especially severe communicable disease.

== Effect on Public Health Response ==

Most [[epidemics]] are caused by contagious diseases, with occasional exceptions, such as [[yellow fever]]. The spread of non-contagious communicable diseases is changed either very little or not at all by medical isolation of ill persons or  medical [[quarantine]] for exposed persons. Thus, a "contagious disease" is sometimes defined in practical terms, as a disease for which isolation or quarantine are useful public health responses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.org/preparedness/cdc_english/IsoQuar.asp] A primer from the CDC on quarantine and its uses against contagious disease spread. Accessed Nov. 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cracked nipple''' (or ''nipple trauma'')&lt;ref name="Sant2016"/&gt; is a condition that can occur in breastfeeding women as a result of a number of possible causes. Developing a cracked nipple can result in soreness, dryness or irritation to, or bleeding of, one or both [[nipple]]s during breastfeeding. The mother with a cracked nipple can have severe nipple pain when the baby is nursing. This severe pain is a disincentive for continued breastfeeding. The crack can appear as a cut across the tip of the nipple and may extend to its the base.&lt;ref name = ncbi/&gt; Cracked nipples develop after the birth of the infant and is managed with pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.{{sfn|Henry|page = 120}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Cracked nipples are classified as a breast disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/N64.0|title=ICD-10 Version:2016|website=apps.who.int|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nipple is not only the structure to deliver milk to the infant, it also contains small, sebaceous glands or [[Montgomery gland]]s to lubricate the skin of the areola.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Secretion of Areolar (Montgomery's) Glands from Lactating Women Elicits Selective, Unconditional Responses in Neonates|first1=Sébastien|last1=Doucet|first2=Robert|last2=Soussignan|first3=Paul|last3=Sagot|first4=Benoist|last4=Schaal|date=23 October 2009|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e7579|accessdate=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007579|pmid=19851461|pmc=2761488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cracked nipples are most often associated with breastfeeding and appear as cracks or small lacerations or breaks in the skin of the nipple.&lt;ref name="Sant2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nhs" /&gt; In some instances an ulcer will form.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"/&gt; The nipple in a nursing mother is in regular contact with a nursing infant.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;!--The nipple is the small raised section of breast tissue close to the center of the breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nipple|title=nipple|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2017|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Cracked nipples are trauma to the nipple and can be quite painful.&lt;ref name="wgov" /&gt; Cracked nipples typically appear three to seven days after the birth.&lt;ref name=nhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/problems-breastfeeding.aspx#sore|title=Breastfeeding problems | publisher = National Health Service (UK)|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sant2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Kamila Juliana da Silva|last2=Santana|first2=Géssica Silva|last3=Vieira|first3=Tatiana de Oliveira|last4=Santos|first4=Carlos Antônio de Souza Teles|last5=Giugliani|first5=Elsa Regina Justo|last6=Vieira|first6=Graciete Oliveira|title=Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=16|issue=1|pages=209|year=2016|issn=1471-2393|doi=10.1186/s12884-016-0999-4|pmid=27496088|pmc=4975913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the nipples appears to be wedge-shaped, white and flattened, this may indicate that the latch is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples.&lt;ref name =nhs2/&gt;

===Complications===
[[Bacteria]] can enter the breast through cracked nipples, which increase the risk of [[mastitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinlay|first=Joanne R.|last2=O'Connell|first2=Dianne L.|last3=Kinlay|first3=Scott|date=April 2001|title=Risk factors for mastitis in breastfeeding women: results of a prospective cohort study|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=115–120|doi=10.1111/j.1753-6405.2001.tb01831.x|issn=1326-0200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Candidiasis|Candida infection]] (thrush) of the nipple can also occur, resulting in deep-pink, cracked, and sore nipples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007615.htm|title=Thrush in newborns: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ncbi/&gt;

=== Contraindications for breastfeeding ===
Because cracked nipples can result in the infant being exposed to blood, women with certain blood-borne diseases may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they have a cracked nipple. It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples to breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/hepatitis.htm|title=Hepatitis B and C Infections - Breastfeeding - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and bleeding nipples or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/toxoplasmosis.htm|title=Toxoplasmosis - Breastfeeding - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and bleeding nipples&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/globalaids/resources/pmtct-care/docs/pocketguide.doc This link opens a document that opens rather than a web page. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked nipples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/detailed.html|title=CDC - Chagas Disease - Detailed Fact Sheet|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm|title=HCV FAQs for Health Professionals - Division of Viral Hepatitis - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000803.htm|title=Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Some studies indicate that cracked nipples are caused by poor latch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Academy of Pediatrics new mother's guide to breastfeeding|others=Meek, Joan Younger,, Scherer, Winnie,, American Academy of Pediatrics|isbn=9780553908237|edition= Second, Bantam books trade paperback |location=New York|oclc=816891128|last1 = Pediatrics|first1 = American Academy Of|last2=Joan Younger Meek|first2=M.D|last3=Yu|first3=Winnie|date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other causes could be poor positioning, use of a feeding bottle, [[breast engorgement]], inexperience, semi-protruding nipples, use of [[breast pump]]s and light pigmentation of the nipples. Breast engorgement is also a main factor in altering the ability of the infant to latch-on. Engorgement changes the shape and curvature of the nipple region by making the breast inflexible, flat, hard, and swollen. The nipples on an engorged breast are flat.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"/&gt;

When the baby is [[Latch (breastfeeding)|latched on]] correctly, the nipple is located against the [[soft palate]] in the back of the baby's mouth. When the nipple is near the front of the mouth and being pinched against the [[hard palate]], this will cause pain and development of cracked nipples.&lt;ref name = nhs2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/sore-cracked-nipples-breastfeeding.aspx|title=Sore or cracked nipples when breastfeeding, Pregnancy and baby guide |publisher = National Health Services (UK)|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause of painful, cracked nipples is the incorrect positioning and incorrect [[latch (breastfeeding)|latching]] on to the breast by the infant.&lt;ref name = wgov/&gt;&lt;ref name = nhs/&gt; The baby can create cracked nipples due to the strong sucking pressure, stretching and pulling the nipple, the [[friction]] and rubbing of skin to skin.&lt;ref name = ncbi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148955/|title=Management of breast conditions and other breastfeeding difficulties|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology and Information, US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wgov/&gt; The cause of sore, cracked nipples can also be from a yeast or [[Candida infection]] in the baby or the mother or both. [[Candidiasis|Thrush]] can develop after the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name = ncbi/&gt; For first-time breastfeeding mothers, it normally takes a few tries before the latch is right, which can make the nipples tender and sore the first few days. If the nipples become cracked or bleed, the latch may need to be corrected. Women are advised to keep on breastfeeding, as it will actually help the nipples heal. A little [[breast milk]] or purified [[lanolin cream]] or ointment helps the healing process.&lt;ref name = wgov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/common-questions-about-breastfeeding-pain.html|title=Common questions about breastfeeding and pain | publisher = WomensHealth.gov|accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=2017-06-09 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a [[feeding bottle]] is used in addition to breastfeeding, cracked nipples may result because the different sucking techniques required for the bottle and the breast vary. Bottle-feeding babies uses his or her [[tongue]] to regulate the flow of milk. This same technique will cause friction on the nipple while breastfeeding. This in turn encourages the continued use of the bottle with less time breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"/&gt;

Pain caused by cracked nipples can sometimes lead to the cessation of breast-feeding.&lt;ref name="Sant2016" /&gt; In addition to cracks, or [[blister]]s or [[ulcers]] can form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosen | first = Paul | title = Rosen's breast pathology | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4511-7653-7 | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The nipples of nursing mothers naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Cracked nipples may be able to be prevented by:

* Avoid soaps and harsh washing or drying of the breasts and nipples. This can cause dryness and cracking.&lt;ref name = wbw/&gt;
* Rubbing a little breast milk on the nipple after feeding to protect it.&lt;ref name= wgov/&gt;&lt;ref name = wbw/&gt; 
* Keeping the nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.&lt;ref name=med+/&gt;&lt;ref name = wbw/&gt;

[[Roman chamomile]] can be applied directly to the skin for pain and swelling and is used to treat cracked nipples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/752.html|title=Roman chamomile: MedlinePlus Supplements|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Cracked nipples can be treated with 100% lanolin. Glycerin nipple pads can be chilled and placed over the nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples.&lt;ref name=med+&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000634.htm|title=Positioning your baby for breastfeeding: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cause of cracked nipples is from thrush, treatment is usually begun with nystatin. If the mother is symptomatic then the mother and the baby can be treated.&lt;ref name = ncbi/&gt; Continuing to breastfeed will actually help the nipples heal. A little breast milk or purified lanolin cream or ointment helps the healing process.&lt;ref name = wgov/&gt; Breastfeeding professionals that include nurses, midwives and lactation consultants are able to assist in the treatment of cracked nipples.&lt;ref name =nhs/&gt;

Advice from others is abundant but there have been some treatments that have been identified as not being effective in healing or preventing cracked nipples. These ineffective treatments are keeping the breastfeeding short and using a nipple guard. Keeping the feedings short so that the nipples can rest is not effective in relieving the pain of cracked nipples and it could have a negative effect on the milk supply. Nipple shields do not improve latching on.&lt;ref name = nhs2/&gt;

==Epidemiology==

In a survey in New York City, 35% of nursing mothers stopped breastfeeding after one week due to the pain of cracked nipples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahluwalia|first=I. B.|date=2005-12-01|title=Why Do Women Stop Breastfeeding?

Another survey of breastfeeding mothers in Brazil reported that there was 25% higher risk of interruption of exclusive breastfeeding when the women had cracked nipples. Mothers with higher education levels were more likely to continue breastfeeding despite the pain of cracked nipples.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"/&gt;

'''EUFIC''', the European Food Information Council, is a non-profit organisation that provides science-based facts on food and health in an accessible, appealing and actionable way.

Since 1995, EUFIC has strived to inspire and empower people to make better decisions about diet and lifestyle. 
EUFIC’s passionate science and communication experts who believe in the power of informed consumers.

== Overview of EUFIC ==

EUFIC communicates science-based information on a range of food and health topics, like [[nutrition]] and lifestyle, [[food safety]] and quality, [[List of food labeling regulations|food labelling]], and risk communication. The science on specific topics and public debate around it are considered, to make sure the materials are relevant, and reflect the scientific consensus. EUFIC’s qualified staff then put the scientific facts into plain language, making them understandable to the general public, and practical for use by health professionals and educators. EUFIC also carries out consumer research, to discover people’s perceptions, views and preferences.

EUFIC works with [http://www.eufic.org/en/who-we-are/working-with-experts Scientific Advisory and Editorial Boards], and with independent experts on specific projects, who advise on the scientific direction, and ensure the accuracy and impartiality of the work. The main objective is to present a balanced view of the scientific evidence, to allow the readers to make their own informed decisions.

The website in 12 languages has the [https://www.hon.ch/ Health On the Net certification], which verifies that content complies with a multi-stakeholder consensus on standards, to protect citizens from misleading health information. The organisation also hosts [http://www.coolfoodplanet.org/ Cool Food Planet], a website for 6–12 years old to learn about healthy diet and lifestyle and food safety.

With its offices in Brussels, EUFIC liaises with a European network to enhance its impact and outreach in other countries.

EUFIC is funded by individual food and drink companies, the European Commission, foundations, umbrella organisations, and from sales of publications.

'''Edward Bright''' (1721–1750)&lt;ref&gt;Some references have the year of his death as 1756.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[grocer]] in [[Maldon, Essex]], [[England]] — known as the "fat man of Maldon"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsaboutmaldon.co.uk/edwardbright/index.shtml Edward Bright - the fat man of Maldon], accessed 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; — who was reputed at the time of his death in 1750 to be the "fattest man in England". He lived in a house on Maldon's High Street, and is buried in Maldon's Church of All Saints.

Bright weighed 47.5 [[Stone (weight)|stone]] (665&amp;nbsp;lb or 302&amp;nbsp;kg).

His coat was said to be large enough to have seven men stand inside it, although this is also sometimes stated as ''seven hundred men'' because of a tale&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maldondengieramblers.org.uk/index.html Maldon and Dengie Hundred Group] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67bd2B1dT?url=http://www.maldondengieramblers.org.uk/index.html |date=2012-05-12 }}, accessed 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in which a man in a local [[Public house|pub]] tempted a [[Gambling|gambler]] with a [[Gambling|bet]] that "seven hundred men" would fit into Edward Bright’s [[waistcoat]]. The bet was accepted. The gambler lost, because seven men from the [[Dengie]] [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]] (a parcel of land) fit into the waistcoat.

His portrait was painted in 1750 by David Ogborne (1700–1768), after whose painting various etchings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?search=as&amp;grp=1109%3BVendors%2C+merchants+and+manufacturers&amp;lDate=&amp;LinkID=mp51492 Edward Bright], [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)]], accessed 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; were published, including:

'''Fascia training''' describes sports activities and movement exercises that attempt to improve the functional properties of the muscular [[connective tissues]] in the human body, such as [[tendons]], [[ligaments]], [[joint capsules]] and muscular envelopes. Also called [[fascia]], these tissues take part in a body-wide tensional force transmission network and are responsive to training stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schleip, "Fascia as a Sensory Organ" in: Erik Dalton, ''Dynamic Body Exploring Form, Expanding Function''. Freedom from Pain Institute, Oklahoma City pp 137–163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Whenever [[muscles]] and joints are moved this also exerts mechanical strain on related [[fascia]]. The general assumption in sports science had therefore been that muscle strength exercises as well as cardiovascular training would be sufficient for an optimal training of the associate [[fibrous connective tissue]]s. However, recent [[ultrasound]]-based research revealed that the mechanical threshold for a training effect on tendinous [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] tends to be significantly higher than for muscle fibers. This insight happened roughly during the same time in which the field of [[fascia]] research attracted major attention by showing that fascial tissues are much more than passive transmitters of muscular tension (years 2007 – 2010). Both influences together triggered an increasing attention in sports science towards the question whether and how fascial tissues can be specifically stimulated with active exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson RL|first1=2nd|title=Biotensegrity: a unifying theory of biological architecture with applications to osteopathic practice, education, and research--a review and analysis|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|date=January 2013|volume=113|issue=1|pages=34–52|pmid=23329804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Divo G.

==Principles==
Fascia training follows the following principles:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

# Preparatory counter-movement (increasing elastic recoil by pre-stretching involved fascial tissues);
# The Ninja principle (focus on effortless movement quality);
# Dynamic [[stretching]] (alternation of melting static stretches with dynamic stretches that include mini-bounces, with multiple directional variations);
# [[Proprioceptive]] refinement (enhancing somatic perceptiveness by mindfulness oriented movement explorations);
# Hydration and renewal ([[foam rolling]] and similar tool-assisted myofascial self-treatment applications);
# Sustainability: respecting the slower adaptation speed but more sustaining effects of fascial tissues (compared with muscles) by aiming at visible body improvements of longer time periods, usually said to happen over 3 to 24 months.

==Evidence==
While good to moderate scientific evidence exists for several of the included training principles – e.g. the inclusion of [[elastic recoil]] as well as a training of proprioceptive refinement – there is currently insufficient evidence for the claimed beneficial effects of a fascia oriented exercises program as such, consisting of a combination of the above described four training elements.&lt;ref&gt;Schleip R., Baker A.: Fascia in Sport and Movement. Handspring Publishing 2015, {{ISBN|978-1-909141-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of foam rollers or a roller massager before or after exercise for self-[[myofascial release]] appears to be helpful with regard to range of motion and soreness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=AN|last2=Best|first2=TM|title=Is self myofascial release an effective preexercise and recovery strategy?

'''George K. Simon''' (born February 1, 1948) is a bestselling author and frequent weblog contributor.&lt;ref name=simon-manipulative&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=George|title=Dealing with Manipulative People|url=http://www.manipulative-people.com/|publisher=manipulative-people.com|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Sherry Simon, Ph.D., is also a professional, living and working in Little Rock.

==Life==
George K. Simon, Jr., Ph.D. received his degree in clinical psychology from Texas Tech University. He has studied and worked with manipulators, others with disturbed personalities, and their victims for many years. He has given more than 250 workshops and seminars as well as made television and radio appearances on the subject of dealing with manipulative people and other difficult personalities.&lt;ref name=sheeps&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=George|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People|year=2010|publisher=Parkhurst Brothers|location=Little Rock|isbn=978-1-935166-30-6|page=176|url=http://www.parkhurstbrothers.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Simon's first book, ''In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People'',&lt;ref name=phenomena&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=George|title=Character Disturbance: the phenomena of our age|url=http://www.manipulative-people.com/in-sheeps-clothing/|publisher=manipulative-people.com|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. Simon discusses the tactics manipulators use to deceive and get the better of others. The book also offers tips on how to avoid being victimized and how to be more empowered in any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa Armstrong|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/sep/16/dealing-difficult-people-20070916/|title=dealing with DIFFICULT people: Maumelle author still finds niche for book he wrote 11 years ago|publisher=Arkansasonline.com|date=2007-09-16|accessdate = 2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest book, ''Character Disturbance: the Phenomenon of Our Age'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://parkhurstbrothers.com/catalog/character-disturbance]{{dead link|date=April 2013}} {{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to provide an in-depth, but readily understandable explanation of the most difficult and problematic personalities a person is likely to encounter, as well as practical ways to keep from being victimized by them. The book also advances the perspective that the phenomenon of "neurosis", about which most traditional psychological frameworks are concerned and which was largely an outgrowth of the highly repressive Victorian culture, has faded in both prevalence and intensity in modern times. It asserts that instead, the necessary issue of greater social concern in an era of permissiveness and entitlement is [[character disorder]], which manifests itself not so much in bizarre psychosomatic symptoms, but rather in distorted thinking patterns, problematic attitudes, and irresponsible behaviors, and Simon asserts further that these can neither be adequately understood, nor effectively dealt with, via traditional approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=George|title=Character Disturbance: The Phenomenon of Our Age|year=2011|publisher=Parkhurst Brothers|location=Little Rock|isbn=9781935166-33-7|page=256|url=http://www.pbros.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon has written numerous articles on character impairment for several popular weblogs,&lt;ref name=couns-resource1&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=Simon|title=Budding Psychopaths or Immature Characters?|url=http://counsellingresource.com/features/2012/07/11/budding-psychopaths-immature-characters/|publisher=Counselling resource|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for his own blog,&lt;ref name=simon-manipulative/&gt; and is the principal composer of the patriotic anthem "America, My Home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parkhurstbrothers.com/catalog/anthem-for-the-millennium |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820073943/http://parkhurstbrothers.com/catalog/anthem-for-the-millennium |archivedate=August 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Coalition for Patient Safety (APS)''' – in German "Aktionsbündnis Patientensicherheit (APS)",  was established in 2005 and located in [[Bonn]] is a German non-profit association of organisations and individuals interested and involved in promotion of [[patient safety]].

==Activities==
APS' multidisciplinary working groups develop recommendations for patient safety activities in in- and outpatient healthcare institutions. The recommendations are available as [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] documents and distributed in healthcare institutions for free.

APS collaborates with professional and consumer associations, with societies, insurance organizations, self-governmental bodies, and research institutions. The Federal Ministry of Health is one of the organization's sponsors. APS acting together with the [[German Agency for Quality in Medicine]] is a Lead Technical Agency of the international '''[[High 5 Project]]'''.

==Selected projects==
'''Recommendation for preventing wrong site surgery'''
Based on international protocols four actions to prevent wrong-site surgery were defined: (1) asking the patient about his identity and the planned intervention, (2) marking the operation site with an indelible pen, (3) ensuring that the right patient is brought to the operating room, and (4) a “team timeout” of the operating team immediately before the intervention.

'''Recommendation for establishing critical incident reporting systems (CIRS) in hospitals'''
[[critical incident reporting system|CIRS]] are voluntary reporting systems for hospital staff. Their purpose is to discover unsafe practices and to initiate safety measures before patients are harmed. APS published recommendations on how to establish CIRS in hospitals, and is partner of the ''German Hospital CIRS Network''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=92–9 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0092 |title=Patient Safety and Error Management—What Causes Adverse Events and How Can They Be Prevented? |journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International |first1=Barbara |last1=Hoffmann |first2=Julia |last2=Rohe |pmid=20204120 |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=6 |pmc=2832110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Checklist for medication safety in hospitals'''
A checklist with a graduated scheme to measure medication safety was published as a tool for any hospital to review common activities and projects to improve medication safety.

'''Medication list for patients'''
At the time of drug prescription doctors often do not have full information about all drugs taken by the patient. This provokes the incalculable risk of unwanted drug interactions and adverse events. APS therefore published a schedule for patients to list their medications.

It&amp;nbsp;is a rare disorder resulting from increased levels of&amp;nbsp;[[growth hormone]]&amp;nbsp;before the fusion of the&amp;nbsp;[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]&amp;nbsp;which usually occurs at some point soon after puberty.

== Cause ==
Gigantism is characterized by an excess of [[growth hormone]] (GH). This overproduction of growth hormone that brings about gigantism is virtually always caused by pituitary growths (adenomas).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These [[adenoma]]s are on the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior pituitary gland]]. They can also cause overproduction of GH's hypothalamic precursor known as [[Growth hormone–releasing hormone|growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=D|last2=Young|first2=W F|last3=Ebersold|first3=M J|last4=Scheithauer|first4=B W|last5=Kovacs|first5=K|last6=Horvath|first6=E|last7=Whitaker|first7=M D|last8=Eberhardt|first8=N L|last9=Downs|first9=T R|date=1993-01-01|title=Congenital gigantism due to growth hormone-releasing hormone excess and pituitary hyperplasia with adenomatous transformation.|url=https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.76.1.8421089|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=216–222|doi=10.1210/jcem.76.1.8421089|issn=0021-972X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the excessive amounts of growth hormone, children achieve heights that are well above normal ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eugster|first=Erica A.|last2=Pescovitz|first2=Ora H.|date=1999-12-01|title=Gigantism|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/12/4379/2864585/Gigantism|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=84|issue=12|pages=4379–4384|doi=10.1210/jcem.84.12.6222|issn=0021-972X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific age of onset for gigantism varies between patients and gender, but the common age that excessive growth symptoms start to appear has been found to be around 13 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other health complications, such as [[hypertension]], may occur in [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] patients with [[Secretion|hyper-secretion]] of growth hormone. Characteristics more similar to those seen in [[acromegaly]] may occur in patients that are closer in age to [[adolescence]] since they are nearing growth plate fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278971/|title=Endotext|last=Murray|first=P.

=== Hormonal cause ===
[[Growth hormone]] (GH) and [[insulin-like growth factor 1|insulin-like growth factor-I]] (IGF-I) are two substances that have been identified as influencing growth plate formation and bone growth and, therefore, gigantism. Their specific mechanisms are still not well understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shim|first=Kye Shik|date=March 2015|title=Pubertal growth and epiphyseal fusion|journal=Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=20|issue=1|pages=8–12|doi=10.6065/apem.2015.20.1.8|issn=2287-1012|pmc=4397276|pmid=25883921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, GH and IGF have both been identified to be involved in most stages of growth: embryonic, prenatal, and postnatal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laron|first=Z|date=October 2001|title=Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): a growth hormone|journal=Molecular Pathology|volume=54|issue=5|pages=311–316|issn=1366-8714|pmc=1187088|pmid=11577173|doi=10.1136/mp.54.5.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lupu|first=Floria|last2=Terwilliger|first2=Joseph D.|last3=Lee|first3=Kaechoong|last4=Segre|first4=Gino V.|last5=Efstratiadis|first5=Argiris|title=Roles of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 in mouse postnatal growth|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012160600999755|journal=Developmental Biology|volume=229|issue=1|pages=141–162|doi=10.1006/dbio.2000.9975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the receptor gene for IGF has been shown to be particularly influential throughout various stages of development, especially prenatally. This is the same for GH receptor genes which have been known to drive overall growth throughout various pathways.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Esmond J.|last2=Harvey|first2=Steve|title=Growth hormone as an early embryonic growth and differentiation factor|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00429-004-0422-1|journal=Anatomy and Embryology|volume=209|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s00429-004-0422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth hormone is a precursor ([[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]]) of IGF-I, but each has its independent role in hormonal pathways. Yet both seem to ultimately come together to have a joint effect on growth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Diagnostic testing ===
Evaluation of growth hormone hyper-secretion cannot be excluded with a single normal GH level due to [[diurnal variation]]. However, a random blood sample showing markedly elevated GH is adequate for diagnosis of GH hyper-secretion. Additionally, a high-normal GH level that fails to suppress with administration of glucose is also sufficient for a diagnosis of GH hyper-secretion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an excellent test for evaluation of GH hyper-secretion. It does not undergo diurnal variation and will thus be consistently elevated in GH hyper-secretion and therefore patients with gigantism. A single normal IGF-1 value will reliably exclude GH hyper-secretion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Genetic  ==
Finding a specific [[Genetics|genetic]] cause for gigantism has proven to be difficult. Gigantism is the primary example of growth hormone hyper-secretion disorders, a group of illnesses that are not yet deeply understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some common [[mutation]]s have been associated with gigantism. Pediatric gigantism patients have shown to have duplications of genes on a specific chromosome, Xq26. Typically, these patients also experienced an onset of typical gigantism symptoms before reaching the age of 5. This indicates a possible linkage between [[gene duplication]]s and the gigantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trivellin|first=Giampaolo|last2=Daly|first2=Adrian F.|last3=Faucz|first3=Fabio R.|last4=Yuan|first4=Bo|last5=Rostomyan|first5=Liliya|last6=Larco|first6=Darwin O.|last7=Schernthaner-Reiter|first7=Marie Helene|last8=Szarek|first8=Eva|last9=Leal|first9=Letícia F.|title=Gigantism and Acromegaly Due to Xq26 Microduplications and GPR101 Mutation|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1408028|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|issue=25|pages=2363–2374|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1408028|pmc=4291174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, DNA mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein ([[AIP (gene)|AIP]]) gene are common in gigantism patients. They have been found to be present in about 29 percent of patients with gigantism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; AIP is labeled as a [[tumor suppressor gene]] and a [[pituitary adenoma]] disposition gene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckers|first=Albert|last2=Aaltonen|first2=Lauri A.|last3=Daly|first3=Adrian F.|last4=Karhu|first4=Auli|date=2013-04-01|title=Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenomas (FIPA) and the Pituitary Adenoma Predisposition due to Mutations in the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interacting Protein (AIP) Gene|url=https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/34/2/239/2354630|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=34|issue=2|pages=239–277|doi=10.1210/er.2012-1013|issn=0163-769X|pmc=3610678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in AIP [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] can have deleterious effects by inducing the development of pituitary adenomas which in turn can cause gigantism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Two specific mutations in the AIP gene have been identified as possible causes of pituitary adenomas. These mutations also have the ability to cause adenoma growth to occur early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vierimaa|first=Outi|last2=Georgitsi|first2=Marianthi|last3=Lehtonen|first3=Rainer|last4=Vahteristo|first4=Pia|last5=Kokko|first5=Antti|last6=Raitila|first6=Anniina|last7=Tuppurainen|first7=Karoliina|last8=Ebeling|first8=Tapani M.

Additionally, a large variety of other known genetic disorders have been found to influence the development of gigantism such as [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1|multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 4]], [[McCune–Albright syndrome|McCune-Albright syndrome]], [[Carney complex]], familial isolated pituitary adenoma, X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rostomyan|first=Liliya|last2=Daly|first2=Adrian F.|last3=Beckers|first3=Albert|title=Pituitary gigantism: Causes and clinical characteristics|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003426615010860|journal=Annales d'Endocrinologie|volume=76|issue=6|pages=643–649|doi=10.1016/j.ando.2015.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although various gene mutations have been associated with gigantism, over 50 percent of cases cannot be linked to genetic causes, showing the complex nature of the disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Many treatments for gigantism receive criticism and are not accepted as ideal. Various treatments involving surgery and drugs have been used to treat gigantism.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Naila|last2=Racine|first2=Michael S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Pamela|last4=Degnan|first4=Bernard|last5=Chandler|first5=William|last6=Barkan|first6=Ariel|date=2008-08-01|title=Treatment of Pituitary Gigantism with the Growth Hormone Receptor Antagonist Pegvisomant|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/93/8/2953/2598340|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=93|issue=8|pages=2953–2956|doi=10.1210/jc.2007-2283|issn=0021-972X|pmc=2515082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
[[Pegvisomant]] is one [[pharmaceutical drug]] which has received attention for being a possible treatment route for gigantism. Reduction of the levels of [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-I]] as a result of pegvisomant administration can be incredibly beneficial for the pediatric gigantism patients.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Naila|last2=Racine|first2=Michael S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Pamela|last4=Degnan|first4=Bernard|last5=Chandler|first5=William|last6=Barkan|first6=Ariel|date=2008-08-01|title=Treatment of Pituitary Gigantism with the Growth Hormone Receptor Antagonist Pegvisomant|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/93/8/2953/2598340/Treatment-of-Pituitary-Gigantism-with-the-Growth|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=93|issue=8|pages=2953–2956|doi=10.1210/jc.2007-2283|issn=0021-972X|pmc=2515082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After treatment with pegvisomant, high growth rates, a feature characteristic of gigantism, can be significantly decreased.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pegvisomant has been seen to be a powerful alternative to other treatments such as [[somatostatin]] analogues, a common treatment method for acromegaly, if drug treatment is paired with [[Radiation therapy|radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rix|first=M.|last2=Laurberg|first2=P.|last3=Hoejberg|first3=A. S.|last4=Brock-Jacobsen|first4=B.|date=2005-08-01|title=Pegvisomant therapy in pituitary gigantism: successful treatment in a 12-year-old girl|url=http://www.eje-online.org/content/153/2/195|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|language=en|volume=153|issue=2|pages=195–201|doi=10.1530/eje.1.01956|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16061823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding the optimal level of pegvisomant is important so normal body growth is not negatively affected. In order to do this, [[titration]] of the medication can be used as a way to find the proper administration level.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

See [[acromegaly]] for additional treatment possibilities.

==Terminology==
[[File:André the Giant in the late '80s.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[André the Giant]], a [[wrestler]] and actor in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.]][[File:Anna Swan with her parents.jpg|thumb|left|Giantess [[Anna Swan]] with her parents.]]
The term is typically applied to those whose height is not just in the upper 1% of the population but several [[standard deviation]]s above mean for persons of the same sex, age, and ethnic ancestry. The term is seldom applied to those who are simply "tall" or "above average" whose heights appear to be the healthy result of normal [[genetics]] and nutrition. Gigantism is usually caused by a [[Pituitary adenoma|tumor on the pituitary gland]] of the brain. It causes growth of  the hands, face, and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.question.com/link/gigantis.html |title=Gigantism |publisher=Question.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2015}} In some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/health/06giant.html In a Giant’s Story, a New Chapter Writ by His DNA - By Gina Kolata. The New York Times, January 5, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names somewhat obsolete for this pathology are hypersoma (Greek: ''hyper'' over the normal level; ''soma'' body) and somatomegaly (Greek; ''soma'' body, [[Genitive case|genitive]] ''somatos''  of the body; ''megas'', gen. ''megalou'' great).  In the past, while many of them were social outcasts because of their height, some (usually unintentionally) found employment in [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]]'s famous [[Potsdam Giants]] regiment.

Many of those who have been identified with gigantism have suffered from multiple health problems involving the [[circulatory system|circulatory]] or [[skeletal system]], as the strain of maintaining a large, heavy body places abnormal demands on both the [[bone]]s and the [[heart]].

== Society and culture ==
{{main|Giant (mythology)}}
Reports of gigantism exist throughout history, with some nations and tribes taller than others. The giants of Crete are listed in various historic sources, beginning with [[Helios|Titan]], a Greek mythological giant, and including Gigantus, after whom giants and gigantism are named.  [[Rhodes]] is another island where giants were said to have lived, with the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], a giant statue of a giant patron god [[Helios]].  [[Goliath]], a giant mentioned in the [[Bible]], was a Philistine warrior who was killed by [[David]] in the war between the Israelites and the Philistines. A member of Goliath's family is also recorded as having six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.&lt;ref&gt;Story of Goliath in {{Bibleref2|1Samuel|17|9}}{{snd}} 6 fingers in {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|20:6|HE}} cf. {{Bibleref2|2Samuel|21:20-22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hexavalent chromium''' ('''chromium(VI)''', '''Cr(VI)''', '''chromium 6''') is any [[chemical compound]] that contains the element [[chromium]] in the +6 [[oxidation state]] (thus [[valence (chemistry)#Common valences|hexavalent]]). Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] [[sodium dichromate]]. Approximately {{convert|136000|tonne|lb}} of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, "Chromium Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are [[chromium trioxide]] and various salts of [[chromate and dichromate]], among others. Hexavalent chromium is used in textile dyes, wood preservation, [[anti-corrosion]] products, [[chromate conversion coating]]s, and a variety of niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as anticorrosive agents to paints, primers, and other surface coatings; and [[chromic acid]] [[electroplate]]d onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing "hot work" such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] OSHA General Industry 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Hexavalent chromium can also be found in drinking water and public water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Yun|last2=Holmgren|first2=Stephanie|last3=Andrews|first3=Danica M.

Problematic exposure is known to occur among workers who handle chromate-containing products and those who grind and/ or weld stainless steel.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Workers who are exposed to hexavalent chromium are at increased risk of developing lung cancer, asthma, or damage to the nasal epithelia and skin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Within the [[European Union]], the use of hexavalent chromium in electronic equipment is largely prohibited by the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]].

==Toxicity==

Hexavalent chromium compounds are [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] [[carcinogen]]s. Due to its structural similarity to sulfate, chromate (a typical form of chromium(VI) at neutral pH) is transported into cells via [[sulfate]] channels.&lt;ref name="Salnikow"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Zhitkovich|first2=A.|year=2008|title=Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms in Metal Carcinogenesis and Cocarcinogenesis: Nickel, Arsenic, and Chromium|url=|journal=Chem.

== Remediation of hexavalent chromium in groundwater and drinking water ==
There are mainly three types of methods to remediate hexavalent chromium in ground water and drinking water: 1) reduction of toxicity, 2) removal technologies and 3) containment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://engr.uconn.edu/~baholmen/docs/ENVE290W/National%20Chromium%20Files%20From%20Luke/Cr(VI)%20Handbook/L1608_C08.pdf|title=Chromium (VI) Handbook|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=9781566706087|location=United States of America|pages=280–298|quote=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110203935/http://engr.uconn.edu/~baholmen/docs/ENVE290W/National%20Chromium%20Files%20From%20Luke/Cr(VI)%20Handbook/L1608_C08.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of toxicity of hexavalent chromium involves methods using chemicals, microbes and plants. Some removal technologies include transporting contaminated soil offsite to a landfill, using ion exchange resins to reduce chromium(VI) concentrations to less than detectable limit and granular [[activated carbon]] (GAC) filter. Containment technologies can be employed with the use of physical barriers such as grouts, slurries or sheet piling. 

Attempts have been made to test the removal or reduction of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions and environment. For example, a research study conducted by the School of Industrial Technology, [[University Sains Malaysia]] in 2010 found that [[chitosan]] coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene can be effectively employed for removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solutions. Chitosan is a very cheap, economical, and environmentally friendly substrate for coating of this polymer. Adsorption of chromium(VI) is found to be effective in the lower pH range and at higher temperatures and subsequent desorption is readily achieved upon alkaline treatment of the adsorbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hena|first=Sufia|date=2010-09-15|title=Removal of chromium hexavalent ion from aqueous solutions using biopolymer chitosan coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene polymer|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389410006205|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=181|issue=1–3|pages=474–479|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.05.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] indicates that the airborne hexavalent chromium in acidic mists of an electroplating tank collected on PVC filters was reduced over time after mist generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Yong Chul|last2=Paik|first2=Nam Won|date=2000-07-01|title=Reduction of Hexavalent Chromium Collected on PVC Filters|journal=AIHAJ - American Industrial Hygiene Association|volume=61|issue=4|pages=563–567|doi=10.1080/15298660008984569|issn=1529-8663}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other emerging technologies for removing chromium from water are also currently under research, including the use of [[cation|cationic]] [[metal-organic frameworks]] to selectively [[adsorption|adsorb]] chromium [[oxyanions]].&lt;ref name="Aboutorabi MOF"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00522 | title=Metal-Organic Framework Based on Isonicotinate N-Oxide for Fast and Highly Efficient Aqueous Phase Cr(VI) Adsorption | author=Leila Aboutorabi et. al. | journal=Inorganic Chemistry | year=2016 | volume=55 | issue=11 | pages=5507–5513 | doi=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00522 | issn=1520-510X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Toxic poultry feed contaminated by chromium-based [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] (as opposed to traditional slower vegetable tanning) is entering the food supply in Bangladesh through chicken meat, which is the most common source of protein in the country. Tanneries in [[Hazaribagh Thana]], an industrial neighborhood of [[Dhaka]], emit around 21,600 cubic meters of toxic waste each day. The tanneries also generate as much as 100 tonnes per day of scraps, trimmed raw hide, flesh and fat, which are processed into feed by neighborhood recycling plants and used in chicken and fish farms across the country. Chromium levels ranging from 350 to 4,520 micrograms (0.35 to 4.52&amp;nbsp;mg) per kilogram were found in different organs of chickens which had been fed the tannery-scraps feed for two months, according to Abul Hossain, a chemistry professor at the [[University of Dhaka]].

====Eastern Central Greece====
The chemistry of the groundwater in eastern [[Central Greece]] (central [[Euboea]] and the [[Asopos]] valley) revealed high concentrations of hexavalent chromium in groundwater systems sometimes exceeding the Greek and the EU drinking water maximum acceptable level for total chromium. Hexavalent chromium pollution here is associated with industrial waste.

By using the GFAAS for total chromium, diphenylcarbazide-Cr(VI) complex colorimetric method for hexavalent chromium, and flame-AAS and [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS]] for other toxic elements, their concentrations were investigated in several groundwater samples. The contamination of water by hexavalent chromium in central Euboea is mainly linked to natural processes, but there are anthropogenic cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Geochemical Characteristics of Natural Waters Contaminated by Hexavalent Chromium, in Eastern Sterea Hellas, Greece|url=http://www.aueb.gr/users/koundouri/resees/uploads/geo2.pdf|journal=Scientific Annals|volume=99|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115234233/http://www.aueb.gr/users/koundouri/resees/uploads/geo2.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1970 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history|title=EPA History|last=EPA, OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021903/https://www.epa.gov/history|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the EPA, the federal government had the funds and the oversight to influence major environmental changes. Following the formation of the EPA, the United States saw groundbreaking legislation such as the [[Clean Water Act]] (1972) and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974).

The [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]] (FWPCA) of 1948 was amended in 1972 to what is more commonly known as the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA). The subsequent amendments provided a basis for the federal government to begin regulating pollutants, implement wastewater standards, and increase funding for water treatment facilities among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|title=History of the Clean Water Act|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108022914/https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|archivedate=2016-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed by congress. The SDWA aimed to monitor and protect the United States drinking water, and the water sources it is drawn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sdwa|title=Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027125530/https://www.epa.gov/sdwa|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the SDWA, in 1991, the EPA placed chromium under its list of maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), to have a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 ppb.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/chromium-drinking-water#if-epa-decides-regulate|title=Chromium in Drinking Water|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028022008/https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/chromium-drinking-water#if-epa-decides-regulate|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the SDWA was amended to include a provision known as the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/third-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule|title=Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027124423/https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/third-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this rule, the EPA issues a list of 30 or less contaminants that aren’t normally regulated under the SDWA. Chromium was monitored under the third UCMR, from January 2013 through December 2015.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The EPA uses data from these reports to assist in making regulatory decisions.

==== Current policies in the United States ====
The current EPA standard in measuring chromium, is in reference to total chromium, both trivalent and hexavalent. However, preliminary findings from water tests conducted by the [[Environmental Working Group]] (EWG), suggest that chromium is most often found in the hexavalent form; the more toxic of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. (2010, December 20). Chromium-6 in U.S. Tap Water (J. Houlihan, R. Sharp, &amp; N. Bruzelius, Eds.). Retrieved October 10, 2016, from {{cite web |url=http://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/water/public-health-goal/ewg1coms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021618/http://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/water/public-health-goal/ewg1coms.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often trivalent and hexavalent chromium are mentioned together, when in fact they are very different from each other.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is an issue because hexavalent chromium can cause cancer, whereas trivalent chromium does not.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1991, the MCL for chromium exposure was set based on potential of “adverse dermatological effects” related to long-term chromium exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Chromium’s MCL of 100 ppb has not changed since its 1991 recommendation. In 1998 the EPA released a toxicological review of hexavalent chromium.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This report examined current literature, at the time, and came to the conclusion that chromium was associated with various health issues.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?substance_nmbr=144|title=Chromium(VI) CASRN 18540-29-9 {{!}} IRIS {{!}} US EPA, ORD|last=Division|first=US EPA, ORD, Integrated Risk Information System|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028083633/https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?substance_nmbr=144|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the EPA can adjust the policy on chromium levels in drinking water, they have to release a final human health assessment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The EPA mentions two specific documents that are currently under review to determine whether or not to adjust the current drinking water standard for chromium.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The first study the EPA mentioned that is under review is a 2008 study conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program. This study looks at chronic oral exposure of hexavalent chromium in rats, and its association with cancer. The other study mentioned is a human health assessment of chromium, titled Toxicological Review of Hexavalent Chromium. The final human health assessment is currently in the stage of draft development.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This stage is the first of seven. The EPA gives no forecast to when the review will be finalized and if a decision will be made.

===== Military applications =====

Wash Primer DOD-P-15328D|last=Smith|first=Paulette|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Army relied on hexavalent chromium compounds, called Cr(VI), to protect its vehicles, equipment, aviation and missile systems from corrosion. The wash primer was sprayed as a pretreatment and protective layer on bare metal.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsiac.org/resources/news/arl-effort-improves-health-environment-bottom-line|title=ARL Effort Improves Health, Environment, Bottom Line {{!}} DSIAC|website=www.dsiac.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012-2015, [[Army Research Laboratory]] conducted research on a wash primer replacement, as a part of the DoD’s effort to eliminate the use of toxic wash primers in the military.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Studies indicated that Cr(VI) contained hazardous air pollutants and high levels of volatile organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=2972|title=ARL effort improves health, environment, bottom line {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project resulted in ARL qualifying three wash primer alternatives in 2015&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; for use on Army depots, installations and repair facilities.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The research led to the removal of chromate products from Army facilities in 2017.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@RDECOM/arl-wins-award-improving-health-and-environment-2c3b88ae8ad9|title=ARL wins award improving health and environment|last=RDECOM|first=U.

==== Pending regulations in the United States ====
In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities. The study was the first nationwide analysis measuring the presence of the chemical in U.S. water systems. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/12/tap-water-of-many-us-cities-has-probable-carcinogen-study/1#.VkziPoREmlY|title=Study: Tap water in U.S. cities has probable carcinogen|newspaper=USATODAY.COM|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA currently limits total chromium in drinking water to 100 parts per billion, but there is no established specifically for chromium(VI). In the same year, the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] had proposed a goal of 0.2 parts per billion, despite a 2001 state law requiring a standard be set by 2005. A final Public Health Goal of 0.02 ppb was established in July 2011.&lt;ref name="Hexavalent Chromium PHG" /&gt;

As of August 2016, the EWG alongside activist [[Erin Brockovich]] is pushing for the EPA to change the nationwide MCL to be more reflective of the California standards. This response comes as result of the resignation of a top state health official in North Carolina. [[Pat McCrory|Governor Pat McCrory]] had been attempting to remove warnings against drinking water potentially contaminated by hexavalent chromium from [[Duke Energy]] coal burning facilities. The confusion on the regulating guidelines and health safety of hexavalent chromium within drinking water has led to multiple standards. The EWG's push for stricter national guidelines is done in hopes to eliminate the confusion among citizens and state officials as well as to protect the health of the population from this carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/release/wake-nc-hexavalent-chromium-scandal-environmentalists-call-epa-set-national-drinking-water|title=In Wake of N.C.

The EWG released an analysis in September 2016 of federal data from nationwide drinking water tests which showed that seventy-five percent of samples contained hexavalent chromium at levels higher than the California public health goal of 0.02 ppb. The EWG estimates that the US will see 12,000 excess cases in cancer by the end of the century if hexavalent chromium exposure in drinking water is not reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/research/chromium-six-found-in-us-tap-water|title='Erin Brockovich' Carcinogen in Tap Water of More than 200 Million Americans|newspaper=EWG|access-date=2016-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028084953/http://www.ewg.org/research/chromium-six-found-in-us-tap-water|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Davenport =====
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District monitored airborne levels of hexavalent chromium at an elementary school and fire department, as well as the point-source.  They concluded that there were high levels of hexavalent chromium in the air, originating from a local cement plant, called [[Cemex]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Health Services Agency. (2008, Nov. 18).

===== Hinkley =====
{{Main article|Hinkley groundwater contamination}}Hexavalent chromium was found in drinking water in the southern California town of [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]] and was brought to popular attention by the involvement of [[Erin Brockovich]] and Attorney [[Edward Masry]]. The source of contamination was from the evaporating ponds of a PG&amp;E ([[Pacific Gas and Electric]]) natural gas pipeline Compressor Station located approximately 2 miles southeast of Hinkley. Between 1952 and 1966, chromium(VI) was used to prevent corrosion in the cooling stacks. The wastewater was then dumped into the unlined evaporating ponds. As a result, the chromium(VI) leaked into the groundwater source.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The 580 ppb chromium(VI) in the groundwater in Hinkley exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 100 ppb for total chromium currently set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-ioc/chromium.html U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Consumer Factsheet on: Chromium.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010171348/http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-ioc/chromium.html |date=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also exceeded the California MCL of 50 ppb (as of November 2008) for all types of chromium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/EPAandCDPH-11-28-2008.pdf |title=California Department of Public Health, Maximum Contaminant Levels and Regulatory Dates for Drinking Water. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718144405/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/EPAandCDPH-11-28-2008.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; California first established an MCL specifically for hexavalent chromium in 2014, set at 10 ppb.&lt;ref name="HEX Chrome Letter" /&gt; Prior to that only total chromium standards applied.

==== Illinois ====
In [[Chicago]]'s first ever testing for the toxic metal contaminant, results show that the city's local drinking water contains levels of hexavalent chromium more than 11 times higher than the health standard set in California in July 2011.  The results of the test showed that the water which is sent to over 7 million residents had average levels of 0.23 ppb of the toxic metal. California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment designated the nation's new "public health goal" limit as 0.02 ppb.  Echoing their counterparts in other cities where the metal has been detected, Chicago officials stress that local tap water is safe and suggest that if a national limit is adopted, it likely would be less stringent than California's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/chicago-water-chromium-127068203.html#ixzz1UNwMlC6Q|title=Toxic Metal Found in Chicago Drinking Water|last=Rodriguez|first=Robert|date=2011-08-06|publisher=NBC Chicago|accessdate=2013-08-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216072838/http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/chicago-water-chromium-127068203.html#ixzz1UNwMlC6Q|archivedate=2013-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-drinking-water-chromium-20110806,0,5813267.story |title=Toxic chromium found in Chicago drinking water |last=Hawthorne |first=Michael |work=Chicago Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807014854/http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-drinking-water-chromium-20110806%2C0%2C5813267.story |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency]] (Illinois EPA) has developed a chromium(VI) strategic plan which outlines tasks in order to reduce the levels of chromium(VI) in Illinois' drinking water.

Cambridge Plating Company, now known as Purecoat North, was an electroplating business in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]].  A report was conducted by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), to evaluate the association between environmental exposures from the Cambridge Plating Company and health effects on the surrounding community.  The report indicated that residents of Belmont were exposed to chromium via air emissions, as well as groundwater and soil.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Assessment for Cambridge Plating Company.

==== Missouri ====
In 2009, a lawsuit was filed against Prime Tanning Corporation of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], over alleged hexavalent chromium contamination in [[Cameron, Missouri]]. A cluster of brain tumors had developed in the town that was above average for the population size of the town. The lawsuit alleges that the tumors were caused by waste hexavalent chromium that had been distributed to local farmers as free fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/lawsuit-alleges-cameron-missouri-brain-tumors-linked-to-fertilizer-3690/|title=Lawsuit Alleges Cameron Missouri Brain Tumors Linked to Fertilizer|date=2009-04-28|publisher=AboutLawsuits.com|accessdate=2013-08-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621215524/http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/lawsuit-alleges-cameron-missouri-brain-tumors-linked-to-fertilizer-3690/|archivedate=2013-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a government study found hexavalent chromium within the soil but not at levels that were hazardous to human health. In 2012, the case ruled that $10 million would be distributed to over a dozen farmers affected in the northwest Missouri area. The Tanning Corporation still denies that their fertilizer caused any harm. Some residents claim that the tumors were a direct cause from the chromium exposure, but it is difficult to determine what other future impacts might arise from exposure in the specific Missouri counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article301330/Burns--McDonnell-settles-case-alleging-hazardous-sludge.html|title=Burns &amp; McDonnell settles case alleging hazardous sludge|first=|date=March 12, 2012|website=www.kansascity.com|publisher=The Kansas City Star|access-date=October 10, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130004/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article301330/Burns--McDonnell-settles-case-alleging-hazardous-sludge.html|archivedate=October 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Texas ====
On April 8, 2009, the [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] (TCEQ) collected ground water samples from a domestic well on West County Road 112 in [[Midland, Texas]] (U.S.), in response to a resident complaint of yellow water. The well was found to be contaminated with chromium(VI). The Midland groundwater reached higher levels of contamination than the EPA mandated maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 parts per billion. The current groundwater plume of chromium lies under approximately 260 acres of land at the West County Road 112 Groundwater Site. In response, the TCEQ installed filtration systems on water-well sites that showed contamination of chromium.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/sites/cr112.html|title=West County Road 112, Midland, TX|website=www.tceq.texas.gov|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028083815/https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/sites/cr112.html|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, TCEQ had sampled water from 235 wells and has installed over 45 anion-exchange filtration systems from this site&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; determined to be centered at 2601 West County Road 112, Midland, Texas.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/CurSites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0606992|title=Search Superfund Site Information|last=OSRTI|first=US EPA,|website=cumulis.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131130939/https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0606992|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TCEQ continues to sample wells surrounding the area to monitor the movement of the plume. In addition, they continue to monitor the effectiveness of the anion-exchange filtration systems by sampling on a year-quarterly and the filters are maintained at no cost to the residents.

As of March 2011, the West County Road 112 Ground Water site was added to the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL) also known as the Superfund List by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; From 2011 to 2013, TCEQ installed groundwater monitors and conducted groundwater sampling. In 2013, TCEQ began sampling residential soil and confirmed that it was contaminated from use of the contaminated groundwater for garden and lawn care.

According to the EPA, ongoing investigations have not concluded the source of the contamination and cleanup solutions are still being developed. Until such investigations are complete and remediation established, residents will continue to be at risk for health effects from exposure to the groundwater contamination.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Wisconsin ====
On January 7, 2011 it was announced that [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] had tested its water and hexavalent chromium was found to be present. Officials stated that it was in such small quantities that it was nothing to worry about, although this contaminant is a carcinogen. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee's average chromium(VI) level is 0.194 parts per billion (the EPA recommended maximum contaminant level (MCL) is 100 ppb).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; All 13 water systems tested positive for chromium(VI). Four out of seven systems detected the chemical in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]], and both [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha Counties]] had the highest levels averaging more than 0.2 parts per billion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs58.com/story/33146644/dangerous-levels-of-erin-brockovich-chemical-found-in-local-drinking-water|title=Dangerous Levels of 'Erin Brockovich' Chemical Found in Local Drinking Water|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027055407/http://www.cbs58.com/story/33146644/dangerous-levels-of-erin-brockovich-chemical-found-in-local-drinking-water|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further testing was being conducted as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/113101749.html City defends water safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110171236/http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/113101749.html |date=2011-01-10 }} ''Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel'', January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There was no further information available as of October 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18297">'''Military nutrition''' has evolved over time. In the past, armies lived off the land, by pillaging food from the people whose land the army occupied, or requisitioning it. Often more soldiers died of disease that was exacerbated by malnutrition than from combat.

"An army marches on its stomach", said [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], in the oft-quoted phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail, [http://dailymailnews.com/0910/index.php "Indian soldiers forced to eat sub-standard food"], Christina Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard for military rations in the United States was set in 1775 during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and included one pound of beef, one quarter pound of pork, or one pound of salt fish; one pound of bread or flour; three pints of peas or beans; one pint of milk; one half-pint of rice or one pint of cornmeal; and one quart of spruce beer or cider. When these items were not available, soldiers relied on jerky and hardtack, a type of biscuit made from flour and water.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://login.ezproxy.stockton.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/bloomfood/ration/0?institutionalId=564|title=Ration|last=Mariani|first=John|date=|website=Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], due to the progress made in the preservation of food, Union rations came to include coffee, tea, potatoes, and seasonings. During [[World War I]], rations included a pound of hard bread and canned meat, a cube of condensed soup, coffee, and sugar.

During World War I, four types of rations existed: garrison rations, reserve rations, emergency rations, and trench rations. Garrison rations were perishable foods like meat and bread. Reserve rations were non-perishables, such as canned goods. In response to the need for food for the [[Grande Armée|Grand Army]] that invaded Russia under Napoleon, a French government reward prompted [[Nicolas Appert]] to invent "[[canning]]", resulting in the first preserved food for armies (military rations), that came as food stuffed into wine bottles and then boiled to preserve it.[[History of military nutrition#cite note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Emergency rations were compressed meats and cereal bars. Trench rations were kept in large steel cans designed to withstand chemical attacks. During the mid-1930s, the names for these rations were changed: garrison rations became A rations; reserve rations became B and C rations; emergency rations became D rations. C rations contained three cans of meat (M) units and Bread (B) units. M1 contained meat and beans, M2 contained meat and vegetable hash, and M3 contained meat and vegetable stew. B units contained bread, coffee, and sugar.

K rations were developed in the 1940s. These were portable rations, sealed for safe consumption, designed to give soldiers the energy they need without the baggage of the bulkier rations. One version of the K ration, the Logan bar, was made from chocolate and oat flour and was made by [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Chocolate Company]]. Starting in the 1980s these rations evolved to include two hot meals a day. T, or tray rations were developed for dining halls and were meant to be boiled and served to twelve to eighteen people. Individual rations were also developed called MRE or [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals Ready-To-Eat]]. These were complete 1300 calorie meals that include things like cake, peanut butter, hot sauce, and candy. These MREs came with a water activated heating pad to prepare the meals if desired. Since the 1980s, the variety of these meals has increased to include more of a variation of meals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== United States Military ==
{{main|History of military nutrition in the United States}}Currently, the United States military several different types of food available. Some of these include: 
* A-Ration, a fresh refrigerator food that is normally prepared in dining halls or field kitchens. Examples of A- Ration include various kinds of meat and produce found locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=academic.oup.com/milmed/article/178/12/1285/4267286|title=Evaluating the Nutrition Intake of U.S. Military Service Members in Garrison|last=Ramsey|first=Casside|date=|website=Oxford University Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B-Ration, less perishable foods such as canned, prepackaged, or preserved foods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_ration|title=United States Military Ration|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}
* MRE, or Meals Ready to Eat, which were first studied by the military in 1975, large-scale tested in 1978, and entered service in 1981. The 25th Infantry did a field study of the MRE in 1983, eating MRE three times a day for 34 days; troops reported that the rations were acceptable, but test results showed only 60% of the calories were consumed. In 1988 changes, were made to the MRE based on the 1983 results, replacing nine of the twelve entree options and increasing entree size from 5 to 8 oz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/13/combat.food/index|title=Grub, Chow, Mystery Meat -- Combat Food 2.0|last=|first=|date=|website=Cable News Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First Strike Ration, a fast action meal which troops can eat while on the move; it is designed to be consumed during the first 72 hours of conflict. One example is the HOOAH! Bar, a dairy based energy bar enriched with calcium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Effects on Health ==
Nutrition has a direct correlation to health, and health directly influences the effectiveness of military personnel. Lack of proper nutrition can decrease the effectiveness of vaccines and increase the possibility of disease, especially in high stress situations. Many nutrients have direct effects on the immune system. When the body is subjected to illnesses such as injuries or burns increased amounts of the amino acid [[Glutamine]] are required. Vitamins C and E are [[antioxidant]]s and have been associated with increased immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ezproxy.stockton.edu/lib/stocktonnj-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3377041|title=Military Strategies for Sustainment of Nutrition and Immune Function in the Field|last=|first=|date=|website=National Academies Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition plays an important role in the body’s ability to repair itself. Throughout history there have been instances where disease caused by nutritional depletion caused more deaths than combat. During [[Lord Anson]]’s 1774 voyage around the world 636 of his 961 soldiers died while on his ships. The surgeon [[James Lind]] of the Royal Navy discovered that consuming citrus fruits prevented scurvy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1562/231.short|title=Military Nutrition: Maintaining Health and Rebuilding Injured Tissue|last=Hill|first=Neil|date=|website=The Royal Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts and nutrient analysis provide evidence that poor nutrition and inadequate amounts of vitamins A, C, and E may have caused the failure of the New Zealand army during the Battle of Gallipoli. These deficiencies account for numerous cases of scurvy and illnesses and could have been easily avoided by incorporating canned fruits and vegetables into soldier’s diets.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Nutritional Analysis of New Zealand Military Food Rations at Gallipoli in 1915: Likely Contribution to Scurvy and Other Nutrient Deficiency Disorders|last=Wilson|first=Nick|publisher=The New Zealand Medical Journal|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=vol. 126, no. 1373, pp. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; “ Inadequate nutrition can result in poor physical and cognitive performance (e.g. inability to carry out physical tasks, poor concentration and decreased vigilance) [21,22]. The long-term effects of both macro- and micro-nutrient imbalances include increased risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies (potentially predisposing some individuals to an increased risk of stress fractures and rickets), obesity, [[hypertension]], [[Coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]], diabetes, [[osteoporosis]] and [[kidney failure]]”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Nutritional Evaluation of Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) ==
In 1963, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] began creating what is now known as “[[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meal, Ready to Eat]]”, commonly abbreviated as MRE. Modern food preparation combined with new packaging technology led to the ability to ration out food in a lighter and more efficient way, rather than having to carry around canned goods. Ongoing development has led to around 24 entrees and more than 150 additional food and beverage options for soldiers to choose from. Recently, MREs have been studied more extensively, and are now being developed using the [[Dietary Reference Intake]]. Created by the Institute of Medicine, it was indicated that military members typically burn around 4,200 calories a day, but tend to only consume around 2,400 calories during combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat|title=Meal, Ready-to-Eat|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}} To combat this and provide foods with better nutritional value, the military has experimented with new ration ideas, such as the [[First Strike Ration]] and the [[HOOAH! Bar]], which are typically lighter than MRE and require less preparation, such as having to heat up foods.

Each MRE meal contains approximately 1,200 calories. They are prepared to be eaten within a twenty-one day period. Packaging requirements are strict in order to maintain health codes. For example, MREs are created to withstand parachute drops from 1,250 feet high. The packaging itself is made to survive a life shelf of three and a half years at 81 degrees Fahrenheit, nine months at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even stay safe through short durations of -60 degrees Fahrenheit.

Not only are the MRE options ever-developing to best suit the needs of service members, the packaging itself is improving. [[Zein]] is being studied as a possibility to replace the current foil packages. Foil has a list of negativity; it can be punctured more easily, can conduct heat, and is reflective, which could give away a soldier’s position while on the battlefield.

== Psychological Effects ==
The subject of how nutrition in the military affects service members psychologically is an ongoing research process. It is currently a small field, as few studies have been conducted. However, much research has been done on how food, or lack thereof, can affect the mental stability of an individual. This information can thus be carried over to our soldiers and intensified, to better their health. A review by the [[American Dietetic Association]] indicated that restricting the intake of food has many underlying issues. Lack of proper nutrition can increase emotional responsiveness and dysphoria, and distractibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223(96)00161-7/fulltext+|title=Psychological Consequences of Food Restriction|last=Polivy|first=Janet|date=|website=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be an obvious issue for soldiers, especially those on the front line. Taking this into account and finding ways to better the dietary plans of military members will not only better their physical abilities, but help keep their minds stronger.

== Religious Diets ==
Muslim soldiers must observe [[Ramadan]], a four-week fasting period where the participants can only eat after sundown. This can cause problems for military personnel who are in training or in battle, depleting their body of nutrients for long periods of time while they are still required to do continuous physical and mental labor at a high level of ability.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfh.mums.ac.ir/index.php/43-uncategorised/images/icon/images/journal/article_7889_f97dcb59e538ab74fcb8157dfeeda459.pdf|title=The Effects of Ramadan Fasting on Physical Field-Expedient Measures in Army Cadets|last=Havenetidis|first=K.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Hellenic Army Academy]] study found that Ramadan fasting does not affect overall military fitness performance, although fasting cadets were less able to handle repeated maximal exercise, possibly due to inadequate recovery between tests.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Diet Quality ==
===United States Military===

Throughout US military history, diet quality has not been the main issue; the lack of food consumption has. The Committee on Military Nutrition Research attempted to identify factors that lead to low food intake by troops in field settings, investigating whether or not—and if so, when—the energy deficit affects soldiers’ performance, and what specific factors are involved, allowing the military to implement operational strategies to mitigate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not Eating Enough: Overcoming Underconsumptions of Military Operational Rations|last=Marriott|first=Bernadette|publisher=Committee on Military Nutrition Research|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Military===

A balanced diet informed by sound nutrition knowledge is key for operational readiness and the health of military personnel. Unfortunately, research suggests that military personnel have inadequate dietary intakes. A  study assessed general nutrition knowledge, diet quality and their association in Australian military personnel.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/relationship-between-general-nutrition-knowledge-and-diet-quality-in-australian-military-personnel/F090D9B81B3D1AAFF32F7215F06A118D|title=Relationship Between General Nutrition Knowledge and Diet Quality in Australian Military Personnel|last=Kullen|first=Farrugia|date=|website=British Journal of Nutrition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two specific questions on eating patterns were also included. The first examined how often during an average week (including weekends) participants skipped breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. Response options included ‘always’, ‘often’, ‘sometimes’ or ‘never’. The second examined on average how many times per week participants ate dinner away from home – for example, from a restaurant, takeaway or frontline (military canteen). Participants were required to provide a numerical value of occasions per week.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This study found that military personnel had poor quality diets even with the knowledge they would expect to have from having to take care of their bodies in other to be able to reach their fitness standards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===New Zealand Military===

A study done testing the poor food quality giving to New Zealand soldiers in [[Gallipoli]] in 1915. To further understand this problem, the study analysed the foods in the military rations for 1915 using food composition data on the closest equivalents for modern foods. The nutrient analysis suggested that the military rations were below modern requirements for vitamins A, C and E; potassium; selenium; and dietary fiber. If military planners had used modest amounts of the canned vegetables and fruit available in 1915, this would probably have eliminated four of these six deficits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In summary, there is now both historical and analytic evidence that the military rations provided to these soldiers were nutritionally inadequate. These deficits are likely to have caused cases of scurvy and may have contributed to the high rates of other illnesses experienced at Gallipoli. Such problems could have been readily prevented by providing rations that included some canned fruit or vegetables.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Canadian Military===

Canada determined that poor nutrition of their military personnel may be affecting their long term health and combat readiness.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development of a Nutrition Strategy for the Canadian Armed Forces to Enhance Operational Effectiveness, Human Performance, and Long Term Health Based on Scientific Evidence|last=Troupe|first=H.|publisher=Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice &amp; Research|year=2017|isbn=|location=|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their findings, the military has designed and required a nutrition course for all new recruits. They have also updated their National Standardized Cycle menu and shelf stable rations to encourage healthier eating habits.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===British Military===

The rations provided to the British Forces were often inedible and did not resemble real food. The soldiers mentioning food in many of their letters home shows some psychological distress that they may have been experiencing due to the nature of their rations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffett|first=Rachel|date=December 2011|title=Beyond the Ration: Sharing and Scrounging on the Western Front|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.stockton.edu/10.1093/tcbh/hwr013|journal=Twentieth Century British History|volume= 22| issue = 4|pages=453–473|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also were high in calories yet low in the essential nutrients needed to thrive. In the book the author reveals parts of soldiers diaries where they admit to stealing food from French farms and orchards. Edible food was used as a motivating source for the Soldiers when receiving care packages from loved ones.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

IMA World Health, also known as Interchurch Medical Assistance, was formed in 1960 as a [[coalition]] of a number of faith-based relief and development agencies.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/52-2112460/interchurch-medical-assistance.aspx | title = Interchurch Medical Assistance: History| publisher = Guide Star | accessdate = 1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-01-16/news/bal-md.ima16jan16_1_ima-world-health-faith-based-relief-groups-hotel-montana | title = Md. aid group shares tears of joy and relief | publisher = Baltimore Sun | accessdate = 2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMA's aim was to centralize and oversee requests for [[Gifts in kind|gifts-in-kind]] from [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and medical supply manufacturers and appropriately channel them to healthcare facilities, refugee centers, and disaster relief programs.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elsevierbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/47/042/interchurch-medical-assistance-drugmedical-supply-shipments-of-over-$10-mil | title = INTERCHURCH MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DRUG/MEDICAL SUPPLY SHIPMENTS OF OVER $10 MIL | publisher = Elsevier | accessdate = 5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began distributing the donations from a warehouse in Maryland.

'''IPS Supported Employment''' is an [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] approach to [[supported employment]] for people who have a  mental illness. IPS stands for '''Individual Placement and Support'''. IPS supports people in their efforts to achieve steady, meaningful employment in mainstream competitive jobs, either part-time or full-time. This stands in contrast to other vocational rehabilitation approaches that employ people in [[sheltered workshop]]s and other set-aside jobs.

IPS has been extensively researched and proven to be effective compared to standard employment services.&lt;ref name="Bond_2008"/&gt;

== Principles ==
IPS is based on eight principles.&lt;ref name="Bond_2004"/&gt; Mental health agencies that implement IPS aim to follow these principles in delivering vocational services.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  || IPS Principles
|-
| &amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp; || Every person with severe mental illness who wants to work is eligible for IPS supported employment.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp; || Employment services are integrated with mental health treatment services.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp; || Competitive employment is the goal.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp; || Personalized benefits counseling is provided.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp; || The job search starts soon after a person expresses interest in working.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp; || Employment specialists systematically develop relationships with employers based upon their client's preferences.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp; || Job supports are continuous.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp; || Client preferences are honored.
|}

The implementation of these principles can be assessed by using a [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page19/page21/files/se-fidelity-scale002c-2008.pdf fidelity scale] and an accompanying [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page19/page49/page49.html manual] that have been developed specifically for IPS.

== Research ==
IPS was first studied in a [[randomized controlled trial]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="Drake_1996"/&gt; Between 1996 and 2011, IPS was evaluated in 15 randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Drake_2011"/&gt; This research has established IPS as an [[evidence-based practice]] in community psychiatry. Studies in this body of research typically compare IPS to another approach to vocational rehabilitation. Study participants are randomized to receive services from one of the vocational approaches being studied. Researchers observe the proportion of participants in each group who get jobs within some fixed period of time. This follow-up period varies across studies from 6 months to 30 months, averaging 18 months.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b"/&gt; On average, 60% of research participants get a competitive job during the follow-up period when they receive IPS, whereas 24% of participants get a competitive job when receiving other vocational services.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b" /&gt; These results, along with data from non-research implementations of IPS, have resulted in the establishment of benchmark employment rates for IPS programs.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b" /&gt;

In addition to testing the [[Comparative effectiveness research|comparative effectiveness]] of IPS, researchers have conducted [[implementation research]] on IPS,&lt;ref name="Bond_2008_b"/&gt; research on predictors of outcome (who gets jobs and why),&lt;ref name="Bond_2008_c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salkever_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michon_2005"/&gt; barriers to employment for people who have a serious mental illness,&lt;ref name="Biegel_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbiere_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McQuilken_2003"/&gt; and a number of other [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~charky1/page40/page23/files/voc-pubs.11-11.pdf related areas.]

== What happens in IPS ==
IPS services are typically delivered by supported employment teams that operate within [[Community mental health service|community mental health agencies]]. These teams work with their agency's clinical staff to coordinate services. When a client at the agency expresses interest in working, that client is referred to an employment specialist on the IPS team for an initial meeting. The employment specialist works with the client to learn about his or her goals and preferences and provides information about how IPS works. When someone chooses to enroll in IPS, that person and the employment specialist make a plan together and begin to look for regular jobs in the community as soon as the client expresses interest in doing so. Employment specialists are trained to provide people with support, coaching, resume development, interview training, and on-the-job support. Employment specialists are also trained to do job development; a process in which employment specialists build relationships with employers in businesses that have jobs that are consistent with client preferences.

In IPS, the client's preferences are central. The client decides whether or not employers and potential employers know about her/his mental illness and whether or not the employment specialist will talk to employer/s on his or her behalf. The client also decides which jobs to apply for and how much he or she wants to work. The decision about how much to work is often influenced by a desire to transition to a working life while minimizing the risk of being both out of work and without disability benefits. Part of the employment specialist's job is to connect people with benefits counseling so that they can make informed decisions in this area.

People who try IPS often get a number of jobs before finding one that is a good fit. In IPS there is an orientation towards moving between jobs as part of a normal process. This process aims at convergence towards stable employment and toward the client's personal [[Recovery model|recovery]] goals.

==Access to IPS Services==
As of 2009 only 2.1% of U.S. mental health clients had access to evidence-based vocational services.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_2009"/&gt; Mental health agencies often face financing challenges in implementing IPS due to the absence of clear reimbursement policies for vocational services in psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Drake_2009"/&gt; Nonetheless, as of 2011, IPS was offered by mental health agencies in at least 13 states.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011"/&gt; Because there is no national directory of IPS providers, people interested in access to these services must ask local mental health services providers about their vocational services in order to find out whether or not evidence-based vocational services are available.

== Dissemination ==
The [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page3/page10/page10.html Johnson &amp; Johnson – Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program] was created to further the dissemination of IPS by providing a structure for supporting implementations of IPS at the state level. In 2001, the [http://prc.dartmouth.edu/ Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center] launched this program with philanthropic support from [http://www.jnj.com/connect/caring/corporate-giving/ Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporate Contributions]. This program has resulted in the formation of a national learning collaborative that supports the implementation of IPS services in everyday (i.e., non-research) settings. Membership in this collaborative is widespread. As of 2011, 13 states containing 130 participating mental health agencies were part of the collaborative.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011"/&gt; States that enter the learning collaborative receive four years of seed funding to support initial implementation efforts. After this first phase, states and their participating agencies stay involved by sharing outcome and service data, participating in research projects, and by continuing statewide implementation efforts.

== IPS outside of the United States ==
Although IPS was developed in the United States, research literature suggests a wider interest in IPS and suggests that the intervention is effective across a range of cultures and policy environments. Randomized trials of IPS have been conducted in Canada,&lt;ref name="Latimer_2006"/&gt; throughout Europe,&lt;ref name="Burns_2007"/&gt; including in the UK, in Australia,&lt;ref name="Killackey_2008"/&gt; The Netherlands,&lt;ref name="Michon_2011"/&gt; Switzerland,&lt;ref name="Hoffman_2011"/&gt; and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Wong_2008"/&gt;

In the UK, Centre for Mental Health has developed a Centres of Excellence project based on the Dartmouth Medical School scheme. The Centres will act as exemplars of how Individual Placement and Support (IPS) can be implemented in localities across England. http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/employment/ips.aspx

In October 2011, [[Independence Blue Cross]] launched a private, charitable foundation— the Independence Blue Cross (IBC) Foundation— with a mission to transform health care through innovation in the communities it serves.&lt;ref name="Philly.Com Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=DiStefano|first=Joseph N.|title=PhillyDeals: IBC establishing a nonprofit foundation to aid health-related programs|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-10-06/business/30250762_1_ibc-grants-health-related-programs|accessdate=2013-09-20|date=10/6/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their mission is defined by the foundation's core principles: Thought leadership, Innovation, Collaboration, Engagement, and Sustainability.

The IBC Foundation funds research, grants, programs, and initiatives that advance caring for the Philadelphia region's most vulnerable, enhance health care delivery, and build healthy communities.&lt;ref name="Independence Blue Cross Foundation Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence Blue Cross Foundation Website|url=http://www.ibxfoundation.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blue Safety Net Grants ==
The IBC Foundation's Blue Safety Net program provides grants to non-profit, privately funded "safety net" health clinics that provide free or nominal-fee care to the uninsured and medically underserved in local communities in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="IBC Foundation Blue Safety Net"&gt;{{cite web|title=IBC Foundation Blue Safety Net|url=http://www.ibxfoundation.org/programs/vulnerable/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nurses for Tomorrow Program ==
Nurses for Tomorrow is an initiative designed to address the shortage of nurses and nursing educators and support the ability for nurses to practice effectively. The program includes nursing scholarship grants to local schools in the Philadelphia region, continuing education workshops, and nursing internships at either the IBC Foundation or Independence Blue Cross.&lt;ref name="IBC Foundation Nurses for Tomorrow"&gt;{{cite web|title=IBC Foundation Nurses for Tomorrow|url=http://www.ibxfoundation.org/programs/enhancing_delivery/nurses_for_tomorrow/index.html|accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBJ - Nursing Scholar Program"&gt;{{cite news|last=George|first=John|title=$20M nursing scholar program has local ties|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2013/06/04/20m-nursing-scholar-program-has-local.html|accessdate=2013-09-20|newspaper=Philadelphia Business Journal|date=6/4/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">'''International trade and water''' is the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Segerfeldt 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Saefong 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGO’s, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.&lt;ref&gt;(Overbeke 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.

==Water as a commodity==
Prior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted.  In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. [[Desalinization]] and desalinization plants play a major role also.

==International institutions, international trade agreements and water privatization==
In 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.&lt;ref&gt;(Public Citizen.org 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The [[Doha Development Round]] of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.&lt;ref&gt;(Mann 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.&lt;ref&gt;(Mann 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible.

==International trade and water legal disputes and politics==
Canada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.&lt;ref&gt;(Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.

==Turkey-Israel==
In 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;(US Water News Online 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The method of transport involved the use of [[Spragg Bag|large plastic bubbles]] that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that  this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;(US Water News Online 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister  also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted ''commodity,'' and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos  [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Flotilla Raid]] on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcglobal/4israsign3.html Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN declaration==
In July 2010, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right. The assembly did not specify whether a public authority or the private sector would be best capable of providing this right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">[[File:JamesLind.jpg|thumb|James Lind 1716–1794]]
The '''James Lind Alliance''' is a British non-profit making initiative, established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)17494-1/fulltext The Lancet, Volume 364, Issue 9449, Pages 1923 - 1924, 27 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to bring [[patients]], carers and clinicians together, in Priority Setting Partnerships, to identify and prioritise the unanswered questions about treatments that they agree are most important. The intention is to ensure that those who fund health research are aware of what matters to  patients, carers and clinicians.

From 1 April 2013, the secretariat of the James Lind Alliance has been hosted by the National Institute for Health Research Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC). Its work includes recruiting and training JLA Advisers, coordinating Priority Setting Partnerships, communications and liaising with other parts of the [[National Institute for Health Research]] (NIHR). In 2016 the James Lind Alliance was granted with the Societal Award of the Foundation Federation of Dutch Medical Scientific Societies (Federa) for their initiative to bring patients into partnerships for research priorities &lt;ref&gt;https://federa.org/Participation%20by%20patients%20in%20science&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Background ==

Research on the effects of treatments often overlooks the shared interests of patients and clinicians. As a result, questions they both consider important are not addressed. The pharmaceutical and medical technology industries and academia play essential roles in developing new treatments, but their priorities are not necessarily the same as those of patients and clinicians. For this reason many areas of potentially valuable research are neglected. Bringing patients and clinicians together to prioritise questions in treatment uncertainty is thought to be rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/336/7650/903 British Medical Journal 2008;336:903-904 (26 April), ] {{doi|10.1136/bmj.39547.586100.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

The James Lind Alliance brings together patients and patient representatives, carers and clinicians, as individuals or represented by groups, to form Priority Setting Partnerships, focusing on specific health conditions. For example, the Asthma Priority Setting Partnership was led by [[Asthma UK]] and the [[British Thoracic Society]], while the Urinary Incontinence Priority Setting Partnership was led by the Bladder &amp; Bowel Foundation [http://www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org] and the Cochrane Incontinence Group [http://www.incontinence.cochrane.org], part of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/ntclinical/2008/05/identifying_uncertainties_to_prioritise_research.html Nursing Times (2008);  104: 18, 38–39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Priority Setting Partnerships work together to gather uncertainties about the effects of treatments. The uncertainties are all checked to ensure they cannot be answered by existing knowledge, research or sources of information.

The uncertainties then go through a process of prioritisation, which aims to culminate in a top ten list of priorities for research, shared by patients, [[carers]] and clinicians. To date, the process has been completed for over 40 health areas including Asthma, Urinary Incontinence, Anaesthetics and Perioperative Care, Vitiligo, Intensive Care, Prostate Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis and Surgery for Common Shoulder Problems.

== James Lind ==

The Alliance is named after a pioneer of [[clinical trials]], [[James Lind]] (1716–1794). Two hundred and fifty years ago, there were many conflicting ideas and unanswered questions about how to treat the deadly disease [[scurvy]]. Lind, a Scottish naval surgeon, decided to confront this uncertainty by treating his patients within a clinical trial comparing six of the proposed remedies. His trial showed that oranges and lemons were dramatically better than the other supposed treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/who-was-james-lind-and-what-exactly-did-he-achieve/ James Lind Library, biography of James Lind]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kama Reservoir''', also known as the '''Perm Reservoir''' ({{lang-ru|Камское водохранилище, Пермское водохранилище}}), is a [[reservoir]] formed by the [[dam]] of the [[Kama Hydroelectric Station]] near [[Perm]] (constructed in 1954-1956). The Kama Reservoir has a surface area of 1,915&amp;nbsp;km² and a water volume of 12,2 cubic km. Its length along the [[Kama River|Kama]] is 272&amp;nbsp;km, major width - up to 30&amp;nbsp;km, average depth - 6,3 m (with maximum depth equaling 30 m). The Kama Reservoir was created for the benefit of transportation, energetics, and water supply. It also performs seasonal flow regulation. The cities of Perm, [[Dobryanka]], [[Chyormoz]], [[Berezniki]], [[Usolye]], and [[Solikamsk]] are located on the shores of the Kama Reservoir.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">The '''liability insurance crisis''' in the [[United States of America]] refers to a volatile economic period during the mid-1980s. During these years, until about 1990, rising [[insurance premium]]s and an unavailability of coverage for several types of [[Liability insurance|liability]] insurance led to a crisis that has been attributed, among others, to the expansion of tort doctrines for insurer liability and the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act|McCarran-Ferguson exemption]] from [[antitrust laws]].

==The Impact of the Crisis==

During the period from 1984 to 1987, premiums for general liability increased from about $6.5 billion to approximately $19.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Gene C. Lai et al.“On Liability Insurance Crisis.” Proceedings of the Risk Theory Society,  Revised October 1996. Based on data from the A.M. Best Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to increases in premium, many insurers took the following measures to limit the number and cost of claims:  1) changed policy coverage from an occurrence to a claims-made basis; 2) expanded exclusions; 3) raised deductibles; and 4) lowered policy limits on a per-claim basis, and 5) introduced the notion of aggregate total exposure.

The resulting crisis adversely affected a diverse range of organizations, including municipalities, social service providers and pharmaceutical, aircraft, sports equipment, and medical device companies.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Priest.“The Current Insurance Crisis and Modern Tort Law.” (1987). Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 578. http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/57&lt;/ref&gt;  Many organizations in the nonprofit and government sector could no longer offer social, medical or recreational services due to the prohibitive cost or unavailability of liability coverage.

Reaction to the crisis was widespread in the public media.&lt;ref&gt;“Sorry, Your Policy Is Cancelled.” Time, Mar. 24, 1986; Various: N.Y. Times, Feb. 15,1986, at 1, col. 1;  Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, Feb. 21, 1986,at B2, col. 1;  N.Y.Times, Feb. 1, 1986, at 1, col. 5; Wall St. J., Feb. 3, 1986, a t5, col. 1; 8. N.Y. Times, Mar. 26, 1986, at C12, col.4; 9. Wall St. J., supra note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Public policy advocates expressed concern about the impact on human services. In California, for example, testimony was given before the California Assembly regarding the significant loss of human service programs such as foster care, group homes, and health services caused by soaring premiums and widespread policy cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Pamela Davis, Graduate Researcher, University of California at Berkeley. Interim Hearing of California Assembly Select Committee on Insurance, Sacramento, October 8, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of the Crisis==

Various theories among academics, government, insurers, consumers, and regulators have been put forth regarding the causes of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the controversial theories as to the source of the commercial liability crisis, see: (Clarke et al 1988, Harrington and Litan 1988, Lacey 1988, Winter 1988, Cummins and Danzon 1991, Gron 1990, Harrington and Danzon 1991, Lai and Witt 1992, Doherty and Garven 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Collusion: the argument that the crisis was engineered by [[insurance companies]] themselves, through price-fixing and/or manipulation of insurance reserve accounts.
# Losses: Decrease in [[interest rate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and investment returns forced insurance companies to raise premiums in order to make up for the loss of profitability.
# Litigation: Proliferation of tort litigation and large settlements drove the cost of liability insurance premiums to excessive levels.
# [[Reinsurance]]: Disruption of supply in reinsurance markets cited as a contributing factor.

==Tort Reform and Alternative Insurance==

As a result of widespread economic disruption, a large number of states adopted [[tort reform]]s to limit the dramatic surge in insurance losses and premiums.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kip Viscus et al.“The Effect of 1980s Tort Reform Legislation on General Liability and Medical Malpractice.” Insurance Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 6:165-186 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress enacted legislation that expanded the ability of companies prone to similar risks to join together and either form their own insurance risk pool or purchase insurance collectively.&lt;ref&gt;Risk Retention Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-563, 100 Stat. 3170&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, such as Vermont and Hawaii, enacted laws to encourage the development of alternative methods to manage risk, such as [[captive insurance]] or [[Risk Retention Group|risk retention groups]].

'''Lifeline Express''' is an [[charitable organization]] that attempts to reduce [[blindness]] in [[China]]. Since 1997, the orgainzation has operated rainbow-coloured hospital "Eye-Trains" that provide free [[cataract]] operations to patients in China. In addition, Lifeline Express promotes ophthalmological training for Chinese doctors, through constructing training centers and inviting foreign doctors to China as consultants, and builds solar [[hot water system]]s in remote parts of China.

The development of Lifeline Express is supported by the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]], [[Ministry of Railways (China)|Ministry of Railways]] and [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]]. It is funded by [http://www.lifelineexpress.org.hk/eng/index.html Lifeline Express Hong Kong Foundation],[http://www.lifeline-express.org.cn/cn/ Lifeline Express China Foundation] and the general public.

==Mission==
Lifeline Express restores sights to the cataract patients in rural China. The Ministry of Health estimated that 1 million cataract patients are remain uncured, with an increase of 0.5 million new cases every year.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Fang. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/30/content_11628936.htm " China restores sights for 8.45 mln cataract patients in 20 years"], ''[[Xinhua News]]'', 2009-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; People suffering from cataract grew younger in remote areas due to unsatisfactory hygiene condition and demanding physical laboring; more and more are diagnosed as genetically inherited. Lifeline Express brings back lights to the patients, allowing the people to pick up their work in the fields again and help the poverty-stricken areas to retrieve work force, thus improve their livelihood. While working on the eye-train, eye-doctors are trained to facilitate the future development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifelineexpress.org.hk/eng/mission.html "Mission"], ''Lifeline Express Hong Kong Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This organisation has replicated the [[Lifeline Express]] created in India by the Impact India Foundation. In 1996, Impact India came to Hong Kong to raise funds for this work. Some of the individuals they approached for support quickly saw the potential for mounting a similar operation on China’s mainland. A group of Hong Kong philanthropists visited India to see the Lifeline Express in action, discussed the idea with China’s Ministry of Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/dingo/Sector/Special-Needs--Disability/2-52-0-136-0-0.html&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty to China, [[Nellie Fong Wong Kut-Man]], the Founding Chairman of Lifeline Express Hong Kong Foundation, together with twenty other Founding Trustees raised the capital for the first eye-train. On 1 July 1997, the first eye-train started its first journey of vision.

In 2002, the Chinese Foundation for Lifeline Express was established and widened the network of sponsorship.

==Service==

===Eye-train===
Over the past decade, the [http://lxlearn.com/viewpage/4889ba18-5d2c-4115-b98c-6b2e3a408172 eye-train] s of Lifeline Express visited over 27 provinces, cities and autonomous regions and cured more than 100,000 cataract patients in the remote and poverty-stricken areas of China. Lifeline Express' hospital trains together visit twelve locations and perform over 11,000 surgeries every year. Train stays at each location for 3 months, performing 25 free eye operations every day for a total of about 1000 patients having their eyesight restored at each stop.
The first eye-train was launched in 1997, the second in 1999, the third in 2002 and the fourth in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-11/27/content_642793.htm "Health foundation aims to aid blind Chinese"], ''[[Xinhuanet]]'', 2002-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.gov.cn/gate/big5/www.gov.cn/wszb/zhibo24/ "健康快車光明行2007"], ''[[People's Republic of China|PRC]]'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 12 team members, including doctors, nurses, engineering technician and administrative staff recruited from the mainland hospitals, staying on each eye-train running the daily operations.  Voluntary [[ophthalmologist]]s from [[Hong Kong]] and overseas spend their vacations on the train to perform surgeries.

There are 4 compartments on the eye-train. Each train consists of medical equipment and eye-care technology. Other facilities are also available on the train:&lt;ref&gt;[http://lxlearn.com/viewpage/4889ba18-5d2c-4115-b98c-6b2e3a408172 "A Story About Lifeline Express"], ''Lifeline Express Training Web''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Consultation clinic
*Sanitization room
*2 Operating theatres
*Recovery room
*Multi-function conference room
*Living quarters for medical staff

===Microscopic Eye Surgery Training Centre===
Lifeline Express has set up 12 Microscopic Eye Surgery Centres to train eye-doctors in China. The Centres are equipped with the latest surgical equipment and eye-care technology. Its ultimate goal is to set up Centres in every province the eye-train visited, namely the less developed provinces. Doctors can received training and sit for the global exam host by the [[International Council of Ophthalmology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lxlearn.com/viewpage/48bf9e7b-6dac-4443-9623-153b3a408172 "The Birth of Microsurgical Eye Training Centers"], ''Lifeline Express Training Web''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Hot Water System===
In the past, many living in the remote area of China could only bath in ponds during summers, and often not to bath in the cold water during fierce winters. Hygiene condition deteriorated and diseases raged.
In 2006, Lifeline Express started a new project in China, building solar hot water system for the rural schools to supply hot water for the village students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lxlearn.com/viewpage/49f87cd4-01b0-45e9-be6a-128d3a408172 "LIFELINE EXPRESS SOLAR HOT WATER SYSTEM FOR VILLAGE SCHOOLS"], ''Lifeline Express Training Web''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myositis ossificans''' comprises two syndromes characterized by [[heterotopic ossification]] (calcification) of muscle.

==Classification==
* In the first, and by far most common type, ''nonhereditary myositis ossificans'' (commonly referred to simply as "myositis ossificans", as in the remainder of this article), calcifications occur at the site of injured muscle, most commonly in the arms or in the [[quadriceps]] of the [[thighs]].
** The term ''myositis ossificans traumatica'' is sometimes used when the condition is due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref name="pmid18196398"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sodl |first1=Jeffrey F. |last2=Bassora |first2=Rocco |last3=Huffman |first3=G. Russell |last4=Keenan |first4=Mary Ann E. |title=Case Report |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |volume=466 |issue=1 |pages=225–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18196398 |pmc=2505309 |doi=10.1007/s11999-007-0005-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18067695"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Manish |last1=Chadha |first2=Anil |last2=Agarwal |title=Myositis ossificans traumatica of the hand |journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=E21–2 |year=2007 |pmid=18067695 |pmc=2386223 |url=http://canjsurg.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/50-6-E21.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Myositis ossificans circumscripta is another  synonym of myositis ossificans traumatica refers to the new extraosseous bone that appears after trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henry |first1=D. |title=Myositis ossificans |url=http://www.bonetumor.org/unknown-tumor-soft-tissue/myositis-ossificans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second condition, ''myositis ossificans progressiva'' (also referred to as [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]]) is an inherited affliction, [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, in which the ossification can occur without injury, and typically grows in a predictable pattern. Although this disorder can be passed to offspring by those afflicted with [[Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva|FOP]], it is also classified as nonhereditary, as it is most often attributed to a spontaneous genetic mutation upon conception.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Most (i.e. 80%) ossifications arise in the thigh or arm, and are caused by a premature return to activity after an injury. Other sites include [[intercostal spaces]], [[erector spinae]], [[pectoralis muscles]], [[glutei]], and the [[chest]]. On planar x-ray, hazy densities are sometimes noted approximately one month after injury, while the denser opacities eventually seen may not be apparent until two months have passed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Pathophysiology ==
The exact mechanism of myositis ossificans is not clear. Inappropriate response of stem cells in the bone against the injury or inflammation causes inappropriate differentiation of [[fibroblast]]s into [[osteogenic]] cells. When a [[skeletal muscle]] is injured, inflammatory cytokines ([[Bone morphogenetic protein 2]], [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4]], and [[Transforming growth factor]]) are released. These cytokines stimulate the [[endothelial]] cells of the blood vessels to transform into [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s. These mesenchymal stem cells then differentiate into [[chondrocyte]]s, and [[osteoblast]]s, resulting in bone formation in soft tissues.&lt;ref name="Walczak 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walczak|first1=Brian E|last2=Johnson|first2=Christopher N|last3=Howe, B|first3=Matthew|title=Myositis Ossificans|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|date=October 2015|volume=23|issue=10|pages=612-622|doi=10.5435/JAAOS-D-14-00269|pmid=26320160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of myositis ossificans can be divided into three stages: early, intermediate, and mature. The early phase occurs in the first four weeks of injury with inflammatory phase of bone formation. This is followed by intermediate phase of bone formation (four to eight weeks following injury) where cacification started to occur and is visible on X-rays. During the maturation phase, mature bone started to form. As the maturation continues, the bone will consolidate in the coming months and subsequently bone regression occurs.&lt;ref name="Walczak 2015"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Sonographic diagnosis===
Calcification is typically depicted 2 weeks earlier by ultrasound (US) when compared to radiographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peetrons |first1=P. |title=Ultrasound of muscles |journal=European Radiology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=35–43 |year=2002 |pmid=11868072 |doi=10.1007/s00330-001-1164-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lesion develops in two distinct stages with different presentations at US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arend |first1=Carlos Frederico |work=Ultrasound of the Shoulder |publisher=Master Medical Books |year=2013 |title=Pectoralis Major Ultrasound: Myositis Ossificans |url=http://www.shoulderus.com/ultrasound-of-the-shoulder/pectoralis-major-ultrasound-myositis-ossificans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stage, termed immature, it  depicts a non-specific soft tissue mass that ranges from a hypoechoic area with an outer sheet-like hyperechoic peripheral rim to a highly echogenic area with variable shadowing. In the late stage, termed mature, myositis ossificans is depicted as an elongated calcific deposit that is aligned with the long-axis of the muscle, exhibits acoustic shadowing, and has no soft tissue mass associated. US may suggest the diagnosis at early stage, but imaging features need to evolve with successive maturation of the lesion and formation of the characteristic late stage changes before they become pathognomonic.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The differential diagnosis includes many tumoral and nontumoral pathologies. A main concern is to differentiate early myositis ossificans from malignant soft-tissue tumors, and the latter is suggested by a fast-growing process. If clinical or sonographic findings are dubious and extraosseous sarcoma is suspected, biopsy should be performed. At histology, detection of the typical zonal phenomenon is diagnostic of myositis ossificans, though microscopic findings may be misleading during the early stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph M. |last1=Mirra |first2=Piero |last2=Picci |first3=Richard H. |last3=Gold |chapter=Osseous soft tissue tumors |title=Bone tumors: clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlations |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger |year=1989 |pages=1549–86 |isbn=978-0-8121-1156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiologic  diagnosis===
The radiological features of myositis ossificans are ‘faint soft tissue calcification within 2–6 weeks, (may have well-defined
bony margins by 8 weeks) separated from periosteum by lucent zone and on CT, the characteristic feature is peripheral ossification’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crundwell |first1=N. |last2=O'Donnell |first2=P. |last3=Saifuddin |first3=A. |title=Non-neoplastic conditions presenting as soft-tissue tumours |journal=Clinical Radiology |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |year=2007 |pmid=17145259 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2006.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parikh |first1=J |last2=Hyare |first2=H |last3=Saifuddin |first3=A |title=The Imaging Features of Post-traumatic Myositis Ossificans, with Emphasis on MRI |journal=Clinical Radiology |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=1058–66 |year=2002 |pmid=12475528 |doi=10.1053/crad.2002.1120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gokkus |first1=K. |last2=Sagtas |first2=E. |last3=Suslu |first3=F.

== Management ==
Since myositis ossificians is more common in those with bleeding disorders, the formation of bone in soft tissue is thought to be associated with [[haematoma]] formation. As the calcifications will typically resolve after a period of time, non-surgical treatment is encouraged to minimize the unpleasant symptoms and maximize the function of the affected limb.&lt;ref name="Walczak 2015"/&gt;

Following a skeletal muscle injury, the affected limb should be immobilized with bed rest, ice therapy, compression, and elevation of the affected limb. Crutches can be used for ambulation while providing adequate rest for the affected limb and minimizing the haematoma formation. Ice therapy for 15 to 20 minutes every 30 to 60 minutes is useful to reduce the skeletal muscle blood flow by 50%. Aggressive limb physiotherapy is not recommended at this stage to prevent the worsening of symptoms. After 48 to 72 hours, range of motion exercise can be introduced as long as the range of motion is not painful. If the lesion becomes more mature, active range of motion and resistance strengthening exercises are useful in maintaining joint function.&lt;ref name="Walczak 2015"/&gt;

Surgical excision is reserved for those who failed the non-surgical treatment, those with intolerable pain, compression of the neurovascular structures, or limitation of the range of motion of the joint which affects the activities of daily living. Surgery is only performed after 6 to 18 months following injury because surgery does not alter the bone maturation process. If a surgery is performed too early, it may predispose to recurrence. However, the optimum timing for surgery and the rate of recurrence following early surgery is controversial because some studies have shown that early surgery does reduce the rate of recurrence.&lt;ref name="Walczak 2015"/&gt;

For those who had [[total hip replacement]] or [[total hip arthroplasty]], postoperative single low-dose radiation with 3 weeks of oral [[indomethacin]] regimen will be preventive  for [[heterotopic ossification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pakos |first1=Emilios E. |last2=Pitouli |first2=Evita J. |last3=Tsekeris |first3=Pericles G. |last4=Papathanasopoulou |first4=Vasiliki |last5=Stafilas |first5=Kosmas |last6=Xenakis |first6=Theodore H. |title=Prevention of heterotopic ossification in high-risk patients with total hip arthroplasty: the experience of a combined therapeutic protocol |journal=International Orthopaedics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=79–83 |year=2006 |pmid=16482442 |pmc=2532069 |doi=10.1007/s00264-005-0054-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knelles |first1=D |last2=Barthel |first2=T |last3=Karrer |first3=A |last4=Kraus |first4=U |last5=Eulert |first5=J |last6=Kölbl |first6=O |title=Prevention of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement.

'''[[Obesity]] in Greece''' is a growing health concern with health officials stating that it is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in [[Greece]]. 

== Extent ==
According to [[Forbes]], Greece ranks 16 on a 2007 list of fattiest countries with a percentage of 65.5% of its citizens with an unhealthy  weight.  This may be a surprise to most individuals because in the past Mediterranean countries like Greece were known to live a pretty healthy lifestyle.  The [[Mediterranean diet]] was developed based on the food patterns in these different countries, Greece being a main one.  In the past the people of Greece consumed a diet consisting mainly of fish, fruit, vegetable, and wine, limiting meats.  These countries also were fairly active which helps to keep them healthy.

Today’s European countries are moving away from this Mediterranean lifestyle and towards a more Western way of life.  Indulging on the fast foods and limited daily activity are to blame on for this increase in obesity in Greece {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}.  An article from the Associated Press states that obesity rates in some European countries are higher than that of the United States.  

Greece’s growing health concerns related to obesity are becoming an issue that was not evident in the past because of an increase in consumption of high fat, high calorie, fast foods and decreased levels of activity.  Obesity brings on health concerns such as [[diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].  Greece is adopting a western style of eating and straying away from the active lifestyles they once possessed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Proarrhythmia''' is a new or more frequent occurrence of pre-existing [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, paradoxically precipitated by antiarrhythmic therapy, which means it is a [[Adverse effect|side effect]] associated with the administration of some existing [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic drugs]], as well as drugs for other indications.  In other words, it is a tendency of antiarrhythmic drugs to facilitate emergence of new arrhythmias.

==Types of proarrhythmia==
According to the [[Vaughan Williams classification]] (VW) of [[antiarrhythmic]] drugs, there are 3 main types of Proarrhythmia during treatment with various antiarrhythmic drugs for [[Atrial Fibrillation]] or [[Atrial flutter]]:

===Ventricular proarrhythmia===
*[[Torsades de pointes]] (VW type IA and type III drugs)
*Sustained [[monomorphic ventricular tachycardia]] (usually VW type IC drugs)
*Sustained [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]]/[[ventricular fibrillation]] without long QT (VW types IA, IC, and III drugs)

===Atrial proarrhythmia===
*Conversion of atrial fribrillation to flutter (usually VW type IC drugs or amiodarone).  May be a desired effect.
*Increase of [[defibrillation threshold]] (a potential problem with VW type IC drugs)
*Provocation of recurrence (probably VW types IA, IC and III drugs).  It is rare.

===Abnormalities of conduction or impulse formation===
*[[Sinus node]] dysfunction, [[atrioventricular block]] (almost all drugs)
*Accelerate conduction over accessory pathway ([[digoxin]], intravenous [[verapamil]], or [[diltiazem]])
*Acceleration of [[ventricular rate]] during atrial fibrillation (VW type IA and type IC drugs).

==Increased risk==
*Presence of structural [[heart disease]], especially LV systolic dysfunction. 
*Class IC agents. 
*Increased age. 
*Females.

==Clinical pointers==
===Class IA drugs=== 
*Dose independent, occurring at normal levels. 
*Follow QT interval, keep ms.  
===Class IC drugs=== 
*May be provoked by increased heart rate. 
*Exercise stress tests after loading. 
===Class III drugs=== 
*Dose dependent. 
*Follow bradycardia, prolonged QT closely.

'''Retinal birefringence scanning''' ('''RBS''') is a method for detection the central fixation of the eye. The method can be used in [[pediatric ophthalmology]] for [[screening (medicine)|screening]] purposes. By simultaneously measuring the central fixation of both eyes, small- and large-angle [[strabismus]] can be detected. The method is non-invasive and requires little cooperation by the patient, so that it can be used for detecting strabismus in young children. The method provides a reliable detection of strabismus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reed M. Jost|author2=Joost Felius|author3=Eileen E. Birch|title=High sensitivity of binocular retinal birefringence screening for anisometropic amblyopia without strabismus|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (JAAPOS)|volume=18|number=4|pages=e5–e6|date=August 2014|url=http://www.jaapos.org/article/S1091-8531%2814%2900236-5/abstract|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2014.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used for detecting certain kinds of [[amblyopia]].

Retinal birefringence scanning uses the [[human eye]]'s [[birefringence|birefringent]] properties to identify the position of the [[fovea centralis|fovea]] and the direction of [[gaze]], and thereby to measure any binocular misalignment.

== Principle ==
Birefringent material has a [[refractive index]] that depends on the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization state]] and propagation direction of [[light]].&lt;ref name="pmid24779618"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gramatikov BI |title=Modern technologies for retinal scanning and imaging: an introduction for the biomedical engineer |journal=BioMedical Engineering OnLine |volume=13 |issue= |pages=52 |year=2014 |pmid=24779618 |pmc=4022984 |doi=10.1186/1475-925X-13-52 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/lightandcolor/birefringence.html |title=Optical Birefringence|website=Olympus Microscopy Resource Center|publisher=Olympus America Inc.|accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main contribution to the birefringence of the eye stems from the Henle fibers. These fibers (named after [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]]) are photoreceptor axons that are arranged in a radially symmetric pattern, extending outward from the [[fovea centralis|fovea]], which is the most sensitive part of the retina. When polarized light strikes the fovea, the layer of Henle fibers produces a characteristic pattern, and the strength and contrast of this pattern as well as the orientation of its bright parts depend on the polarization of the light that reaches the retina.&lt;ref name="pmid23668264"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gramatikov B |title=Detecting fixation on a target using time-frequency distributions of a retinal birefringence scanning signal |journal=BioMedical Engineering OnLine |volume=12 |issue= |pages=41 |year=2013 |pmid=23668264 |pmc=3661397 |doi=10.1186/1475-925X-12-41 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of this pattern allows the position of the fovea and the direction of gaze to be determined.

Binocular retinal birefringence has been used for diagnosing strabismus (including micro-strabismus) in young children, and has also been proposed for diagnosing amblyopia by detecting strabismus and by detecting a reduced fixation accuracy.&lt;ref name="pmid21642624"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loudon SE, Rook CA, Nassif DS, Piskun NV, Hunter DG |title=Rapid, high-accuracy detection of strabismus and amblyopia using the pediatric vision scanner |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=5043–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21642624 |doi=10.1167/iovs.11-7503 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
However, also birefringent properties of the [[cornea]] and the retinal [[nerve fiber layer]] (RNFL) are sources of birefringence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=GDx-MM: An Imaging Mueller Matrix Retinal Polarimeter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6Bd9xH9B40C&amp;pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-27120-8|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corneal birefringence varies widely from one individual to another, as well as from one location to another for the same individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues in Biomedical Engineering Research and Application: 2013 Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idTH0WJuv78C&amp;pg=PA297|date=1 May 2013|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|isbn=978-1-4901-0871-1|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can thus confound measurements.

The '''Royal Tobacco Factory''' ({{lang-es|Real Fábrica de Tabacos}}) is an 18th-century stone building in [[Seville]], southern [[Spain]]. Since the 1950s it has been the seat of the [[Rector (academia)#Spain|rectorate]] of the [[University of Seville]]. Prior to that, it was, as its name indicates, a [[tobacco]] factory: the most prominent such institution in Europe, and a lineal descendant of Europe's first tobacco factory, which was located nearby. It is one of the most notable and splendid examples of industrial architecture from the era of Spain's [[Antiguo Régimen]].&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz"&gt;Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/fabricatabaco/vision_general.htm La Real Fábrica de Tabacos de Sevilla: Vision histórica general].

== Antecedents ==
The Spanish encountered the tobacco plant almost immediately upon their first arrival in [[the Americas]] in 1492.&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005],  p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Seville, home to the [[Casa de Contratación]] (The House of Trade),&lt;ref name=monopolio&gt;Maria Luisa Laviana Cuetos, [http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/histesp/contextos/6703.htm El monopolio comercial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403092956/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/histesp/contextos/6703.htm |date=2008-04-03 }}, ArteHistoria, 1995–1997. Access date 2010-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; held a monopoly on commerce with the Americas.&lt;ref name=monopolio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005] pp. 15, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 16th century the first tobacco manufacturers established themselves in Seville, the first anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 19 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, they were dispersed through the city, but were eventually concentrated in one place—facing the [[Church of Saint Peter (Seville)|Church of Saint Peter]]—for sanitary reasons and to facilitate state control of the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005] p. 23 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, the royal government decided to build the present large building immediately outside the city walls.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Fábrica de Tabacos (1728-1771).jpg|left|thumb|Main courtyard]]
This 18th-century industrial building was, at the time it was built the second largest building in Spain, second only to the royal residence [[El Escorial]]. It remains one of the largest and most architecturally distinguished industrial buildings ever built in that country, and one of the oldest such buildings to survive.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

The factory was built just outside the [[Puerta de Jerez]] (a gate in the city walls), in the land known as ''de las calaveras'' ("of the skulls") because it had been the site of an [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] burial ground. Construction began in 1728, and proceeded by fits and starts over the next 30 years. The architects of the building were military engineers from Spain and the [[Low Countries]], most notably:&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;
* [[Ignacio Sala]], who drew up the initial proposal in 1725.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt; All of Ignacio Sala's plan that was executed was the building of a foundation and the canalization of the Tagarete,&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; a stream that ran roughly along the route of the present-day Calle de San Fernando.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/fabricatabaco/tagarete_fabrica.htm El Tagarete y la fábrica de tabaco de Sevilla]. Access date 2010-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diego Bordick Deverez]] replaced Sala and was in charge of the project from 1731 to 1750. He developed a new plan to accommodate larger machinery than was originally contemplated. In actuality, construction proceeded only in two years of this period, from 1733 to 1735.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;
* The [[Flanders|Flemish]] engineer [[Sebastián Van der Borcht]] was put in charge beginning in 1750, and can be considered the primary author of the factory as it was built.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt; He collaborated with local architects and builders Vicente Catalán Bengochea,&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/fabricatabaco/vicente_bengoechea.htm Vicente Catalán Bengoechea, arquitecto del siglo XVIII].

==Operation==
[[File:Patio del Reloj.jpg|thumb|left|Clock's courtyard]]
The factory began production in 1758;&lt;ref&gt;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; the first tobacco auctions there (which were the first in Spain) took place in 1763. At that point the factory was employing a thousand men, two hundred horses, and 170 "mills" ({{lang-es|molinos}}: the devices used to turn the tobacco into [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], known in Spanish as ''polvo'' or ''rapé''); tobacco came both from [[Virginia]] and from the Spanish colonies in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ángel Vázquez Medel, ''Sevilla y su provincia'', Editorial Gever, S.A. {{ISBN|84-88566-01-8}}, which recounts the account of the French traveler [[Esteban de Silhuette]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inscription on two of the pillars of the drawbridge on the west side, the building was finished in 1770.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

The production of snuff was heavy work: enormous sheaves of tobacco were hauled around manually, and horses turned the grinding mills. For centuries, Seville remained Spain's only manufacturer of snuff. The rising popularity of cigars resulted in part of the factory being adapted for that purpose; cigars were also made in several other Spanish cities: [[Cádiz]], [[Alicante]], [[La Coruña]], and [[Madrid]]. Long after the manufacture of cigars elsewhere in Spain (and in [[Cuba]]) had become women's work, the workforce in Seville remained entirely male. By the beginning of the 19th century, 700 men were employed in the factory to make cigars, and another thousand to make snuff.&lt;ref name=cigarreras&gt;Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/fabricatabaco/cigarreras_sevilla.htm Operarios y cigarreras en la Real Fábrica de Tabacos de Sevilla]. Access date 2010-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, however, Seville's cigars developed a poor reputation. There were frequent problems with labor discipline, and quality was lower than in the factories where women made cigars; furthermore, men received better wages than women, so these inferior cigars were more expensive than those produced elsewhere. The factory became less profitable. Matters were brought to a head during the [[Peninsular War]]. The cigar-making portion of the factory closed in 1811. When it reopened in 1813, it was with a female workforce, then (from 1816) a larger, mixed workforce, and finally (after 1829) an entirely female workforce again, some 6,000 of them at the peak in the 1880s before numbers began to decrease because of mechanization.&lt;ref name=cigarreras /&gt;

Labor unrest was less common among the women than it had been among the men, though by no means was it unknown. There were revolts or strikes in 1838, 1842, and 1885, but none of them were sustained for more than a few days. With mechanization, the labor force reduced to 3,332 in 1906, about 2,000 in 1920, and by the 1940s only about 1,100.&lt;ref name=cigarreras /&gt; The title character of [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]'' is a ''cigarrera'' at the Royal Tobacco Factory.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Burgos, [http://www.elmundo.es/2003/07/28/opinion/1447545.html Carmen, opera bufa], ''El Mundo'' (Madrid), 2003-07-28, Number 4,982.

In his autobiography, published in 1915, [[Hiram Maxim]] wrote of a visit he made to the factory:

:There was an immense number of young women making cigars and cigarettes, but what attracted my attention most of all was the number of cradles and baskets with babies; about a third of the young women seemed to have a baby to take care of while they were working.&lt;ref&gt;Maxim, Hiram S., ''My Life'', Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd., London, 1915, pages 235-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Seville==

Accessed online 2010-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and to use the historic building as the headquarters of the University of Seville.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt; The transformation of the building was a major undertaking, performed between 1954 and 1956 according to the plans of architects [[Alberto Balbontín de Orta]], Delgado Roig, and Toro Buiza.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz-70"&gt;Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, [http://personal.us.es/alporu/historia/hist3_los70.htm La universidad de los 70].

==Physical description==
[[File:Fábrica de Tabacos de Sevilla.jpg|thumb|left|Lateral view of the building with the pit]]
Although the interior has been much altered, especially during the adaptation in the 1950s for use by the University of Seville, the Royal Tobacco Factory is a remarkable example of 18th-century industrial architecture. It is one of the largest and best industrial buildings in Spain, and one of the oldest buildings of its type in Europe. The building covers a roughly rectangular area of 185 by 147 metres (610 by 480 feet), with slight protrusions at the corners. The only building in Spain that covers a larger surface area is the monastery-palace of [[El Escorial]], which is 207 by 162 metres (680 by 530 feet).&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

[[Renaissance architecture]] provides the main points of reference, with [[Herrerian]] influences in its floor plan, courtyards, and the details of the façades. There are also motifs reminiscent of architects [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Palladio]]. The stone façades are modulated by pilasters on pedestals.&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

Plans originally called for building the walls [[pilaster]]s, [[arch]]es and other elements out of the yellow-brown [[limestone]] from Martelilla (near [[Jerez de la Frontera]]), but it proved too fragile and too often defective. In the end, the stone used for the building came from [[Morón de la Frontera]].&lt;ref name="Pozo Ruiz" /&gt;

There are paintings inside the Tobacco Factory recalling the women cigar makers who worked there. Outstanding among these is the painting by [[Gonzalo Bilbao]], whose most well known depictions of customs and manners are in the Seville Museum of Fine Arts, including other portrayals of women cigar makers. A ditch was dug around the factory with several sentry boxes, indicating a defensive use. Today it is the headquarters of Seville University.

==The 1950s factory==
The replacement factory built in the 1950s remained part of Spain's national tobacco monopoly [[Tabacalera]] until that was merged into [[Altadis]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=Fuchs /&gt; In 2004, Altadis announced plans to shutter the plant in 2007, bringing to an end Seville's long tradition of making tobacco products.&lt;ref name=Fuchs /&gt; The factory's last day of operation was 31 December 2007.&lt;ref name=Jimenez /&gt; In June 2009, plans were announced to turn over that facility, as well, to the University of Seville.&lt;ref name=Jimenez /&gt;

'''SOS Médecins''' is the official [[medicine|medical emergency service]] of [[France]] which sends doctors directly to a residence instead of sending an ambulance ([[house call]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sosmedecins-france.fr/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[SiCKO]], [[Michael Moore]]&lt;/ref&gt; This works seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, and participates with close liaison with the public emergency services ([[Emergency medical services in France|ambulance, fire brigade, hospital]]), and continuity of care in many urban centers and its periphery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosmedecins.fr/index.php/visites/a-propos-des-visites-medicales Visites medicales a domicile 24 H SUR 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its operational concept has been copied in other countries, such as in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosmedecins.be/ SOS Bruxelles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Doctors of [[London]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Rome]] came to copy the mode of operation of the association. In [[Dakar]] (Senegal), [[Athens]] (Greece), [[Brussels]] (Belgium), [[Geneva]] (Switzerland), [[Beirut]] (SOS Doctors Of Lebanon), SOS Médecins participated in the inauguration of home care private medical services teams.

'''Tardive''' refers to something that is late in appearing. For example, the characteristic symptom of a [[disease]], such as a [[lesion]], may occur a long period after exposure. A tardive [[symptom]] could be contrasted with an [[acute symptom]], which appears soon after injury or exposure to disease, although it may also mean a symptom that is gone quickly. On the other hand, [[chronic condition]]s are not late-appearing, they are long-lasting.

In the medical field, tardive is most commonly associated with tardive neurological disorders, such as [[tardive dyskinesia]], tardive [[dystonia]], [[tardive psychosis]] and tardive [[akathisia]]. These disorders arise from the long-term usage of anti-psychotic medication. In addition, there is [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]], also called tardive cyanosis. However, it is unrelated to the other disorders.

'''''Warrendale''''' is a 1967 [[documentary film]] by [[Canadians|Canadian]] filmmaker [[Allan King]]. It was originally produced for broadcast on [[CBC Television]], but was never shown due to King's refusal to edit out the copious profanity in the footage.

The film is a [[cinéma vérité]] look at the lives of emotionally disturbed children housed in a facility named Warrendale, in [[Rexdale]], at the time, a [[Toronto]] suburb. The facility was considered innovative, and met with approval when it first opened in December 1965. But almost a year after it opened, it became the centre of several controversies in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], and was eventually closed.&lt;ref name=Historicist&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Wencer | first1 = David | title = Historicist: Warrendale, a Mental Health Treatment Centre for Children | url = http://torontoist.com/2013/03/historicist-warrendale-a-mental-health-treatment-centre-for-children/ | accessdate = 12 March 2015 | work = Torontoist | date = 2013-03-30 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6WyyTuY1S?url=http://torontoist.com/2013/03/historicist-warrendale-a-mental-health-treatment-centre-for-children/ | archivedate = 2015-03-12 | deadurl = no | location = Toronto | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder John Brown was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislature from 1967 to 1971.
 
''Warrendale'' won awards at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and French director [[Jean Renoir]] declared King a great artist.

In 2002, ''Warrendale'' was honoured as a "MasterWork" by the [[Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://avtrust.ca/masterworks/2002/en_film_3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--''This article was last comprehensively updated in May 2010, with a partial update in July 2014.''--&gt;

'''Water supply and sanitation in Morocco''' is provided by a wide array of utilities. They range from private companies in the largest city, [[Casablanca]], the capital, [[Rabat]], and two other cities, to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company (ONEE). The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.

There have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighborhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the [[National Human Development Initiative]], under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.

== Water resources ==

=== Conventional water resources ===

Morocco has about 22 billion cubic meter of conventional renewable water resources per year equivalent to 730 cubic meter/capita/year. Before taking into account drought years of the 1990s and 2000s total renewable water resources were estimated to be much higher at around 29 billion cubic meters &lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc:Débat National sur l'Eau.

Retrieved October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only up to 20 billion cubic meter per year can be economically captured (''ressources mobilisables''), including 16 billion m3 of surface water and 4 billion m3 of groundwater. Morocco has about 100 dams of various sizes with a total storage capacity of 15 billion cubic meter. It was estimated that in 2004 about 13.5 billion m3 were withdrawn, or about 67% of available resources. 83% of withdrawals were for agriculture and 17% for municipal and industrial uses.&lt;ref name="Bzioui"&gt;[http://www.pnud.org.ma/pdf/Rappt_national_1%20juin_fr.pdf Mokhtar Bzioui, UN Water Africa:Rapport National 2004 sur les ressources en eau du Maroc], November 2004, p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; However, water resources are not divided equally in space and time, with most of the water resources available in the North and rainfall limited to the winter. In addition, the quality of water resources is degraded through pollution, in particular in the Sebou basin.
[[Image:Village atlas.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Snowpack in the [[Atlas Mountains]], where most major rivers in Morocco have their source, provides important storage for water resources
]]Morocco is divided in seven major river basins and a number of smaller basins. The seven major basins from North to South are the [[Loukkos River]], the [[Moulouya]] River, the [[Sebou River]], the [[Bou Regreg]] River, the [[Oum Er-Rbia River]], the [[Tensift River|Tensift]] River and the [[Souss-Massa basin]]. Except for the Loukkos River, all these rivers originate in the [[Atlas Mountains]].There are few [[inter-basin transfer]]s in Morocco, the most important ones being the Rocade canal from the Oum Er-Rbia basin to the Tensift basin near Marrakesh, a transfer from near the mouth of the Oum er-Rbia to Casablanca and a transfer from the Bouregreg River also to Casablanca. There are tentative plans for a large north-south water transfer project with an average conveyance capacity of around 2.74 million cubic meter/day (0.75 billion m3/year) over 500–600&amp;nbsp;km from the Sebou River basin to the water-stressed Tensift basin.&lt;ref name="Desal"&gt;[[Global Water Intelligence]]:[http://www.globalwaterintel.com/news/2009/43/morocco-course-deliver-boost-desalination-sector.html Morocco to deliver boost to desalination sector]. Retrieved October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water use for municipal and industrial uses was about 2.28 billion m3 in 2003, of which 0.7 billion m3 (31%) were from groundwater and 1.58 billion m3 (69%) from surface water.&lt;ref name="Bzioui"/&gt; Groundwater resources are overexploited in parts of the country, in particular in the Sous-Massa area in the South where irrigation is the predominant water user.

=== Wastewater treatment and reuse ===

So far there is limited planned reuse of [[reclaimed water]] in Morocco, given that only 21% of the collected wastewater undergoes any treatment.&lt;ref name="eajournals.org"&gt;http://www.eajournals.org/wp-content/uploads/Review-of-Wastewater-Treatment-and-Reuse-in-the-Morocco-Aspects-and-Perspectives.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 there were more than 100 wastewater treatment plants in Morocco, mostly serving small and medium-sized towns located in the interior or the country. The first wastewater treatment plants in Morocco were built by small municipalities using a wide range of technologies. Because of the limited financial and technical capacities of those municipalities practically all of these 28 plants ceased functioning shortly after they were completed. This triggered a decision in 2000 to gradually transfer the responsibility for sanitation in small and medium-sized towns to the national utility ONEP.&lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc/Banque mondiale/KfW:Revue Stratégique du Programme National d'Assainissement, Mai 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the latter has built or was in the process of building 43 plants, mostly using the [[stabilization pond]] technology, but also one [[activated sludge]] plant and a few [[trickling filter]] plants. The track record of operating these plants is better than for the plants operated by municipalities, partly because the predominant technology - stabilization ponds - does not require electricity. Its lower operating costs make it less vulnerable to disruptions in the case of strained operating budgets. In larger cities, only very few municipal utilities (Régies) operate wastewater treatment plants. Their track record at operating them is mixed: A plant operated by the Agadir utility works well, while plants operated by the utilities of Beni Mellal and Nador do not function. These plants use the activated sludge technology which requires electricity. The Marakkech utility was constructing a large plant in 2009, and the Fes utility was in the process of bidding for a plant. This process experienced a setback when the French development agency AFD and the European Investment Bank withdrew their financing for the plant, citing non-respect of tender procedures as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwaterintel.com/home/ Global Water Intelligence]:[http://www.globalwaterintel.com/news/2009/51/afd-departure-raises-eyebrows-fes.html AFD departure raises eyebrows at Fes], 16 December 2009. Retrieved 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the overall water use in Morocco, reclaimed water can only provide a fraction of the country's increasing water needs. Furthermore, there is no regulatory framework for water reuse and no established system to recover the costs for reclaimed water from users. The country's largest reuse project is currently under construction in Marrakech, where reclaimed water from a 90,000 m3/day plant will be reused primarily to irrigate golf courses. The tertiary treatment and the network to distribute the reclaimed water will be financed by private investors. Redal, the utility serving Rabat, was carrying out a study in 2009 to assess the feasibility of wastewater reuse to irrigate green spaces in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:[http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/1/general/moroccan-capital-eyes-greater-reuse-capacity.html Moroccan capital eyes greater reuse capacity], January 2009. Retrieved December 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this there have been a few scattered small-scale pilot reuse projects since the 1980s, some of which have been abandoned. Among the sustainable projects is a project to irrigate golf courses in Ben Slimane that has been operating since 1997 with a capacity of 5,600 cubic meter/day.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank and KfW:Revue stratégique du Porgamme National d'Assainissement, 2008, p. 4, quoting a study by Xanthoulis, Soudi and Khalayoune of 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a large reuse project was planned in Agadir to irrigate a golf course and municipal gardens with 50,000 cubic meters/day. In 2009 there were also two projects for direct, planned reuse in agriculture in Oujda and Beni Mellal. These projects are financed by the National Environmental Fund and would add a tertia2bb03c3e1; centralauth_Session=1reatment plants. In 2009 the water department of the State Secretariat for Water and Environment carried out a national study for water reuse.

=== Desalination ===
Morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs for drinking, industry and mining. The ''Secrétariat d'État chargé de l'Eau et de l'Environnement'' has commissioned a study on desalination due to be completed by the end of 2009. Among others, the study foresees a very large new desalination plant in the Casablanca region with a capacity of around 685,000 m3/day (250 million m3/year), or more than 10% of total municipal water use in Morocco.&lt;ref name="Desal"/&gt;

In May 2014 the national utility ONEE signed a [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] contract for a 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day [[reverse osmosis]] seawater desalination plant in [[Agadir]] with a consortium between the Spanish firm [[Abengoa]] Water and the investment fund InfraMaroc. The project had been under preparation for seven years. The payment is in local currency and the Abengoa-led consortium was the only one that submitted a bid for the project that other firms considered to be too risky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agadir paves way for PPP in Moroccan desal|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/15/7/general/agadir-paves-way-ppp-moroccan-desal.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence, July 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==

In 2011 82% of the population of Morocco had access to an [[improved water source]]. Specifically, this means that 59% of Moroccans had access to piped water in their house or in the yard of their house.&lt;ref name="JMP 2013"/&gt; As of 2004, for 11% the main source of water supply was a public stand pipe, for 5.6% it was a protected well. 1.5% of Moroccans, essentially in rural areas, relied on [[rainwater harvesting]] as their principal water source. 7% collected water from springs. Half of these springs,  supplying 3.5% of the population, were estimated to be protected. All the above sources are considered as [[improved water source]]s by the [[WHO]], thus bringing the total to 82%.&lt;ref name="JMP Water"&gt;WHO/UNICEF:Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation:[http://documents.wssinfo.org/download?id_document=1083 Coverage Estimates for Improved Drinking Water]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}, 2008, quoting a 2003-04 survey on population and family health (''Enquête sur la Population et la Santé Familiale'') of the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM)&lt;/ref&gt;

18% of the population did not have access to an improved water source. This share is split up as follows: 1%, both in urban and rural areas, used water from tankers as their main water source. 7% collected water from unprotected public wells and 4% from unprotected private wells inside their home or yard. 2.5% took their water directly from rivers and open reservoirs. Another 3.5% were estimated to use an unprotected spring as their main source of water supply, so that in total 18% of the population lacked access to an improved water source.&lt;ref name="JMP Water"/&gt;

Concerning sanitation, 83% of the urban population and 52% of the rural population had access to an [[improved sanitation|improved sanitation facility]] in 2011. 14% of the urban population used shared latrines, which do not count as improved sanitation. 6% of the rural population used shared latrines, and 38% were estimated to defecate in the open.&lt;ref name="JMP 2013"/&gt; It is the poorest who have no access to sanitation: A 2004 World Bank study noted that "Sewerage service is completely lacking in the peri-urban areas of secondary urban centers.

Only about 21 percent of collected sewage is being treated before being discharged into the environment.&lt;ref name="eajournals.org"/&gt;

== History and recent developments ==

=== Private service provision during the protectorate ===

During the [[French protectorate of Morocco|French Protectorate]], beginning in 1912, water supply and sanitation in many large cities in Morocco were managed under a concession to the private company ''Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'electricité'' (SMD). SMD, a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux, provided services in Casablanca, Rabat, Salé, Tangiers and Meknes. Since 1950 SMD also managed a vital bulk water transfer project: The supply of water from the Oum er-Rbia river to Casablanca. Bulk water supply to other cities that were not able to supply themselves from local water sources was a responsibility of a public company called ''Régie d'exploitation industrielle du protectorat'' (REIP) created in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Miras"&gt;Claude de Miras and Xavier Godard:[http://www.cairn.info/revue-mediterranee-2006-1-p-113.htm Les firmes concessionnaires de service public au Maroc:eau potable, assainissement et transport collectifs], in:Méditerrannée, No. 106 (2006), p. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations for two important elements of today's water and sanitation sector - private concessions for water distribution in large cities and a national public company for bulk water supply - were thus already laid during the protectorate.

=== Nationalization after independence ===

After independence in 1956 water distribution systems were nationalized and handed over to public companies in the major cities, the so-called ''Régies''. The bulk water supply system from the [[Oum Er-Rbia River]] to Casablanca remained in the hands of the private concessionnaire SMD.&lt;ref name="Miras"/&gt; Bulk water supply in the rest of the country was entrusted to a new national water company created in 1972, the ''Office National de l'Eau Potable'' (ONEP).&lt;ref&gt;Office National de l'Eau Potable:[http://www.onep.org.ma/ Présentation ONEP]. Retrieved October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New water resources management law and rural water program (1995) ===

In 1995 a new, comprehensive '''Water Law''' (Loi 10-95) was passed. Aimed at changing the emphasis of water resources management from supply expansion to demand management it was considered a "paradigm shift" at the time. It foresees measures to promote water use efficiency, better allocation of water resources and the protection of water quality through the application of the [[user pays]] principle and the [[Polluter pays principle]]. The law also provided the legal basis for the establishment of river basin agencies for integrated water resources management, inspired by examples of such agencies in France and Spain, among other countries. In 1996 the Oum Er-Rbia agency was established as the first basin agency in Morocco. In 2000 agencies in the country's other six major basins were created. However, the basin agencies took many years and they still remain relatively weak entities. More than a decade after having been passed the law it is still not fully implemented.

Also in 1995, the government launched an ambitious '''Rural Water Supply Program''' (''Programme d'approvisionnement groupé en eau potable des populations rurales'' - PAGER) to face the challenge of very low access to potable water in rural areas. The program is carried out by ONEP, whose responsibility was extended from urban to rural areas through the program (see also below under innovative approaches and international good practice).

=== Water privatization in the late 1990s ===

For details see [[Water privatization in Morocco]]

Since the ''Régie'' serving Casablanca had a poor service record the government decided in the mid-1990s to bring in a private company to manage the city's water, sewerage and power networks. A consortium called Lydec, led by [[Lyonnaise des Eaux]] (now SUEZ), was awarded the 30-year concession without a competitive tender in 1997. The Casablanca concession paved the way for subsequent concessions in [[Rabat]], [[Tangiers]] and [[Tetouan]]. While the Rabat concession was awarded directly to Vivendi in 1998, the concessions in Tangiers and Tetouan were awarded in 2002 after competitive bidding to [[Amendis]], a subsidiary of Vivendi.

In 2000 the initial 50-year concession of SMD, a subsidiary of Lyonnaise, for bulk water supply to Casablanca was renewed.&lt;ref name="Miras"/&gt;

=== National Sanitation Program ===

In 2000 the ONEP Law was amended to include sanitation (sewerage and wastewater treatment) in ONEP's mandate. At the same time wastewater tariffs (''redevance d'assainissement'') were first introduced, albeit at a very low level of less than 1 Dirham/m3, and a modest subsidy program was set up. In 2005 this policy was reinforced by the more ambitious National Sanitation Program (''Programme National d'Assainissement'' - PNA).

=== Creation of ONEE through the merger ONEP and ONE ===
During a cabinet reshuffle after elections in 2007 the Ministry of Environment and Water on the one hand, and the Ministry of Energy and Mining on the other hand, were merged into a single "Super Ministry". Within the Ministry a State Secretary remains in charge of water and environment. The Ministry of Environment and Water had been created in 2002, grouping together responsibilities that were previously scattered over several Ministries.

In 2009 the Cabinet approved a bill (''Loi 40 09'') that foresees a strategic alliance (''regroupement'') between ONEP and the national electric utility ONE. The objective is to extend economies of scale in billing and maintenance, which are already achieved in the concessions and the ''Regies'' in the larger cities, to other areas of the country. The bill is inspired by reform proposals that were put forward in various studies, including one by the management consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] carried out for the Ministry of Interior in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;La Vie Eco:[http://www.lavieeco.com/economie/14582-lydec-amendis-redal%E2%80%A6-le-modele-multiservice-duplique-dans-toutes-les-regions-du-royaume.html Lydec, Amendis, Rédal…, le modèle multiservice dupliqué dans toutes les régions du Royaume], September 21, 2009. Retrieved October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 the bill was approved by Parliament and the new entity, the ''Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable'' (ONEE), was created. The former ONEP became its "water branch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'ONE et l'ONEP fusionnent sous la bannière de l'ONEE|url=http://www.labass.net/1520-lone-et-lonep-fusionnent-sous-la-banniere-de-l%E2%80%99onee.html|publisher=Labass.net|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International good practice and innovative approaches ==

Among the various activities in water and sanitation in Morocco initiated over the past two decades, the rural water and sanitation program PAGER has been recognized as international good practice by the United Nations. In addition, an innovative [[output-based aid]] project to expand access to water and sanitation has been initiated in 2007.

=== The rural water supply program PAGER ===
In 2004 the national rural water supply program PAGER received the [[United Nations Public Service Awards|United Nations Public Service Award]] in the category improvement of public service results. The project relies on two basic principles: the use of simple technologies and the participation of beneficiaries in all stages of the project from the needs assessment to design, implementation and evaluation. The US$1bn program initiated in 1995 aims to reach 12 million people until 2010. The program has relieved women and children from the burden of carrying water.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations:[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/6071058/UNITED-NATIONS-PUBLIC-SERVICE-AWARDS-CEREMONY-AND-AD-HOC UN Public Service Award Ceremony, Report of the Second Award Ceremony, 23 June 2004, New York]. Retrieved October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 World Bank evaluation showed that school enrollment in beneficiary communities increased by 16%.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelbikr Zahoud, Secretary of State for Water:[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan017151.pdf Presentation of PAGER at the UN], 2004, Slide 18. Retrieved October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official data and reports by the Moroccan media, PAGER increased access to water in rural areas from 14% in 1995 to 61% in 2004 and 77% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Aujourd'hui le Maroc:[http://www.aujourdhui.ma/entreprise-details40053.html Pager : de l’eau potable pour tous].

According to the same survey data access to an [[improved water source]] in rural areas remained constant between 1995 and 2004 at 58%.&lt;ref name="JMP Water"/&gt; It remains unclear how the survey data and the data of PAGER can be reconciled.

=== Output-Based Aid to expand access to water and sanitation ===

In 2007, the private concessionaires in Casablanca, Tangiers and Tetouan, as well as the public water utility of Meknes began to implement water supply and sanitation pilot projects on the basis of an innovative [[output-based aid]] approach. The objective is to extend water and sewer connections to 11.300 households in poor, unzoned, periurban neighbourhoods. The pilot projects are part of the [[National Human Development Initiative]] and are funded through a US$7 million grant by the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) administered by the World Bank. It is the first time that GPOBA, which promotes primarily the private sector, provided grants to a public water operator. The average [[subsidy]] level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams that go to market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process certifies that the households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/water-in-the-arab-world-ch17.pdf Subsidies for the Poor: An Innovative Output-Based Aid Approach Providing Basic Services to Poor Periurban Neighborhoods in Morocco] Xavier Chauvot de Beauchêne and Pier Mantovani, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoba.org/gpoba/node/213 The Global Partnership on Output-based Aid - Further detailed information on the OBA project in Morocco]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sector responsibilities ==

The key actors at the policy level in the sector are the Ministry of Energy, Mining, Water and Environment in charge of water resources management and the Ministry of Interior in charge of water supply and sanitation. At the level of service provision, key actors are the national electric and water utility ONEE, 3 private operators and 13 municipally owned utilities. The country's largest city, [[Casablanca]], is served by the private operator Lydec. In addition to the above institutions, seven basin agencies are in charge of water resources management. These institutions are, however, still relatively weak.

Overall, the sector is characterized by a complex and fragmented institutional framework, which - according to a 2004 World Bank report - "has hindered the formulation of a comprehensive sector-wide vision and the establishment of coherent policy objectives".&lt;ref name="REDI4"&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf Kingdom of Morocco.

=== Policy and regulation ===

The highest political authority in the Moroccan water sector rests with the Higher Council for Water and Climate (''Conseil Supérieur de l'Eau et du Climat'') under the Prime Minister and the Honorary Presidency of the King. It was created in 1996, replacing an earlier Higher Council created in 1981. It includes representatives of all the Ministries involved in water, representatives of regional governments and water user associations, as well as academics, professional associations and trade associations. Although the council is supposed to meet once a year as per its founding decree, it last met in 2001. Its last previous meeting was held in 1994. According to the same decree the secretariat function for the Council is assured by the Ministry of Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;Secrétariat d'État chargé de l'Eau:[http://www.water.gov.ma/04textes-juridiques/dec_cons.htm DECRET N° 2-96-158 DU 8 rejeb 1417 (20 novembre 1996) RELATIF A LA COMPOSITION ET AU FONCTIONNEMENT DU CONSEIL SUPERIEUR DE L'EAU ET DU CLIMAT]. Retrieved October 21, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123063143/http://www.water.gov.ma/04textes-juridiques/dec_cons.htm |date=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all water-related functions were moved from the Ministry of Public Works to the newly created Ministry of Water and Environment in 2002.

Within the government of Morocco responsibilities for water supply and sanitation are shared by various Ministries. The Ministry of Energy, Mining, Water and Environment (''Ministère de l'Energie, des mines, de l'eau et de l'environnement'') is in charge of water resources management and bulk water supply, while the Ministry of Interior is in charge of supervising water distribution and sanitation carried out by municipal utilities. Within the Ministry of Interior the ''Direction de l'eau et de l'assainissement'' (DEA) assists local governments with water and sanitation issues, and plays an active role in planning, implementing, and supporting the operations of basic water and sewerage infrastructure. The Directorate of Public Utilities and Concessions (DRSC), also in the Ministry of the Interior, monitors the performance of ''Régies'' and concessions

Certain sector responsibilities are within the realm of other Ministries. The Ministry of Public Health (Ministère de la santé publique, MSP) is the main water quality regulator in the sector, responsible for setting and enforcing public health drinking water standards. The Directorate of Public Corporations and Privatization of the Ministry of Finance oversees the fiscal aspects of public utility operations, and the contracting of concessions. Furthermore, an Interdepartmental Commission on Prices approves proposals for tariff increases.

=== Water resources management ===
[[Image:Oum Errabiaa.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Oum Er-Rbia River]] in central Morocco is the country's longest river. Besides being an important source of water for irrigation, it supplies most of the drinking water for the country's largest city, [[Casablanca]]]]
Nine river basin agencies are responsible for the management of water resources in Morocco. River basin agencies have a number of important responsibilities. They authorize water abstractions and wastewater discharges for all users, based on a basin master plan (''Plan directeur d'aménagement intégré des ressources en eau'', PDAIRE) that they prepare. They also collect charges for abstraction and effluent discharges. They are also supposed to provide financial help and technical assistance to service providers for the prevention of water pollution and the efficient use of water resources. They also monitor the quality and quantity of both surface and groundwater and are in charge of managing water-related emergencies. Finally, they should increase public awareness about water resources. The agencies cover the following basins ranked in the order of the available water resources in each basin: [[Sebou River]], [[Moulouya]] River, [[Oum Er-Rbia River]], [[Bou Regreg]] River, [[Tensift River|Tensift]] River, [[Loukkos River]] and the [[Souss-Massa-Drâa|Souss-Massa]] basin, Ziz-Er Gheris et Sakia el Hamra-Oued Eddahab.&lt;ref name="LES AGENCES DE BASSINS HYDRAULIQUES"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Hachmi, Secrétariat d'État chargé de l'Eau et de l'Environnement:[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/13/21/43316393.pdf Agences de Bassins Hydrauliques &amp; Gouvernance de l’eau], 8–9 July 2009. Retrieved October 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The means available to the basin agencies are largely insufficient to carry out their functions.

=== Service provision ===

There are four categories of urban service providers in Morocco: private concessionnaires (38% of urban water customers), municipal utilities (31%), the national public company ONEE (28%), and municipalities providing services directly (3%). De jure, according to the municipal code of 1976 (''Charte Communale''), amended in 2002 and 2008, public services such as water supply, sewerage and electricity distribution are the responsibility of municipalities (''communes''). There are 1,547 municipalities in Morocco, including 249 urban and 1,298 rural municipalities. As mentioned above, some municipalities have delegated service provision to private concessionnaires. In other municipalities the ''Régies'' provide these services, often not on the basis of a specific contract. In the smaller municipalities ONEE often provides services, either with or without a contract (''contrat de gestion déléguée'') with the municipality. In the case of sewers, many smaller municipalities still provide this service directly, although there is a policy to gradually transfer sewer services to ONEE.

The 2008 amendment to the municipal code allowed for the creation of municipal associations (''groupement d'agglomérations urbaines'').&lt;ref&gt;Biladi.ma:[http://biladi.ma/74370-charte-communale-maroc-la-chambre-des-conseillers-adopte-le-projet-de-loi.htm Charte communale Maroc: La Chambre des conseillers adopte le projet de loi].

==== Private concessions ====
[[Image:Tanger1.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Water and sewer services in the city of [[Tangiers]] on the Straits of Gibraltar are run by the private company Amendis, a subsidiary of [[Veolia Environnement]] of France]]
Three private multi-utility concessionaires provide  drinking water, sewerage services and electricity in [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]], [[Tangiers]], and [[Tetouan]]. Lydec, the concession holder in Casablanca, is owned by [[SUEZ]] Environnement (51%), the Moroccan insurance company RMA Watanya (15%) and the Moroccan investment company FIPAR-Holding (19.75%). In addition, 14.25% of the shares are traded on the Casablanca stock exchange since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Lydec:[http://www.lydec.ma/html/visite.htm Carte de visite].

The company had also been criticized for failing to reach its investment targets, in particular concerning access to the poor.

A fourth concessionnaire provides bulk water to Casablanca.

==== Municipal utilities: ''Régies autonomes'' ====
[[Image:Nador seafront.JPG|thumb|200px|Water supply and sanitation in the Mediterranean city of [[Nador]] was transferred to ONEP after the municipal utility RADEEN was unable to clean up the Nador lagoon]]
12 specialized municipally owned public operators called ''Régies autonomes'' provide water in 12 medium to large cities. The same operators also provide sanitation in 11 cities and electricity distribution services in 7 cities. The largest of the cities served by ''Regies autonomes'' are [[Agadir]], [[Fes]], [[Marrakech]], [[Meknes]] and [[Oujda]]. Regies also exist in [[Chaouia (region)|Chaouia]], [[El Jadida]], [[Kenitra]], [[Larache]], [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]], [[Tadla]] and [[Taza]]. Many of these utilities are owned by several municipalities (''Régies intercommunales''). The ''Régie Autonome de Distribution de l'Eau et de l'Elecricité de Nador'' (RADEEN) was taken over by ONEP in about 2007 as a result of the utility's failure to properly to clean up the highly polluted lagoon of Nador.

==== The national utility ONEE ====

ONEE (''Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable'') is an electric utility and a bulk water provider that produces 80 percent of the country's drinking water and sells much of it to the ''Regies'' and the private concessionnaires. It also distributes water directly to customers in about 500 medium to small towns. ONEE has also taken over sanitation services in more than 65 of the towns where it distributes drinking water by 2009, and it is expected to take over sanitation services in a total of 191 towns by 2017. Furthermore, ONEE provides water through standposts to one third of the rural population that has access to an improved source of water. ONEE («Office national d'électricité et d'eau potable») was created through as alliance of the power company ONE and ONEP.

==== Direct service provision by municipalities: ''Régies directes'' ====

40 municipalities in small towns serve 3 percent of urban customers with water (''Régies directes'') through "non-professional and underfunded municipal departments".&lt;ref name="REDI4"/&gt; They also provide sewerage services in 280 towns (2003).

=== Associations ===

The Moroccan Association for Water Supply and Sanitation (''Association Marocaine de l'Eau Potable et de l'Assainissement'' - AMEPA) is a [[trade association]] created in 1997 to "address upcoming challenges and defend the sector's interests". It has organized a number of national and international seminars and congresses in Morocco. It also participates in international conferences. In 2009 it had 120 members, including service providers, contractors, consulting firms and [[professional association]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amepa-maroc.com/index.php Moroccan Association for Water Supply and Sanitation (''Association Marocaine de l’Eau Potable et de l’Assainissement'' - AMEPA].

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs and affordability ===

Morocco has a complicated system of water and sanitation tariffs and fees that consists of a large array of tariffs at different stages of the water cycle: water abstraction, sale in bulk, retail sales, as well as the collection, treatment and discharge of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Mathilde Tenneson and Dominique Rojat:[http://www.cairn.info/revue-afrique-contemporaine-2003-1-page-151.htm LA TARIFICATION DE L’EAU AU MAROC : COMMENT SERVIR DIFFÉRENTES CAUSES?], Afrique Contemporaine, Dossier spécial no 205 2003/1. Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban tariffs are differentiated by locality, by the quantity consumed, and by the type of use (residential, public, commercial and industrial). Urban tariff review mechanisms vary furthermore depending on whether the service provider is private or public, the process for the latter being more complicated and cumbersome than for the former. In general, the level of urban water tariffs is high compared to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, making it hard to afford to the urban poor connected to the piped network. On the other hand, it is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery. 11% of all users, including a large share of poor users in both urban and rural areas, receive water for free from standpipes.

'''Abstraction fees'''. ONEE and the Régies have to pay fees (''redevances'') for water abstraction and wastewater discharge to the basin agencies. These fees were introduced on the basis of the Water Law of 1995. Their level is low, not allowing the basin agencies to cover its own administrative costs, not to speak of contributing to the financing of investments by service providers as foreseen by the law. Since their introduction the level of the fees has not been adjusted, so that in inflation-adjusted terms the value of the already low fee has been further eroded.

'''Bulk water tariffs'''. ONEE charges tariffs for the supply of bulk water to the private operators and the Régies. These tariffs are reviewed by the government together with the tariffs for the Régies and ONEE's retail water and sewer tariffs. Bulk water tariffs differ from one city to the other taking into account production costs. For example, bulk water tariffs for Casabalanca, where the service provider is private, are twice as high as for the neighboring city Settat.&lt;ref&gt;L'Economiste:[http://www.tamesna.net/eau%20electricite.html Eau et électricité: un vrai casse-tête]. Retrieved October 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 5% special tax on bulk water sales in order to finance the rural water supply program PAGER &lt;ref name="PAGER"/&gt; as well as another more important surtax to finance water supply in small towns.

'''Retail water tariffs'''. The same retail tariff ''structure'' applies to the entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block tariff structure, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the ''level'' of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a ''gardien/gérant'', who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, both in terms of wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf Kingdom of Morocco. Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure (REDI).Water Supply and Sanitation Sector], 2004, p. 18 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607014410/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water and sewer retails tariffs were increased in 2006 throughout the country by reducing the size of the first block of the increasing-block tariff from 8 to 6 cubic meters per month and by increasing the fixed portion of the bill. The volumetric tariff for each tariff block remained unchanged. These modifications were equivalent to an 11% (check) tariff increase.

After the increase the average water tariff varied between Dirham 3.20 per m3 (US$0.29) in Meknes and Dirham 7.18 per m3 (US$0.66) in Casablanca. The sewer tariff varied between Dirham 0.59 per m3 (US$0.05) in Oujda and Dirham 1.64 per m3 (US$0.15) in Marrakech.&lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc:Revue Strategique du Programme National d'Assainissement, Banque Mondiale/KfW, 2008, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it was decided that the sewer tariff in small towns served by ONEP should become uniform for all towns, using an increasing-block structure. The average ONEP sewer tariff was Dirham 1.50 per m3 in 2009. Although a decision has been taken in 2004 to increase the sewer tariff to Dirham 2.00 per m3. However, the application of this decision has been delayed and until 2009 only sewer tariffs were only increased in one town. Nevertheless, an increase to Dirham 2.20 per m3 has been envisaged for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan d'Activité Assainissement de l'ONEP, 25 November 2009, Slide 41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Connection fees'''. In urban areas one-time connection fees for water and sewer connections are paid to the respective service provider. The level of the fees is determined based on a formula that takes into account the length of the water and sewer network in the city, as well as the length of the facade of each property (for water connection fees charged by ONEP, called ''taxe riveraine'') or the area of the property (for all connection fees charged by the Régies and private operators, as well as for sewer connection fees charged by ONEP, all together called ''Participation au Premier Etablissement'' or PPE). These fees do not include the costs of actually establishing the connection from the service line in the street, which the beneficiary has to pay himself separately. As in other countries, it also does not cover the costs of plumbing installations inside the property. Connection fees to the water and sewer network are a major source of funding for service providers. At the same time their high level constitutes an obstacle to expand the network, despite a policy to allow poor customers to pay part of the connection fee in installments that are added to the monthly water bill over a period of up to 7 years (''branchements sociaux''). These difficulties are illustrated by the example of Casablanca where an initial annual target of 10,000 social connections had been set, but only 1,250 were implemented every year until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Miras, Julien Le Tellier, Aahd Benmansour:[http://www.authorstream.com/presentation/Breezy-21910-saragosse-DeMiras-LeTellier-France-Maroc-2-Volont-explicite-de-faire-reculer-la-pauvret-et-ses-cons-quences-LYDEC-montage-du-co-financement-as-Entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ Le modèle marocain de gouvernance de l'eau potable], Presentation in Saragossa, March 2007, Slide 5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Human Development Initiative]] waives connection fees for selected poor urban neighborhoods &lt;ref&gt;Claude de Miras, Julien Le Tellier, Aahd Benmansour:[http://www.authorstream.com/presentation/Breezy-21910-saragosse-DeMiras-LeTellier-France-Maroc-2-Volont-explicite-de-faire-reculer-la-pauvret-et-ses-cons-quences-LYDEC-montage-du-co-financement-as-Entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ Le modèle marocain de gouvernance de l'eau potable], Presentation in Saragossa, March 2007, Slide 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Average connection fees ranged from an equivalent of US$220 to 500 for water and US$880 to 1,650 for sewerage in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf Kingdom of Morocco.

However, according to another source, in 2008 the connection fee for sewerage charged by ONEP was only 1,600 Dirham (about US$145).&lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc:Revue Strategique du Programme National d'Assainissement, Banque Mondiale/KfW, 2008, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Affordability'''. Data from the National Household Living Standards Survey 1998/99 assessed total expenditures for water supply at MAD 84.8/person/year in urban areas and 147.4 MAD/person/year in rural areas, or 1.8 and 2.9 percent of average total per capita expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf Kingdom of Morocco.

=== Cost recovery ===

Cost recovery in the sector remains a challenge. ONEE is nominally financially autonomous through its tariff revenues, but it receives investment subsidies of Dirham 150 million per year for rural water supply and half its sanitation investments are financed by the government budget and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc:Contrat de Programme entre l'État et l'ONEP 2008-2010, October 2008. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Regies have to rely to a large extent on connection fees for their revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf Kingdom of Morocco. Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure (REDI).Water Supply and Sanitation Sector], 2004, p. 58 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607014410/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/03/24/000011823_20050324120250/Rendered/PDF/296340MOR0whit1P0866960REDI1public1.pdf |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment ===

The investments in the water and sanitation sector increased substantially between 2003 and 2005. In urban water distribution it increased from Dirham 0.9bn to 1.5bn, in rural water supply from Dirham 0.5bn to 0.8bn, in water production from 0.3bn to 0.6bn, and in sanitation from Dirham 1.1bn to 2.8bn. Overall investments doubled from Dirham 2.8bn (US$ 337m) to 5.7bn (US$ 687m).&lt;ref&gt;Revue strategique du PNA, 2008, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Per capita investment in water supply and sanitation thus stood at US$21 per capita and year, a relatively high level compared to other middle-income countries.

=== Financing ===

Investments are financed from tariff revenues, various subsidies and transfers (grants and soft loans) by external partners. However, there are also substantial cross-subsidies. For example, bulk water tariffs charged by ONEE to the private concessionnaires and the ''Régies'' are higher than production costs. The surplus is used to cross-subsidize ONEE's activities in rural water supply and in sanitation, where tariffs do not cover costs.

Furthermore, according to a World Bank study of 2008, there is a cross-subsidy of about Dirham 1bn from electricity users who are charged distribution tariffs that are above costs. This allows the concessionnaires and the ''Régies'' to generate the revenue necessary to pay for the inflated tariffs for bulk water, which in turn allows ONEE to cross-subsidize rural water supply and sanitation at an amount that is also about Dirham 1bn.&lt;ref&gt;Royaume du Maroc:Mécanismes et Flux de Financement du Secteur de l'Eau, Banque mondiale, Avril 2008, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

== External cooperation ==

External cooperation plays a major role in the Moroccan water and sanitation sector. External partners provide investment finance and technical assistance. Beginning in 2002 the African Development Bank, the European Union and subsequently the World Bank also provided [[budget support]] linked to the fulfillment of certain policy conditions. The major external partners in the sector are, in addition to the three named above, France, Germany and Japan. Other external partners are Belgium, the Islamic Development Bank, Kuwait, Luxemburg, Spain and the United States.

External partners work increasingly together to finance joint programs instead of financing specific projects. An example is the rural water supply program PAGER initiated in 1995 that was supported by Belgium, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, Luxemburg and the World Bank.&lt;ref name="PAGER"&gt;Secrétariat d'État chargé de l'Eau:[http://www.water.gov.ma/03programmes/ameliorations-pager.htm AMELIORATIONS APPORTEES PAR LE PAGER].

=== African Development Bank ===
[[Image:AFDB Logo.png|100px|right]]
The [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) has financed nine drinking water projects in Morocco since 1978. The total amount of its funding in the sector has been USD180 million until 2006, benefiting 20 Moroccan towns, in particular [[Tangiers]]. On-going projects, all executed by ONEP, include the ninth drinking water and sanitation project, appraised in 2006, which benefits rural populations in four provinces and foresees wastewater treatment in three towns ([[Khouribga]], [[Oued Zem]] and [[Boujaâd]]) &lt;ref&gt;[[African Development Bank]]:[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/MA-2006-059-EN-ADB-BD-WP-MOROCCO-NINTH-WATER-SUPPLY-AND-SANITATION-PROJECT-FINAL.PDF NINTH DRINKING WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT:APPRAISAL REPORT], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the tenth drinking water supply project approved in 2008 which supports drinking water supply in [[Khénifra]], [[Taounate]],  [[Settat]], [[Marrakech]] and [[Tamesna, Rabat|Tamesna]] as well as neighbouring small towns.&lt;ref&gt;[[African Development Bank]] :[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-approves-10th-drinking-water-supply-project-in-morocco-3396/ AfDB Approves 10th Drinking Water Supply Project in Morocco], November 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the AfDB provided a loan for a water sector adjustment program. In 2012 the AfDB approved a $157 million USD loan to finance a Marrakech Region Water Supply Project together with AFD ($68.7 million USD), ONEE and the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP), each providing $66.8 million USD. It will finance bulk water transmission from the [[Al Massira Dam]] for drinking water, tourism and mining. The project is expected to be completed in 2017.

=== European Union ===
[[Image:Flag of Europe.svg|thumb|100px|right]]
The [[European Union]] supports the sector through grants, as well as through loans from the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB). The EIB has supported water supply and sanitation projects in six cities (Marrakech, Settat, Meknes, Agadir, Oujda and Fes), as well as a number of small towns. Between 1997 and 2006 it provided 10 loans totaling Euro 283m. In 2006 it approved another loan of Euro 40m for sanitation in the Sebou basin, a highly polluted river where [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] are located.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Investment Bank]]:[http://www.eib.org/projects/loans/regions/mediterranean-countries/ma.htm?start=1980&amp;end=2009&amp;sector=water%2C-sewerage Loans to Morocco for water and sanitation].

=== France ===

Water supply and sanitation is a focal area of French development cooperation with Morocco. In 2007 the French Development Agency (AFD) supported projects with a value of Euro 130m for urban and rural water supply and Euro 145m for sanitation. Geographically the projects are concentrated in the Sebou river basin, in [[Agadir]] and in [[Nador]].&lt;ref&gt;Agence Française de Développement:[http://www.afd.fr/jahia/webdav/site/afd/users/administrateur/public/plaquettes/AFD_Maroc_(F)7_BD.pdf L’AFD et le Maroc:Quinze ans de partenariat], 2007. Retrieved October 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nador French aid contributes through a loan approved in 2007 to clean up the highly polluted lagoon of Nador, the largest lagoon in the Mediterranean. The clean-up plan for the bay is inspired by similar experiences in France (''Contrats de Baie'') under which different public players work together for the common goal to clean up a coastal bay.&lt;ref&gt;Agence Française de Développement:[http://www.afd.fr/jahia/webdav/site/afd/users/administrateur/public/plaquettes/AFD-Eau-Mediterranee_FR.pdf L’AFD ET L’EAU EN MÉDITERRANÉE, Ecnadré sur MAROC – LE PLAN DE DÉPOLLUTION DE LA LAGUNE DE NADOR, UNE APPROCHE INNOVANTE], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

Germany has supported the Moroccan water sector since the early 1980s and was among the first donors to support the Moroccan government's efforts at expanding access to sanitation in small and medium-sized towns in the early 1990s. German aid projects are administered  by [[KfW]] in charge of investment projects, [[GTZ]] in charge of technical cooperation and InWent in charge of training. In 2009 the total volume of approved and on-going investment projects supported by KfW was Euro 407m, all executed by ONEP in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammer in Marokko:[http://marokko.ahk.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/Veranstaltungen/2009-02-04_Wasserworkshop/2009-02-04_KfW_La_cooperation_allemande_dans_l_eau_et_assainissement.pdf La coopération financière avec le Royaume du Maroc dans le domaine de l'eau et de l'assainissement], Christoph Krieger, 2009.

'''World Tuberculosis Day''', observed on 24 March each year, is designed to build public awareness about the global [[epidemic]] of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) and efforts to eliminate the disease. In 2012, 8.6 million people fell ill with TB, and 1.3 million died from the disease, mostly in the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/ Tuberculosis.] WHO Fact Sheet N° 104, Reviewed March 2014. Accessed 8 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World TB Day is one of eight official [[global health|global public health]] campaigns marked by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]] and [[World AIDS Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
24 March commemorates the day in 1882 when [[Robert Koch|Dr Robert Koch]] astounded the scientific community by announcing to a small group of scientists at the University of Berlin's Institute of Hygiene that he had discovered the cause of tuberculosis, the [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|TB bacillus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Frank. 1992. ''Tuberculosis: The Greatest Story Never Told''. Worcestershire: Swift Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Koch’s colleague, [[Paul Ehrlich]], “At this memorable session, Koch appeared before the public with an announcement which marked a turning-point in the story of a virulent human infectious disease. In clear, simple words Koch explained the aetiology of tuberculosis with convincing force, presenting many of his microscope slides and other pieces of evidence.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Steinbruck. 1982. “Robert Koch.” World Health (January): 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Koch's announcement in [[Berlin]], TB was raging through [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], causing the death of one out of every seven people. Koch's discovery opened the way toward diagnosing and curing tuberculosis.

== History ==
In 1982, on the one-hundredth [[anniversary]] of [[Robert Koch]]'s presentation, the [[International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease]] (IUATLD) proposed that 24 March be proclaimed an official World TB Day. This was part of a year-long centennial effort by the IUATLD and the [[World Health Organization]] under the theme “Defeat TB: Now and Forever.”&lt;ref&gt;IUATLD/WHO information kit, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; World TB Day was not officially recognized as an annual occurrence by WHO's [[World Health Assembly]] and the United Nations until over a decade later.

In the fall of 1995, WHO and the Royal Netherlands Tuberculosis Foundation (KNCV) hosted the first World TB Day advocacy planning meeting in [[Den Haag]], [[Netherlands]]; an event they would continue co-sponsor over the next few years.&lt;ref name=Klaudt&gt;Klaudt, Kraig. 2000. “Mobilizing Society Against TB.” Pp. 843–864 in ''Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive International Approach'', 2d ed, ed. L. Reichman and E. Hershfield. New York: MarcelDekker.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, WHO, KNCV, the IUATLD and other concerned organizations joined to conduct a wide range of World TB Day activities.

For World TB Day 1997, WHO held a news conference in Berlin during which WHO Director-General [[Hiroshi Nakajima]] declared that “DOTS is the biggest health breakthrough of this decade, according to lives we will be able to save.”&lt;ref&gt;“Breakthrough in TB Control Announced by World Health Organization,” Press Release WHO/23, 19 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; WHO's Global TB Programme Director, Dr. [[Arata Kochi]], promised that, "Today the situation of the global TB epidemic is about to change, because we have made a breakthrough. It is the breakthrough of health management systems that makes it possible to control TB not only in wealthy countries, but in all parts of the developing world, where 95 percent of all TB cases now exist."&lt;ref&gt;Kochi, Arata. "Statement to the Press." 19 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, nearly 200 organizations conducted public outreach activities on World TB Day.&lt;ref name=Klaudt/&gt; During its World TB Day 1998 news conference in London, WHO for the first time identified the top twenty-two countries with the world’s highest TB burden.&lt;ref&gt;”Progress Against TB Stalled in Key Countries.” WHO press release #30, 19 March 1998, ({{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-30.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329080636/http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-30.html |archivedate=29 March 2012}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, over 60 key TB advocates from 18 countries attended the three-day WHO/KNCV planning meeting for World TB Day 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Guicherit-Samson, Carla. 1999. “Report on Workshop Word TB Day.” KNCV memo 34.123/CGS/8172ev.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] marked World TB Day 2000 by administering the WHO-recommended Directly Observed Therapy, Short-Course ([[DOTS]]) treatment to patients at the Mahavir Hospital in [[Hyderabad]], [[India]]. According to Clinton, "These are human tragedies, economic calamities, and far more than crises for you, they are crises for the world. The spread of disease is the one global problem for which . . . no nation is immune."&lt;ref&gt;”President Clinton Helps TB Patients.” WHO press release #20, 24 March 2000, (http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-20.html).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health noted on World TB Day 2014 that 64% of TB cases reported nationally were among foreign-born individuals and 23% among [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]], highlighting TB as a key area of concern about [[health equity]].&lt;ref&gt;National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health, [http://nccdh.ca/blog/entry/how-will-you-make-world-tb-day-count How will you make World TB Day count?] Accessed 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the [[Stop TB Partnership]], a network of organizations and countries fighting TB (the IUATLD is a member and WHO houses the Stop TB Partnership secretariat in [[Geneva]]), organizes the Day to highlight the scope of the disease and how to prevent and cure it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

{{col-end}}

===2008–2009: I am stopping TB===
The two-year World TB Day campaign "I am stopping TB", launched in 2008, highlighted the message that the campaign belonged to people everywhere doing their part to Stop TB.

===2010: Innovate to accelerate action===
The World TB Day 2010 recognized people and partners who had introduced a variety of innovations in a variety of settings to stop TB.&lt;ref&gt;Stop TB Partnership, [http://www.stoptb.org/events/world_tb_day/2010/ World TB Day 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of World TB Day 2010, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) declared that attempts to stem the spread of tuberculosis across the globe are likely to fall well short of what is needed unless authorities in affected countries significantly increase their efforts to stop the deadly disease from breeding inside [[prison]]s.  As a result of overcrowding and poor nutrition, TB rates in many prisons are 10 to 40 times higher than in the general public. The ICRC had been fighting TB in prisons in the Caucasus region, Central Asia, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa for more than a decade, either directly or by supporting local programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/azerbaijan-news-220310 Tuberculosis: a killer that can’t be kept behind bars], ICRC News release, 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/azerbaijan-interview-220310 Tuberculosis: stopping a killer that can't be kept behind bars], ICRC&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011: Transforming the fight===
For the World TB Day 2011 campaign, the goal was to inspire innovation in TB research and care.

===2012: Tell the world what you want to see in your lifetime===
For World TB Day 2012, individuals were called upon to join the global fight to stop TB in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Stop TB Partnership, [http://www.stoptb.org/events/world_tb_day/2012/ World TB Day 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013: Stop TB in my lifetime===
The World TB Day 2013 campaign provided an opportunity to mark progress towards global targets for reductions in TB cases and deaths: TB mortality fell over 40% worldwide since 1990, and incidence was declining.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/tb-day/2013/en/ World TB Day 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further progress would depend on addressing critical funding gaps: an estimated 1.6 billion US dollars needed to implement existing TB interventions.

===2014: Reach the three million===
Of the 9 million people a year who get sick with TB, 3 million of them are "missed" by [[health system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/tb-day/2014/en/ World TB Day 2014.] Accessed 8 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of World TB Day 2014 was for countries and partners to take forward innovative approaches to reach the 3 million and ensure that everyone suffering from TB has access to TB [[Tuberculosis diagnosis|diagnosis]], treatment and cure.

===2015: Gear up to end TB===
World TB Day 2015 was seen as an opportunity to raise awareness about the burden of TB worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts, highlighting WHO’s vision of a world free of TB with zero deaths and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/tb-day/2015/en/ World TB Day 2015.] Accessed 27 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 : Unite to end TB ===
World TB 2017 focused on joining efforts to raise awareness and eliminate Tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/worldtbday/index.html|title=World TB Day 2017|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=16 December 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018: Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world ===
World TB 2018 day focused on building commitment to end TB, not only at the political level with Heads of State and Ministers of Health, but at all levels from Mayors, Governors, parliamentarians and community leaders, to people affected with TB, civil society advocates, health workers, doctors or nurses, NGOs and other partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/campaigns/tb-day/2018/event/en/ WHO. World Tuberculosis Day, 24 March 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

She first summitted [[Kilimanjaro]] on New Year's Day in 1982, and summitted [[Aconcagua]] exactly two years later.  She reached the summit of [[Denali]] on July 1, 1985, and the summit of [[Mount Elbrus]] on August 1, 1992. After summitting the [[Vinson Massif]] on December 29, 1993 and the [[Carstensz Pyramid]] on November 12, 1994, Namba's final summit to reach was [[Mount Everest]]. She signed on with [[Rob Hall]]'s guiding company, [[Adventure Consultants]], and reached the summit in May 1996, but died during her descent in the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]].

==Personal and professional life==
Prior to her involvement in the Everest disaster, Yasuko Namba had been employed by Federal Express as a personnel manager in Tokyo, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Tom and Jonathan Simon, editors. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zkVAs_AQs24C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Yasuko+Namba%22+and+%22Federal+Express%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ANe3cC5aV&amp;sig=95GoVeGsvgFukeJzXTebsaYfx3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizluWSoY7bAhVn9YMKHdbrDKQ4ChDoAQguMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Yasuko%20Namba%22%20and%20%22Federal%20Express%22&amp;f=false Embracing Risk: The Changing Culture of Insurance and Responsibility]''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was survived by her husband, Kenichi Namba,&lt;ref&gt;Yasuko Namba, in "[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/05/13/Two-mountain-climbers-an-American-and-a-Taiwanese-concluded/7759831960000/ Two mountain climbers, an American and a Taiwanese, concluded....]" United Press International, Inc.: Accessed May 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and her brother, both of whom later traveled to Nepal with the hope of retrieving her body from Everest.&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, Into Thin Air, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{main|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}
On May 10, 1996, the 47-year-old Namba reached the summit of Everest, becoming the oldest woman to do so (her record was later broken by [[Anna Czerwińska]] of Poland who summitted Everest at age 50).  She was still high on the mountain rather late into the afternoon, and was descending when a blizzard struck. Namba, fellow client [[Beck Weathers]], and their guide Mike Groom from Adventure Consultants and clients from [[Scott Fischer]]'s [[Mountain Madness]] were stuck on the [[South Col]], while a whiteout prevented them from knowing where their camp was located.  Groom later said that Namba insisted on putting her oxygen mask on despite the fact that she had run out of oxygen. Both Namba and Weathers were so weak that the two guides (Groom and Neal Beidleman from Mountain Madness) had to support them. Although the group tried to head to the camp, the guides soon realized it was pointless and dangerous, and waited for a break in the storm.

One of Fischer's guides, [[Anatoli Boukreev]], set out from Camp IV into the night to find the cluster of trapped climbers.  After assisting several other people, he came back one last time for [[Sandy Pittman]] and Tim Madsen. Madsen, who assumed that Namba was dead and Weathers was a "lost cause," left the two alone. The following day, Stuart Hutchinson, one of the clients on Adventure Consultants, organized a search party to find both Namba and Weathers. Hutchinson found both in such bad shape that they were unlikely to live long enough to be carried down to Base Camp, and he decided to leave the two alone to save limited resources for the other climbers.

While Weathers survived against all expectations, and walked back to camp, Namba died from exhaustion and exposure.  Jon Krakauer's book, ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', describes the anguish of Neal Beidleman, who felt guilty that he was unable to do anything more to save Namba.  Boukreev's book ''The Climb'' expressed profound regret at her lonely death, saying that she was just a little 90-pound woman, and that someone should have dragged her back to camp so she could at least die among her companions. On a later expedition to Everest with the Indonesian National Team, Boukreev found Namba's body on April 28, 1997. He constructed a [[cairn]] around her to protect her from [[Alpine chough#Distribution and habitat|scavenging birds]], and a few days later apologized to her widower for failing to save Namba's life. Later in 1997, her husband funded an operation that brought her body down the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Viesturs|first=Ed|last2=Roberts|first2=David|title=No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 materials created by the PBS program "Frontline" for David Breashears' film "Storm Over Everest," John Taske described Namba, and presented his thoughts on factors which may have contributed to her death, saying "She was a little lady; I've never met a girl more determined. About 100 pounds in weight, no more, but as far as determination goes, she was twice that weight in determination. However, nature being what it is, hypothermia, body mass -- she had a small body mass; she would have gotten desperately cold much more quickly than an average person twice her weight.&lt;ref&gt;"Yasuko Namba," in "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/everest/etc/remembering.html Remembering Those Who Died]," in "Storm Over Everest." PBS: Frontline, retrieved online May 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked for her thoughts regarding Namba's Seven Summits achievement and subsequent death, [[Junko Tabei]], the first woman from Japan to summit Everest, told a reporter from United Press International, Inc. in mid-May 1996: "I jumped for joy when I heard she did it, but I feel like I have lost my sister and I am very sorry."&lt;ref&gt;Yasuko Namba, in Two mountain climbers. UPI, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After the 1996 disaster, two memorial chortens were built nearby Gorak Shep by the Sherpas: one for Rob Hall and the other for Rob Hall's teammates Doug Hansen, Andy Harris, and Yasuko Namba. The two chortens are connected by prayer flags.
