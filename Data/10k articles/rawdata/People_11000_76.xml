      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">{{Portal|Book of Mormon}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Abinadom''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|b|ɪ|n|ə|d|ə|m}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-bĭn´a-dum»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] record keeper and the son of [[Chemish]].  He received the [[Plates of Nephi]] from his father and penned two verses in the [[Book of Omni]] before conferring the record to his son, [[Amaleki]].
Verses attributed to Abinadom in the Book of Mormon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
10 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish. Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.
&lt;br /&gt;11 And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I make an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] and [[Egyptian_language|Egyptian]] origins&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt; and states:

:"This is a Canaanite name. I'll bet 'Abinadom' means 'Abinetchem'. It's a combination, a typical Canaanite name. It means 'Abi (my father) is friendly, gentle, loving'. 'Netem' means 'sweet or agreeable' in Egyptian and it's a borrowed word. So Abinetchem could very well mean 'my father is benevolent or sweet'."

The name Abinadom is also similar to other Book of Mormon names such as [[Abinadi]] and the final syllable is similar to the Old Testament name [[Adam]] (Hebrew "אָדָם") meaning "man".

'''Alara Kalama''' ([[IAST]] ''Ārāḷa Kālāma'') was a hermit saint and a teacher of ancient  meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;Laumakis, Stephen.

According to the [[Pāli Canon]] scriptures, he was the first teacher{{clarify|date=July 2017|reason=First teacher or one of the first?}} of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="ariyapariyesana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ariyapariyesana Sutta,translation by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html|accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After Gautama [[Gautama Buddha#Departure and ascetic life|became an ascetic]], he went to Alara Kalama, who was a teacher that taught a kind of early [[samkhya]] at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vessali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eliade |first= Mircea |title= Yoga: Immortality and Freedom |year= 2009 |publisher= Princeton University Press |location= New Jersey, USA |isbn= 978-0691142036 |page= 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alara taught Gautama Buddha [[meditation]], especially a [[dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyānic state]] called the "sphere of nothingness" (Pali: ''ākiñcaññāyatana'').{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=76}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aalara_kaalaama.htm|title=Ālāra Kālāma|accessdate=2014-06-29|work=Article on Palikanon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gautama eventually equalled Alara, who could not teach him more, saying, "You are the same as I am now. There is no difference between us. Stay here and take my place and teach my students with me."&lt;ref name="ariyapariyesana"/&gt; Gautama was not interested in staying. After leaving, the Buddha found a new teacher, [[Uddaka Ramaputta]].&lt;ref name="The Buddha's First Teachers"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddha's First Teachers|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/13lbud.htm|work=Article on Buddhanet.net|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">'''Alexander Gordon Huie''' (16 October 1869 &amp;ndash; 7 November 1964) was an Australian journalist and [[single tax]] campaigner.

Huie was born at Tayco in the [[Riverina]] to Scottish farmer Alexander Huie and Mary Eliza, ''née'' Carige, who had been born in [[Grenada|British Grenada]]. His family all supported the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] movement. Huie moved to [[Lake Cargelligo]] in 1883 to work as a carpenter, and read [[Henry George]]'s ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' in 1889. He became a correspondent for the ''Hillston Spectator'' and was appointed secretary of the local progress committee. He contested the seat of [[Electoral district of Lachlan|Lachlan]] in 1894 and would go on to unsuccessfully contest eleven more elections at all levels of government. In 1901 he became founding honorary secretary of the Sydney [[Single Tax League]], although he supported [[Joseph Carruthers]]' [[Liberal Reform Party (Australia)|Liberal and Reform Association]] at the 1904 and 1907 state elections.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Cite web

Huie founded the single tax journal the ''Standard'' in December 1905, remaining editor and secretary of the Single Tax League until December 1953. He had about 220 letters published in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' between 1916 and 1962, and was a strong supporter of [[proportional representation]]. He married Annie Bertha Lark, ''née'' Bartlett, a [[Malta|Maltese]]-born widow, on 1 October 1921 in a [[Methodist]] ceremony at [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], where they settled; Annie would predecease him in 1948. He regularly spoke in the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]]. Huie died in 1964 visiting Lake Cargelligo, where he is buried with [[Presbyterian]] forms.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

'''Anatoli Andreyevich Kim''' ({{lang-ru|Анато́лий Андре́евич Ким}}; born 15 June 1939) is a [[Russian language|Russian-language]] writer.&lt;ref name="Bogdanova182"&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanova|2005|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Kim's father was a [[Koryo-saram|Soviet Korean]], the son of a man who immigrated to the [[Russian Far East]] in 1908; his mother was of Russian ethnicity. He claims to be a descendant of 15th-century Korean author [[Kim Si-seup]].&lt;ref name="Sakhvesti"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sakhvesti.ru/?div=gubved&amp;id=21914|title="Сахалин никогда не отпускал меня от себя…" (из бесед с писателем Анатолием Кимом)|date=2010-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-06|last=Egorova|first=Tatiana|periodical=Sakhalin-Kurile Information Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Sergievka, [[Tulkibas District]], Chimkent Oblast, [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (today [[South Kazakhstan Province]], [[Kazakhstan]]) and spent his early years there.&lt;ref name="Bogdanova182"/&gt; In 1948, his family moved to the Russian Far East and [[Sakhalin]], where he lived until 1957 before entering an art school in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Choi|1988|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
Aside from his original works, Kim has also translated a number of [[Kazakh language]] works into Russian, including [[Abdijamil Nurpeisov]]'s ''Last Duty'' (Последний долг) and [[Mukhtar Auezov]]'s ''Path of Abay'' (a re-translation, to replace an older Soviet-era version perceived as insufficient).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.elmedia.kz/ru/?p=330 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142302/http://www.elmedia.kz/ru/?p=330 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-22 |periodical=Республика |title="Путь Абая": перечитывая заново |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2010-09-06 |first=Guljakhan |last=Otar }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Leonid|last=Terakpyan|title=Абдижамила Нурпеисова "Последний долг"|periodical=Октябрь|date=November 2001|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/october/2001/11/ter.html|accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===1984–1999: Childhood===
Lavigne was born in 1984 at [[Belleville, Ontario]], Canada. Her mother is of English, Scottish, and German descent, and her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, is of [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] origin.{{r|wennfrance}} She was named "Avril" by her father{{r|storage.canoe.ca}} after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother, Judith-Rosanne "Judy" Lavigne (née Loshaw),{{r|rollingstonecover}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.myheritage.com/names/judith-rosanne_loshaw |title=Judith-Rosanne Loshaw |publisher=MyHeritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" on the way home from church.{{r|sperling}} Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle,{{r|peoplekappes}} both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying."{{r|sperling}} She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band [[One OK Rock]] bassist [[Ryota Kohama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2017/02/22/one-ok-rock-bassist-and-avril-lavignes-sister-get-married |title=ONE OK ROCK bassist and Avril Lavigne's sister get married |publisher=SBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to [[Greater Napanee]], Ontario,{{r|unofficialbiog}} a town with a population of approximately 5,000.{{r|canoemcqueen|mtvrealdeal|ewwillman}} In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in [[Kingston, Ontario]], where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.{{r|msnbcpauley}} Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by [[Garth Brooks]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Shania Twain]]. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as "cheesy cute".{{r|mirrorquigley}}

===Music===

====1999–2001: Early performances and record deal====
In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.{{r|tracy}}{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, "[[What Made You Say That]]",{{r|unofficialbiog}} and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be "a famous singer".{{r|canoemcqueen}} During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, ''Quinte Spirit''. She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album, ''My Window to You'', in 2000.

In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario]].{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.{{r|sk8terfaker}} Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, [[Nettwerk]], received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.{{r|patch}} Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer [[Peter Zizzo]] during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why". Lavigne was noticed by [[Arista Records]] during a trip to New York.{{r|sk8terfaker}}

In November 2000,{{r|mtvrealdeal}} Ken Krongard, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] representative, invited [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25&amp;nbsp;million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.{{r|ewwillman|unofficialbiog}} By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed [[skateboard]]ing, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.{{r|mtvrealdeal}}{{r|canadianpress|mirrorquigley}} Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the [[Canadian punk rock]] scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827104222/http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |archivedate=August 27, 2016}} Most inexperienced singers are backed by seasoned musicians, but Nettwerk chose to go with young performers who were up and coming in the Canadian punk-rock scene. As Nettwerk manager Shauna Gold told Shanda Deziel of Maclean's, "[Lavigne] is young, her music's young, we needed a band that would fit well with who she is as a person."&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002–2003: ''Let Go''====
[[File:AvrilShow.jpg|thumb|left|Lavigne performing in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in September 2002]]
Reid gave A&amp;R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told [[HitQuarters]] that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]] production team—including "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'', finished in January 2002.{{r|hitquarters}}

Lavigne released ''Let Go'' in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at that time.{{r|aboutlamb}} By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and ''Let Go'' the top-selling debut of the year.{{r|riaadiamond}} By May 2003, ''Let Go'' had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]].{{r|criadiamond}} By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide.{{r|transworldnews}} By March 2018,  the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GP_March_2018.pdf |title=RIAA GOLD &amp; PLATINUM AWARDS March // 3/1/18 – 3/31/18 |last= |first= |date= |website=[[RIAA]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavigne's debut single, "Complicated", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. "Complicated" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US,{{r|billboarddecadehot100}} where subsequent singles "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (song)|I'm with You]]" reached the top ten.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart.{{r|reuterstop40}} Lavigne was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] (for "Complicated") at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]],{{r|thestarmtv}} won four [[Juno Awards]] in 2003 out of six nominations,{{r|billboardjuno}} received a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] for "World's Bestselling Canadian Singer", and was nominated for eight [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for "Complicated".{{r|hollywoodgrammy}}

In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for "[[Hundred Million]]" by the [[pop punk]] band [[Treble Charger]].{{r|cbcnewstreble}} In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine,{{r|rollingstonecover}} and in May she performed "[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]" during MTV's Icon tribute to [[Metallica]].{{r|mtvdowney}}{{r|mtviconmetallica}} During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered [[Green Day]]'s "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]".{{r|sfgatesullivan}}

Lavigne said that ''Under My Skin'' proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that "each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs".{{r|ledgermoody}} "[[Don't Tell Me (Avril Lavigne song)|Don't Tell Me]]", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia.

The third single, "[[Nobody's Home (Avril Lavigne song)|Nobody's Home]]", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.

During early 2004 Lavigne went on the 'Live and By Surprise' acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote ''Under My Skin'', accompanied by her guitarist [[Evan Taubenfeld]]. In late 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long [[Bonez Tour]]. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for 'World's Best Pop/Rock Artist' and 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist', and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including 'Artist of the Year'.&lt;ref name=Juno /&gt; She also won in the category of 'Favorite Female Singer' at the eighteenth annual [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]].{{r|mtvmoss}}

Three months after the release of ''Goodbye Lullaby'', Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of ''Goodbye Lullaby''{{r|shuffleme.net}} and "pop and more fun again".{{r|nmefifth|corner|daw}} In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to [[Epic Records]], headed by [[L. A. Reid]].{{r|www.925thebeat.ca|www.billboard.biz}} Lavigne contributed two cover songs to the 2012 Japanese animated film ''[[One Piece Film: Z]]'': "[[How You Remind Me]]" (originally by [[Nickelback]]) and "[[Bad Reputation (Joan Jett song)|Bad Reputation]]" (originally by [[Joan Jett]]).{{r|www.animenewsnetwork.com}}

The lead single from Lavigne's fifth studio album, "[[Here's to Never Growing Up]]" (produced by [[Martin Johnson (musician)|Martin Johnson]] of the band [[Boys Like Girls]]), was released in April 2013{{r|cornerds}} and reached top 20 positions on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], Australia and the UK. The second single, "[[Rock n Roll (Avril Lavigne song)|Rock n Roll]]", was released in August 2013&lt;ref name="Rock n Roll release confirmation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avrilbandaids.com/content.php?r%3D646-Rock-N-Roll-Music-Video-Teaser-Video-Premiere-on-August-20-Single-Release-on-August-27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223609/http://www.avrilbandaids.com/content.php?r=646-Rock-N-Roll-Music-Video-Teaser-Video-Premiere-on-August-20-Single-Release-on-August-27 |archivedate=October 16, 2015}} Avril Lavigne Bandaids.

In an April 2015 interview with ''Billboard'', Lavigne announced a new single titled "[[Fly (Avril Lavigne song)|Fly]]", which was released on April 26 in association with the [[2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games]].&lt;ref name=Billboard-April2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6524244/avril-lavigne-interview-special-olympics-christmas-album-lyme-disease |title=Avril Lavigne's Post-Illness Plans: Special Olympics Song, Christmas Album &amp; Film Work |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing "Sk8er Boi"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of "Losing Grip".{{r|goingthedistance}}

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&amp;nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}

[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of."{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. "[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&amp;nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}

In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}

Both ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part."{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}

===Fashion===
In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all."{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}

The designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} "It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find."{{r|inked2010}}

Lavigne released her first fragrance, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], created by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are."{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''[[Forbidden Rose]]'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.{{r|popeater}} The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more".{{r|perfumediary}} It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.{{r|fragrantica}}

In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate ''Alice in Wonderland''-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.{{r|seacrestinterview26}} Her designs were exhibited at the [[Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising]] in California beginning in May through September, alongside [[Colleen Atwood]]'s costumes from the 2010 film.{{r|ladowntownalice}}

==Artistry==

===Musical style and songwriting===
Themes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.{{r|blossoming}} Lavigne believes her "songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true."{{r|girlauinterview}} On her debut album, ''Let Go'', Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as "[[Losing Grip]]", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", saying that "the songs I did with [[The Matrix (record production team)|the Matrix]]&amp;nbsp;... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore."{{r|teenspirit}} Lavigne's second album, ''Under My Skin'', had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about&amp;nbsp;... Like boys, like dating or relationships".{{r|musicomhinterview}} Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more [[post-grunge]] sound that verged on [[nü-metal]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pop-buzz.com/just-music/avril-lavigne-8-best-deep-cuts/ |title=Avril Lavigne: 8 Best Songs That Should've Been Singles |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9jp2 |title=BBC – Music – Review of Avril Lavigne – Under My Skin |first=Annabel |last=Leathes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/avril-lavigne-emunder-my-skinem-11438 |title=Avril Lavigne: Under My Skin |date=May 28, 2004 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2004/05/28/under-my-skin |title=Under My Skin |date=May 28, 2004 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, her third album, ''The Best Damn Thing'', was not personal to her. "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through."{{r|scold}} Her objective in writing the album was simply to "make it fun".{{r|salva}} The style has been praised for her ability to combine [[bubblegum pop]] melodies with [[punk rock]] riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dunk |first1=Marcus |title=AVRIL LAVIGNE: THE BEST DAMN THING |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/4945/AVRIL-LAVIGNE-THE-BEST-DAMN-THING |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |publisher=Express |date=April 20, 2007 |quote=... the perpetual teenager who manages to combine bubblegum pop with punk riffs in pretty much every song.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goodbye Lullaby'', Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,{{r|musicmix}} with Lavigne describing the album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional".{{r|popeater}} [[Ian McKellen]] defined her as "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' in 2007.{{r|www.fanpop.com|avrillavigneuk.tumblr.com}}

Most critics and publications, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''[[MusicMight]]'', [[IGN]] and ''[[PopMatters]]'', have identified Lavigne as a mix of [[alternative rock]], [[pop punk]] and [[pop rock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Avril Lavigne Essentials |url=https://itunes.apple.com/za/playlist/avril-lavigne-essentials/pl.8504e182e47a4668970d44586c0e6be3 |website=Apple Music |accessdate=September 20, 2018 |quote=Alt-rock upstart Avril Lavigne came crashing into the charts in 2002 with a sound that stuck up a black nail-varnished middle finger at the hyper-polished world of classmates Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. From the chugging, three-chord pop-punk of “Sk8er Boi” and “My Happy Ending” to the country-hued, catchy melody of “Complicated” and the twinkling balladry of “I'm With You,” the Canadian singer proved herself a crossover star, garnering legions of both mainstream and fringe fans with her Cali punk-indebted sound.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|www.musicmight.com|music.ign.com|www.popmatters.com|www.nytimes.com|www.rollingstone.com|www.rollingstone.com-2}} influenced by a [[post-grunge]] sound.{{r|www.thebiographychannel.co.uk|www.allmusic.com|www.allrovi.com|www.musicmight.com|www.fanpop.com-2}}&lt;ref name="hotpresssoon" /&gt;

While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14.{{r|ledgermoody}} Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles "Complicated", "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (song)|I'm with You]]". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that "[N]one of those songs aren't from me".{{r|teenspirit}}

In 2007, [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism{{r|kreviazuk}} and criticized her songwriting, saying that "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/23/AR2007072300771.html |title=Singer-Songwriters, or Just Singers? |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Nekesa |last=Mumbi Moody |date=July 23, 2007 |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character.{{r|yahoomusic}} Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her."{{r|kreviazuk}} Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band [[the Rubinoos]], sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]] for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend".{{r|billboardstole}} Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a [[Sum 41]] song. It's the [[Sex Pistols]], not the Rubinoos."{{r|yahoomusic}} In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.{{r|settle}}

===Influences===
Lavigne's earlier influences came from [[country music]] acts such as [[Garth Brooks]], [[the Dixie Chicks]] and [[Shania Twain]];{{r|teenspirit|mirrorquigley}} and [[alternative music|alternative]] [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]] and [[Janis Joplin]].{{r|musicomhinterview}} By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by [[skate punk]], [[pop punk]] and [[punk rock]] acts such as [[blink-182]], [[Sum 41]], [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Green Day]], [[the Ramones]], [[the Distillers]] and [[Hole (band)|Hole]]. She also enjoyed [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[System of a Down]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and [[the Used]]; as well as [[alternative rock|alternative]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[No Doubt]], the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Radiohead]], [[Coldplay]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Third Eye Blind]] and [[Matchbox Twenty]].{{r|capricho.abril.com.br}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/avril_lavigne_when_females_lash_out.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307203139/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/avril_lavigne_when_females_lash_out.html |archivedate=March 7, 2016}} "what music she listens to then, she [Avril] said: "Marilyn Manson, The Used, Hole, Radiohead, The Distillers, NOFX etc"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/influences-avril-lavigne-mw0001588701 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502180502/http://www.allmusic.com/album/influences-avril-lavigne-mw0001588701 |archivedate=May 2, 2016}} Influences: Avril Lavigne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/avril-lavigne-20040624 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927071503/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/avril-lavigne-20040624 |archivedate=September 27, 2016}} "I've been listening to Third Eye Blind, Oasis, Marilyn Manson and System of a Down on my iPod, but I really like the new Blink-182 record.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/avril-lavigne/related-artists/?filter%3DinfluencedBy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209005720/http://www.mtv.com/artists/avril-lavigne/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy |archivedate=December 9, 2015}} Artist Influences for Avril Lavigne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotpress.com/Avril-Lavigne/features/interviews/4-real/2651650.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215651/http://www.hotpress.com/Avril-Lavigne/features/interviews/4-real/2651650.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016}} "I listen to… I've been listening to a lot of older stuff latelyish", she murmurs tentatively.

At the moment I'm into The Distillers… Hole… I like Alanis…"&lt;br /&gt;Female frontpeople like Courtney Love and Alanis Morrissette must have been a huge deal for you when you were younger, we suggest.&lt;br /&gt;
"Well, I didn't start listening to Hole until recently", says Avril, "so y'know, I only recently really know who she is, but I listened to Alanis quite a lot. She was really inspiring."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herworldplus.com/celebs-men-sex/celebs/avril-lavigne-talks-about-black-eyeliner-and-frank-sinatra |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805174923/http://www.herworldplus.com/celebs-men-sex/celebs/avril-lavigne-talks-about-black-eyeliner-and-frank-sinatra |archivedate=August 5, 2016}} "...In high school I listened to Pennywise, Blink 182 and the Dixie Chicks. Now I love listening to Frank Sinatra."&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as [[punk subculture|punk]], something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, [[Evan Taubenfeld]], said, "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest".{{r|ultimateguitar}} Lavigne commented on the matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel&amp;nbsp;... punk, and I am ''so'' not any of them."{{r|ledgermoody}} However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music.

Lavigne eventually took on a more [[goth subculture|gothic]] style as she began her second album, ''Under My Skin'', trading her skating outfits for black [[Ballet tutu|tutus]]{{r|observer}} and developing an image marked by [[angst]].{{r|mtvundermyskin}} During ''The Best Damn Thing'' years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,{{r|imnotobsessed}} including "tight jeans and heels",{{r|inked2010}} and modelled for magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.{{r|vancouversun}} Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all&amp;nbsp;... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".{{r|imnotobsessed}}

Lavigne has been the subject of a [[conspiracy theory]] that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39921209 |title=The Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory returns |last=Estatie |first=Lamia |date=May 15, 2017 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Australia's [[KIIS 106.5]] in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, dismissing it as weird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cydney |last=Contreras|url=https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/982961/avril-lavigne-finally-responds-to-viral-conspiracy-theory-that-she-died-years-ago |title=Avril Lavigne Finally Responds to Viral Conspiracy Theory That She Died Years Ago |work=E Online |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |location=USA |date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tattoos===
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right
|quote=Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that second and do it.|Avril Lavigne{{r|inked2010}}}}

[[File:Avril Lavigne leaning, St. Petersburg (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist]]
Only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.{{r|inked2010}} Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate [[Ben Moody]]'s identical tattoo.{{r|mtvaction}} In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.{{r|inked2010|ferguson2007}} Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.{{r|inked2010}} In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.{{r|dose}}

Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and [[Brody Jenner]] each got matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs.{{r|radaronlinetattoo|usweeklytattoo}} Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for [[Inked (magazine)|''Inked'' magazine]], where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the "fuck" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her "favorite word"{{r|inked2010}}) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.{{r|inkedblog}} She added that she eventually wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name&amp;nbsp;... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life."{{r|inked2010}} In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast.{{r|mtvbrodytattoo}} The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.{{r|www.eonline.com}}

===French citizenship===
Lavigne has been legally French from birth, because her father is French and France applies [[jus sanguinis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lavigne |first=Avril |title=Interview on NRJ Radio |url=http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/eQil1_A8eYU?start=47&amp;autoplay=1 |date=February 9, 2011 |quote=I love France, in fact my father was born here, so I have applied for my French passport.

She rented an apartment and attended a [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]] school.{{r|wennfrance|malach}} She later held her second wedding in the [[South of France]].&lt;ref name="DMWedding2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2306611/Avril-Lavigne-weds-Nickelback-frontman-Chad-Kroeger-south-France.html |title=Just married!

He practiced homeopathy in London during part of his life, and became a renowned practitioner of mesmerism&amp;mdash;the theories first developed by [[Franz Mesmer]] involving [[animal magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sollier|first=Paul|year=1903|title=L'autoscopie interne|journal=[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger]]|volume=55|pages=1–41|jstor=41077720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born at [[Sennevoy-le-Haut]], the son of Charles Jean-Baptiste Dupotet, seigneur de La Chapelle et de Sennevoy, and  Pierrette Babeau Simone. He was married twice, to Aglaé Saunier in Paris in 1833, and the second time to Marie Isaure Hérault. He died in Paris and is buried in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;C.A.P. 291 (1843), Allée Samson, Division 23, Row 3, 15th tomb from the left; gravestone broken.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Du Potet was a highly successful mesmerist. Some attributed this to the fact he was missing the thumb on his right hand.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=James Fernandez |title=Autobiographical Recollections of the Medical Profession |location=London |publisher=Churchill |year=1874 |oclc=559634098 |url=https://archive.org/stream/autobiographica01clargoog#page/n180/mode/2up |page=161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was such, apparently, that a man was convicted of murder and executed based on evidence given by "one of Du Potet's clairvoyantes".&lt;ref name=blackmagic&gt;{{cite journal |year=1890 |title=Black Magic in Science |journal=[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]] |volume=6 |issue=34 |pages=265–75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_jgbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272}}&lt;/ref&gt; He operated a free school of magnetism in Paris from 1826 on,&lt;ref name=Deveney&gt;{{cite book |last=Deveney |first=John Patrick |title=Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician |series=SUNY series in Western esoteric traditions |location=Albany, New York |publisher=State University of New York |year=1997 |isbn=9780585042800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhs9obpHqhIC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=Jules+Dupotet+Denis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSZu3BsvzA&amp;sig=3Loraq3bkFZC8oqRCZHaraGSDU4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HVKzU4raKIvooAShtoCYDQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jules%20Dupotet%20Denis&amp;f=false |pages=53&amp;ndash;55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1837 to 1845 practised as a homeopathic physician in London,&lt;ref name=Goodrick&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodrick-Clarke |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke |title=The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction |location=Oxford/New York |publisher=Oxford University |year=2008 |isbn=9780195320992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPwoK5XYXrAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Goodrick+Clarke,+The+Western+Esoteric+Traditions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QWSzU5L9M4L6oATB44KoDg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dupotet&amp;f=false |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he successfully treated [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] girls at the [[North London Hospital]]&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; and according to a letter to the editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'' his experiments became the talk of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1837|title=Animal Magnetism|journal=[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]]|pages=507–509|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVk9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For du Potet, who was in correspondence with [[Magnetizer|mesmerists]] worldwide, mesmerism was, not unlike [[Utopian socialism]], an aid in bringing about social transformation, even a revolution.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Caryn Cossé|title=Revolution, Romanticism, and the Afro-Creole Protest Tradition in Louisiana, 1718&amp;mdash;1868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wwK-IQ4UZIC&amp;pg=PT177|date=1997-02-01|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807153451|pages=177–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1890 article in the English occult magazine ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' praises him as an ardent supporter of mesmerism whose "powerful voice" might have stopped the "travesty" of hypnotism.&lt;ref name=blackmagic/&gt;

Du Potet also pursued occult applications of mesmerism. [[Eliphas Levi]] praised him highly in his ''History of Magic'', and said that magnetism had unlocked for him the secrets of magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Eliphas |title=The History of Magic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIVo4hmp6ooC&amp;pg=PA339|year=1999 |publisher=Weiser |isbn=9780877289296 |pages=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Levi, he believed that trance enabled contact with the dead and with never incarnated spirits, and his circle believed in [[Psychokinesis|remote influence]] by means of magnetic currents.&lt;ref name=Deveney/&gt; He was a member of the [[Theosophical Society]]; his writings were quoted extensively by [[Helena Blavatsky]], who regarded him as an adept.&lt;ref name=Goodrick/&gt; In ''[[The Discovery of the Unconscious]]'', [[Henri Ellenberger]] considers him to have "developed&amp;nbsp;... delusions of grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellenburger |first=Henri F. |authorlink=Henri Ellenberger |title=The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ke1jd_e7AyYC&amp;pg=PA906&amp;dq=Jules+Dupotet+Denis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6WezU7C8FsXdoAT-6IBg&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=incarnation%20of%20magnetism&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1970 |page=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Potet published and edited the ''Journal du magnetisme''&lt;ref name="Matlock"/&gt; from 1845 to 1861. Books he wrote include ''Introduction to the Study of Animal Magnetism'' (1838) and ''La magie dévoilée et la science occulte'' (1852), a copy of which was owned by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref name="Matlock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matlock|first=Jann|year=2000|title=Ghostly Politics|journal=[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]|volume=30|issue=3|pages=53–71|jstor=1566343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bassem Youssef''' (born [[Egypt]]) is a senior American FBI agent. He was the highest ranking American agent of Coptic descent employed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as of 2009, as a Unit Chief in the FBI’s [[Counterterrorism]] Division.  Prior to holding this position, Youssef coordinated the national counterterrorism investigation into the Islamic Group, the organization responsible for the first [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] bombing.

==Career==
Youssef was born in Egypt in a Coptic Christian family.&lt;ref&gt;FBI whistleblowers: hearing before the Subcommittee United States. Congress. House. Committee on the Judiciary. Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security - 2009 "Bassem Youssef Bassem Youssef is the FBI's highest-ranking Arab American agent. ... His background as an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian and native Arabic speaker should have made him one of the FBI's most valued and appreciated ..."&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks fluent Arabic (the highest ranking FBI official with this skill).

In 1994, he earned the Intelligence Community’s prestigious and coveted award, the [[National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal]], awarded by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).  The award was for outstanding accomplishments in a terrorism case involving an al-Qaeda-related investigation.  

After obtaining the DCI award, he was selected by the former FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]] to head of the FBI’s overseas office with responsibility for Saudi Arabia and the contiguous Gulf States, including UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Bahrain and Qatar.  The FBI’s internal inspection of that office, conducted in 2000, highly praised Youssef’s performance.  Inspection reports are kept confidential within the FBI, and are tasked with identifying problems in various programs. 

According to an FBI report drafted in 2000, within three months of his arrival in Saudi Arabia Youssef's "efforts led to the establishment of direct communications with senior officials of the Mabahith [Saudi Arabia's security service] which had previously been unavailable to US Embassy personnel." These contacts were crucial in establishing a first-ever meeting between then-FBI director Louis Freeh and Saudi officials.

==Whistleblower==
In July, 2006 the Justice Department's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] concluded that the FBI illegally retaliated against Youssef because he had allegedly made whistleblower disclosures to the Director of the FBI and a [[Member of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt; United States of America Congressional Record - Page 6365 "Consider the case of FBI Special Agent Bassem Youssef. According to a Washington Post article from July 18, 2006, an internal investigation conducted by the United States Justice Department concluded that Youssef, the FBI's highest"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benito Salas Vargas''' (1770 – 18 September 1816) was a military and social leader during [[Colombia]]'s (then known as [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]]) independence war (1810–1819). He fought against [[Pablo Morillo]] during the [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada]]. In 1811 he joined the forces of [[Brigadier]] Jose Diaz,&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; as part of the army of the United Provinces of New Granada commanded by General Antonio Baraya.&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; On December 8, 1812, in [[Timaná]], he swore recognition to the Congress of the United Provinces.&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; He fought with the troops of [[Antonio Nariño]].&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; On 29 June 1816, he fought in the battle of Cuchilla del Tambo&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; where the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriot troops]] were defeated by the royalists commanded by [[Juan José de Sámano y Uribarri]]. On July 10, 1816, '''Salas''' was captured.&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt;

In September 1816, by order of the [[Purificación, Tolima|Purificación]] Tribunal,&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt; Salas was executed&lt;ref name="Crónicas de Bogotá, CAPITULO XLVI

His head was buried in the terrain which would later become ''La Manguita'' [[Hacienda]]. In 1936, the Colombian government inaugurated Neiva's airport in the hacienda, and renamed it in 1986 as the [[Benito Salas Airport]] in honour of Salas.&lt;ref name="lanacion" /&gt;

He then went on to represent the US at the 2009 CPISRA World Championships, 2011 CPISRA World Championships, the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], the 2015 CPISRA World Championships and the 2015 Parapan American Games.  He has over 60 caps for the US national team.

== Cerebral palsy football ==
Boarman is a CP5 classified footballer,&lt;ref name=rostersalou/&gt; serving as a defender when playing for the national team.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Boarman has over 60 caps for the USPNT.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/para-soccer/athletes/Bryce-Boarman|title=Bryce Boarman|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Team USA|publisher=US Olympic Committee|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Paralympic sportspeople in the United States first recognized his talent, they tried to recruit him for athletics.  After he expressed more interest in soccer, they put him in touch with the USPNT who then went on to invite him to a national team training tryout.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the 2008, Boarman was a selected to the USPNT later that year.

She is best known for popularizing the phrase ''[[the personal is political]]'' in a 1969 essay of the same name.&lt;ref name="Smith2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Dale M.|title=Poets Beyond the Barricade: Rhetoric, Citizenship, and Dissent after 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUNq2Ni019wC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=2012-01-15|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817317492|pages=153–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also conceived the 1968 [[Miss America protest]] and was one of the four women who hung a women's liberation banner over the balcony at the [[Miss America Pageant]], disrupting the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Paul D.|title=Radical Feminists: A Guide to an American Subculture|url=|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598843576|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lx5TlteHLvAC&amp;pg=PA124 124ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hanisch was born and raised in Iowa, and worked as a wire services reporter in Des Moines before leaving to join the [[Delta Ministry]] in Mississippi in 1965, inspired by the [[Freedom Summer]] reports the year before. There, she met the co-founders of the Southern Conference Education Fund (SCEF), [[Anne Braden]] and husband [[Carl Braden]], who hired her to run the SCEF NY office.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller1999/&gt;

==Feminist activism and writing==
By early 1968, Hanisch had secured the SCEF offices for the weekly meetings of the New York Radical Women, and it remained their base until the group dissolved in the early 70's.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller1999&gt;Brownmiller, Susan (1999). ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution''. Dial Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

She co-founded and currently co-edits with Kathy Scarbrough ''Meeting Ground online'', the third version of "Meeting Ground." The statement of purpose from 1977 describes itself as providing "an ongoing place to hammer out ideas about theory, strategy and tactics for the women’s liberation movement and for the general radical movement of working men and women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetinggroundonline.org/about-meeting-ground/ ''Meeting Ground online''] website "about page" with January 1977 statement of purpose, ''accessed August 31, 2014.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Hanish, along with Scarbrough, [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] and [[Kathie Sarachild]] initiated "Forbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of 'Gender'", which they described as an "open statement from 48 radical feminists from seven countries".&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetinggroundonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GENDER-Statement-InterActive-930.pdf Forbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of 'Gender'"], at ''Meeting Ground online'', August 12, 2013, updated with more signatures September 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 Michelle Goldberg in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described it as expressing their “alarm” at “threats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michelle (August 4, 2014). [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2 "What Is a Woman? The dispute between radical feminism and transgenderism"], ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4295">{{History of Indonesia}}
'''Dalem Samprangan''' was a king of [[Bali]] who governed under the suzerainty of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Majapahit]] Empire (1293-c. 1527), and belonged to a dynasty of immigrants from [[Java]]. The exact dating of his reign is unclear; the sources point at either the second half of the 14th century or the early 16th century.

==Reign==

According to the 18th-century chronicle [[Babad Dalem]],&lt;ref&gt;I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), ''Babad Dalem. Teks dan Terjemahan''. Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalem Samprangan succeeded his father [[Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan]] who had been established as vassal king by Majapahit after the conquest of Bali in 1343. His residence was [[Samprangan]] in the present-day [[Gianyar]] regency, to the southeast of the ancient royal seat Bedaulu.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Wiener, ''Visible and invisible realms: Power, magic, and colonial conquest in Bali''. Chicago &amp; London: Chicago University Press 1995, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle characterizes him as an incompetent and vain figure. He spent much time on his outward appearance, and let his ministers wait in the council hall for him to show up. This behaviour irritated the grandees of the kingdom. After waiting for hours in vain one morning, one of them, Kubon Klapa, left the palace in anger and looked up Dalem Samprangan's youngest brother Ketut, who was a well-known gambler. He persuaded the prince to take royal titles and offered him his residence in [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]], a village in the present-day [[Klungkung]] residency, near the south coast. In that way, the Samprangan palace quickly lapsed into obscurity, while Gelgel rose as the political centre of the island under the new king [[Dalem Ketut]].&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Berg, ''De middeljavaansche historische traditië''. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 123-4.&lt;/ref&gt; No more is heard in the ''Babad Dalem'' about Samprangan which became a minor village immediately to the east of [[Gianyar]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Vickers, "Central Bali: Gianyar Regency", in Eric Oey (ed.), ''Bali: Island of the gods''. Berkeley: Periplus, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Dalem Tarukan==

A complex of legendary texts called ''Babad Pulasari'' relate the fortunes of Dalem Samprangan's other brother Dalem Tarukan, who had a residence close to modern [[Ubud]]. He fell out with his royal brother which resulted in a series of internecine wars on the island. At length, Dalem Tarukan was defeated, and his descendants were demoted from the [[Ksatria]] caste. Certain Balinese texts date the defeat of Tarukan in 1502.&lt;ref&gt;http://vxu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206791/FULLTEXT01 , p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This is incompatible with the ''Babad Dalem'', which indicates Dalem Samprangan about one generation after the Majapahit conquest of 1343. The historical background of these persons and events is therefore uncertain.

==Place in the list of Balinese rulers==

In the central Balinese temple [[Pura Besakih]], the most important shrine is Pura Padharman Dalem Gelgel, which honours a series of six ancient Balinese kings. After Dewa Tegal Besung (often identified as Dalem Ketut), who is accorded a ''meru'' (tower-like structure) with 11 roofs, Dewa Samprangan follows with a ''meru'' with 9 roofs, in turn followed by Dewa Enggong ([[Dalem Baturenggong]]) and three later kings.&lt;ref&gt;David Stuart-Fox, ''Pura Besakih: Tempel, religion and society in Bali''. Leiden: KITLV Press 2002, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalem Samprangan is also listed as king in the early religious text ''Usana Bali'', as successor of Ken Angrok and predecessor of Dalem Baturenggong.&lt;ref&gt;R. Friederich, "De Oesana Bali", ''Tijdschrift voor Neerland's Indië'' 9-3 1847, p. 286. [[Ken Arok|Ken Angrok]] is otherwise known as the founder king of [[Singhasari]] on [[Java]]&lt;/ref&gt; All this complicates the question of his original place in the succession of Balinese rulers.

The Klallam language is still spoken as a [[second language]] by some members of the four indigenous Klallam communities: the [[Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington|Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe]], and the [[Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Olympic Peninsula]], the [[Port Gamble Band of S’Klallam Indians]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Kitsap Peninsula]],as well as the [[Scia'new First Nation|Beecher Bay Klallam]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

==Biography==
Sampson was born '''Hazel Hall''' to William Hall and Ida Balch Hall on May 26, 1910, in [[Jamestown, Washington]].&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; She was the granddaughter of Chief [[James Balch]], the founder of Jamestown and the namesake of both the town and the [[Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington]].&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Her parents taught her the [[Klallam language]] as a native speaker, though she later learned [[English language|English]] as a second language.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Her father, William Hall, founded the first [[Indian Shaker Church]] on the Olympic Peninsula in [[Dungeness, Washington]], circa 1910.&lt;ref name=pdn2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Lower Elwha celebrate elder's 101st birthday |url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20110516/news/305169988/lower-elwha-celebrate-elder-8217-s-101st-birthday |work=[[Peninsula Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Sampson and her husband, Edward C. Sampson Sr., moved from Jamestown to [[Port Angeles, Washington]]. There, the Sampsons became one of the thirteen founding families who purchased and owned land on the [[Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe|Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation]].&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; She was married to Edward Sampson for 75 years, until his death in 1995.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; She was also a member of the Jamestown S'Klallam Band, which was established as a separate Klallam political entity during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; According to Jamestown chairman Ron Allen, Sampson, "considered herself a S'Klallam first. She associated closely with all three bands" in Washington state.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;

Hazel Sampson was a key contributor in the work to preserve the Klallam language.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; [[Timothy Montler]], a professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[University of North Texas]], began working on Klallam language preservation beginning in 1990.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Montler partnered with [[Jamie Valadez]], a Klallam language teacher at Port Angeles High School and member of the Lower Elwha Klallam, compile Klallam language materials and teaching tools.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; The two began work to save Klallam from potential extinction.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

Montler and Valdez collaborated closely with local native speaking Klallam, including Hazel and Ed Sampson, [[Adeline Smith]] and [[Bea Charles]].&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; In 1999, Montler published several guidebooks and lesson plans aimed at teaching Klallam language basics through [[storytelling]].&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; Montler also published the first Klallam dictionary in 2012 through the University of Washington Press.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; He used terms and definitions contributed by Hazel Sampson, Smith and Charles to compile the dictionary.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;

Hazel Sampson had declined to be named as an official member of Montler and Valadez's project, citing tradition.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; However, she collaborated closely with her husband and other members.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; The researchers believed she understood the Klallam language better than her husband and the other members of the project.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; According to Valadez, "She said, 'This is Ed's work.' She was very traditional."&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; [[Adeline Smith]] died in March 2013, leaving Sampson as the last surviving, native speaker of the Klallam language.&lt;ref name=pdn3&gt;{{cite news |first=Arwyn |last=Rice |title=Lower Elwha tribal elder Adeline Smith, 95, dies |url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20130320/NEWS/303209995/lower-elwha-tribal-elder-adeline-smith-95-dies |work=[[Peninsula Daily News]] |publisher=|date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel Sampson resided in her Port Angeles home until her death in 2014.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; She died on February 4, 2014, at the age of 103.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;  Her death marked the passing of the last native speaker of Klallam, though some younger members continued to speak it as a second language.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;  According to Klallam cultural teacher Jamie Valadez, "She was the last one...[Her death] changes the dynamics of everything...They carry so much knowledge of our culture and traditions."&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt; Sampson was survived by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren; great-great grandchildren and great-great-great grandchildren.&lt;ref name=pdn/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

'''Heidi Hartmann''' is a [[Feminist economics|feminist economist]] who is founder and president of the Washington-based [[Institute for Women's Policy Research]] (IWPR), a research organization created to conduct women-centered, public policy research. She is an expert on the intersection of women, economics and public policy. Dr. Hartmann is also a Research Professor at [[George Washington University]] and the editor of the ''[[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]]''.

== Early life ==
On August 14, 1945, Hartmann was born to Henry Hartmann and Hedwig (Bercher) Hartmann in Elizabeth, New Jersey. She attended [[Swarthmore College]], where she received a [[B.A.]] in [[economics]] with honors in 1967. During that same year, she married Frank Blair Cochran, birthed Jessica Lee Cochran then divorced a year later. Hartmann then attended [[Yale University]], where she received a M. Phil. in economics in 1972 and a Ph.D in the subject in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree= Ph.D | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi |date=1974|title=Capitalism and women's work in the home, 1900-1930|publisher=[[Yale University]]|oclc=933172723}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, she married John Varick Wells and had two daughters—Katherine Lina Hartman Wells and Laura Cameron Hartmann Wells.&lt;ref name="Cicarelli, James 2003"&gt;Cicarelli, James, and Julianne Cicarelli.

== Career ==

Hartmann began her career in 1969 as a computer programmer and researcher for the city planning department of [[New Haven, Connecticut]], from 1969 until 1972. After, she became an acting instructor at Yale University for one year. She moved to [[New York City]], where from 1974 to 1976 she was a visiting assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. Hartmann then took her talents to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she worked for two years as a senior research economist at the Office of Research of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and then for eight years as a staff member of the National Academy of Science/National Research Council. Here she worked on many reports listed in the 'Publications' section below.

Before finding IWPR, Hartmann did many things. She began her career in 1969 as a computer programmer and researcher for the city planning department of New Haven, Connecticut, from 1969 until 1972. After, she became an acting instructor at Yale University for one year. She moved to New York City, where from 1974 to 1976 she was a visiting assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. Hartmann then took her talents to Washington, D.C., where she worked for two years as a senior research economist at the Office of Research of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and then for eight years as a staff member of the National Academy of Science/National Research Council. Here she worked on many reports listed in the 'Publications' section below. Hartmann held&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Heidi.

== Expertise ==

=== Women's contribution to the economy ===

Hartmann believes women's part in the economy is split in two halves: work for pay and family care. Women are increasingly getting out of the home and into the marketplace but at the same time are still taking on most of the workload at home. In order to achieve equality for women, Hartmann argues that society needs to improve opportunities in the labor market and also make the ability of women and men to make work and home care more manageable.&lt;ref name="Hartmann, Heidi 2007"&gt;Hartmann, Heidi. "A Feminist Work and Family Agenda". Institute for Women's Policy Research. 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===

Hartmann argues women's employment progress has significantly increased over the past five decades. Women have entered occupations, that have historically been closed off to them and are able to contribute to their family income and the economy more than ever before. According to a 2014 report by Women's Policy Research,&lt;ref name="iwpr.org"/&gt; growth for women's occupations over the past seven years was strongest in professional and business services (42,000 jobs were gained by women). Despite all this, Hartmann still thinks that women's employment has a long way to go—see Social Security and Wage Gap/Discrimination.

=== Social Security ===

Social Security provides many advantages as well as disadvantages for women, according to Hartmann's studies. In terms of advantages, it covers everyone (including women) that has worked at least ten years at a salary of $4,360 per year. It provides benefits to wives regardless of whether they have worked for pay or not, former wives (who had at least a ten-year marriage) and for widows. Social Security also is adaptive to inflation processes and does not discriminate against lower or higher earning women workers. Hartmann also makes note of disadvantages of the United States' current social security system that are particular to women. In 2013, Social Security cuts (known as Chained CPI) hurt women more than it helps them. Elderly women rely on Social Security for most of their income, because they have less access to other forms of income such as pensions and savings that men have more access too. Besides the recent cuts to benefits, years when women are caregiving are averaged as zeroes, which drag's down a woman's overall average income. Additionally, there are no benefits to caregiving outside of marriage, whereas the married caregiver can received spousal benefits from Social Security.&lt;ref name="Hartmann, Heidi 2007"/&gt;

=== Wage gap/discrimination ===

Hartmann advocates greatly for equal opportunity in the labor market. In "Still A Man's Labor Market: The Long-Term Earnings Gap; Unnecessary Losses", Hartmann argues that the wage gap has a major influence on many aspects of family life—such as choices, poverty rates, single mother's ability to care for their children and older women's retirement rates. If women's wages were higher, Hartmann concludes that nearly all families with women earners would have a higher standard of living. She attributes the lower average earnings of women not to their preferences for low wage work, but because of the degree of sex segregation. Labor market discrimination leads to lower earnings for women, meaning women cannot pay for child care, which takes them away from their jobs to commit to their children, a commitment that in turn contributes to discrimination against them in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Heidi. "Still A Man's Labor Market: The Long-Term Earnings Gap; Unnecessary Losses: Costs to Americans of the Lack of Family and Medical Leave". Rep. Washington, D.C.: Institute for Women's Policy Research, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann recognizes the gender wage gap across all racial and ethnic groups. According to a 2013 report, women of all racial and ethnic groups earn less than men of the same group, and also earn less than white men. Hispanic workers have lower median weekly earnings than white, black and Asian workers, the lowest of any race/ethnic group reported on. Asian workers have the highest median weekly earnings—primarily because of higher rates of educational attainment for both males and females.

=== Comparable worth ===

This concept, created by Hartmann, is grounded in her belief that equal pay for jobs of equal value. "The general goal of a comparable worth strategy is pay equity—equitable occupational wage rates that are not influenced by the sex, race, or ethnicity of the incumbents." (''Comparable Worth'', 4). She emphasized a certain type of wage discrimination that arises when a firm is substantially segregated by sex and the two groups are not performing the same sort of tasks, but tasks that are of "comparable worth" to the employer (Women, Work, and Wages 9). Hartmann's exploration of comparable worth forced her to not only look into the issue of wage gaps between men and women but also the significance of gender bias/sex segregation in employment. She defines sex segregation in the workplace as the concentration of men and women in different jobs that are predominantly of a single sex. Hartmann works towards a goal of complete integration, with different proportions of men and women within every occupation identical to their representation in the labor force as a whole. She points out, however, that due to differences between men and women deeply rooted in certain cultures, this goal may take decades to reach. Therefore, an appropriate policy goal would be to eliminate barriers in the way of women's full exercise of employment rights.

=== Feminist scholarship ===

==== Patriarchy ====
According to Hartmann, patriarchy is defined as "controlling women's access to resources and their sexuality, which in turn, allows men to control women's labor power, both for the purpose of serving men in many personal and sexual ways and for the purpose of rearing children". Before capitalism, a patriarchal system was established in which men controlled the labor of women and children in the family, and that through this they learned the techniques of hierarchal control. Today, Hartmann argues the labor market perpetuates this hierarchal control. Low wages keep women dependent on men, encouraging them to marry. Married women must perform domestic tasks for their husbands, and thus men benefit—both from earning higher wages and by not having to participate in domestic tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi I. | title = Capitalism, patriarchy, and job segregation by sex | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]], special issue: Women and the Workplace: The Implications of Occupational Segregation | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 137–169 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/493283 | jstor = 3173001 | date = Spring 1976 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/493283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marxism and feminism ====
In 1981, Hartmann wrote the lead article "The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism" in the publication ''Women and Revolution''. The article argues that "the marriage of Marxism and feminism has been like that between husband and wife depicted in English common law; Marxism and feminism are one, and that one is Marxism ... either we need a healthier marriage or we need a divorce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi | chapter = The unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism: towards a more progressive union | editor-last = Sargent | editor-first = Lydia | editor-link = Lydia Sargent | title = Women and revolution: a discussion of the unhappy marriage of Marxism and Feminism | pages = 1–42 | publisher = South End Press | location = Boston, Massachusetts | series = South End Press Political Controversies Series | year = 1981 | isbn = 9780896080621 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann argues that the attempts to integrate Marxism and feminism are not sufficient enough because they don't incorporate the feminist struggle into the larger struggle against capitalism—it places the concerns of class over those of gender. Hartmann believes Marxism provides good analysis but is sex-blind. She says the way that radical feminists describe characteristics of men- competitive, rationalistic, dominating- are much like the characteristics of capitalistic society. Therefore, it is in a capitalist society that it makes sense for people to look down on women as emotional or irrational—looking at them as "dependent". Because of this, a feminism analysis is also necessary to describe the relations between men and women. She says that society must use the strengths of both Marxism and feminism to judge capitalism and acknowledge the present situation of women in it.

==== Double-bind dilemma ====
Women face a double-bind in many aspects of society, but in particular the economy. A woman is expected to work and provide for her family, while also making sure everything is taken care of in the home. In "Contemporary Marxist Theory and Practice: A Feminist Critique", Hartmann along with Ann Markusen argue that in order to overcome the issues feminist economists are working to correct (wage gap, discrimination in the workplace, and social security), the relation of women's reproductive processes to economic production need to be emphasized along with their importance to being a part of the actual work force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hartmann | first1 = Heidi I. | last2 = Markusen | first2 = Ann R. | title = Contemporary Marxist theory and practice: a feminist critique | journal = [[Review of Radical Political Economics]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–94 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] | doi = 10.1177/048661348001200210 | date = July 1980 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/048661348001200210 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann also says that although a couple's share of work outside of the home has become more equal over the past thirty years, the couple's share of housework has hardly changed. In order to progress in the area of housework, the family needs to be understood not just as a unit of common ancestry but also as a location where conflicts regarding production and redistribution are sorted out. Conflicts of production deal with how housework is distributed, the standards for this, and who will work for wages outside the home. Conflicts of redistribution deal with how the money should be spent and who will decide this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi I. | title = The family as the locus of gender, class, and political struggle: the example of housework | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 366–394 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/493813 | jstor = 3173752 | date = Spring 1981 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/493813 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards and honors ===
Hartmann has won various awards. In 1994, she won the [[MacArthur Fellows Program#1994|MacArthur Fellowship Award]]—a five-year grant from the MacArthur Foundation give to individuals who show exceptional creativity for their research and the prospect for more in the future—for her work on women and economics. She is also the recipient of two honorary degrees.

[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] '''Henry Steel Olcott''' (2 August 1832 – 17 February 1907) was an American military officer, journalist, lawyer and the co-founder and first President of the [[Theosophical Society]].

Olcott was the first well-known American of European ancestry to make a formal [[conversion to Buddhism]]. His subsequent actions as president of the Theosophical Society helped create a renaissance in the study of Buddhism. Olcott is considered a [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] for his efforts in interpreting [[Buddhism]] through a [[Western culture|Westernized]] lens.

Olcott was a major revivalist of Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]] and he is still honored in Sri Lanka for these efforts.
Olcott has been called by Sri Lankans "one of the heroes in the struggle of our [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence]] and a pioneer of the present religious, national and cultural revival".

==Biographical overview==
[[File:A Replica of the Certification Letter written By Henry Steel Olcott Mentioning that He took Pancha Sila at Vijayananda Vihara Galle.jpg|left|thumb|A replica of the Certification Letter written By Henry Steel Olcott mentioning that he took [[Five Precepts|Pancha Sila]] for the first time at Vijayananda [[Galle]].]]

Olcott was born on 2 August 1832 in [[Orange, New Jersey]], the oldest of six children, to [[Presbyterian]] businessman Henry Wyckoff Olcott and Emily Steele Olcott.  As a child, Olcott lived on his father's [[New Jersey]] farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosophical.org/resources/library/olcott-centenary/family/olcott-family.htm Janet Kerschner, ''The Olcott Family''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218213500/http://www.theosophical.org/resources/library/olcott-centenary/family/olcott-family.htm |date=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his teens he attended first the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]] and later [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/46-96-7/th-sbdo.htm Remembering H. S. Olcott]&lt;/ref&gt; where he joined the [[List of St. Anthony Hall members|St. Anthony Hall]] fraternity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/baird-s-manual-of-american-college-fraternities-1879-delta-psi Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities ...: Information and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; a milieu of well-known people.   In 1851 his father's business failed and he had to leave the university.

In the early 1850s, Olcott became interested in [[Spiritualism]] and published letters in the ''Spiritual Telegraph'' under the pseudonym "Amherst."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosophy.ph/onlinebooks/odl/odl120.html Olcott's Old Diary Leaves, pg. 322]; Amherst, "A Word to Mediums," ''Spiritual Telegraph'', October 27, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1858 to 1860 Olcott was the agricultural correspondent for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' and the ''Mark Lane Express'', but occasionally submitted articles on other subjects.  He also published a genealogy of his family extending back to Thomas Olcott, one of the founders of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1636.

In 1860 Olcott married Mary Epplee Morgan, daughter of the rector of Trinity parish, [[New Rochelle, New York]]. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy.

He served in the US Army during the [[American Civil War]] and afterward was admitted as the Special Commissioner of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in New York. He was later promoted to the rank of colonel and transferred to the Department of the Navy in Washington, DC.  He was well respected, and in 1865, following the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]], assisted in the investigation of the assassination.

In 1868 he became a lawyer specializing in insurance, revenue, and fraud.

[[File:Peopleotherworld Safar Ali Bek.jpg|thumb|180px|The spirit [[materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of Safar Ali Bek, a drawing from Olcott's book ''People from the Other World''.]]
In 1874 he became aware of the [[séance]]s of the [[Eddy Brothers]] of [[Chittenden, Vermont]].  His interest aroused, Olcott wrote an article for the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'', in which he investigated Eddy Farms. His article was popular enough that other papers, such as the ''[[New York Daily Graphic]]'', republished it.  His 1874 publication ''People from the Other World'' began with his early articles concerning the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] movement.

Also in 1874, Olcott met [[Helena Blavatsky]] while both were visiting the Eddy farm.  His foundational interest in the Spiritualist movement and his budding relationship with Blavatsky helped foster his development of spiritual philosophy.

Olcott continued to act as a lawyer during the first few years of the establishment of the [[Theosophical Society]], in addition to being a financial supporter of the [[new religious movement]].  In early 1875 Olcott was asked by prominent Spiritualists to investigate an accusation of fraud against the mediums Jenny and Nelson Holmes, who had claimed to materialize the famous "spirit control" [[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]] (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 269–277).

In 1880 [[Helena Blavatsky]] and Olcott became the first Westerners to receive the refuges and precepts, the ceremony by which one traditionally becomes a Buddhist; thus Blavatsky was the first Western woman to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Perspectives in Buddhism: Buddhism today : issues &amp; global dimensions'', Madhusudan Sakya, Cyber Tech Publications, 2011, page 244&lt;/ref&gt;  Olcott once described his adult faith as "pure, primitive Buddhism," but his was a unique sort of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen. "Henry Steele Olcott and 'Protestant Buddhism'" pg.285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophical Society==
From 1874 on, Olcott's spiritual growth and development with Blavatsky and other spiritual leaders would lead to the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]].
In 1875, Olcott, Blavatsky, and others, notably [[William Quan Judge]], formed the Theosophical Society in New York City, USA. Olcott financially supported the earliest years of the Theosophical Society and was acting President while Blavatsky served as the Society's Secretary.

In December 1878, they left New York in order to move the headquarters of the Society to India.
They landed at [[Bombay]] on February 16, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/mahatma/ml-ccpre.htm Combined Chronology of The Mahatma Letters – Preface]&lt;/ref&gt;  Olcott set out to experience the native country of his spiritual leader, the [[Buddha]].  The headquarters of the  Society were established at [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], [[Chennai]] as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]], starting also the [[Adyar Library|Adyar Library and Research Centre]] within the headquarters.

While in India, Olcott strove to receive the translations of sacred oriental texts which were becoming available as a result of western researches.  His intent was to avoid the Westernized interpretations often encountered in America, and to discover the pure message of texts from the [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]], and [[Zoroastrian]] religions, in order to properly educate Westerners.

Olcott's research and translation efforts put him in dialogue with early, ostensibly secular [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[religious studies|scholars of religion]]. He corresponded extensively with [[Max Müller]], asking questions related to his interest in Hinduism and Buddhism and sharing discoveries from his travels in South Asia. He also personally met both Müller and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] at least once at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 122-123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olcott's main religious interest was Buddhism, and he is commonly known for his work in [[Sri Lanka]]. After a two-year correspondence with Ven. Piyarathne Thissa, he and Blavatsky arrived in the then capital [[Colombo]] on May 16, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/030824/plus/9.html|title=That controversial clash|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]]|last=Ranatunga|first=D.

On that day Olcott and Blavatsky were formally acknowledged as Buddhists, although Olcott noted that they had previously declared themselves Buddhists, while still living in America.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott in Caldwell (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Sri Lanka Olcott strove to revive Buddhism within the region, while compiling the tenets of Buddhism for the education of Westerners.  It was during this period that he wrote the ''Buddhist Catechism'' (1881), which is still used today.

The Theosophical Society built several Buddhist schools in Ceylon, most notably [[Ananda College]] and [[Nalanda College, Colombo]], [[Dharmaraja College]] in [[Kandy]], [[Mahinda College]] in [[Galle]],Musaeus Girls College, Colombo [[Maliyadeva College]] in [[Kurunegala]] and [[ Dharmasoka College]] in [[Ambalangoda]].
Olcott also acted as an adviser to the committee appointed to design a Buddhist flag in 1885. The [[Buddhist flag]] designed with the assistance of Olcott was later adopted as a symbol by the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] and as the universal flag of all [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist traditions]].

Helena Blavatsky eventually went to live in London, where she died in 1891, but Olcott stayed in India and pursued the work of the Theosophical Society there.
Olcott's role in the Theosophical Society would still be as President, but the induction of [[Annie Besant]] sparked a new era of the movement. Upon his death, the Theosophical Society elected her to take over as President and leader of the movement.

==Buddhist catechism==

===Text of "Buddhist Catechism"===
[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|300px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]
Olcott's "Buddhist Catechism", composed in 1881, is one of his most enduring contributions to the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, and remains in use there today. The text outlines what Olcott saw to be the basic doctrines of Buddhism, including the life of the [[Buddha]], the message of the [[Dharma]], the role of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The text also treats how the Buddha's message correlates with contemporary society.  Olcott was considered by South Asians and others as a Buddhist revivalist.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen. "Henry Steel Olcott and 'Protestant Buddhism'" pg.283&lt;/ref&gt;

It is presented in the same format of question and answer used in some  Christian [[catechism]]s.  Here are a few examples from that text:

{{quote|
'''Q.''' Would you call a person a Buddhist who has merely been born of Buddhist parents?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' Certainly not.  A Buddhist is one who not only professes belief in the Buddha as the noblest of Teachers, in the Doctrine preached by Him, and in the brotherhood of [[Arahant (Buddhism)|Arhats]], but practices his Precepts in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott's ''Buddhist Catechism'', pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Q.''' What is Karma?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' A causation operating on the moral, as well as physical and other planes.  Buddhists say there is no miracle in human affairs: what a man sows that he must still reap.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Q.''' What other good words have been used to express the essence of Buddhism?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' Self-culture and universal love.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott's ''Buddhist Catechism'', pg 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[Four sights]] and how they impacted the Buddha:&lt;br /&gt;
'''26. Q:''' Why should these sights, so familiar to everybody, have caused him to go into the jungle?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' We often see such signs. He had not; and they made a deep impression on his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
'''27. Q:''' Why had he not also seen them?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A:''' The astrologers had foretold at his birth that he would one day resign his kingdom and become a Buddha. The King, his father, not wishing to lose his son, had carefully prevented his seeing any sights that might suggest to him human misery and death. No one was allowed even to speak of such things to the Prince. He was almost like a prisoner in his lovely palaces and flower gardens. They were surrounded with high walls; and inside everything was made as beautiful as possible, so that he might not want to go and see the sorrow and distress that are in the world. &lt;br /&gt;
'''28. Q:''' Was he so kind-hearted that his father feared he might really want to sacrifice himself for the world's sake?&lt;br /&gt;
'''A:''' Yes; he seems to have felt for all being so strong a pity and love as that.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott's ''Buddhist Catechism'', pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''55. Q.''' Why does ignorance cause suffering? &lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' Because it makes us prize what is not worth prizing, grieve for that we should not grieve for, consider real what is not real but only illusory, and pass our lives in the pursuit of worthless objects, neglecting what is in reality most valuable. &lt;br /&gt;

'''56. Q.''' And what is that which is most valuable? &lt;br /&gt;
'''A.''' To know the whole secret of man's existence and destiny, so that we may estimate at no more than their actual value and this life and its relations; so that we may live in a way to insure the greatest happiness and the least suffering for our fellow-men and ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Olcott's ''Buddhist Catechism'', pg, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Olcott's catechism reflects a new, post-Enlightenment interpretation of traditional Buddhist tenets.  As [[David McMahan]] stated, "[Olcott] allied Buddhism with scientific rationalism in implicit criticism of orthodox Christianity, but went well beyond the tenets of conventional science in extrapolating from the Romantic- and [[Transcendentalist]]-influenced 'occult sciences' of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'' USA: Oxford University Press, 2008. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olcott's science and theosophy===

The Theosophists combination of spiritualism and science to investigate the supernatural reflected the society's desire to combine of religion and reason and to produce a rationally spiritual movement. This "occult science" within the Theosophical Society was used to find the "truth" behind all of the world's major religions. Through their research, Olcott and Blavatsky concluded that Buddhism best embodied elements of what they found significant in all religions.

Olcott utilized scientific reasoning in his synthesis and presentation of Buddhism. This is clearly seen in a chapter of his "Buddhist Catechism", entitled "Buddhism and Science". Notably, his efforts represent one of the earliest attempts to combine scientific understanding and reasoning with Buddhist religion.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'' USA: Oxford University Press, 2008. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interrelationship he saw between Buddhism and Science paralleled his Theosophical approach to show the scientific bases for supernatural phenomena such as auras, hypnosis, and Buddhist "miracles".

Olcott was President of the Theosophical Society until his death on February 17, 1907.

Two major streets in [[Colombo]] and [[Galle]] have been named Olcott Mawatha, to commemorate him. A statue of him has been erected in front of Colombo Fort Railway Station. Many other schools that he helped found or have been founded in his memory possess commemorative statues in honour of his contribution to Buddhist education. He is still remembered fondly by many Sri Lankans today. On September 10, 2011, a statue of Colonel Olcott was unveiled at a Buddhist temple near Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Abdill [http://www.theosophical.org/announcements/2386-olcott-statue-unveiled-in-new-jersey ''Olcott statue unveiled in New Jersey.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of his death is often remembered by Buddhist centers and Sunday schools in present-day [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in Theosophical communities around the globe.  Olcott believed himself to be Asia's savior, the outsider hero who would sweep in at the end of the drama to save a disenchanted subcontinent from spiritual death.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen. "Henry Steel Olcott and 'Protestant Buddhism'" pg.295&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to revitalize Buddhism within Sri Lanka was successful and influenced many native Buddhist intellectuals. Sri Lanka was dominated by British colonial power and influence at the time, and many Buddhists heard Olcott's interpretation of the Buddha's message as socially motivating and supportive of efforts to overturn colonialist efforts to ignore Buddhism and Buddhist tradition. This was despite the fact that his re-interpretation of the Buddha was along modern liberal ideas promoted by the British in Sri Lanka. As David McMahan wrote, "Henry Steel Olcott saw the Buddha as a figure much like the ideal liberal freethinker – someone full of 'benevolence,' 'gratitude,' and 'tolerance,' who promoted 'brotherhood among all men' as well as 'lessons in manly self-reliance".&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'' USA: Oxford University Press, 2008. McMahon 95.&lt;/ref&gt; His Westernized view of Buddha influenced Sri Lankan leaders, such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]].

Olcott and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] were associates, which reflects both men's awareness of the divide between East and West—as seen in their presentation of Buddhism to the West.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism.'' USA: Oxford University Press, 2008. Pg 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Olcott helped financially support the Buddhist presence at the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in Chicago, 1893. The inclusion of Buddhists in the Parliament allowed for the expansion of Buddhism within the West in general and in America specifically, leading to other Buddhist Modernist movements.

As Stephen Prothero wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was Olcott who most eloquently articulated and most obviously embodied the diverse religious and cultural traditions that shaped Protestant Buddhism, who gave the revival movement both its organizational shape and its emphasis on education-as-character-building. The most Protestant of all early Protestant Buddhists, Olcott was the liminoid figure, the griot who because of his awkward standing betwixt and between the American Protestant grammars of his youth and the Asian Buddhist lexicon of his adulthood was able to conjure traditional Sinhalese Buddhism, Protestant modernism, metropolitan gentility, and academic [[Orientalism]] into a decidedly new creole tradition. This creole tradition Olcott then passed on to a whole generation of Sinhalese students educated in his schools.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen. "Henry Steel Olcott and 'Protestant Buddhism'" pg.296/297&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Olcott is probably the only major contributor to the nineteenth-century Sinhalese Buddhist revival who was actually born and raised in the Protestant Christian tradition, though he had already left Protestantism for [[Spiritualism]] long before he became a Buddhist. His childhood Protestantism is a reason that many scholars have referred to the [[Buddhist modernism]] he influenced as "Protestant Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41262">A '''Hollywood marriage''' originally meant a glamorous high society [[marriage]] between [[celebrity|celebrities]] involved in the [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. film industry]]; the word "[[Hollywood]]" is often used to represent the US film industry. However, the term has grown to also have strong negative connotations of a marriage that is of short duration and quickly ends in [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=marriage#v=snippet&amp;q=marriage&amp;f=false |title=Jet September 23, 1985 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1985-09-23 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term developed the negative connotations fairly early; by the 1930s, a "Hollywood marriage" was a marriage both glamorous and short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gFFkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WnUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1387,4367247&amp;dq=hollywood-marriage&amp;hl=en |title=St. Joseph News-Press – July 31, 1938 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1938-07-31 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xRE_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6k4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2649,1205199&amp;dq=hollywood-marriage&amp;hl=en |title=The Border Cities Star – April 3, 1935 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1935-04-03 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connotation may also have related, at times, to [[moral panic]]s over Hollywood's influence on the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/817968732.html?dids=817968732:817968732&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+23%2C+1933&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Hollywood%27s+%27Big+Parade%27+To+The+Reno+Divorce+Mill+Result+of+Actors%27+Insatiable+Craving+for+Publicity&amp;pqatl=google |title="Hollywood's 'Big Parade' To The Reno Divorce Mill Result of Actors' Insatiable Craving for Publicity" from the Hartford Courant on July 23, 1933 |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1933-07-23 |accessdate=2011-02-21 |first=J C |last=Moffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

Sympathetic views of celebrities point out that in Hollywood, it is mostly the bad marriages that are documented by the media, giving a skewed perspective that might make "Hollywood marriages" appear to have a worse success rate than they have in reality. In 1972 Bob Thomas of the [[Associated Press]] remarked specifically about the tendency to ignore lasting celebrity marriages with the examples he gave including [[Bob Hope]]'s marriage to [[Dolores Hope]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]'s marriage to producer Frederick Brisson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pTkzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T7cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=931,4090555&amp;dq= AP via The Palm Beach Post – April 23, 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative views of Hollywood marriages take the position that the divorce rates are indeed unusually high among celebrities and that this is caused by faults within Hollywood as a culture or by personal faults of the celebrities themselves. They point to the usage of weddings as [[publicity stunt]]s, the egotism or immaturity of celebrities or "celebrity culture", and high rates of infidelity or [[promiscuity]].  [[Bee Wilson]], in an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', critiqued "Hollywood marriages" for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed "permanent children," although she points to some [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] couples, like [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]], as exceptions to these criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Bee |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3663142/Movie-stars-plus-marriage-equals-disaster.html |title="Movie Stars plus marriage equals disaster" Daily Telegraph: 11 February 2007 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2011-02-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the introduction to the ''Cultural Sociology of Divorce: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Robert E. Emery specifically mentions Hollywood divorces as epitomizing a "consumerist, [[Throw-away society|throw-away]]-marriage view found in the West."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wzJdSIfeeTQC&amp;pg=PR27&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Cultural Sociology of Divorce'' edited by Robert E. Emery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors and entertainers themselves vary in perspective on the commonality or reason for divorce in Hollywood. In 1961 [[Anne Baxter]] stated Hollywood was "the most difficult place in America for marriage" due, in part, to the "terrible extremes of success and failure" both spouses may face.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pEYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=POkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3658,2332812&amp;dq= The Miami News – June 5, 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 interview [[Mitzi Gaynor]], who would remain married to the husband mentioned in the interview until his death, took the more "defensive" position that "Hollywood" couples look different mostly because "everything we do is magnified." Although she conceded they might be slightly different because "you have to be a little off-center to get into this business in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LUcqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BE8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7379,1030430&amp;dq= The Pittsburgh Press – June 19, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond anecdote or opinion the actual evidence on the matter is complicated by differing definitions of who qualifies as a "celebrity" or "Hollywood." That stated a study from [[Radford University]] placed "dancers and choreographers" as the occupations having the highest percent currently divorced&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091607509.html The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; with "Entertainers and performers, sports and related workers, all other" still being above average at tenth. That placed them between "Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides" at ninth and "Baggage porters and concierges" at eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/highest-divorce-rates-by-profession-2010-9?op=1 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 "actors, professional showmen" were listed as having the highest divorce rate of occupations, but as this predates even the incorporation of Hollywood it refers to the profession itself rather than "Hollywood" or "celebrity culture" as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/09/low-divorce-jobs.html Overcoming Bias]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Forbes]] article placed "professional athletes and entertainers" together and with a high divorce rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://divorce.lovetoknow.com/Divorce_Rate_Statistics_by_Occupation Forbes via "love to know."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entertainers married a year or less ==

The idea that the term "Hollywood marriage" equates to something short-term is sometimes displayed by citing celebrities who had marriages that ended in divorce, separation, or annulment within approximately one year. The following examples of that are primarily restricted to marriages involving a notable actor or director linked to "Hollywood" in some way.

== Entertainers married 50 years or more ==
Entertainment couples that last for decades, and/or life, are occasionally used as a counterpoint when referring to "Hollywood marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v9wqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GkoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2969,2107034&amp;dq=hollywood-marriage&amp;hl=en |title="A Hollywood Marriage That Succeeded", article on Ida Cantor's death from The Deseret News on August 10, 1962 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to that, here is a selection of entertainers who have or had marriages that lasted over 50 years.

(Note that in a few of these cases, the entertainers were not necessarily in ''faithful'' marriages. Tom Jones, for example, was widely known to effectively be in an [[open relationship]] and had many extramarital affairs throughout his marriage.)

'''John Silas "Jack" Reed''' (October 22, 1887 – October 17, 1920) was an American [[journalist]], poet, and [[socialist]] [[activist]], best remembered for ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', his first-hand account of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. He married the writer and feminist [[Louise Bryant]] in 1916. Reed died of [[typhus]] in Russia in 1920. He is one of three Americans honored by being buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] (the others are labor organizer [[Bill Haywood]] and [[Charles Ruthenburg]], founder of the [[Communist Party USA]]).

==Early life==
John Silas Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandparents' mansion in what is now the [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]]. His grandmother's household had Chinese servants.&lt;ref&gt;Granville Hicks with John Stuart, ''John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary.'' New York: Macmillan, 1936. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a "Goose Hollowite" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in [[Washington Park, Portland, Oregon|Washington Park]], which overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace (the mansion no longer exists).&lt;ref name=prince&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YABWNNHirLIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage|title=Portland's Goose Hollow|last=Prince|first=Tracy J.|isbn=978-0-7385-7472-1|page=122|year=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His mother, Margaret (Green) Reed, was the daughter of Portland industrialist [[Henry Dodge Green]],&lt;ref name="cartoon"&gt;[http://www.amiaconference.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/John-Reeds-Portland-Map.pdf "Jon Reed's Portland - Map"], Oregon Cartoon Institute&lt;/ref&gt; who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas &amp; light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner).&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="cartoon"/&gt;

John's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland's business community.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Homberger, ''John Reed.'' Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990. Pages 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had married in 1886, and the family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Reed side. 

A sickly child, young "Jack" grew up surrounded by nurses and servants. His mother carefully selected his upper-class playmates. He had a brother, Harry, who was two years younger.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1904, he was sent to [[Morristown-Beard School|Morristown]], a [[New Jersey]] [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], to prepare for college. His father, who did not attend college, wanted his sons to go to Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Munk, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/reed/bio/portland.htm John Reed], marxists.org. Accessed November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At Morristown Jack continued his poor classroom performance, but made the [[History of American football|football]] team and showed some literary promise.&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Reed poem Monthly vol 44 (1907).jpg|thumb|left|''The Harvard Monthly'' Vol. 44 (1907)]]
Reed failed his first attempt at Harvard College's admission exam but passed on his second try, and enrolled in the fall of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|year=1997|pp=587|title=[[The Zinn Reader]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-583229-46-0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall, handsome, and lighthearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon|Lampoon]]'' and ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'', and was president of the [[Harvard Glee Club]]. In 1910 he held a position in the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]], and also wrote music and lyrics for their show ''Diana's Debut''. Reed failed to make the football and [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also made "Ivy orator and poet" in his senior year.

Reed attended meetings of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society|Socialist Club]], over which his friend [[Walter Lippmann]] presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Graham Wallas]], wrenching us away from the [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wildian]] [[Amateur|dilettantism]] which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the "dull outside world," visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat to pay his fare to Europe. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, [[Charles Townsend Copeland]] ("Copey"), who told him he must "see life" if he wanted to successfully write about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macmilian|first1=Granville Hicks|title=Promethean Playboy|journal=Time|date=1936|volume=27|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Journalist===
Reed had determined to become a journalist, and set out to make his mark in New York, a center of the industry. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, [[Lincoln Steffens]], who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on ''[[The American Magazine]]'', where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his insufficient salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called ''Landscape Architecture.''&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Reed journalist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A native of [[Oregon]], John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.]]
Reed made his home in [[Greenwich Village]], a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]] that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]].'' Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]],'' ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]],'' and ''[[The Century Magazine]].'' One of his poems was set to music by composer [[Arthur Foote]]. The editors at ''The American'' came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and [[Ida Tarbell]]. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of ''[[The Masses]]'', edited by [[Max Eastman]]. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.

The first of Reed's many arrests came in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of [[Paterson Silk Strike of 1913|strikers in the New Jersey silk mills]]. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] trade union, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref name="Homberger, John Reed, p. 49"&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, "War in Paterson." During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader [[Bill Haywood]], Reed put on "The Pageant of the Paterson Strike" in [[Madison Square Garden]] as a benefit for the strikers.&lt;ref name="Homberger, John Reed, p. 49"/&gt;

In the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' to report the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He shared the perils of [[Pancho Villa]]'s army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose "Primer Jefe" political chief was [[Venustiano Carranza]]) when it defeated Federal forces at [[Torreón]], opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.

Reed's reporting on the [[Villistas]] in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a [[war correspondent]]. Reed deeply sympathized with the [[peons]] and vehemently opposed [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]]; US forces occupied Veracruz. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book ''Insurgent Mexico'' (1914). 

On April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in [[Colorado]], scene of the recent [[Ludlow massacre]], a result of owners' suppression of labor organizing. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject ("The Colorado War", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reed spent summer 1914 in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together ''Insurgent Mexico'' and interviewing [[United States President|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at [[White House]] insistence, was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War correspondent===
On August 14, 1914, shortly after [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the ''Metropolitan''. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in [[Naples]], and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties. 

In an unsigned piece titled "The Traders' War," published in the September 1914 issue of ''The Masses,'' Reed wrote:

{{quote|The real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders...

What has democracy to do in alliance with [[Nicholas II|Nicholas]], the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the [[St. Petersburg, Russia|Petersburg]] of [[Father Gapon]], from the [[Odessa]] of the [[pogrom]]s?...

No. There is a falling out among commercial rivals....

We, who are Socialists, must hope — we may even expect — that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes — and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men.

But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny.

This is not Our War.&lt;ref&gt;John Reed, "The Trader's War," ''The Masses,'' v. 5, no. 12, whole no. 40 (Sept. 1914), pp. 16–17. The article was attributed to "a well-known American author and war correspondent who is compelled by arrangements with another publication to withhold his name."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed [[Karl Liebknecht]], one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the [[Second International]], and by its replacement with [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reed-john-1917.jpg|thumb|left|Reed {{Circa|1917}}]]
He returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by [[Boardman Robinson]], a Canadian artist and frequent ''Masses'' contributor. Traveling from [[Thessaloniki]], they saw scenes of profound devastation in [[Serbia]] (including a bombed-out [[Belgrade]]), also going through [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. They passed through the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in [[Bessarabia]]. In [[Chełm]] they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.

Traveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in [[Kiev]]. In [[Bucharest]], the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to [[Constantinople]] in hopes of seeing action at [[Gallipoli]]. From these experiences he wrote the book, ''[[The War in Eastern Europe]],'' published in April 1916.

After returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with [[Louise Bryant]], who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], a summer destination on [[Cape Cod]] for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed [[Woodrow Wilson]], believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 112–116.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1916 he married Bryant in [[Peekskill, New York]]. The same year, he underwent an operation at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] to remove a kidney. &lt;!-- why? --&gt; He was hospitalized until mid-December.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a [[conscientious objector]], as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published ''Tamburlaine and Other Verses'', in an edition of 500 copies.

As the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the ''Metropolitan'' was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his [[Cape Cod]] cottage to the [[birth control]] activist and sex educator [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the [[People's Council (US)|People's Council]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: "This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it."&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for ''[[The Masses]]'', which the [[United States Postal Service]] refused to mail, and for ''Seven Arts.'' Due to antiwar articles by Reed and [[Randolph Bourne]], the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.

===Witness to the Russian Revolution===
On August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the [[US Department of State|State Department]] with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John Reed, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests and German and Bolshevik Propaganda: Report and Hearings of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary, United States Senate...,'' vol 3. p. 563. Hereafter: ''Overman Committee Report, v. 3.''&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of [[Finland]], the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed [[Kornilov affair|military coup]] of [[monarchist]] General [[Lavr Kornilov]]. This was an attempt to topple the [[Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and [[Ukraine]], had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.

Reed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolshevik [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]], headed by [[Vladimir Lenin]], toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.

Food shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down — milk and everything of that sort.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the [[Winter Palace]], the seat of Kerensky's government.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Рид-красная Россия.jpg|thumb|300pix|right|The cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.]]
Reed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new [[revolutionary socialist]] government. He went to work for the new [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs]], translating decrees and news of the new government into English. "I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches," Reed later recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met [[Leon Trotsky]] and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American [[Raymond Robins]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]]. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: "This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital."&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 161"&gt;Homberger, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would "call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses." American journalist [[Edgar Sisson]] told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 161"/&gt; 

In January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman [[Alexander Gumberg]] met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk]]. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 161-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's ''Six Red Months in Russia'' appeared first, but Reed's ''10 Days That Shook the World'' (1919) garnered more notice.

Bryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28.&lt;ref name="Stuart, p. 303"&gt;Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to [[Finland]]. In [[Turku]] harbor, when Reed was boarding a [[ship]] on his way to [[Stockholm]], Finnish [[police]] arrested him; he was held at [[Kakola]] prison in [[Turku]] until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], [[Norway]] via [[Stockholm]]. 

Because he remained under indictment in the ''Masses'' case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, [[Morris Hillquit]], promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day.&lt;ref name="Stuart, p. 303"/&gt; His papers were not returned to him until November.

===Radical political activist===
Back in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in ''The Masses'', particularly one headlined "Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy", had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for [[sedition]] against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason). 

The first ''Masses'' trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The second ''Masses'' trial also ended in a hung jury.
[[File:Voice of labor 1 Oct 1919.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Cover of Reed's ''Voice of Labor,'' October 1919]]
In [[Philadelphia]], Reed stood outside a closed hall &lt;!-- Whose hall" --&gt;on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]] and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in [[The Bronx]]). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to prevent [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the [[Ukraine]] and Japanese designs on [[Siberia]], but this argument came to naught.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 21–22, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was "savagely distorted" by the press.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 180"&gt;Homberger, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 180"/&gt; Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of ''[[The New York Communist]],'' the weekly newspaper issued by the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party|Left Wing Section]] of Greater New York.

Affiliated with the Left Wing of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]]. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, ''The Voice of Labor'', and was denounced as "Jack the Liar" in the Communist Party organ, ''The Communist''. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy "based upon equality and the liberty of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 191-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comintern functionary===
Indicted for [[sedition]] and hoping to secure [[Comintern]] backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to [[Bergen]] as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to [[Moscow]] by train. In the cold winter of 1919–20, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist [[Emma Goldman]] had recently arrived aboard the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']], among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the [[Cheka]]. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see [[Angelica Balabanoff]], a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reed-tendays-1922.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German edition of ''10 Days That Shook The World'', published by the [[Communist International|Comintern]] in Hamburg in 1922]]
Though facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 203-4&lt;/ref&gt; Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to [[Petrograd]].&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he crossed into [[Helsinki]], where he had radical friends, including [[Hella Wuolijoki]], the future politician and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SDKL]] [[Parliament of Finland|member of parliament]]. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter. 

On the 13th, customs officials in Finland found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman "Jim Gormley". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for [[treason]]. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).

The [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 205-6&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained illegally. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[insomnia]], wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally released in early June, and sailed for [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to [[Petrograd]], recuperating from malnutrition and [[scurvy]] caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. His spirits were high.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 207"&gt;Homberger, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] and arrived in [[Gothenburg]] on August 10.&lt;ref name="Homberger, p. 207"/&gt; At the same time, Reed attended the second [[Comintern]] congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, pp. 207-8&lt;/ref&gt;

During this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions – a policy Reed felt would be disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; He was contemptuous of the [[bullying]] tactics displayed during the congress by [[Karl Radek]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], who ordered Reed to attend the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] to be held at [[Baku]] on August 15.

The journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through countryside that was devastated by civil war and infected by [[typhus]]. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from [[Murmansk]]. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: "the Comintern has made a decision. Obey."&lt;ref name="homberger212-213"/&gt; Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance.&lt;ref name="homberger212-213"&gt;Homberger, pp. 212-3&lt;/ref&gt; Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend [[Benjamin Gitlow]] asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took her to meet Lenin, Trotsky, [[Lev Kamenev]], and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.

==Death==
Reed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have [[influenza]], he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with [[scrub typhus|spotted typhus]]. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied [[blockade]]. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Homberger, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; After a hero's funeral, his body was buried at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. He is one of three Americans honored by being buried there.

==Legacy==
The interpretation of Reed in popular culture has been varied. Some{{who|date=November 2014}} have dismissed him as a "romantic revolutionary" and a "playboy", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;By the 1930s, the height of the communist movement in the United States, literary [[John Reed Club]]s, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in many large cities of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as his old friend and comrade [[Benjamin Gitlow]], claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism late in his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] cause.

===Representation in other media===
*Soviet director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s influential 1927 [[silent film]] ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' was based on Reed's book.
*[[John Dos Passos]] included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work ''1919,'' the second part of his [[U.S.A. trilogy]].
*The 1958 Soviet film ''In October Days'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:В дни Октября|В дни Октября]]}}), directed by [[Sergei Vasilyev]], featured Reed and Bryant.
*Actor and director [[Warren Beatty]] made the film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), based on Reed's life. Beatty starred as Reed, [[Diane Keaton]] as Louise Bryant and [[Jack Nicholson]] as Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three [[Academy Award]]s and was nominated for nine others.

Two films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] made ''[[Reed: Insurgent Mexico]]'' (1973). A Mexican–Soviet-Italian co-production released ''[[Red Bells]]'' (1982) and ''[[Red Bells II]]'' (1983), both directed by [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], with [[Franco Nero]] as Reed.

'''Johann-Nielsen Jebsen''', nicknamed "Johnny", was an anti-Nazi German intelligence officer and British [[double agent]] (code name Artist) during the [[Second World War]]. Jebsen recruited [[Dušan Popov]] (who became the British agent Tricycle) to the {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}} and through him later joined the Allied cause. Kidnapped from Lisbon by the Germans shortly before the [[Normandy landings]], Jebsen was tortured in prison and spent time in a concentration camp before disappearing, presumed killed, at the end of the war.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Jebsen was born in [[Hamburg]] in 1917, heir to the shipping firm Jebsen &amp; Jebsen. His parents, who both died whilst Jebsen was still a child, were of [[Denmark|Danish]] origin but held German citizenship, after moving the company to the country. Even early on, Jebsen considered his citizenship a convenience, with deep roots remaining in his Danish ancestry. During childhood he visited England and became enamoured with the country, adopting the mannerisms and the language.&lt;ref name=Macintyre7/&gt;

Jebsen attended the [[University of Freiburg]] during the 1930s, where he became close friends with [[Duško Popov]]. During this time, both showed distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] that was emerging in Germany. After graduation Jebsen moved to England, intending to study at [[Oxford University]], although it appears he never did this. Over the next few years he moved amongst the London social set, befriending [[P. G. Wodehouse]] amongst others.&lt;ref name=Macintyre7/&gt;

=== Second World War ===
At the outset of the Second World War, Jebsen joined the German military intelligence agency—the {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}}—largely as a way to avoid compulsory service in the army.&lt;ref name=Crowdy64/&gt; He was given a vague brief as an independent "researcher" and assigned the rank of private. In reality it meant he could continue his normal activities as an international businessman, so long as he was available to help the {{lang|de|Abwehr}} when it required.

In 1940, Jebsen arranged an introduction between Popov, who the Germans hoped to recruit as an agent, and a senior {{lang|de|Abwehr}} officer in [[Belgrade]]. The meeting led to Popov's recruitment, upon which he instantly offered his services to the Allies as a double agent. It is likely that Jebsen knew this early on, and often passed information to Popov which the latter believed was intended for Allied hands.&lt;ref name=Macintyre7/&gt;

During the war, Jebsen travelled freely on business, although it was not clear what he did. He married Eleonore Bothilde Peterson, an actress from [[Frankfurt]], but had a string of mistresses across Europe.&lt;ref name=Macintyre83/&gt; Jebsen's anti-Nazi stance led to clashes with the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], and its intelligence office, the {{lang|de|[[Sicherheitsdienst]]}}.&lt;ref name=Macintyre83/&gt;

Through 1943, Jebsen, Dušan Popov and his brother Ivo (also an agent, codenamed Dreadnought) ran an operation to recruit double agents from Yugoslavia. Ivo Popov identified potential candidates, who were told they would be working for the British. First they were sent to Berlin, under the care of Jebsen, for training in the spy school before ultimately ending up in Britain (via Spain and Portugal) to work for [[MI5]].&lt;ref name=Crowdy253/&gt;

=== Kidnapping ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R97512, Berlin, Geheimes Staatspolizeihauptamt.jpg|thumb|Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, where Jebsen was held in a basement cell]]
[[File:Stolperstein Hartungstraße 7a (Johann-Nielsen Jebsen) in Hamburg-Rotherbaum.JPG|thumb|{{lang|de|[[Stolperstein]]}} for Jebsen in Hamburg, Hartungstraße 7&lt;ref&gt;Text of plaque: Here resided Johann-Nielsen Jebsen ; born 1917 ; abducted from Portugal by the Gestapo in 1944 ; tortured at the headquarters of Reich Security in Berlin ; murdered at Sachsenhausen in February 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On {{nowr|29 April 1944}}, Jebsen was abducted from [[Lisbon]], Portugal, and driven overnight to France. Aloys Schreiber, the head of German counter-intelligence in Lisbon,&lt;ref name=Macintyre217/&gt; had invited Jebsen to his office on the pretext of discussing his pending [[War Merit Medal]]. After a brief struggle Jebsen and his friend (Heinz Moldenhauer) were overpowered and bundled into a car.&lt;ref name=Macintyre273/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarRecord1/&gt;

Jebsen's disappearance was a serious concern for the Allies. He had been privy to a great deal of information, not just the knowledge of Popov's double agent role, but the fact that [[Joan Pujol Garcia|Agent Garbo]]'s network of sub-agents was fiction and familiarity with many details of [[Operation Fortitude]]. If he talked, the entire cover plan for the Normandy landings was at risk. After much analysis the intelligence services decided that Jebsen had been snatched because the {{lang|de|Abwehr}} believed he was planning to defect, rather than that he had already turned. It is possible that Jebsen was abducted to protect Popov, who the Germans considered one of their most important agents.&lt;ref name=Macintyre277/&gt; As a precaution, the Allies suspended Popov's network of fictional sub-agents and his transmissions to his German handlers.&lt;ref name=Crowdy255/&gt;

At first Jebsen was taken to the [[Gestapo]] headquarters in Berlin, where his interrogation began. After a few weeks the Allies were encouraged, intercepts of German communications showed the Germans were interested in Jebsen's finances (he had been defrauding a number of SS officers) – there was no mention of his activities as an agent. As time progressed it appeared that agent Artist had not cracked under pressure and the ''Fortitude'' deception was safe.&lt;ref name=Macintyre293/&gt;

In July&amp;nbsp;1944, Jebsen was moved to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. When he arrived he had broken ribs and was malnourished, but still harboured thoughts of escape. He told Allied soldiers, also held in the camp, that he had been accused of helping the British and when he had refused to talk his financial fraud had been investigated. Eventually he got a message to London via a British Commando, [[Jack Churchill]], however the [[War Office]] had no record of Jebsen's name and so the plea for help was ignored. In February&amp;nbsp;1945, Gestapo agents removed Jebsen from Sachsenhausen; it is the last sighting of him and he is presumed to have been murdered soon after. Several attempts to find him after the war were unsuccessful and he was legally declared dead on {{nowr|17 February 1950}}.&lt;ref name=Crowdy255/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macintyre354/&gt;

'''Julian the Hospitaller''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] saint.

==History==
The earliest known reference to Julian dates to the late twelfth century.&lt;ref name=whatley&gt;[http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/whatley-saints-lives-in-middle-english-collections-life-of-st-julian-hospitaller-introduction "The Life of St. Julian the Hospitaller: Introduction", ''Saints' Lives in Middle English Collections'', (E. Gordon Whatley, Anne B. Thompson, and Robert K. Upchurch, eds.) 2004] {{ISBN|1-58044-089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main theories of his origin:
* Born in [[Le Mans]], France, possibly from confusion with [[Saint Julian of Le Mans]]
* Born in [[Ath]], Belgium, around 7 AD 
* Born in [[Naples]], Italy

The location of the hospitals built by him is also debated between the banks of the River [[Gardon]] in [[Provence]] and an island near the River [[Potenza (river)|Potenza]] heading to [[Macerata]].

He was known as the patron of the cities of [[Ghent]] and [[Macerata]]. The [[Lord's Prayer|Paternoster]] (Our Father prayer) of St. Julian can be found as early as 1353 in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'', and is still passed on by word of mouth throughout some places in Italy. The account is included the 13th-century ''[[The Golden Legend|Leggenda Aurea]]'' of [[Genoa|Genoan]] [[Giacomo da Varazze]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest. Beautiful stained glass depicting St. Julian by an unknown artist in the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] also dates back to the 13th century. Early [[fresco]] paintings of him are found in the [[Cathedral of Trento]] (14th century) and the Palazzo Comunale di Assisi.

==Golden Legend==
[[Image:Saint Julian Taddeo Gaddi.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Saint Julian. [[Taddeo Gaddi]], 14th century.]]
According to de Varazze, on the night Julian was born, his father, a man of noble blood, saw pagan [[witch]]es secretly lay a curse on the boy that would make him kill both his parents. His father wanted to get rid of the child, but his mother did not let him do so. As the boy grew into a handsome young man, his mother would often burst into tears because of the sin her son was destined to commit.  When he finally found out the reason for her tears, he swore he "would never commit such a sin" and "with great belief in [[Christ]] went off full of courage" as far away from his parents as he could. Some versions say that it was his mother who told him at the age of 10, while others say it was a stag he met in the forest while hunting (a situation used in depicting St. Julian in statues and pictures). After fifty days of walking he finally reached [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] where he married a "good woman", said to be a wealthy widow.

Twenty years later, his parents decided to go look for their now thirty-year-old son. When they arrived, they visited the altar of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]], and "as soon as they came out of the church they met a woman sitting on a chair outside, whom the pilgrims greeted and asked, for Jesus' love, whether she would host them for the night as they were tired." She let them in and told them that her husband, Julian, was out hunting. (This is why he is also known as the patron of hunters.) The mother and father were overjoyed to have found their son, as was Julian's wife. "She took care of them well and had them rest in her and Julian's bed." But ''the enemy'' went off seeking Julian and told him: 'I have sour news for you. While you are here, hunting, your wife is in bed embracing another man. There they are right now, still sleeping.'"

De Verazze continues: "And Julian felt deep sadness and his face drew into a frown. He rode back home, went to his bed and found a man and a woman sleeping in it. He drew his sword and killed them both. He was about to take off and never again set foot in that land, but as he was leaving he saw his wife sitting among the other women. She told him: 'There are your mother and father resting in your room.' And so Julian knew, and fell into a rage. 'The shrewd enemy lied to me when he said my wife was betraying me', and while kissing their wounds he cried 'Better had I never been born, for I am cursed in soul and body.' And his good wife comforted him and said 'Have faith in Christ Almighty, a stream of life and mercy.' They had no children... Gold and silver they had a lot... And after seeking redemption in Rome, Julian built seven hospitals and twenty-five houses. And the poor started flowing to him, to Jesus' Almighty's love."

[[Image:Quattrino Macerata.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Papal States scudo|Quattrino]] of Macerata depicting Saint Julian]]
De Verazze continues: "''The enemy'' conspired again to ruin Julian—disguised as a weak pilgrim, he was let in by Julian with the others. At midnight he woke up and made a mess of the house." The following morning Julian saw the damage and swore never to let in anyone else in his home. He was so furious he had everyone leave. "And [[Jesus]] went to him, again as a pilgrim, seeking rest. He asked humbly, in the name of God, for shelter. But Julian answered with contempt: 'I shall not let you in. Go away, for the other night I had my home so vandalized that I shall never let you in.' And Christ told him 'Hold my walking-stick, please.' Julian, embarrassed, went to take the stick, and it stuck to his hands. And Julian recognized him at once and said 'He tricked me, ''the enemy'' who does not want me to be your faithful servant. But I shall embrace you, I do not care about him; and for your love I shall give shelter to whoever needs.' He knelt and Jesus forgave him, and Julian asked, full of repentance, forgiveness for his wife and parents. Some versions skip the second mistake and tell of an [[angel]] visiting Julian and announcing to him that he is forgiven.

==Veneration in Malta==
Devotion to St. Julian started in the [[Malta|Maltese]] Islands in the 15th century after the discovery of his relics in the city of [[Macerata]]. It was introduced by the noble family of De Astis, high-ranking in Malta at the time, who had strong connections with the [[Bishop of Macerata]]. Three churches were built in his honor before the arrival of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]]: in [[Tabija]], towards [[Mdina]]; in [[Luqa]]; and in [[Senglea]] (Isla). This last one had a storage room for [[hunters]], and served to popularize this devotion through the sailors arriving at the Three Cities. In the 16th century there existed a hospital, ''Ospedale di San Giuliano'', in the Citadel in [[Gozo]], showing a wide devotion to the saint. Being an order of hospitaliers, the [[Knights of St. John]] helped widen further this devotion. In 1539 they rebuilt the church in Senglea and in 1590 built another church in the parish of [[Birkirkara]], a section that since then was called [[St. Julian's]]. In 1891 the church was made a parish, the only one ever dedicated to the saint in Malta.

The '''Kennedy Center Honors''' is an annual honor given to those in the [[performing arts]] for their lifetime of contributions to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] (regardless of their citizenship). The honors have been presented annually since 1978, culminating each December in a star-studded gala celebrating the honorees in the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] Opera House.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/about/home.html "About the Honors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516004214/http://kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/about/home.html |date=2008-05-16 }} Kennedy Center.

==History==
[[George Stevens Jr.]] created the Kennedy Center Honors with the late [[Nick Vanoff]], and produced the first gala in 1978. He was the producer and co-writer through the 2014 awards,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paul. [https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/george-stevens-jr-to-end-37-year-run-as-kennedy-center-honors-producer-1201373481/ "George Stevens Jr. to End 37-Year Run as Kennedy Center Honors Producer"] ''Variety'', December 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; after which he sold the production rights to the Kennedy Center.

The Kennedy Center Honors started in 1977, after that year's 10th-anniversary White House reception and Kennedy Center program for the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI). [[Roger L. Stevens]], the founding chairman of the Kennedy Center, asked George Stevens, Jr., (no relation), the founding director of the AFI, to hold an event for the Center. George Stevens asked Isaac Stern to become involved, and then "pitched" the idea to the television network [[CBS]], who "bought it." With the announcement of the first honors event and honorees, CBS vice president for specials Bernie Sofronski stated:&lt;ref&gt;Crews, Chip. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/26/AR2005122600801_pf.html "The Honors, Take 2"] ''Washington Post'', December 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom. "Crowning America's Culture Superstars", The Washington Post, September 28, 1978, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|George [Stevens] came to us with this. What turned us on is that this is the only show of its kind. In Europe and most countries, they have ways of honoring their actors and their athletes. England has its command performances for the queen. We see this as a national honoring of people who have contributed to society, not someone who happens to have a pop record hit at the moment ... Our intention is not to do just another award show. We're going to make an effort in terms of a real special.}}

The first host was [[Leonard Bernstein]] in 1978, followed by [[Eric Sevareid]] in 1979 and [[Beverly Sills]] in 1980. [[Walter Cronkite]] hosted from 1981 to 2002 and [[Caroline Kennedy]] hosted from 2003 until 2012. [[Glenn Close]] hosted in 2013 and [[Stephen Colbert]] hosted from 2014 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Peggy. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/11/19/stephen-colbert-will-host-37th-annual-kennedy-center-honors/# "Stephen Colbert will host 37th annual Kennedy Center Honors"] ''Washington Post'', November 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, Andrea.

Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss of White Cherry Entertainment were selected as Executive Producers of the 38th annual Kennedy Center Honors (2015) after George Stevens, Jr. stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2015/05/05/tony-awards-team-chosen-to-produce-2015-kennedy-center-honors/ "Tony Awards Team Chosen"] ''Washington Post'', May 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the few awards shows that does not air live (with the exception of closed-circuit venues), but a re-edited version lasting approximately two hours is normally televised on [[CBS]] after Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kennedy-center-honors-2017-how-to-watch-on-cbs/ "Kennedy Center Honors 2017: How to watch online and on TV, start time and pre-show"] cbsnews.com, December 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kennedy-center.org/Content/pdfs/pages/specialevents/2017HonorsPressRelease.pdf "2017 Honors"] kennedy-center.org, December 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection process===
Honoree recommendations are accepted from the general public,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/ Honors] kennedy-center.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kennedy Center initiated a Special Honors Advisory Committee, which comprises two members of the Board of Trustees as well as past Honorees and distinguished artists.  The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees selects the Honoree recipients based on excellence in music, dance, theater, opera, motion pictures or television.&lt;ref name="kennedy-center.org"&gt;[https://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/2015HonorsPressRelease.pdf Press Release"] kennedy-center.org&lt;/ref&gt; The selections are typically announced sometime between July and September.

==The events==
The invitation-only weekend-long ceremony includes the Chairman's Luncheon, State Department dinner, White House reception, and the Honors gala performances and supper.

Surrounded by the Honorees, the luncheon is held on Saturday at the [[Kennedy Center]], with a welcoming speech by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. At that evening's reception and dinner at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], presided over by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the Honorees are introduced and the Honors medallions are presented by the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name="kennedy-center.org"/&gt; The wide rainbow-colored ribbon then hung around the necks of the recipients, and prominently noticeable when the events are televised, symbolizes "a spectrum of many skills within the performing arts" according to creator [[Ivan Chermayeff]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120500948.html Interview] in [[The Washington Post]] 2008-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, there is an early-evening [[White House]] reception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrs-o.com/newdata/2011/12/4/a-vision-in-blue.html|title=A Vision in Blue|publisher=Mrs. O|date=2011-12-04|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the President of the United States and the First Lady, followed by the Honors gala performance at the Kennedy Center and supper.

For the 2015 gala performance, President [[Barack Obama]] did attend, after addressing the nation in a live telecast.&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Peggy.

On August 19, 2017, the White House announced that President [[Donald Trump]] and the first lady, Melania Trump, have decided not to participate in events honoring recipients of the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors awards to "allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-skip-kennedy-center-arts-awards/2017/08/19/621e7a5c-84d6-11e7-9e7a-20fa8d7a0db6_story.html "Trump to skip Kennedy Center arts award."] ''Washington Post'', August 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2017 ceremony, held on December 3, 2017, President and Mrs. Trump did not attend.

There have been 213 recipients to date of the Kennedy Center Honors Awards during the Honor's 40 years (as of 2017), although the one given to [[Bill Cosby]] in 1998 was rescinded in 2018, following his sexual assault conviction.&lt;ref name="cosbyrescind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bill-cosby-kennedy-center-honors-212925295.html |title=Bill Cosby's Kennedy Center Honors, Mark Twain Prize Revoked |publisher=yahoo.com |date=2018-05-08 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority have been bestowed on individuals. On ten occasions since 1985, awards have been presented to duos or groups, including three married couples who were actors: [[Hume Cronyn]] and [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]], and [[Ossie Davis]] and [[Ruby Dee]]. The dancers [[Fayard Nicholas]] and [[Harold Nicholas]] of the [[Nicholas Brothers]] were honored, along with three [[musical theater]] songwriting duos: [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], and [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]].

Schmit]], [[Joe Walsh]] and (posthumously) [[Glenn Frey]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].

The 2018 award ceremony will present the honor, for the first time, to the creators of the musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'': Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler and Alex Lacamoire for "trailblazing creators of a transformative work that defies category."&lt;ref name=cher&gt;Gans, Andrew.

==Prospective honorees who declined, canceled, or postponed==
Pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]] was to be an honoree, but the selection committee withdrew the offer when Horowitz conditioned his acceptance on being honored alone and at 4 in the afternoon.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;Crews, Chip. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/26/AR2005122600801_pf.html "The Honors, Take 2"] ''The Washington Post'', December 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Katharine Hepburn]] declined the committee's first offer, though she relented in 1990.&lt;ref name="washpost"/&gt;

[[Doris Day]] repeatedly turned down the honors because her fear of flying prevented her from attending the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Allen.[http://www.dorisday.com/about "About Doris"] www.dorisday.com&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering [[Irving Berlin]] for the 1987 awards because of criticism for overlooking him, the Center was informed that Berlin wanted to be honored only if he surpassed his 100th birthday (which would not be until May 1988). Also, he was in failing health, used a wheelchair following a series of strokes, and could not attend a public event. The Center instead chose to pay special tribute to him at the 1987 Gala. He died in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Molotsky, Irvin.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF1031F934A35751C1A961948260 "Five Receive Kennedy Center Honors for Artistic Contributions"] ''The New York Times'' , December 7, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul McCartney]] was selected as an honoree in 2002, but was unable to attend because of an "inescapable personal obligation," his cousin's previously planned wedding. After initially saying that McCartney's award would be postponed until the following year, the Kennedy Center announced in August 2003 that "Paul McCartney will not be receiving a Kennedy Center Honor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFD61E3EF935A3575BC0A9659C8B63 "The Kennedy Center Honors: This Year's Bid for Glamour"] ''The New York Times'', August 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney later became a 2010 honoree.&lt;ref name=george&gt;Trescott, Jacqueline.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090702439.html "Oprah Winfrey among five recipients of 2010 Kennedy Center Honors"] ''The Washington Post'', September 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mel Brooks]] has stated that he refused the honor when [[George W. Bush]] was in office, due to his distaste for Bush's Iraq policy, but Brooks was an honoree in 2009, the first year Barack Obama was President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/mel-brooks-interview.html|title=Mel Brooks on His New Box Set and the 1 Million Great Stories That Come With It|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/20/182609040/mel-brooks-i-m-an-egot-so-i-don-t-need-any-more|title=Mel Brooks: 'I'm An EGOT; I Don't Need Any More'|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, one month before the actual ceremony, the Eagles postponed their honors until the following year because Glenn Frey had intestinal problems that required major surgery and a long recovery period.&lt;ref name=eagles/&gt; Despite their absence, they were still honored in 2015 via a performance of "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]" by country singer [[Miranda Lambert]]. Glenn Frey died on January 18, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morton|first=Victor|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/18/glenn-frey-eagles-guitarist-dies-67/|title=Glenn Frey, Eagles guitarist, dies at 67|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Center made him and the three surviving members 2016 honorees.&lt;ref name="Frey" /&gt;

In 2017, [[Norman Lear]] announced that he would accept the honors, but would boycott the White House ceremony because of his opposition to President [[Donald Trump]], citing Trump's proposal to end the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/05/541812555/norman-lear-kennedy-center-honoree-to-skip-white-house-reception-in-protest "Protest"] npr.com, August 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lear did attend the 2017 events and ceremony, but Donald and Melania Trump were not present, becoming the first U.S. presidential couple to skip the event, in order "to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction".&lt;ref name=2017gala/&gt;

'''Louis de Clermont, seigneur de Bussy d'Amboise''' (1549–1579) was a gentleman at the court of French king [[Henry III of France|Henri III]], a swordsman, dandy, and a lover of both sexes. He was one of the [[favourite]]s, or "[[Les Mignons|mignons]]", of ''[[François, Duke of Anjou|Monsieur]]'', brother of the king.&lt;ref&gt;''Régistre-journal d'un curieux etc. pendant le règne de Henri III: 1574-1589'' by [[Pierre de L'Estoile]], Jean-Jacques Champollion-Figeac; p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He was a cousin of [[François d'Amboise]].

Of a noble family ([[Georges II d'Amboise|his great-uncle]] was a cardinal), he entered the service of Prince [[François, Duke of Anjou]], the younger brother and rival of Henri III. Bussy became well-known at court as Anjou's "favourite" and later became the lover of Princess [[Marguerite de Valois]].

"Le brave Bussy" made fun of the favourites of the king and frequently fought [[duel]]s with them. He helped Anjou flee from the court where Henri III held him prisoner.

He was a main participant in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572), when he assassinated, among others, his relative Antoine de Clermont. While later attempting to seduce the wife of Charles de Chambes, Count of [[Château de Montsoreau|Montsoreau]], he was trapped and killed by her husband.

== In popular culture ==
Bussy d'Amboise is the hero of the play ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'' (1607) by English playwright [[George Chapman]], written 20 years after d'Amboise's death. He is also the hero of the novel ''[[La Dame de Monsoreau]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].

[[David R. Slavitt]] featured d'Amboise in his 2011 novel ''The Duke's Man''.

'''Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull''' (born 29 December 1946) is an English singer, songwriter and actress. She achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her hit single "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]" and became one of the lead female artists during the [[British Invasion]] in the United States.

Born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]], Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a [[Rolling Stones]] party where she was discovered by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. After the release of her hit single "As Tears Go By", she became an international star. Her debut album ''[[Marianne Faithfull (album)|Marianne Faithfull]]'' (1965) (released simultaneously with her album ''[[Come My Way]]'') was a commercial success followed by a number of albums on [[Decca Records]]. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with [[Mick Jagger]]. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]'' (1967), ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' (1968), and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s. During that time she was [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[Opioid use disorder|heroin addict]]. 

Noted for her distinctive voice, Faithfull's previously melodic and higher registered vocals (which were prevalent throughout her career in the 1960s) were affected by severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during the 1970s, permanently altering her voice, leaving it raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. This new sound was praised as "whisky soaked" by some critics for helping capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

After a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]].'' The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. ''Broken English'' earned Faithfull a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] and is often regarded as her "definitive recording." She followed with a series of albums, including ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'' (1981), ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' (1983), and ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'' (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: ''[[Faithfull: An Autobiography]]'' (1994), ''Memories, Dreams &amp; Reflections'' (2007), and ''Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record'' (2014).

Faithfull is listed on [[VH1]]'s "100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll" list. She received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 [[Women's World Award]]s and was made a ''Commandeur'' of the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the government of France.

==Early life and links to nobility==
Faithfull was born in [[Hampstead]], London. Her half-brother is artist [[Simon Faithfull]]. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officer and professor of Italian Literature at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] of London University. Robert Glynn Faithfull's family lived in [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire, while he completed a doctorate at [[Liverpool University]].&lt;ref name="BeatlesE"/&gt;  

Faithfull's mother, Eva, was the daughter of an [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian nobleman]], Artur Wolfgang, [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch (1875–1953). Eva chose to [[Courtesy style|style]] herself as [[Eva von Sacher-Masoch|Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/marianne-faithfull|title=Marianne Faithfull|work= Who Do You Think You Are?

Faithfull's mother had been born in [[Budapest]] and moved to [[Vienna]] in 1918. The family of Sacher-Masoch had secretly opposed the Nazi regime in Vienna. Faithfull's father's intelligence work for the British Army brought him into contact with the family, and he thus met Eva, his future wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/wdytya2013_faithfull.php|title=Featured Articles|publisher=Thegenealogist.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faithfull's maternal grandfather had aristocratic roots in the [[Habsburg Dynasty]], while Faithfull's maternal grandmother was [[Matrilineality in Judaism|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=c2a86822-529a-421f-959e-e0e613a0fc53&amp;k=94564|title=Marianne keeps the Faith|work=Vancouver City Guide|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104093456/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=c2a86822-529a-421f-959e-e0e613a0fc53&amp;k=94564|archivedate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eva had been a ballerina for the [[Max Reinhardt]] Company during her early years, and danced in productions of works by the German theatrical duo [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]].&lt;ref name="Faithfull, Marianne 2007"&gt;Faithfull, Marianne. ''Memories, Dreams and Reflections'', Fourth Estate. 1 October 2007; {{ISBN|0-00-724580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faithfull's maternal great great uncle was [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], whose erotic novel, ''[[Venus in Furs]],'' spawned the word "[[Sadomasochism|masochism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/inter23.html|title=Sex god?

(UK TV series)#Series 10 (2013)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' that the title was [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch, the relative corresponding English title being that of [[Baronet]], an inherited knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Documentation License|first1=GNU Free|title=Ritter|url=http://72.9.148.189/learn/index.php?title=Ritter&amp;printable=yes|publisher=GNU Free|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103601/http://72.9.148.189/learn/index.php?title=Ritter&amp;printable=yes|archivedate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She spent some of her early life at the [[commune]] at [[Braziers Park]], Oxfordshire, formed by Dr John Norman Glaister, where her father also lived and participated. Her parents divorced when she was six years old,&lt;ref name="BeatlesE"/&gt; after which she moved with her mother to Milman Road in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Her primary school was in [[Brixton]]. Living in reduced circumstances, Faithfull's girlhood was marred by bouts of [[tuberculosis]]. She was a [[bursary|charitably subsidized (bursaried) pupil]] at [[St Joseph's College, Reading|St Joseph's Roman Catholic Convent School, Reading]], where she was, for a time, a weekly boarder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Craig|title=Top of the Fops|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4259397/Top-of-the-fops.html|publisher=UK Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 March 2015|ref=10 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at St Joseph's, she was a member of the [[Progress Theatre]]'s student group.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== Singing career ==
=== 1960s ===
[[File:Fanclub1966MarianneFaithfull3.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Marianne Faithfull performing on the Dutch TV programme ''Fanclub'' on 17 September 1966]]
Faithfull began her singing career in 1964, landing her first gigs as a [[folk music]] performer in coffeehouses.&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;Faithfull, Marianne. ''Faithfull: An Autobiography'' Boston: Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-27324-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She soon began taking part in London's exploding social scene. In early 1964 she attended a Rolling Stones launch party with artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]] and met [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who discovered her. Her first major release, "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=_phZZgkT1Jk&amp;list=PL4EE73C317CAB2ED7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written and composed by [[Jagger/Richards|Jagger, Keith Richards]], and Oldham, and became a chart success. (The Rolling Stones recorded their own version one year later, which also became successful.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/as-tears-go-by-mt0004692005|title=As Tears Go By|publisher=Allmusic|author=Ruhlmann, William|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then released a series of successful singles, including "This Little Bird", "Summer Nights", and "[[Come and Stay With Me]]".&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Faithfull married John Dunbar on 6 May 1965 in [[Cambridge]] with [[Peter Asher]] as the [[Participants in wedding ceremonies#Groomsmen|best man]].&lt;ref name = "BeatlesE"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Harry, Bill| title=The Beatles Encyclopaedia (2000 paperback edition; first published 1992) | year=2000 | publisher=Virgin Publishing | location=London | isbn=0-7535-0481-2 | page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in a flat at 29 Lennox Gardens in [[Belgravia]] just off [[Knightsbridge]], London SW1.&lt;ref name = "BeatlesE"/&gt; On 10 November 1965, she gave birth to their son, Nicholas.&lt;ref name = "BeatlesE"/&gt; She left her husband shortly after to live with Mick Jagger.&lt;ref name = "BeatlesE"/&gt;

[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], Marianne Faithfull, [[Al Vandenberg]], [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], and [[Brian Jones]] at the [[Royal Concertgebouw]] on 1 September 1967]]
In 1966 she took Nicholas to stay with [[Brian Jones]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]] in London. During that time period, Faithfull started smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and became best friends with Pallenberg. She also began a much publicised relationship with Mick Jagger that same year. The couple became notorious and largely part of the hip [[Swinging London]] scene. She was found wearing only a fur rug by police executing a drug search at [[Keith Richards]]'s house in [[West Wittering]], [[Sussex]]. In an interview 27 years later with [[A.M. Homes]] for [[Details magazine|''Details'']], Faithfull discussed her wilder days and admitted that the drug bust fur rug incident had ravaged her personal life: "It destroyed me. To be a male [[drug addict]] and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother." In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to [[cocaine]], miscarried a daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while retreating to Jagger's country house in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marianne Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/faithfull-marianne-biography |title=Marianne Biography |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faithfull's involvement in Jagger's life would be reflected in some of the Rolling Stones's best known songs. "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]", featured on the 1968 album ''[[Beggars Banquet]],'' was partially inspired by ''[[The Master and Margarita]],'' written by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], a book to which Faithfull introduced Jagger. The song "[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]," on the 1969 album ''[[Let It Bleed]],'' was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs "[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]" and "[[I Got the Blues]]" on the 1971 album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' were also allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote "[[Sister Morphine]]". (The writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle; the resolution of the case has Faithfull listed as co-author of the song.) In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent did not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and battling with heroin addiction at the time. Faithfull appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' concert, giving a solo performance of "Something Better".&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

=== 1970s ===
Faithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970, and she lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Faithfull's personal life went into decline, and her career went into a tailspin. She only made a few appearances, including a 1973 performance at [[NBC]] with [[David Bowie]], singing [[Sonny &amp; Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]".&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

Faithfull lived on London's [[Soho]] streets for two years, suffering from [[heroin addiction]] and [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvie Simmons [http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 interview], ''Mojo Magazine'', 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193903/http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 |date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends intervened and enrolled her in an [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] drug programme, from which she could get her daily fix on prescription from a chemist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Barber, Lynn |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,521920,00.html |title=You know, I'm not everybody's cup of tea! |work=The Observer |date=15 July 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She failed at controlling or stabilising her [[drug addiction|addiction]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBUGo2YaJg |title=Marianne Faithfull Interview 1978|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, producer [[Mike Leander]] found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]''. The album was shelved until 1985.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

Severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during this period, permanently altered Faithfull's voice, leaving it cracked and lower in pitch. While the new sound was praised as "whisky soaked" by some critics, journalist John Jones, of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', wrote that she had "permanently vulgarised her voice".&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; In 1975 she released the [[country music|country]]-influenced record [[Dreamin' My Dreams (Marianne Faithfull album)|''Dreamin' My Dreams'']] (a.k.a. ''Faithless''), which reached No.1 on the [[Irish Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Faithfull moved into a [[squatting|squat]] without hot water or electricity in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] with then-boyfriend Ben Brierly, of the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[the Vibrators]]. She later shared flats in Chelsea and [[Regent's Park]] with [[Henrietta Moraes]].

Faithfull's career returned full force in 1979 (the same year she was arrested for marijuana possession in [[Norway]]) with the album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]'', one of her most critically hailed albums.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; The album was partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year. In addition to the [[punk-pop]] sounds of the title track (which addressed terrorism in Europe, being dedicated to [[Ulrike Meinhof]]), the album also included "Why D'Ya Do It?", a punk-[[reggae]] song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by [[Heathcote Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Robert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1D61339F932A15753C1A967948260 |title=The Pop Life |work=The New York Times |date=21 October 1981 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical structure of this song is complex; though on the surface hard rock, it is a [[Tango (dance)|tango]] in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by [[Barry Reynolds]] in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure are accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 is accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams' lyric was "an early form of [[rap music|rap]]".&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; ''Broken English'' was also the album which revealed the full extent of Faithfull's drinking and drug use and its effect on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records being replaced by a raucous, deep voice which helped capture the raw emotions expressed in the album's songs.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

=== 1980s ===
Faithfull began living in [[New York City|New York]] after the release of the follow-up to ''Broken English'', ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'', in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]'' (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed "Ballad of the Soldier's Wife" on [[Hal Willner]]'s tribute album ''[[Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill]]''. Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.

In 1985, she was at the [[Hazelden Foundation]] Clinic in [[Minnesota]] for rehabilitation. She then received treatment at [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]]. While living at a hotel in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a [[dual diagnosis]] ([[mental illness|mentally ill]] and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a ''"thank you"'' to Tose within the album package of ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]]'', on the back sleeve: "To Howard Tose with love and thanks". Faithfull's divorce from Brierly was also finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose's death in "Flaming September" from the album ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]''.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

In 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, this time as a jazz and blues singer, on ''Strange Weather'', also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]" for ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'', this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. "I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song," she told [[Jay Cocks]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Faithfull declared, "forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen."&lt;ref name="Marianne Biography"/&gt; The album of covers was produced by [[Hal Willner]] after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of [[20th-century music]]. They chose to record such diverse tracks as [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]" and "[[Yesterdays (1933 song)|Yesterdays]]", written by Broadway composers [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Otto Harbach]]. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Bessie Smith]]; [[Tom Waits]] wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

=== 1990s ===
When [[Roger Waters]] assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]'' live in [[Berlin]] in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink's overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album ''Blazing Away,'' which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. ''Blazing Away'' was recorded at St. Ann's Cathedral in [[Brooklyn]]. The 13 selections include "Sister Morphine", a cover of [[Edith Piaf]]'s "Les Prisons du Roy", and "Why D'Ya Do It?" from ''Broken English''. Alanna Nash of ''Stereo Review'' commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her—longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former [[The Band|Band]] member [[Garth Hudson]] and pianist [[Dr. John]]. Nash was also impressed with the album's autobiographical tone, noting "Faithfull's gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who's been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has." The reviewer extolled Faithfull as "one of the most challenging and artful of women artists," and ''Rolling Stone'' writer Fred Goodman asserted: "''Blazing Away'' is a fine retrospective – proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa."&lt;ref name="Marianne Biography"/&gt;

''A Collection of Her Best Recordings'' was released in 1994 by [[Island Records]] to coincide with the release of the Faithfull autobiography; the two products originally shared the same cover art. It contained Faithfull's updated version of "As Tears Go By" from ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]],'' several cuts from ''Broken English'' and ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' and a song written by [[Patti Smith]] scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, "[[Ghost Dance (song)|Ghost Dance]]", suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old acquaintances: Stones' drummer [[Charlie Watts]] and guitarist [[Ron Wood]] backed Faithfull's vocals on the song, while [[Keith Richards]] coproduced it. The retrospective album also featured one live track, "Times Square", from ''Blazing Away'' as well as a new Faithfull original, "She", penned with composer and arranger [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to be released the following year on ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]'', with additional songs co written with Badalamenti. Faithfull also sang "Love is Teasin," an Irish folk standard, with [[The Chieftains]] on their album [[The Long Black Veil (album)|The Long Black Veil]], released in 1995. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the [[San Francisco]] band [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]]'s 1997 album Serenade in Red. Faithfull also sang interlude vocals on [[Metallica]]'s song "[[The Memory Remains]]" from their 1997 album ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|ReLoad]]'' and appeared in the song's music video; the track reached No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart) and No.13 in the UK.

As her fascination with the music of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at the [[Gate Theatre]], [[Dublin]], playing [[Pirate Jenny]]. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, ''[[20th Century Blues (Marianne Faithfull album)|Twentieth Century Blues]]'' (1996), which focused on the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] as well as [[Noël Coward]], followed in 1998 by a recording of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (Marianne Faithfull album)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'', with the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour accompanied by [[Paul Trueblood]] at the piano, culminated in the filming, at the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]], of the DVD ''Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill''.

In 1998 Faithfull released ''A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology'', a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums ''Broken English'', ''Dangerous Acquaintances'', ''A Child's Adventure'', ''Strange Weather'', ''Blazing Away'', and ''A Secret Life'', as well as several [[B side]]s and unreleased tracks.

Faithfull's 1999 DVD ''Dreaming My Dreams'' contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964 and interviews with the artist and several friends who have known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]] and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on [[PBS]] for the series ''[[Sessions at West 54th]]''. That same year, she ranked 25th in ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll''.

Roger Waters (Pink Floyd) wrote the song ''Incarceration of a Flower Child'' in 1968; it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was eventually recorded by Marianne Faithfull on her 1999 album ''[[Vagabond Ways]]''.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Marianne-faithfull-8 Istanbul 2.jpg|thumb|right|Faithfull performing in 2008]]
Faithfull released several albums in the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with ''[[Vagabond Ways]]'' (1999), which was produced and recorded by [[Mark Howard (producer)|Mark Howard]]. It included collaborations with [[Daniel Lanois]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, and writer (and friend) [[Frank McGuinness]]. Later that year she sang "Love Got Lost" on [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson's]] ''[[Night and Day II]]''.

Her renaissance continued with ''[[Kissin Time]]'', released in 2002. The album contained songs written with [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Beck]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], David Courts and the [[France|French]] pop singer [[Étienne Daho]]. On this record, she paid tribute to [[Nico]] (with "Song for Nico"), whose work she admired. The album also included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called "Sliding Through Life on Charm".

In 2005, she released ''[[Before the Poison]]''. The album was primarily a collaboration with [[PJ Harvey]] and [[Nick Cave]], though [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jon Brion]] also contributed. ''Before the Poison'' received mixed reviews from both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walters, Barry |title=Before the poison -review |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 2005 |quote=The combination often proves too bleak.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Goldfein, Josh |title=Angel With Big Friends – ''Before the poison'' review |work=Village Voice |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-04-12/music/angel-with-big-friends/ |date=12 April 2005 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |quote=Faithfull's voice is just too weak to carry a tune without a narrative crutch...

In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter, [[Patrick Wolf]] on the duet "Magpie" from his third album ''The Magic Position'' and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film ''Truands'' called "A Lean and Hungry Look" with Ulysse.

In March 2007 she returned to the stage with a touring show entitled ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''. Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before including "Something Better", the song she sang on ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. The show also included the [[Harry Nilsson]] song "Don't Forget Me", "Marathon Kiss" from [[Vagabond Ways]] and a version of the traditional "Spike Driver Blues".

Articles published at that time hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement and was hoping that money from ''Songs of the Innocence and Experience'' would enable her to live in comfort. She said: "I'm not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariannefaithfull.net/news.php?item.26.4 Faithful Reveals She Has No Money] mariannefaithfull.net&lt;/ref&gt; However, she still lived in her flat in Paris&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Woods, Judith |title='Of course I have regrets,' says Marianne Faithfull, on a life packed with bad living |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-495994/Of-course-I-regrets-says-Marianne-Faithfull-life-packed-bad-living.html |work=Daily Mail |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |quote=Marianne on the balcony of her Paris apartment, which is tucked away off the ultra-fashionable shopping street rue St-Honoré}}&lt;/ref&gt; (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite web |author=Iley, Chrissy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8359212/Marianne-Faithfull-interview.html |title=Marianne Faithfull interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |quote=She still lives in Paris and has a house in County Waterford, Ireland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording of ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (Marianne Faithfull album)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]'' commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by [[Hal Willner]] who had previously recorded ''Strange Weather'' in 1997.

On 16 April 2009, while preparing to board a [[British Airways]] flight at London's [[Gatwick Airport]] bound for a concert appearance in [[Bologna]], [[François Ravard]], accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made as to whether the passenger is fit to travel. When he was refused travel, he became physically and verbally abusive. Police were called and he was arrested.

The pair was flying to Italy on a leg of her world tour promoting ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (Marianne Faithfull album)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]''. According to her spokesperson, "Marianne was at Gatwick airport but was not involved in any way in the situation that occurred and she managed to travel on to Bologna as planned.

In April 2009, Faithfull stated that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull said, "I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely. I am much, much better now, but it is not good for your self-esteem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1171647/After-15-years-Marianne-Faithfull-soul-mate-split.html After 15 years, Faithfull and her 'soul mate' split], ''Daily Mail'', (18 April 2009).

Because of this, she insisted, it has been hard to maintain a long career as a female artist, which, she said, gave her empathy for [[Amy Winehouse]] when they met recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldradio.ch/wrs/shows/mix/an-icon-in-switzerland-marianne-faithfull.shtml?16713 |title='Marianne Faithfull: An icon', radio interview, World Radio Switzerland (10 mins) |publisher=Worldradio.ch |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010941/http://worldradio.ch/wrs/shows/mix/an-icon-in-switzerland-marianne-faithfull.shtml?16713 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UK CD release was planned for 7 March 2011. Faithfull supported the album's release with an extensive European tour with a five-piece band, arriving in the UK on 24 May for a rare show at London's [[Barbican Centre]], with an extra UK show at [[Leamington Spa]] on 26 May. TV and media interviews were also planned as part of the promotion.

On 7 May 2011 she appeared on [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''[[Graham Norton Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010xwbq |title="Marianne Faithfull and Mark Foster join Graham" at |publisher=BBC |date=7 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reunited with [[Metallica]] in December 2011 for their 30th anniversary celebration at [[the Fillmore]] where she performed "[[The Memory Remains]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iGO8-OwBXk |title=Metallica w/ Marianne Faithfull – The Memory Remains (Live in San Francisco, December 7th, 2011) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Faithfull released an album of all-new material, titled ''[[Give My Love to London]].'' She started a 12-month 50th anniversary tour at the end of 2014.

During a webchat hosted by ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 1 February 2016, Faithfull revealed plans to release a live album from her 50th Anniversary tour. She also had ideas for a follow-up for ''Give My Love to London,'' but had no intention of recording new material for at least a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2016/jan/28/marianne-faithfull-webchat-post-your-questions-now|title=Marianne Faithfull webchat – as it happened|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new album from Faithfull, which she titled ''Negative Capability,'' was slated to be released sometime in 2018, via BMG. Promotions for the album described it as channeling [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], having a folky feel, and including collaborations with [[Nick Cave]], [[Ed Harcourt]], and [[Mark Lanegan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://60stoday.com/2017/12/29/marianne-faithfull-announces-new-album-negative-capability/|title=Marianne Faithfull Announces New Album ‘Negative Capability}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/bmg-promotes-fred-casimir-to-evp-of-global-recordings/|title=BMG PROMOTES FRED CASIMIR TO EVP OF GLOBAL RECORDINGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported, in the ''Daily Beast,'' that ''Negative Capability'' would be released on 2 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/marianne-faithfull-a-lifetimes-worth-of-dream-dinner-dates|title=Marianne Faithfull: A Lifetime’s Worth of Dream Dinner Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Faithfull's touring and work schedule has been repeatedly interrupted by health problems. In late 2004 she called off the European leg of a world tour, promoting ''[[Before The Poison]]'' after collapsing on stage in [[Milan]], and was hospitalised for exhaustion. The tour resumed later and included a US leg in 2005. In September 2006, she again called off a concert tour, this time after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5345326.stm|title=Sixties star Faithfull has cancer|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stay-faithfull-a-revealing-audience-with-marianne-faithfull-813726.html |title=Stay Faithfull: A revealing audience with Marianne Faithfull |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=26 April 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, she underwent surgery in France and no further treatment was necessary owing to the tumour having been caught at a very early stage. Less than two months after she declared having beaten the disease, Faithfull made her public statement of full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6121442.stm|title=Faithfull recovers after cancer|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Faithfull stated she suffered from [[hepatitis C]] on the UK television programme ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', and that she had first been diagnosed with the condition 12 years before. She discusses both the cancer and hepatitis diagnoses in further depth in her second memoir, ''Memories, Dreams and Reflections.''&lt;ref name="Faithfull, Marianne 2007"/&gt; On 27 May 2008, Faithfull released the following blog posting on her MySpace page, with the headline "Tour Dates Cancelled" and credited to FR Management – the company operated by her boyfriend/manager François Ravard: "Due to general mental, physical and nervous exhaustion doctors have ordered Marianne Faithfull to immediately cease all work activities and rehabilitate. The treatment and recovery should last around six months."&lt;ref name="profile.myspace.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=114722231 |title=Marianne Faithfull Official MySpace |publisher=Profile.myspace.com |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222194438/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=114722231 |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsha Coleman-Adebayo.jpg|thumb|Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]]
'''Marsha Coleman-Adebayo''' is an American former senior policy analyst for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Beginning in 1996, she filed complaints alleging that a company from the United States was mining [[vanadium]] in South Africa and harming the environment and human health. The EPA did not respond, and Coleman-Adebayo reported her concerns to other organizations. When the EPA subsequently did not promote Coleman-Adebayo at her request, she filed suit against the agency, alleging racial and gender discrimination. On August 18, 2000, a federal jury found EPA guilty of violating the civil rights of Coleman-Adebayo on the basis of race, sex, color and a [[hostile work environment]], under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;  Her experience inspired passage of the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 ([[No FEAR Act]]).

During the legal proceedings, Coleman-Adebayo remained employed at the EPA. When she was diagnosed with hypertension, the agency agreed to let her work from home. After five years of [[telecommuting]] and another lawsuit, the EPA ordered Coleman-Adebayo to return to the office, placing her on unpaid leave when she did not comply.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/09/AR2006070900741_pf.html Fears, D., "Coming Soon: A Tale of Whistleblowing at the EPA"], [[Washington Post]], 10 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman-Adebayo is a founder and leader of the No FEAR Coalition&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; and EPA Employees Against Racial Discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Through her leadership the No FEAR Coalition, working closely with Representative [[James Sensenbrenner]], organized a successful grass-roots campaign and secured passage of the "[[No-FEAR Act|Notification of Federal Employees Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act]]," the first Civil Rights Law of the 21st Century. The Act was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Coleman-Adebayo currently serves on the Board of Directors of the [[National Whistleblower Center]], a nonpartisan, nonprofit, advocacy group dedicated to protecting the rights of employee whistleblowers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} ''Good Housekeeping'' presented her with its Women in Government award in 2003.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; Her first book, "No Fear: A Whistleblower's Triumph Over Corruption and Retaliation at the EPA" was published in September 2011 by Lawrence Hill Books.

As of April 2015, she also serves on the Green [[Shadow Cabinet]] of the United States as "Director of Governmental Transparency and Accountability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenshadowcabinet.us/members|title=Green Shadow Cabinet Members|accessdate=2015-04-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330010626/http://greenshadowcabinet.us/members|archivedate=2015-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Coleman-Adebayo endorsed [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate Dr. [[Jill Stein]] while speaking at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Bernd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/31570-we-re-in-an-age-of-the-statistically-unlikely-green-party-candidate-jill-stein-announces-presidential-run|title="An Age of the Statistically Unlikely": An Interview With Presidential Candidate Jill Stein|last=Bernd|first=Candice|publisher=[[TruthOut]]|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norris Edwin Bradbury''' (30 May 1909&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 1997), was an American [[physicist]] who served as Director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for 25 years from 1945 to 1970. He succeeded [[Robert Oppenheimer]], who personally chose Bradbury for the position of director after working closely with him on the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]]. Bradbury was in charge of the final assembly of "[[the Gadget]]", detonated in July 1945 for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]].

Bradbury took charge at Los Alamos at a difficult time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor and there was a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.

In the 1950s Bradbury oversaw the development of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s, although a falling out with [[Edward Teller]] over the priority given to their development led to the creation of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. In later years, he branched out, constructing the [[Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility]] to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the [[Space Race]] of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the [[Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application]] (NERVA). The [[Bradbury Science Museum]] is named in his honor.

== Early life ==
Norris Bradbury was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], on 30 May 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seaborg, Glenn T.|authorlink=Glenn T. Seaborg|title=Obituary: Norris Edwin Bradbury|journal=Physics Today|date=January 1998|volume=51|issue=1|pages=74–75|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v51/i1/p74_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.882111|bibcode=1998PhT....51a..74S}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of four children of Edwin Pearly and his wife Elvira née Clausen. One sister died as an infant, and the family adopted twins Bobby and Betty, both of whom served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]]. Bradbury was educated at [[Hollywood High School]] and [[Chaffey High School]] in [[Ontario, California]], graduating at the age of 16. He then attended [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], from which he graduated [[summa cum laude]] with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in [[chemistry]] in 1929. This earned him membership of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]].{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=3}}{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=62}} At Pomona, he met Lois Platt, an English Literature major who was the sister of his college roommate. They were married in 1933,{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=63–68}} and had three sons, James, John, and David.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=11}}

Bradbury became interested in [[physics]], and did graduate work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was a teaching fellow from 1929 to 1931, and then a [[Whiting Foundation]] fellow from 1931 to 1932. He submitted a PhD thesis on ''Studies on the mobility of gaseous ions'' under the supervision of Leonard B. Loeb, and was awarded a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] fellowship.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b15406108~S1 |title=Studies on the mobility of gaseous ions |year=1932 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=The Mobility of Aged Ions in Air in Relation to the Nature of Gaseous Ions  |last=Bradbury |first=Norris E. |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1311–1319 |date=May 1931  |publisher=American Physical Society |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.1311 |bibcode = 1931PhRv...37.1311B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as supervising Bradbury's thesis, Loeb, who had served as a naval reservist during [[World War I]], encouraged Bradbury to apply for a commission as a naval reservist. Bradbury's commission as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] was signed by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]], who was the head of the [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] at Berkeley at the time.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=69–70}}

After two years at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Bradbury became an assistant professor of physics at [[Stanford University]] in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the [[Electrical conductor|electrical conductivity]] of gases, the properties of [[ion]]s, and the behavior of [[atmospheric electricity]], publishing in journals including the ''[[Physical Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Physics]]'', ''[[Journal of Chemical Physics]]'', and the ''Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism''.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=4}} He invented the [[Bradbury-Nielsen shutter]], a type of electrical ion gate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norris E.

== World War II ==
Bradbury was called up for service in World War II in early 1941, although the Navy allowed him to stay at Stanford until the end of the academic year. He was then sent to the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] at [[Dahlgren, Virginia]], to work on [[external ballistics]]. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and [[Commander]] [[Deak Parsons]].{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=69–70}}

[[File:HD.4G.053 (10540204545).jpg|thumb|right|[[Trinity Test]], July 1945. Bradbury stands next to the partially assembled Gadget atop the test tower.]]
In June 1944, Bradbury received orders from Parsons, who was now the Deputy Director of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], to report to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury to work on the [[explosive lens]]es required by an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.{{sfn|Christman|1998|p=139}}{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=71}}

At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=175}} which put him in charge of the implosion field test program.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=310}} In August, the laboratory's director, [[Robert Oppenheimer]], implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of [[George Kistiakowsky]]'s new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=245}} At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the [[jet (fluid)|jets]] that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, [[X-ray]] and [[RaLa]] techniques.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=272–277}}

In March 1945, Oppenheimer created [[Project Alberta]] under Parsons to carry out the Manhattan Project's ultimate mission: the preparation and delivery of nuclear weapons in combat. Bradbury was transferred to Project Alberta to head the [[Fat Man]] assembly group.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=319}} In July 1945, Bradbury supervised the preparation of "the Gadget", as the bomb was known, at the [[Trinity nuclear test]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=367–368}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=378}} "For me to say", Bradbury later recalled, "I had any deep emotional thoughts about Trinity... I didn't. I was just damned pleased that it went off."{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=79}}

== Director of Los Alamos ==
[[File:Bradbury Groves Jette etc. 681002.jpg|thumb|right|Bradbury (left) sits at a table with Leslie Groves of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (center) and Eric Jette]]
Oppenheimer submitted his resignation as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked the fact that as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=3625–626}}{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=4}}

Parsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy,{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=82–83}} which awarded him the [[Legion of Merit]] for his wartime services.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=9}} He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=98}} On 16 October 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the [[Army-Navy "E" Award]], and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory's second director the following day.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=398–402}}{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=4}}

The first months of Bradbury's directorship were particularly difficult. He had hoped that [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became clear that this would take more than six months. President [[Harry S. Truman]] did not sign the act creating the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=5}}

Most of the scientists at Los Alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. [[Darol Froman]] became head of [[Robert Bacher]]'s G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, [[John H. Manley]] for Physics, [[George Placzek]] for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=398–402}} The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=5}} Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for [[Operation Crossroads]], the nuclear tests in the Pacific.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=6}}

[[File:Bradbury in front of Kiwi B4-A reactor N6211910.jpg|thumb|left|Bradbury (left) in front of the Kiwi B4-A reactor used to power a nuclear rocket]]
Bradbury pushed continued development of nuclear weapons to take them from laboratory devices to production models. There were numerous improvements that could make them more safe, reliable and easy to store and handle, and make more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel. While Bradbury gave priority to improved fission weapons, research still continued on "Alarm Clock", a boosted nuclear weapon, and the "[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]", a [[thermonuclear weapon]]s design.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=58–59}} The new fission designs were tested during [[Operation Sandstone]] in 1948. The [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]] became the first nuclear weapon to be mass-produced on an assembly line.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=176}}

As the future became more certain, Bradbury began looking for a new site for the laboratory away from the crowded town center. In 1948, Bradbury submitted a proposal to the Atomic Energy Commission for a new $107 million facility on the South Mesa, linked to the town by a new bridge over the canyon.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=176}}

All this time, Bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract three months after the end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=88–90}}{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=9}}

By 1951, the laboratory had come up with the [[Teller-Ulam design]], and thermonuclear tests were conducted during [[Operation Greenhouse]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=539–542}} Tensions between Bradbury and [[Edward Teller]] over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to the creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=568–572, 584–584}}

In later years, Bradbury branched out, constructing the [[Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility]] to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=93}} During the [[Space Race]] of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on [[Project Rover]], developing the [[Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application]] (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=8}}

For many years, Bradbury was responsible for much of the administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on 18 February 1957 the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended.{{sfn|Hunner|2004|pp=130–132, 218–219}}{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=91–92}}

In 1966, Bradbury was awarded the [[Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service]] for "exceptionally meritorious civilian service to the Armed Forces and the United States of America in a position of great responsibility as director, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory".{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|pp=9–10}} His citation went on to say that "The outstanding international reputation of the Los Alamos Laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership. The United States is indebted to Dr. Bradbury and his laboratory, to a very large degree, for our present nuclear capability."{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|pp=9–10}} He also received the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] in 1970.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|pp=9–10}}

== Later life ==
[[File:Bradbury and Oppenheimer PUB-5829-26.jpg|thumb|right|Bradbury with his predecessor Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1964]]
Bradbury retired as director of Los Alamos Laboratory in 1970. His successor, [[Harold Agnew]], invited him to become a senior consultant, but Bradbury declined the offer, although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies, including the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and as a member of the boards of the Los Alamos Medical Center, the First National Bank of Santa Fe, the Los Alamos YMCA and the Santa Fe Neurological Society.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=187–188}}

In 1969 the [[Governor of New Mexico]], [[David Cargo]], appointed Bradbury as a regent of the [[University of New Mexico]],  but this was a turbulent time for the university. In response to the [[Kent State Shootings]] in May 1970, students and antiwar activist [[Jane Fonda]] marched on the home of Ferrel Heady, the President of the University of New Mexico. When he refused to meet with them, the students called a strike. Classes were cancelled, rallies were held and students occupied the Student Union Building. Cargo called in the [[New Mexico National Guard]] to remove them, and eleven people were [[bayonet]]ed. Cargo's successor, [[Bruce King]], replaced Bradbury and another regent.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=187–188}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Santa Fe Reporter]] |url=http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-7911-may-1970-the-bust-at-the-sub.html |title=May 1970: The Bust at the SUB |date=26 November 2013 |first=Dianne R. |last=Layden |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while chopping firewood. [[Gangrene]] set in, and his right leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|pp=190–193}} He was survived by his wife Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons.{{sfn|Agnew|Schreiber|1998|p=11}} A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.{{sfn|Ebinger|2006|p=185}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave | grid = 91814037 | name = Norris Edwin Bradbury | date = 20 August 1997 | accessdate = 7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked in private practice in [[Athens, Ohio]].   Martin taught psychology, [[psychopharmacology]], and the Biblical basis of behavior for five years at [[Geneva College]], where he was a member of the department of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=ICSA Staff|title=People Profiles - International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) |url=http://www.icsahome.com/elibrary/peopleprofiles|website=www.icsahome.com|publisher=ICSA|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 book ''Cult-Proofing Your Kids'', Martin wrote about his former membership and leadership in the [[Great Commission International]] (currently called [[Great Commission Association of Churches]]).  In 1971, he dropped out of graduate school to join the group, when it was known as "The Blitz".  He later explained that he left the group when he did not receive an adequate response, after questioning its more controversial methods and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Paul R.|title=Cult proofing your kids|date=1 April 1993|publisher=Zondervan Pub.

==Career==
Mr. Martin served as an expert witness in court cases including the [[Lee Boyd Malvo]] sniper trial and the trial of [[Zacharias Moussaoui]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Puss 'n' Boots''''' was a British comic strip which ran in the UK comic magazine ''[[Sparky (comic)|Sparky]]'' from 1969 to 1977 and later appeared in ''[[Topper (comic book)|Topper]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]''. Most of the strips were drawn by [[John Geering]]. Some scripts were written by Morris Heggie, later to become editor of the Dandy.

==Concept==

The strip's protagonists are Puss, a black anthropomorphic [[cat]] and Boots, a similarly humanoid brown [[dog]]. In the stories they are in a continuous state of conflict, as indicated by the strap-line "They Fight Like Cat and Dog". Most stories revolved around one of them playing a trick on the other, the recipient getting revenge and both fighting. The strip name is a pun on the pantomime ''[[Puss in Boots]]''. 

It was one of a few [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co.|DC Thomson ]] cartoons where dialogue was as important as the artwork, with Puss and Boots insulting each other elaborately.

Regular characters included Puss' baby nephew, Titch, whose speech largely consisted of the word 'Baggle', and from time to time the Scottish uncles, Uncle Hamish McToorie and Uncle Duncan McTavish.

==Later history==

As its sales faltered ''Sparky'' was merged with ''Topper'' which also failed. From 1993 ''Puss 'n' Boots'' appeared infrequently in the Dandy before a long hiatus. The artist John Geering died in 1999. The strip ran in ''The Dandy'' for two spells in the early 2000s, drawn by [[Barrie Appleby]], who also drew [[Cuddles and Dimples]], before being dropped when the comic was revamped in October 2004. 

From 2008 new strips appeared in ''The Dandy'' and older strips were reprinted in [[Classics from the Comics]]. ''Puss 'n' Boots'' appear in the Dandy Annual 2009, drawn by [[Nigel Parkinson]]. They also feature in the 2012 annual drawn by [[Nigel Auchterlounie]].

A similarly themed strip also appeared in [[The Beano]] under the name [[Meebo and Zuky]].

==Biography==
[[File:Rosina Galli - Feb 1920 Shadowland.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Galli (1920)]]
Galli was born in Naples, where her father was a lawyer. She studied dance at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]]'s ballet school, becoming the company's ''première danseuse'' at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="nytimes1911"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seventeen-Year-Old Dancer Delights Operagoers|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/11/12/104882406.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 November 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was offered the première danseuse position at La Scala Theatre Ballet, the family moved to Milan. She debuted in 1910, at the age of eighteen, dancing in ''Pietro Micca'' and ''Ballo Excelsior'' of [[Luigi Manzotti]].

In 1911, her father and two brothers escorted Galli to [[Genoa]], from where Galli and her mother proceeded to [[Chicago]], US. Galli performed first as soloist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chujoy|first1=Anatole|last2=Manchester|first2=P W|title=The Dance Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xujdtusdm8YC|year=1967|publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as prima ballerina of the Chicago Ballet. In 1913,&lt;ref name="D'Acierno1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Acierno|first=Pellegrino|title=The Italian American Heritage: A Companion to Literature and Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nevq7gnw-WgC&amp;pg=PA470|date=January 1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-0380-0|pages=470–}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was hired by the Metropolitan Opera House. Though she sported a petite figure, characterized as [[elf]]ish, Galli demonstrated a rigorous technique and performed powerful [[pirouette]]s, continuing to dance there until 1931.&lt;ref name=LaGuminaCavaioli2013 /&gt; Her partner at the Met was Giuseppe Bonfiglio.&lt;ref name="CohenFoundation1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Selma Jeanne|author2=Dance Perspectives Foundation|title=International encyclopedia of dance: a project of Dance Perspectives Foundation, Inc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhsKAQAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512308-1|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her studies in America were under [[Luigi Albertieri]].&lt;ref name="PageWentink1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Page|first1=Ruth|last2=Wentink|first2=Andrew Mark|last3=Delfau|first3=André|title=Class: notes on dance classes around the world, 1915–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V098U1gISR4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton Book Co.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seamus Daly''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''' Séamus Ó Dálaigh''') is an [[Irish republican]] from [[Kilmurray]], [[Castleblayney]], [[County Monaghan]]. He was [[Indictment|charged]] with  being a member of the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in Dublin's [[Special Criminal Court]] in 2004, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three and half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Man convicted of Real IRA membership | author = | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0302/rira.html | publisher = ''[[RTÉ]]'' | date = 2 March 2004 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he appeared in [[Carrickmacross]] District Court for failing to produce insurance and driving without a licence at Tullyvaragh, Carrickmacross and also failing to produce insurance and a driving licence when stopped in Carrickmacross Court car park. He received a 12-month driving ban and a €3,250 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8094683.stm|title=Omagh bomb organiser's drive ban |date=2009-06-11|accessdate=2009-06-26|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
He is a builder from Cullaville, County Monaghan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/omagh-bomb-legal-victory-the-men-behind-worst-atrocity-of-the-troubles-28486981.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omagh bombing ==
{{main|Omagh bombing}}
In 2009, Daly, along with three other Real IRA members, were ruled to be civilly liable for the [[Omagh bombing]] and ordered by a Belfast court to pay £1.5 million to the victims of the attack. All four men refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ira-militant-charged-29-omagh-bomb-murders-23277897 |title=Bail Denied for Real IRA Man Linked to Omagh Bomb |publisher=Associated Press |date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2014, arising out of the police investigation into the Omagh bombing, Seamus Daly was charged with the murder of 29 people in Omagh in 1998, two charges linked to the explosion and two counts linked to an attempted explosion in [[Lisburn]] in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man charged with murdering 29 people in Omagh bombing|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0410/608132-omagh/|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=RTÉ News|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in court on 11 April and was remanded in custody due to the possibility he may flee the jurisdiction. On 6 May, Daly's case was adjourned for four weeks at the prosecutor's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27300565 |title=Seamus Daly Omagh bomb case is adjourned |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 Northern Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions ordered that Daly face charges "both for the Omagh bomb and [[1988 Lisburn van bombing|Lisburn bomb]] and the charges associated with those two incidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11417770/Omagh-bombing-trial-of-Real-IRA-suspect-Seamus-Daly-will-go-ahead.html|title = Omagh bombing: trial of Real IRA suspect Seamus Daly will go ahead|date = 17 February 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = The Telegraph|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their star witness contradicted himself in pre-trial hearing, prosecutors in the North dropped all charges against Seamus Daly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/world/europe/seamus-daly-omagh-bombing.html?_r=0|title = Britain Drops Case Against Last Suspect in 1998 Omagh Bombing|date = 1 March 2016|accessdate = |website = |publisher = The Irish Times|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daly was released from Maghaberry high-security prison in Co Antrim on 1 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.sky.com/story/1651229/omagh-seamus-daly-freed-as-charges-dropped|title = Omagh: Seamus Daly Freed As Charges Dropped|date = 1 March 2016|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Sky News|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign for his release ==

Since his arrest in 2014, Daly's family and friends maintained his innocence. A committee was established in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crossexaminer.co.uk/archives/14338&lt;/ref&gt; to work on highlighting the case and they released a number of statements. A website and social media campaign &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/releaseseamusdaly?ref=hl&lt;/ref&gt; was established in July 2015 to highlight his ongoing imprisonment, which campaigners described as "the age old tactic of internment by remand."

'''Shirley Cheechoo''' ({{lang-cr|ᔒᓕᒋᒍ }} born 1952) is a [[Cree]] actress, writer, producer, director, and visual artist, best known for her [[solo-voice]] or [[monodrama]] play ''[[Path With No Moccasins]]'', as well as her work with [[De-Ba-Jeh-Mu-Jig]] theatre group. Her first break came in 1985 when she was cast on the CBC's first nations TV series ''[[Spirit Bay]]'', and later, in 1997, she found a role on the CBC's TV series ''[[The Rez]]''.

She was named chancellor of [[Brock University]] in July 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2015/07/16/acclaimed-native-actordirector-named-brock-chancellor "Acclaimed native actor/director named Brock chancellor"]. ''[[St. Catharines Standard]], July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the institution's first female and first aboriginal chancellor.

==Biography==

Shirley Cheechoo was born in 1952 in [[Eastmain, Quebec]],&lt;ref name ="turtleislandcheechoo"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shirley Cheechoo Internationally Acclaimed Filmmaker/ Artist|url = http://www.turtleisland.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?p=5182|website = Turtle Island Native Network|accessdate = 2015-10-26|date = 2005-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Moose Factory]] and [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[Ontario]]. Shirley spent her early life on traplines with her parents and brothers, but at the age of nine was sent to a residential school, [[Shingwauk Residential School]], now known as [[Algoma University College]]. At this school Cheechoo, like many other residential school survivors, experienced violence and abuse and was told that "her parents would die if she ran away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilmer|first1=S.E.|title=Native American Performance and Representation|date=2011|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Arizona|isbn=9780816502745|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school at fifteen, Cheechoo experienced problems with substance abuse, but eventually, she turned her life around and began to work in film and theatre to explore themes of healing and [[survivance]] post-trauma. Her experiences at a residential school and her road to healing are documented in her stage play 1991 ''Path with No Moccasins.''&lt;ref name ="turtleislandcheechoo" /&gt;

Shirley attended art classes at the [[Manitou Arts Foundation]] during the summer of 1966.

==The De-ba-jeh-mu-jig years==

Shirley founded De-ba-jeh-mu-jig theatre, which developed out of the children's theatre. After starting the theatre company, partner Blake Debassige, a visual artist, served on the board of directors and as president of the board during the early years of [[De-Ba-Jeh-Mu-Jig]] theatre group.

During her time at Debaj, Shirley fulfilled the role of [[artistic director]], president of the board of directors, as well as fulfilling much of the administrative roles, actor, and playwright.

Shirley is the first [[First Nations]] woman to "write, produce, direct, and act in a feature length film from Canada".&lt;ref name="whetung"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Shirley Cheechoo |url=http://www.whetung.com/cheechoo.html |date=2015-02-27 |accessdate=2015-10-26 |website=Whetung Ojibwa Crafts and Art Gallery |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227055704/http://www.whetung.com/cheechoo.html |archivedate=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moose River Crossing The Movie|url = http://www.mooserivercrossingthemovie.com/cast.php?cst=Shirley|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Shirley first gained national attention with ''Path With No Moccasins''. Her directorial debut was with a short film called ''Silent Tears'', which won several film festival awards for Best Short Film and was "screened at the 1998Sundance Film Festival."&lt;ref name = "whetung"/&gt;

Her first feature film was ''Backroads'', a journey into the harsh contemporary life of Cree women.  The movie was financed and executive-produced by Offline Entertainment Group.&lt;ref&gt;Aleiss, Angela. "Making War Bonnets Old Hat: Native American Filmmakers are Forging into Hollywood with Projects Involving Real Human Concerns," ''Los Angeles Times'', August 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shirley Cheechoo|url = http://filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu/person/895/|website = National Museum of the American Indian|accessdate = 2015-10-26|date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirley realized that she could "ease a pain or raise an issue with her film work" and so dedicated herself to creating film by enrolling in writing classes, director's labs, acting workshops and film schools.&lt;ref name="naaf.ca"&gt;[http://www.naaf.ca/html/shirley_cheechoo_e.html Shirley Cheechoo], [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]] {{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of her art is based on biographical elements. ''Path With No Moccasins'' gave Shirley the opportunity to "speak about her life and the struggle to retain her identity, and Cree heritage".&lt;ref name="artworldofsherway.com"&gt;[http://www.artworldofsherway.com/Featured%20Artists/Cheechoo/Cheechoo.htm/ Shirley Cheechoo], Art World of Sherway {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031030351/http://www.artworldofsherway.com/Featured%20Artists/Cheechoo/Cheechoo.htm/ |date=October 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Silent Tears'' chronicles the events of a "harsh winter trip with her parents to a northern trap line when she was eight years old".&lt;ref name="artworldofsherway.com" /&gt;

In order to promote Aboriginal artists, Shirley and Blake Debassige co-own [[Kasheese Studios]] art gallery. She is also the president of Spoken Song film production company and founded the [[Weengushk Film Institute]] on [[Manitoulin Island]] that will train, develop and guide independent filmmakers.&lt;ref name="naaf.ca"/&gt;

Her artwork is inspired by [[Woodlands style|Woodlands School]], which is a concept given birth by [[Norval Morrisseau]].  Her art has been exhibited around the world, and her commissions include:

*Christmas cards for UNICEF
*Amnesty International
*The Ontario Native Women's Association
*The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto

==Cultural work==

She is a mentor to many in the Native arts community and one of Canada's most well-known and respected artists. She visits other communities and schools and holds workshops. On the topic of visiting schools to host acting and playwrighting workshops, Shirley has said

&lt;blockquote&gt;the kids that come into the theatre, into the drama workshops, are the kids that I pick. I feel that they need some kind of self-esteem, and drama does it. Anything in the arts gives these kids a lot of self-esteem ... the arts are really important for children and they're not taught in the schools&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shirley is concerned with Indigenous people's complacency with "small advancements and the slight changes that appear when it comes to equality and respect" and believes that "We must continue to fight in the most positive way to try and find a level playing field for Indigenous people to work, live, and create in the main".&lt;ref name="naaf.ca"/&gt;

In February 2008, Shirley was awarded a [[Indspire Awards|Lifetime Achievement Award]] in the area of art by the [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://indspire.ca/laureate/shirley-cheechoo/ Shirley Cheechoo], Indspire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also awarded the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Award in 2013 to recognize her commitment to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Weengushk founder Shirley Cheechoo receives Diamond Jubilee Award|url = http://www.manitoulin.ca/2013/08/23/weengushk-founder-shirley-cheechoo-receives-diamond-jubilee-award/|website = Manitoulin Expositor|accessdate = 2015-10-26|date = 2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

[[Image:Arthur-Pyle Sir Kay breaketh his sword at ye Tournament.JPG|thumb|275px|"Sir Kay breaketh his sword at ye Tournament" from ''[[The Story of King Arthur and His Knights]]'' by [[Howard Pyle]] (1903)]]

In [[Arthurian legend]], '''Sir Kay''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ}} ({{lang-cy|'''Cai'''}}, [[Middle Welsh]] '''''Kei''''' or '''''Cei'''''; {{lang-la|Caius}}; French: ''Keu''; French Romance: ''Queux''; Old French: ''Kès'' or ''Kex'') is [[Sir Ector]]'s son and [[King Arthur]]'s foster brother and later [[seneschal]], as well as one of the first [[Knights of the Round Table|Knights]] of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]]. In later literature he is known for his acid tongue and bullying, boorish behavior, but in earlier accounts he was one of Arthur's premier warriors. Along with [[Bedivere]], with whom he is frequently associated, Kay is one of the earliest characters associated with Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;See Rachel Bromwich's discussion in the "Notes on Personal Names", part of her edition of ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads'', second edition (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp. 303-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cai in Welsh tradition==
Cai or Cei is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the [[Arthurian mythology|Arthurian cycle]], appearing in a number of early Welsh texts, including ''[[Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch ac Olwen]]'', ''[[Three Welsh Romances|Geraint fab Erbin]], [[Three Welsh Romances|Iarlles y Ffynnon]], ''[[Peredur fab Efrawg]]'', [[Breuddwyd Rhonabwy]], [[Pa gur|Pa Gur yv y Porthaur]]'' and the [[Welsh Triads]]. His father is given as Cynyr, his son as Garanwyn and his daughter as Kelemon.

Before Cai's birth, Cynyr Ceinfarfog prophesied that his son's heart would be eternally cold, that he would be exceptionally stubborn and that no one would be able to brave fire or water like him. Cai is attributed with a number of further superhuman abilities, including the ability to go nine days and nine nights without the need to breathe or to sleep, the ability to grow as "tall as the tallest tree in the forest if he pleased" and the ability to radiate supernatural heat from his hands. Furthermore, it is impossible to cure a wound from Cai's sword.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion.''&lt;/ref&gt; Cai is killed by Gwyddawg fab Menestyr, who is in turn killed in vengeance by [[King Arthur|Arthur]].

===''Pa Gur yv y Porthaur''===
One of the earliest direct reference to Cai can be found in the 10th-century poem ''Pa Gur'', in which Arthur recounts the feats and achievements of his knights so as to gain entrance to a fortress guarded by [[Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr]], the titular porter. The poem concerns itself largely with Cai's exploits:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Prince of the plunder,
The unrelenting warrior to his enemy;
Heavy was he in his vengeance;
Terrible was his fighting.

When he would drink from a horn,
He would drink as much as four;
When into battle he came
He slew as would a hundred.

Unless God should accomplish it,
Cei's death would be unattainable.

Worthy Cei and Llachau
Used to fight battles,
Before the pain of livid spears [ended the conflict].

On the top of Ystarfingun
Cei slew [[Nine sorceresses|nine witches]].
Worthy Cei went to Ynys Mon
To destroy lions.
Little protection did his shield offer
Against [[Cath Palug|Palug's Cat]].&lt;ref name="Pa Gur"&gt;[http://www.markadderley.net/arthur/welsh-arthur/pagur.html ''Pa Gur''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723202344/http://www.markadderley.net/arthur/welsh-arthur/pagur.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===''Culhwch ac Olwen''===
{{main|Culhwch and Olwen}}
[[File:Ysbaddaden.jpeg|thumb|Culhwch and his companions at Ysbadadden's court in [[Ernest Wallcousins]] illustration for ''Celtic Myth &amp; Legend'' (1920)]]

[[Culhwch]]'s father, [[Cilydd|King Cilydd son of Celyddon]], loses his wife [[Goleuddydd]] after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother's attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful [[Olwen]], daughter of the [[giant (mythology)|giant]] Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in [[Celliwig]] in [[Cornwall]] and asks for support and assistance. Cai is the first knight to volunteer to assist Culhwch in his quest, promising to stand by his side until Olwen is found. A further five knights join them in their mission. They travel onwards until they come across the "fairest of the castles of the world", and meet Ysbaddaden's shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd's twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden's castle. Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, [[Goreu fab Custennin|Goreu]] with his life. The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant's hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]], then by the enchanter [[Menw]], and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (''anoethau''), including hunting the [[Twrch Trwyth]] and recovering the exalted prisoner [[Mabon ap Modron]].

Cai is a prominent character throughout the tale and is responsible for completing a number of the tasks; he kills Wrnach the Giant, rescues [[Mabon ap Modron]] from his watery prison and retrieving the hairs of Dillus the Bearded. However, when Arthur makes a satirical [[englyn]] about Cai, he grows angry and hostile towards the king, ultimately abandoning the quest and his companions. The narrative tells us that Cai would "have nothing to do with Arthur from then on, not when the latter was waning in strength or when his men were being killed." As a result, he did not take part in [[Hunting of Twrch Trwyth|the hunt]] for [[Twrch Trwyth]].

===Other appearances===
In the Life of St. [[Cadoc]] (c.1100) Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cai in dealing with King [[Gwynllyw]] of [[Gwynllwg]]'s abduction of St. [[Gwladys]] from her father's court in [[Brycheiniog]]. Cai appears prominently in the early Welsh version of ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'', in which he assists the two lovers and is himself infatuated with a maiden named Golwg Hafddydd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/trystan.html] Trystan and Esyllt.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early dialogue poems relating to [[Maleagant|Melwas']] abduction of [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]]. The context suggests that Cai is rescuing the queen from the otherwordly suitor, and may imply a romantic relationship between Cai and Gwenhwyfar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/melwas.html] The Dialogue of Melwas and Gwenhwyfar&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Welsh Triads]] name Cai as one of the "Three Battle-Diademed Men of the Island of Britain" alongside [[Tristan|Drystan mab Tallwch]] and [[Hueil mab Caw]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Triads of the Horses'', his horse is named as Gwyneu gwddf hir (Gwyneu of the Long Neck).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to tradition, Cai is intimately associated with the old Roman fort of Caer Gai.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. [http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_c/cei.html] Celtnet.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Welsh Romances]] (specifically ''[[Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain]]'' and ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]''), Cai assumes the same boorish role he takes in the continental romances. However, manuscripts for these romances date to well after [[Chrétien de Troyes]], meaning that Cai as he appears there may owe more to Chrétien's version of the character than to the indigenous Welsh representation.

[[Image:Arthur-Pyle Sir Kay showeth the mystic sword unto Sir Ector.JPG|thumb|''Sir Kay showeth the mystic sword unto Sir Ector'', by [[Howard Pyle]] from ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1903)]]

Kay is ubiquitous in Arthurian literature but he rarely serves as anything but a [[foil (literature)|foil]] for other characters. Though he manipulates the king to get his way, his loyalty to Arthur is usually unquestioned. In the [[Vulgate Cycle]], the [[Post-Vulgate]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Kay's father Ector adopts the infant Arthur after [[Merlin]] takes him away from his birth parents, [[Uther]] and [[Igraine]]. Ector raises him and Kay as brothers, but Arthur's parentage is revealed when he draws the [[Excalibur|Sword in the Stone]] at a tournament in London. Arthur, serving as squire to the newly knighted Kay, is locked out of the house and cannot get to his brother's sword and uses the Sword in the Stone to replace it. Kay shows his characteristic opportunism when he tries to claim it was he that pulled the sword from the stone, making him the true [[List of legendary kings of Britain|King of the Britons]], but he relents and admits it was Arthur. He becomes one of the first Knights of the Round Table and serves his foster-brother throughout his life.

Kay's father is called Ector in later literature, but the Welsh accounts name him as Cynyr Fork-Beard. In ''[[Erec and Enide]]'', [[Chrétien de Troyes]] mentions he had a son called Gronosis, who was versed in evil, while the Welsh give him a son and daughter named Garanwyn and Celemon. Romance rarely deals with Kay's love life, an exception being Girart d'Amiens' ''Escanor'', which details his love for Andrivete of [[Northumbria]], whom he must defend from her uncle's political machinations before they can marry.

==Kay in Arthurian legend==
Kay and Bedivere appear in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', and aid Arthur in defeating the Giant of [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. Geoffrey makes Kay the count of [[Anjou]] and Arthur's steward, an office he holds in most later literature.

In the works of [[Chrétien de Troyes]], Kay assumes the characteristics he is most associated with today. He retains his hot-headedness and fiery temper from Welsh literature, but he is more or less an incompetent braggart. Chrétien uses him as a scoffer and a troublemaker; a foil for heroic knights like [[Lancelot]], [[Ywain]], or [[Gawain]]. He mocks the chivalric courtesy of Sir [[Calogrenant]] in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', and he tricks Arthur into allowing him to try to save [[Guinevere]] from [[Maleagant]] in ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', which ends in his humiliating defeat. In ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', Sir Kay grows angry with [[Percival|Perceval]]'s naïveté and slaps a maiden who says he will become a great knight; Perceval avenges her later when he breaks Kay's shoulder. [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who tells the same story in his ''[[Parzival]]'', asks his audience not to judge Kay too harshly, as his sharp words actually serve to maintain courtly order.

Scholars have pointed out that Kay's scornful, overly boastful character never makes him a clown, a coward or a traitor, except in the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] romance ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', where he murders Arthur's son [[Loholt]] and joins up with the king's enemies. This strange work is an anomaly, however, and Kay's portrayal tends to range from merely cruel and malicious, as in the ''Roman de [[Yder]]'' or [[Hartmann von Aue]]'s ''[[Iwein (poem)|Iwein]]'' to humorously derisive and even endearing, as in ''[[Durmart le Gallois]]'' and ''Escanor''.

Despite his ubiquity, Kay's death is not frequently dealt with. In Welsh literature, it is mentioned he was killed by Gwyddawg and avenged by Arthur. In Geoffrey of Monmouth and the ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'', he is killed in the war against the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Emperor Lucius|Lucius]], while the Vulgate Cycle has him die in France, also in battle against the Romans.

According to Malory's version of Book 5, Kay did not die in the war against Rome, but survived and later was part of a party sent to try and retrieve Excalibur's sacred scabbard, prior to the [[Battle of Camlann]]. He was also among the few people who survived the battle of Camlann, although it is ambiguous as to how he survived. In later interpretations it is suggested that he never participated in that battle.

==Modern interpretations==
*Kay is a main character in the first three books of [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Air and Darkness]]''. His portrayal is based on Malory's account of Arthur's upbringing, but White adds a number of new elements to the story, including one in which the young Kay kills a dangerous [[griffin]] with the aid of [[Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]]. White's Kay is quick-witted and often mean, but always a loving foster brother to Arthur, whom he calls "the Wart". Kay appears in the 1963 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]] film adaptation of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', in which he serves as a foil to Arthur, being self-centered, and lazy, in which he is outwardly boorish and bitter, and also constantly bullies Arthur. At the end when Arthur becomes King, he comes to respect Arthur as the King and also shows guilt for the way he treated him in the past.
*Kay is the main character of [[Phyllis Ann Karr]]'s 1982 novel ''[[The Idylls of the Queen]]''. Expanding on a scene from the classic tales in which a knight is poisoned at Guinevere's feast and the queen is accused of the crime, Karr turns her story into a [[murder mystery]] with Kay as the detective attempting to discover the truth.
*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s 1983 ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Kay (spelled Cai) is Arthur's foster-brother. After a near fatal accident as a small child, Arthur is sent to live with Cai and his father, Ectorius. Cai and Arthur love each other very much, and after Arthur is crowned, he tells Cai, "God strike me if I ever ask that you, brother, should call me [king]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Marion Zimmer|year=1982|title=The Mists of Avalon|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|place=New York|page=11|isbn=0-345-31452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cai is described as having a facial scar and a limp, two injuries that he received while protecting Arthur during a Saxon invasion. Cai is made Arthur's knight and chamberlain, and he keeps Arthur's castle for him.
*In [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger]]'s 1978 ''[[Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel]]'', Kay is a somewhat foppish, sharp-tongued [[gourmand]]. Relieved to be freed from his bucolic upbringing in Wales, he takes charge of the kitchens at [[Camelot]] and yearns to make it a more sophisticated court. Arthur good-naturedly complains that Sir Kay is always serving him rich foods, when the king would rather just have simple meals. Kay supplies occasional comic relief in the book, but ultimately fights and dies with honor in the last battle against [[Mordred]]'s host.
*In the 1970s HTV-series ''[[Arthur of the Britons]]'', Kay (spelled Kai) was played by [[Michael Gothard]]. In this version of the legend, Arthur is a Celtic chieftain and Kai is a Saxon orphan, raised together as brothers by an adoptive father, Llud, among the Celts. He is portrayed as somewhat hot-headed and sometimes distracted by female company, but a fiercely capable warrior (sometimes favouring an axe-weapon) and Arthur's most trusted and loyal friend.
*In [[Gillian Bradshaw]]'s ''Down the Long Wind'' series, Cei is Arthur's infantry commander. He is a large man with fiery hair and a temper to match, but with a strong sense of honor and loyalty to Arthur.
*In [[Stephen R. Lawhead|Stephen Lawhead]]'s ''[[The Pendragon Cycle|Pendragon Cycle]]'' Kay, spelled Cai, is Arthur's most loyal companion. As a child he had a crippled leg and Arthur was one of the few who defends him. This earns Arthur his complete and unquestioning loyalty. He dies in the battle against Mordred.
*In comedy TV series ''[[Kaamelott]]'', Kay is portrayed as a rogue [[centurion]] and rival of Arthur named Caius [[End of Roman rule in Britain|who refused to follow his troops back to Rome]] and therefore celticized his name and was given knighthood by Arthur to end their rivalry.
*In the 2011 [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] TV series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'', Kay is played by Canadian actor [[Peter Mooney]]. In this American-Irish-Canadian adaption of Arthurian Legend, Kay is portrayed as a loyal and protective older brother to Arthur. Although raised in a rural setting, he appears educated and somewhat idealistic, described by the actor who plays him as having "a world of book-smarts, but no practical experience [of how be a warrior]".&lt;ref&gt;Starz channel promotion "Camelot: Focus on Kay"&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sir Kay briefly appears in the [[Once Upon a Time (season 5)|season 5]] [[The Dark Swan|opener]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV Series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', where he betrays Arthur and attempts to pull Excalibur out of the stone to rule Camelot for himself. When he attempts to do so, he is proven unworthy, and the protection around the sword turns him to dust.
*He appears in [[Philip Reeve]]'s ''[[Here Lies Arthur]],'' as Cei, Arthur's loyal half-brother and friend to the bard [[Myrddin emrys|Myrddin]] (Merlin) at the beginning, before their friendship wanes over his stories designed to improve Arthur's reputation. He is later murdered in person by a character known as 'The Irishman', while riding to the Irishman's aid against raiders. The Irishman attacked their camp overnight, on the order of Myrddin, as many viewed him as a superior leader to Arthur. The other members of Arthur's army who were untrusted were also killed by the Irishman and his soldiers. The main character, Gwyn/Gwyna, and [[Percival|Peredur]] ([[Percival]]), were the only two to escape and survive the attack.

'''Zomahoun Idossou Rufin''' (born June 15, 1964), popularly known as '''Zomahon''' (ゾマホン), is a [[Benin]]ese foreign personality (''[[Tarento#Foreign tarento|gaijin tarento]]'' and [[diplomat]]) in Japan. He is currently the Ambassador of the Republic of [[Benin]] to [[Japan]] and the former Special Advisor of the [[List of heads of state of Benin#Republic of Benin|President of the Republic of Benin]] [[Thomas Boni Yayi]].

Zomahoun was born in [[Dassa-Zoumé]], [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]] (the old name of Benin until 1975). He attended [[National University of Benin]] and [[Beijing Language and Culture University]] in [[Beijing]], China. Until 2006, he was a student at [[Sophia University]] in [[Tokyo]], where his coursework completed without a degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[sociology]]. He can speak [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Fon language|Fon]], English, French, Mandarin and Japanese.

In 1998, Zomahoun was "discovered" by a [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] executive and became a cast member on the TV show ''[[Koko ga Hen da yo Nihonjin]]''. In a pool of 100 foreigners voicing their displeasure about certain aspects of Japanese society, he was usually picked due to his hyperactive Japanese speech, causing him to trip over his words and prompting the celebrity panel to yell at him to speak more slowly. He was one of the show's leading stars until its end in 2002. With the help of host [[Takeshi Kitano]], Zomahoun built four schools in Benin, two of which are named after Kitano (Takeshi Elementary School and Takeshi Japanese School). Additionally, he won a People's Honor Award in Benin in 2002.

In 2008, he participated in a few episodes (403-406) of [[Ainori]] [[reality show]], when the traveling group arrived in Benin.

In December 2011, the Cabinet of Benin accredited him as Ambassador to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20111217-OYT1T01011.htm ゾマホンさん、駐日ベナン大使に] YOMIURI ONLINE. Retrieved on 2011-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
