      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">An '''agent of record''' ('''AOR''') is an individual or a legal entity with a duly executed contractual agreement with an [[insurance policy]] owner, in line with the prevailing legal norms and regulations of the region in which the contract was entered. The agent of record has a legal right to receive commissions from the respective insurance policy.

The individual or [[Legal personality|legal entity]] is authorized to represent an insured party in purchasing, servicing, and maintaining insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose information or discuss an insured party's account with an agent other than the Agent of Record. An insured party wishing to change [[insurance agent]](s) must submit a revised agent of record letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluestarbenefits.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/agent-of-record-letter/ Agent of record letter]&lt;/ref&gt; to the respective insurer authorizing said insurer to release the insured party's information and to discuss the insured party's coverage with the newly appointed agent.

Relevant documents may be executed via hard copy documents or, alternatively, electronically in jurisdictions where electronic execution is legal. Applications may be made electronically, as well as in physical form.

An Agent of Record letter can, in some cases, be used as an insurance sales tool, though some question its legality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12937881.html/ Agent of Record letters can lock in business accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
In the advertising and marketing industry, AOR stands for "Agency of Record." In this context, an AOR is an agency that is authorized to purchase advertising time (for radio or television advertising) or space (for print or web advertising) on behalf of the company with which they have an agency contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-agency-of-record-4962111-1.html agency of record | Barrons Dictionary | AllBusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Āśraya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: आश्रय) variously means – base, source, assistance, shelter, protection, refuge, dependence, having recourse to or depending on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AF&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Hindu philosophy]], the living entity or ''[[Jiva]]'' is ''āśraya'', and [[Brahman]] or the Supreme Being, the Godhead, is ''[[Visayah|viśaya]]'', the supreme objective, the goal of life [[Bhagavata Purana]] (VII.x.6). But, this word - ''āśraya'' conveying the primary meaning – 'refuge', immediately relates with the deity which is worshipped rather than with the abstract Brahman, the substratum of all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ganesapurana|publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]]|page=65|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WcKf113gPwwC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I2AKVfnpDMyzuASv9ICwBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu view-point==

[[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]], which promotes qualified-monism, holds the belief that ''[[Jiva]]'' is ''anu'' or [[Arity|monadic]] in substance. ''Jiva'' though infinitesimal, is the individual ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' harboured by a body, which ''atman'' the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] tells us, to be known by the mind is capable of becoming infinite through its attributive knowledge. ''Jiva'' is ''kartā'' and ''bhoktā'', both; it is the ''āśraya'' for ''jñāna'', the substrate for ''krti'' or ''[[prayatna]]'' (effort) caused by the desire to act. Therefore, ''Jiva'' is the ''āśraya'' for the states of experience that invariably involve changes in mental disposition without affecting the ''Jiva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaisnavism: Its Philosophy..|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|pages=71–73|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=evmiLInyxBMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] does not consider ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidyā]]'' (ignorance) as something positively existent, he does not speak about its ''vikśepa-śakti'' (power of dispersion) or ''avarna-sakti'' (power of concealment); he does not raise ''avidyā'' to an eternal metaphysical entity. Shankara also does not subscribe to the view that the individual soul is the bearer of ''avidyā'' (āśraya) or to the contention that the [[Paramatman]] is the ''āśraya'' of ''avidyā'' as is held by [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Mandana]] and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vācaspati]]. He reiterates that for an awakened person there is no ''avidyā'' to delude and cause pain or pleasure. In the context of the origin of the world (the original state is called ''[[avyakta]]'') he terms Parameswara-Brahman as the āśraya of [[Namarupa|nāmarūpe]] (the physical presence which name manifests) and that Brahman is the āspada (locus) of the cosmic vyavahāra imagined by avidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philology and Confrontation|author=Paul Hacker|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|pages=65, 66, 77|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uP9-Qme_Bo0C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge implies the subject which knows and the object that is known. Suppression (''[[avarna]]'') precedes substitution (''[[viksepa]]''); ''avidyā'' makes one misapprehend and therefore it is described as positive (''bhāva-rūpa''), and does not contradict ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyā]]'' (knowledge). With regard to the transmigrating souls, Shankara does speak about the ''bhūta- āśraya'' or elementary substratum or material substratum of the soul, the subtle body, and about the ''karma- āśraya'' or moral substratum connected with ''vāsanās'' (impressions), ''karma'' (works ordained or forbidden) and ''pūrvaprajñā'' (previous experience) but he does not accept the existence of subtle persisting elements of works or preparatory elements of fruits called ''[[apurva]]'' because of their non-spiritual nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=43,300|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nzdbNqXIxQkC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NV8KVay6KIe4uATV5YHIAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bhagavata Purana (one of the 18 Mahapuranas or 18 Major Puranas) the personal aspect of God is the Āśraya of the ātmā.

==Jaina viewpoint==

Condition of existence (''gati''), according to [[Jain philosophy]], is the state of a soul shaped by ''gati-nama-karma'' (body-condition-making) or is the cause of the soul passing through any one of the four conditions of existence – hellish, sub-human, human and celestial. They subscribe to the view that in a thing which is permanent the existence of ''sāmānaya'' and ''samavāya'' is complete, that means that common properties cannot exist without individuals possessing them; the individuals are the ''āśraya''; ''sāmānaya'' and ''samavāya'' is complete in one substance will not exist without ''āśraya'' (substratum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Apta-mimamsa of Acharya Samantabhadra|publisher=Bharatiya Jnanapith|pages=30|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KBbt-zzaKKEC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view-point==

[[Vasubandhu]] explains that the ''āśraya'' (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates ''ātmabhāva'' (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; ''āśraya'' refers to obscured ''tathagatagarbha'' (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (''tataparāvrtti'') which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one ''āśraya'' with another by freeing the ''[[ayatana]]s'' (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental impregnations of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates the''ayatanas'' associated with awareness (''vidyā'') that purify all impregnations of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to ''śuddhāśrayabhūmi'', the level of pure superior intention, never to return to the lower realms or suffer rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining for Wisdom within Delusion|author=Karl Brunnholzl|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/booksid=W1JbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tathatā'' is the basis of transcendental wisdom, and ''Bhūtatathatā'' is the genuine 'Suchness', the essential nature of phenomenal existence, the self-identical universality, the grounding (''āśraya'') truth of finite particularity. The [[Buddhists]] believe that the ''skandhas'', the ''ayatanas'' and the ''[[Skandha#Eighteen Dh.C4.81tus|dhātu]]s'' are the ''dharmas'' that constitute the phenomenal world and are the forms (and the conditioning factors) in which consciousness appears to itself. ''Bhūtatathatā'' is the ''āśraya'' i.e. the basis which is to be transformed (''āśraya-paravritti''), and also the ''āśraya'' which is the result of the transformation. Therefore, it is the ''āśraya'' of delusion and awakening. The ''Mahāyāna-samparigrahaśāshtra'' tells us that the mind of Reality is ever obstructed by ''āveṇkī avidyā'' which is ''manas'', the seventh consciousness and the  ''āśraya'' of ''mano-vijñāna'' and the five sensorial consciousnesses evolved from self-patterning of the Absolute; the attachment of ''manas'' to ''ātmagrāha'' (egohood) and ''dharmagrāha'' (thinghood) makes the perception of the multiplicity of forms possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddha Nature|author=Brian Edward Brown|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=196, 217|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NV8KVay6KIe4uATV5YHIAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāyāna-abhidharmasutra'' tells us that the beginningless ''dhātu'' (locus) is the equal support (''āśraya'') of all phenomena (''dharma'') and rests in the body as seeds. According to the [[Yogacara]]s, ''ātmabhāva'' and ''āśraya'' basically mean – "body", and who also tell us that ''āśraya-paravritti'' can be of the mind or path or errant tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pruning of the Bodhi Tree|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|pages=171, 196|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AjlCz4xm1gIC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fmEKVcCyE9GWuASIiYDIBA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Hindu astrology]]==

''Āśarya yoga'', a special kind of planetary placement with most planets resting in moveable or fixed or common signs (''rāsis''), is one of the thirty-two varieties of ''Nabhasa yogas'' in which regard [[Varahamihira]] tells us –

:  अनुष्टुभ्-आश्रयोक्तास्तु विफला भवन्त्यन्यैर्विमिश्रताः |
:  मिश्रा येस्ते फलं दद्युरमिश्राः स्वफलप्रदाः ||

: " The Āśarya yogas become ineffective, when they look like other yogas, and those other yogas become operative and bear results. When the Āśarya yogasdo not bear any resemblance with other yogas, it is then that the Āśarya yogas produce results. " – [[Brihat Jataka]] (XII.12)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brihajjatakam of Varahamihira|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=213|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KeS5VkbutFEC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I2AKVfnpDMyzuASv9ICwBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In some schools of [[Buddhism]],  '''''bardo''''' ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] བར་དོ་ Wylie: ''bar do'') or '''''antarabhāva''''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is an intermediate, transitional, or liminal state between death and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. It is a concept which arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], ''bardo'' is the central theme of the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' (literally ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State''), the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead''.

Used loosely, "bardo" is the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth. According to [[Tibet]]an tradition, after death and before one's next birth, when one's consciousness is not connected with a physical body, one experiences a variety of phenomena. These usually follow a particular sequence of degeneration from, just after death, the clearest experiences of reality of which one is [[spirit]]ually capable, and then proceeding to terrifying hallucinations that arise from the impulses of one's previous unskillful actions. For the prepared and appropriately trained individuals, the bardo offers a state of great opportunity for liberation, since transcendental insight may arise with the direct experience of reality; for others, it can become a place of danger as the [[karma|karmically]] created hallucinations can impel one into a less than desirable [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Metaphorically, ''bardo'' can describe times when our usual way of life becomes suspended, as, for example, during a period of illness or during a meditation [[Retreat (religious/spiritual)|retreat]]. Such times can prove fruitful for spiritual progress because external constraints diminish. However, they can also present challenges because our less skillful impulses may come to the foreground, just as in the [[Bardo Thodol|''sidpa bardo'']].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The concept of ''antarabhāva'', an intervening state between death and rebirth, was brought into Buddhism from the Vedic-Upanishadic philosophical tradition which later developed into Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', ''s.v.'' [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800947.001.0001/acref-9780192800947-e-524]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Jaré Cuevas, "Predecessors and Prototypes: Towards a Conceptual History of the Buddhist Antarābhava", ''Numen'' '''43''':3:263-302 (September 1996) {{jstor|3270367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermediate state in Indian Buddhism==

From the records of early Buddhist schools, it appears that at least six different groups accepted the notion of an intermediate existence (antarabhāva), namely, the [[Sarvāstivāda]], [[Darṣṭāntika]], [[Vātsīputrīyas]], [[Saṃmitīya]], [[Pūrvaśaila]] and late [[Mahīśāsaka]].  The first four of these are closely related schools.  Opposing them were the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], early [[Mahīśāsaka]], [[Theravāda]], [[Vibhajyavāda]] and the [[Śāriputra Abhidharma]] (possibly [[Dharmagupta]]) (Bareau 1955: 291).

Some of the earliest references we have to the “intermediate existence” are to be found in the Sarvāstivādin text the [[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣa]] (阿毘達磨大毘婆沙論).  For instance, the Mahāvibhāṣa indicates a “basic existence” (本有), an “intermediate existence” (中有), a “birth existence” (生有) and “death existence” (死有) (CBETA, T27, no. 1545, p.&amp;nbsp;959, etc.).   Bareau (1955: 143) provides the arguments of the Sarvāstivāda as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intermediate being who makes the passage in this way from one existence to the next is formed, like every living being, of the five aggregates (skandha). His existence is demonstrated by the fact that it cannot have any discontinuity in time and space between the place and moment of death and those of rebirth, and therefore it must be that the two existences belonging to the same series are linked in time and space by an intermediate stage. The intermediate being is the [[Gandharva]], the presence of which is as necessary at conception as the fecundity and union of the parents. Furthermore, the Antarāparinirvāyin is an Anāgamin who obtains parinirvāṇa during the intermediary existence. As for the heinous criminal guilty of one of the five crimes without interval (ānantarya), he passes in quite the same way by an intermediate existence at the end of which he is reborn necessarily in hell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deriving from a later period of the same school, though with some differences, [[Vasubandhu]]’s [[Abhidharmakośa]] explains (English trs. p.&amp;nbsp;383ff):

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is an intermediate being, and an intermediate existence? Intermediate existence, which inserts itself between existence at death and existence at birth, not having arrived at the location where it should go, cannot be said to be born.  Between death—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of death—and arising—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of rebirth—there is found an existence—a "body" of five skandhas—that goes to the place of rebirth. This existence between two realms of rebirth (gatī) is called intermediate existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He cites a number of texts and examples to defend the notion against other schools which reject it and claim that death in one life is immediately followed by rebirth in the next, without any intermediate state in between the two.  Both the Mahāvibhāṣa and the Abhidharmakośa have the notion of the intermediate state lasting "seven times seven days" (i.e. 49 days) at most.  This is one view, though, and there were also others.

Similar arguments were also used in [[Harivarman]]’s *Satyasiddhi Śāstra, a quasi-[[Mahāyāna]] text, and the Upadeśa commentary on the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, both of which have strong influence from the Sarvāstivāda school.  Both of these texts had powerful influence in Chinese Buddhism, which also accepts this idea as a rule.

The Saddharma-smṛty-upasthāna Sūtra (正法念處經) classifies 17 intermediate states with different experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070106145557/http://www.lianhua33.com/sys6.htm 《生与死——佛教轮回说》]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six bardos in Tibetan Buddhism==
Fremantle (2001) states that there are six traditional bardo states known as the Six Bardos:  the Bardo of This Life (p.&amp;nbsp;55); the Bardo of Meditation (p.&amp;nbsp;58); the Bardo of Dream (p.&amp;nbsp;62); the Bardo of Dying (p.&amp;nbsp;64); the Bardo of Dharmata (p.&amp;nbsp;65); and the Bardo of Existence (p.&amp;nbsp;66).

Shugchang, ''et al.'' (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;5) discuss the [[Zhitro]] (Tibetan: Zhi-khro) teachings which subsume the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' and mention [[Karma Lingpa]], [[Terma (religion)|terma]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and list the Six Bardo:  "The first bardo begins when we take birth and endures as long as we live. The second is the bardo of dreams. The third is the bardo of concentration or meditation. The fourth occurs at the moment of death. The fifth is known as the bardo of the luminosity of the true nature. The sixth is called the bardo of transmigration or karmic becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Shugchang, Padma (editor); Sherab, Khenchen Palden &amp; Dongyal, Khenpo Tse Wang (2000). ''A Modern Commentary on Karma Lingpa's Zhi-Khro: teachings on the peaceful and wrathful deities''. Padma Gochen Ling. Source: [http://www.turtlehill.org/khen/zhikhro.pdf] (accessed: December 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Kyenay bardo''' (''skye gnas bar do''): is the first bardo of birth and life. This bardo commences from conception until the last breath, when the [[mindstream]] withdraws from the body.
# '''Milam bardo''' (''rmi lam bar do''): is the second bardo of the dream state. The Milam Bardo is a subset of the first Bardo.  [[Dream Yoga]] develops practices to integrate the dream state into Buddhist [[sadhana]].
# '''Samten bardo''' (''bsam gtan bar do'') is the third bardo of [[meditation]]. This bardo is generally only experienced by meditators, though individuals may have spontaneous experience of it. Samten Bardo is a subset of the Shinay Bardo.
# '''Chikhai bardo''' ('''chi kha'i bar do''): is the fourth bardo of the moment of death. According to tradition, this bardo is held to commence when the outer and inner signs presage that the onset of death is nigh, and continues through the dissolution or transmutation of the [[Mahabhuta]] until the external and internal breath has completed.
# '''Chönyi bardo''' (''chos nyid bar do''): is the fifth bardo of the luminosity of the true nature which commences after the final 'inner breath' (Sanskrit: ''[[prana]]'', [[vayu]]; Tibetan: ''[[rlung]]''). It is within this Bardo that visions and auditory phenomena occur. In the Dzogchen teachings, these are known as the spontaneously manifesting [[Thödgal]] (Tibetan: ''thod-rgyal'') visions. Concomitant to these visions, there is a welling of profound peace and pristine awareness. Sentient beings who have not practiced during their lived experience and/or who do not recognize the clear light (Tibetan: ''[[Ösel (yoga)|od gsal]]'') at the moment of death are usually deluded throughout the fifth bardo of luminosity.
# '''Sidpa bardo''' (''srid pa bar do''): is the sixth bardo of becoming or transmigration.  This bardo endures until the inner-breath commences in the new transmigrating form determined by the "karmic seeds" within the [[storehouse consciousness]].

==Exegesis==
Fremantle (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;53–54) charts the development of the bardo concept through the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Originally bardo referred only to the period between one life and the next, and this is still its normal meaning when it is mentioned without any qualification.  There was considerable dispute over this theory during the early centuries of Buddhism, with one side arguing that rebirth (or conception) follows immediately after death, and the other saying that there must be an interval between the two. With the rise of mahayana, belief in a transitional period prevailed.  Later Buddhism expanded the whole concept to distinguish six or more similar states, covering the whole cycle of life, death, and rebirth.  But it can also be interpreted as any transitional experience, any state that lies between two other states.  Its original meaning, the experience of being between death and rebirth, is the prototype of the bardo experience, while the six traditional bardos show how the essential qualities of that experience are also present in other transitional periods.  By refining even further the understanding of the essence of bardo, it can then be applied to every moment of existence.  The present moment, the now, is a continual bardo, always suspended between the past and the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as shown above, Fremantle's idea that it was originally only "between one life and next" was not how it was understood by the Sarvāstivāda school at the outset.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Also, the idea that the ascendancy of this idea was due to the Mahāyāna is unfounded, and it is much more likely that it was due to the Sarvāstivāda influence, several centuries before the Mahāyāna had any real influence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A '''burn down chart''' is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a [[run chart]] of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.  It is often used in [[agile software development]] methodologies such as [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]].  However, burn down charts can be applied to any project containing measurable progress over time.

Outstanding work can be represented in terms of either time or story points.&lt;ref name="Dinwiddie 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idiacomputing.com/pub/BetterSoftware-BurnCharts.pdf|title=Feel The Burn, Getting the Most out of Burn Charts - Better Software, Volume 11, Issue 5, pp. 26-31|date=July–August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reading burn down charts ==

[[File:Burn down chart.png|frame|none|A project burn down chart]]

A burn down chart for a completed iteration is shown above and can be read by knowing the following:&lt;ref name="Wenzel 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joel.inpointform.net/software-development/burn-down-charts-tutorial-simple-agile-project-tracking/|title=Burn Down Chart Tutorial: Simple Agile Project Tracking|last=Wenzel|first=Joel|date=December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707200105/http://joel.inpointform.net/software-development/burn-down-charts-tutorial-simple-agile-project-tracking/#|archive-date=2013-07-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=2011-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|style="min-width: 10em" | X-Axis
| The project/iteration timeline
|-
| Y-Axis
| The work that needs to be completed for the project.  The time or story point estimates for the work remaining will be represented by this axis.
|-
| Project Start Point
| This is the farthest point to the left of the chart and occurs at day 0 of the project/iteration.
|-
| Project End Point
| This is the point that is farthest to the right of the chart and occurs on the predicted last day of the project/iteration
|-
| Number of Workers and Efficiency Factor
| In the above example, there are an estimated 28 days of work to be done, and there are two developers working on the project, who work at an efficiency of 70%. Therefore, the work should be completed in {{math|(28 ÷ 2) ÷ 0.7 {{=}} 20}} days.
|-
| Ideal Work Remaining Line
| This is a straight line that connects the start point to the end point.  At the start point, the ideal line shows the sum of the estimates for all the tasks (work) that needs to be completed.  At the end point, the ideal line intercepts the x-axis showing that there is no work left to be completed. Some people take issue with calling this an "ideal" line, as it's not generally true that the goal is to follow this line. This line is a mathematical calculation based on estimates, and the estimates are more likely to be in error than the work. The goal of a burn down chart is to display the progress toward completion and give an estimate on the likelihood of timely completion.
|-
| Actual Work Remaining Line
| This shows the actual work remaining.  At the start point, the actual work remaining is the same as the ideal work remaining but as time progresses, the actual work line fluctuates above and below the ideal line depending on this disparity between estimates and how effective the team is. In general, a new point is added to this line each day of the project.  Each day, the sum of the time or story point estimates for work that was recently completed is subtracted from the last point in the line to determine the next point.

|}

== Measuring performance ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Actual Work Line is above the Ideal Work Line
| If the actual work line is above the ideal work line, it means that there is more work left than originally predicted and the project is behind schedule.
|-
| Actual Work Line is below the Ideal Work Line
| If the actual work line is below the ideal work line, it means that there is less work left than originally predicted and the project is ahead of schedule.
|}

The above table is only one way of interpreting the shape of the burn down chart. There are others.&lt;ref name="Dinwiddie 2009" /&gt;

== Removing variability in time estimates ==
One issue that may be noticed in burn down charts is that whether or not the Actual Work line is above or below the Ideal Work line depends on how accurate the original time estimates are. This means that if a team constantly overestimates time requirements, the progress will always appear ahead of schedule. If they constantly underestimate time requirements, they will always appear behind schedule. This issue is corrected by incorporating an efficiency factor into the burn down chart. After the first iteration of a project, the efficiency factor can be recalculated to allow for more accurate estimates during the next iteration. Some templates automatically calculate the efficiency as a project progresses. This can be used to identify areas/phases where inaccurate estimates consistently occur.&lt;ref name="Wenzel 2010" /&gt;

'''Cab Gallery''' was an art project from 1999 to 2001 [[curator|curated]] by London art dealer Paul Stolper of [[Paul Stolper Gallery]] and art collector and London taxi driver Jason Brown. The concept was for art to be exhibited on the outside and inside of a working [[London Taxi|London taxi]] rather than a traditional [[art gallery|gallery]] space. As stated by Brown, "It was important to me that when working, the artwork was incidental to the journey of the passenger. I hoped they would notice but it was part of their environment and unexpected. It was also interesting to me to learn which artworks they reacted to. But it had to be a natural discovery."

Artists were provided the views and dimensions of the available spaces such as the bottom of [[Folding seat|fold-up seats]] (or "tip-up seats"), the exterior of the cab, and limited inside options for free-standing work. Because the cab was also a working London taxi, after each artwork was selected by the curators, approval from the Cab Advertising Committee of the [[Public Carriage Office]] was also required. Artwork placed on the exterior of the cab was printed in vinyl the same as per usual advertising procedures. Special receipts were designed, listing participating artists and contact details. In addition to serving as gallery space during working cab hours, Cab Gallery would park outside galleries on their opening nights enabling the artists to exhibit more ambitious and experimental installation and sound pieces.

Throughout the project Brown honored his commitment to the project's concept of never bringing attention to the art while operating as a working cab but rather allowing the passengers to discover it for themselves. When the cab was serving as a stationary exhibition space at art galleries and events, however, Brown would often act as de facto [[museum docent|docent]] for the collection.

==History==
In 1999, Brown approached Stolper with the idea of exhibiting art in the spaces reserved for advertising in his traditional London Black Taxi, and Cab Gallery was launched in [[Hoxton Square]] on 24 September 1999.

The first exterior was a text piece by [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], ''Taxy'' in red and yellow vinyl. On the fold-up seats were two text pieces by [[Peter Liversidge]], who became a regular contributor to the project and whose collected proposals were later published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN= 978-1870540322|last1 = Liversidge|first1 = Peter|title = Proposals for Paul E. Stolper and Jason Brown: For: Cab Gallery, Reg: S310 DGJ, Model: Tx : 1|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on display at the launch were ''All the animals'', an embroidered cushion by [[Abigail Cohen]], ''from Swiss Cottage to Soho and back,'' a book of drawings by [[Susie Hamilton]], and ''Cab Gallery Greeting'', a sound piece by [[Jessica Voorsanger]]. Absinthe was served out of the rear boot of the taxi.

The success of the launch led to other artists becoming involved and invitations by galleries and art event organizers to participate in their openings. On these occasions, the Cab was parked outside the entrance and artists had the opportunity to create more ambitious artworks as installations and sound pieces.

In mid-2000, the Bob and Roberta Smith exterior artwork was replaced with ''Sunny'' by [[Alex Katz]], the American figurative painter.
The popularity of the project spread through wide media coverage and Cab Gallery participated in its first show outside London at the [[Ikon Gallery]] in Birmingham. This was soon followed by [[From Space Gallery]] in Manchester and in 2001 the [[Aspex Gallery]] in Portsmouth.
In 2001 the final exterior of the cab became ''Out from Under'' by important American [[conceptual art]]ist [[Lawrence Weiner]].
The project expanded to include a website featuring a project by [[Layla Curtis]] which traced the routes made by Brown in his cab over a specific week.

The project came to feature regular new pieces by Peter Liversidge, the "house artist," as well as new artists and artwork to keep the project fresh.
By the end of 2001 after media coverage as wide ranging as the magazines Top Gear, The Art News and Art in America and daily papers from Finland to Australia it was felt that the project should end at its height.

==Retrospective==
[[File:Retrospective with Lawrence Weiner Cab Exterior.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Retrospective with cab exterior ''Out from Under'' by Lawrence Weiner]]
The curators arranged for a retrospective exhibition immediately upon discontinuing the project, held as part of the opening of the [[Essor Gallery]], which occupied the main gallery as well as a project space nearby. The Cab Gallery Retrospective ran from 15–22 January 2002 and included the "Cab Gallery" itself, which was parked up inside. All previous artworks were on show along with films and sound pieces.

Paul Stolper continues as a leading London gallery owner and publisher.

Jason Brown collaborated with Chelsea space at [[Chelsea College of Art &amp; Design]] to use the same taxi, renamed the Chelsea Cab, to exhibit new exterior artwork on the cab by [[Bruce McLean]], [[Stephen Farthing|Stephen Farthing RA]] and [[David Shrigley]]. In 2012 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and continues to curate art shows including exchanges between London and Nashville. In 2012 Brown donated the entire Cab Gallery archive including artwork, correspondence and ephemera to the Special Collections at the Library at the Chelsea College of Art &amp; Design.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the materials available, see http://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/library-services/collections-and-archives/chelsea/#CAB_Gallery_Archive.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Chinese spiritual world concepts''' are cultural practices or methods found in [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]].  Some fit in the realms of a particular religion, others do not.  In general these concepts were uniquely evolved from the Chinese values of filial piety, tacit acknowledgment of the co-existence of the living and the deceased, and the belief in causality and reincarnation, with or without religious overtones.

== Practices and beliefs ==

* '''[[Ancestral worship]]''' (拜祖) – A practice to honor the deeds and memories of the deceased.  This is an extension to the [[filial piety]] from the teachings of [[Confucius]] and [[Laozi]]. Elders, seniors, extended families and particularly parents are to be respected, heeded and looked after. Respects continue after their deaths.  In addition to the [[Qingming]] and [[Chongyang Festival|Chongyang]] festivals, descendants should pay tribute to ancestors during the ''Zhongyuanjie'', more commonly known as the [[Ghost Festival]] ( but ghost festival is on Dongzhi "冬至”） In addition to providing a tombstone or urn cover, descendants are traditionally expected to install an altar (神台) in their home to pay homage regularly each day with [[joss sticks]] and tea. The ancestors, including parents and grandparents, are worshipped or venerated as if they are still living.
* '''Three [[Realms]]''' (三曹) – the belief that Heaven, the living and the deceased exist side by side; [[heaven]] a place for [[saint]]s or rested [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, [[diyu|hell]] for the criminous deceased. '''[[Hun and po|Three wun seven pak]]''' (三魂七魄) explains a person's existence.  The three realms is where a person exists, and the seven states are what makes a person exist.  The [[Pumi people]], for example, are a supporter of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;China.com.cn. "[http://www.china.com.cn/culture/aboutchina/pmz/2009-08/04/content_18264553.htm China.com.cn]." ''三魂七魄 普米族喊魂的习俗.'' Retrieved on 2010-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jian''' (間) – The living world where people exist in reality is referred to as Yang Jian (陽間). The [[underworld]] where spirits exist after death is regarded as Yin Jian (陰間), though this is not necessarily a negative place such as [[diyu|hell]].
* '''[[Tai Sui|Fan Tai Sui]]''' (犯太歲) – is when an individual faces major obstacles in health, job and studies.&lt;ref name="hkstan1"&gt;HKstandard. "[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&amp;art_id=65923&amp;sid=18957281&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080516&amp;sear_year=2008 HKstandard]." ''Rats to lucky number eight.'' Retrieved on 2008-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The obstacles last for a single [[Chinese calendar]] year. An example is when Hong Kong [[Feng shui]] master Raymond Lo tried to explain the occurrences in 2008 in relation to [[People's Republic of China]] leaders [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]]. Within the animal astrology the [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]] clashes with the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], causing a turbulent year.&lt;ref name="ihthorse"&gt;IHT. "[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/15/asia/AS-GEN-OLY-China-Feng-Shui.php International Herald Tribune]." ''Feng Shui master explains bad to start to 2008 Olympic year.'' Retrieved on 2008-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Hu and Wen are born in 1942, the [[Horse (zodiac)|year of the Horse]], which clashes with 2008 the [[Rat (zodiac)|year of the Rat]]. Hence [[2008 in the People's Republic of China|2008 in China]] was one of the most turbulent year with [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan unrest]], [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] and many more events.&lt;ref name="hkstan1" /&gt;  Another example is [[Henry Tang]] suffering from Fan Tai shui in 2012 where he experienced the [[Henry Tang illegal basement controversy|illegal basement controversy]] as well as many other events during the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2012|2012 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20120216/00174_001.html |script-title=zh:唐宮曝光 英名掃地 年犯太歲 議員：退選吧﹗ – 東方日報 |language=zh |publisher=Orientaldaily.on.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tang would end up losing the election.
* '''Zung saang gei''' (種生基) – is when a piece of hair is placed in a particular [[fung shui]] location in an attempt to extend a person's life.  A publicised example is Hong Kong actress [[Tina Leung]] who performed this practice in 1998 at a place near the Xingdao Lake (星島湖) in [[Beihai]], [[Guangxi]], China.  The maximum that she could extend was 12 years. She died exactly 12 years later in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Eastweek. 2010 April 11 volume 326. pg 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sina.com.

==Modes of communication==
*'''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|Fuji]]''' (乩文) – planchette writing is practiced using either a rattan sieve (see [[coscinomancy]]) or a wooden stylus to write [[Chinese characters]] in sand or incense ashes. This Chinese tradition of [[automatic writing]] continues to be practiced in [[Taoist]] temples in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China.
* '''Mun mai''' ([[:zh:問覡|問米]]) – is communication directly with [[spirit]]s who have died.  The most common usage is for finding and contacting deceased relatives or loved ones. The general cultural term is that people are raised from the underground or down from heaven to communicate. A western comparison is likely [[seance]] or [[necromancy]].
* '''Yum si lou''' (陰司路) – is the idea of flooding the spiritual road with [[Hell bank note|spiritual money]] to ensure the person who died will reach their destination safely.  In Chinese culture, the road to [[heaven]], [[diyu]] or [[reincarnation]] may not be clear.  By overloading the path with spiritual money, hopefully all troubled souls on the way will be too occupied with the money and leave the traveling-soul alone.  This is an assurance for the living.
* '''[[Villain hitting]]''' (打小人) – is a folk [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] popular in the [[Guangdong]] area of [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] used for exorcising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myheartmyhome.hk/eng/sight_02.php?id=2&amp;locationid=1 "Demon-exorcising Service at 'Goose-neck Bridge' "]. My Heart, My Home – 18 Districts Reach Out Together for Lovable Sights in Hong Kong. Retrieved 11 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tong ling''' (通靈) – is to tunnel and channel through to communicate with spirits.

==Figures==
* '''Gui ren''' (貴人) – Someone who can help you.  Or is destined to help you.
* '''Xiao ren''' (小人) ("Siu yen" in Cantonese) – Someone who can hurt you.  Or is destined to hurt you.  Simple methods such as [[kau cim]] can usually inform you whether a guiren or xiaoren is visible in your near future.

==Objects==
* '''Peach wood sword''' (桃木劍) – the definitive weapon used for demon exorcism during [[Taoist]] exorcism.&lt;ref name="JLAS"&gt;Lee, James. [2006] (2006).

* '''[[Shigandang|Stone tablets]]''' (石敢當) – the tablets are placed at main doors, junctions of small avenues, three-way junctions, river banks or ponds to gather positive energy and ward off evil spirit.  Sometimes it is used to block natural mishaps such as [[natural disasters]].&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;
* '''Tai mountain stone tablets''' (泰山石敢當) – the most powerful of the stone tablets are made from stones coming from [[Mount Tai]].  These stone tablets are shaped like the mountain forming the 5 fingers shape.&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;  The ones inscribed with (泰山石敢當) go with along with [[Battle of Zhuolu|the legend of the fight]] between war deity [[Chi You]] and the [[Yellow Emperor]].&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;石敢當.

[[Image:UML diagram of composition over inheritance.svg|thumb|right|444px|This diagram shows how the fly and sound behavior of an animal can be designed in a flexible way by using the composition over inheritance design principle.&lt;ref name=FHDPs /&gt;]]
'''Composition over inheritance''' (or '''composite reuse principle''') in [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) is the principle that classes should achieve [[Polymorphism_(computer_science)|polymorphic]] behavior and [[code reuse]] by their [[object composition|composition]] (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] from a base or parent class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an often-stated principle of OOP, such as in the influential book ''[[Design Patterns]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-63361-2 | title = [[Design Patterns|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]] | last1 = Gamma | first1 = Erich | authorlink1 = Erich Gamma | last2 = Helm | first2 = Richard | last3 = Johnson | first3 = Ralph | authorlink3 = Ralph Johnson (computer scientist) | last4 = Vlissides | first4 = John | authorlink4 = John Vlissides | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]  | page = 20  | oclc = 31171684 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==
An implementation of composition over inheritance typically begins with the creation of various [[Interface (computing)#Software interfaces in object-oriented languages|interfaces]] representing the behaviors that the system must exhibit. The use of interfaces allows this technique to support the [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] behavior that is so valuable in object-oriented programming. Classes implementing the identified interfaces are built and added to [[business domain]] classes as needed. Thus, system behaviors are realized without inheritance. 

In fact, business domain classes may all be base classes without any inheritance at all. Alternative implementation of system behaviors is accomplished by providing another class that implements the desired behavior interface. Any business domain class that contains a reference to the interface can easily support any implementation of that interface and the choice can even be delayed until run time.

==Example==

===Inheritance===
An example in [[C++11]] follows:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class GameObject {
    public:
        virtual ~GameObject() {}
        virtual void update() {}
        virtual void draw() {}
        virtual void collide(GameObject objects[]) {}
};

class Visible : public GameObject {
    public:
        void draw() override { /* draw model at position of this object */ };
    private:
        Model* model;
};

class Solid : public GameObject {
    public:
        void collide(GameObject objects[]) override { /* check and react to collisions with objects */ };
};

class Movable : public GameObject {
    public:
        void update() override { /* update position */ };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, we have concrete classes:

* class &lt;code&gt;Player&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Cloud&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Building&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt;
* class &lt;code&gt;Trap&lt;/code&gt; - which is &lt;code&gt;Solid&lt;/code&gt;, but neither &lt;code&gt;Visible&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt;

Note that multiple inheritance is dangerous if not implemented carefully, as it can lead to the [[diamond problem]]. One solution to avoid this is to create classes such as &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndSolid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndMovable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VisibleAndSolidAndMovable&lt;/code&gt;, etc. for every needed combination, though this leads to a large amount of repetitive code. Keep in mind that C++ solves the diamond problem of multiple inheritance by allowing [[virtual inheritance]].

=== Composition and interfaces ===
The following C# example demonstrates the principle of using composition and interfaces to achieve code reuse and polymorphism.

&lt;source lang="CSharp"&gt;
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var player = new Player();
        player.Update();
        player.Collide();
        player.Draw();
    }
}

interface IVisible {
    void Draw();
}

class Invisible : IVisible {
    public void Draw() {
        Console.Write("I won't appear.");
    }
}

class Visible : IVisible {
    public void Draw() {
        Console.Write("I'm showing myself.");
    }
}

interface ICollidable {
    void Collide();
}

class Solid : ICollidable {
    public void Collide() {
        Console.Write("Bang!");
    }
}

class NotSolid : ICollidable {
    public void Collide() {
        Console.Write("Splash!");
    }
}

interface IUpdatable {
    void Update();
}

class Movable : IUpdatable {
    public void Update() {
        Console.Write("Moving forward.");
    }
}

class NotMovable : IUpdatable {
    public void Update() {
        Console.Write("I'm staying put.");
    }
}

abstract class GameObject : IVisible, IUpdatable, ICollidable {
    private readonly IVisible _v;
    private readonly IUpdatable _u;
    private readonly ICollidable _c;

    public GameObject(IVisible visible, IUpdatable updatable, ICollidable collidable) {
        _v = visible;
        _u = updatable;
        _c = collidable;
    }

    public void Update() {
        _u.Update();
    }

    public void Draw() {
        _v.Draw();
    }

    public void Collide() {
        _c.Collide();
    }
}

class Player : GameObject {
    public Player() : base(new Visible(), new Movable(), new Solid()) { }
}

class Cloud : GameObject {
    public Cloud() : base(new Visible(), new Movable(), new NotSolid()) { }
}

class Building : GameObject {
    public Building() : base(new Visible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid()) { }
}

class Trap : GameObject {
    public Trap() : base(new Invisible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid()) { }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Benefits==
To favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the design higher flexibility. It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree. For example, a gas pedal and a wheel share very few common traits, yet are both vital components in a car. What they can do and how they can be used to benefit the car is easily defined. Composition also provides a more stable business domain in the long term as it is less prone to the quirks of the family members. In other words, it is better to compose what an object can do (''[[HAS-A]]'') than extend what it is (''[[IS-A]]'').&lt;ref name=FHDPs&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial design is simplified by identifying system object behaviors in separate interfaces instead of creating a hierarchical relationship to distribute behaviors among business-domain classes via inheritance. This approach more easily accommodates future requirements changes that would otherwise require a complete restructuring of business-domain classes in the inheritance model. Additionally, it avoids problems often associated with relatively minor changes to an inheritance-based model that includes several generations of classes.

Some languages, notably [[Go (programming language)|Go]], use type composition exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |last1=Pike |first1=Rob |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
One common drawback of using composition instead of inheritance is that methods being provided by individual components may have to be implemented in the derived type, even if they are only [[Forwarding (object-oriented programming)|forwarding methods]]. In contrast, inheritance does not require all of the base class's methods to be re-implemented within the derived class. Rather, the derived class only needs to implement (override) the methods having different behavior than the base class methods. This can require significantly less programming effort if the base class contains many methods providing default behavior and only a few of them need to be overridden within the derived class.

For example, in the C# code below, the variables and methods of the {{code|Employee}} base class are inherited by the {{code|HourlyEmployee}} and {{code|SalariedEmployee}} derived subclasses. Only the {{code|Pay()}} method needs to be implemented (specialized) by each derived subclass. The other methods are implemented by the base class itself, and are shared by all of its derived subclasses; they do not need to be re-implemented (overridden) or even mentioned in the subclass definitions.

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
// Base class
public abstract class Employee
{
    // Properties
    protected string  Name        { get; set; }
    protected int     ID          { get; set; }
    protected decimal PayRate     { get; set; }
    protected int     HoursWorked { get; }

    // Get pay for the current pay period
    abstract public decimal Pay();
}

// Derived subclass
public class HourlyEmployee: Employee
{
    // Get pay for the current pay period
    override public decimal Pay()
    {
        // Time worked is in hours
        return HoursWorked * PayRate;

}

// Derived subclass
public class SalariedEmployee: Employee
{
    // Get pay for the current pay period
    override public decimal Pay()

        // Pay rate is annual salary instead of hourly rate
        return HoursWorked * PayRate/2087;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This drawback can be avoided by using [[Traits (computer science)|traits]], [[mixin]]s, or [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]] extensions. Some languages, such as [[Perl 6]], provide a &lt;code&gt;handles&lt;/code&gt; keyword to facilitate method forwarding. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [http://projectlombok.org/ Project Lombok] allows delegation to be implemented using a single @Delegate annotation on the field, instead of copying and maintaining the names and types of all the methods from the delegated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projectlombok.org/features/Delegate.html | title=@Delegate | website=Project Lombok | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], extensions can be used to define a default implementation of a protocol on the protocol itself, rather than within an individual type's implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html | title=Protocols | website=The Swift Programming Language | publisher=Apple Inc | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] the delegation pattern has been included into the language syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html | title=Delegated Properties | website=Kotlin Reference | publisher=JetBrains | access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical studies==
A 2013 study of 93 open source Java programs (of varying size) found that:

The '''Copenhagen–Tartu school of biosemiotics''' is a loose network of scholars working within the discipline of [[biosemiotics]] at the [[University of Tartu]] and the [[University of Copenhagen]]. 

==History==
The school has been instrumental in developing biosemiotics as a new perspective on the study of life, in the [[biology|biological]] and [[environmental science]]s. Notable [[semiotician]]s working in the Copenhagen–Tartu school are: [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Peeter Torop]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Timo Maran]], [[Mihhail Lotman]].&lt;ref&gt;The institution of semiotics in Estonia. 2011. ''Sign Systems Studies'' 39(2/4). Compiled by Kalevi Kull, Silvi Salupere,  Peeter Torop, Mihhail Lotman [http://www.ut.ee/SOSE/sss/pdf/Kull_Salupere_Torop_Lotman_392.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, Donald (ed.) 2010.

''Introduction to Biosemiotics: The New Biological Synthesis''. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally also the name 'Tartu–Bloomington–Copenhagen school' has been used,&lt;ref&gt;''International Handbook of Semiotics'', Springer, 2015, p. 98.

'''Digital fashion''' is the interplay between digital technology and couture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been deeply integrated both into the fashion industry as well as within the experience of clients and prospects. Such interplay has happened at three main levels.
# ICTs are used to design and produce fashion products, while also the industry organization leverages onto digital technologies
# ICTs impact marketing, distribution and sales
# ICTs are extensively used in communication activities with all relevant stakeholders, and contribute to co-create the fashion world

== Design, Production, and Organization ==
Among the many applications available to fashion designers to model the fusion of creativity with digital avenues, the Digital Textile Printing can be mentioned here.

===Digital Textile Printing===
Digital printing is a process in which prints are directly applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing textile waste. The main advantage of digital printing is the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion-marketer.com/2014/06/12/digital_printing/ Fashion Marketer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital Textile printing is “probably the greatest innovation of 21-st century fashion, “ Christina Binkley declared in the Wall Street Journal. The “vastly improved digital printing technologies allow designers to innovate while beefing up their brands“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/industry/b--digital-printing-and-fashion-23077.html/ Digital Printing and fashion ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand such as Prada, Pucci or Jil Sander are using this technology to invent their design ideas on fabric.

== Marketing, Distribution, and Sales ==
While all digital channels can be used in order to market and sell fashion completely online ([[eCommerce]]), they usually are implemented in connection with offline channels (so-called "omni-channel"). Here Virtual and Augmented reality is playing a crucial role.

=== Online services ===
Prospects and clients can use ICTs - own computers, tablets and smart phones - to skip fitting rooms and cosmetics counters, and instead virtually see how they look in specific outfits and makeup via in-store kiosks, mobile phones or tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/new-tech-lets-retailers-give-head-to-toe-virtual-makeovers/ Retail Customer Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; Modiface is a  web application that anyone can use to give them a virtual makeover. Customers can give any look and decide on what to suits and buy products.

[[Sephora]], the beauty specialty retailer, and ModiFace, an augmented reality virtual makeover technology provider, today announced the launch of a 3D Augmented Reality Mirror that can simulate cosmetics on a user's face in real-time and in 3D. The new patented technology, created by ModiFace, tracks the precise location of a user's facial features and applies eye shadow colors directly on the video feed from a camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modiface.com/news.php/ ModiFace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/101727503/ CNBC: “Sephora brings augmented reality to real-life shop”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes beauty retailers will feature virtual fitting rooms to allow users to experience the look of their product before committing to a purchase. Some examples are color contact retailers Freshlook, which allows users to simulate contact lens wear in their color contacts studio before purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshlookcontacts.com/color-studio/|title=Freshlook Color Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful Eyes also offers a virtual color contact lens try on room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorfuleyes.org/eye-color-changer|title=Eye Color Changer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Dressing Room===
A virtual dressing room&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/13/business/la-fi-virtual-dressing-room-20120714/ LA Times on virtual dressing room]&lt;/ref&gt; (also often referred to as virtual fitting room and virtual changing room although they do perform different functions) is the online equivalent of the near-ubiquitous in-store changing room – that is, it enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.

The multimedia communication company Eyemagnet developed the Virtual Dressing Room for the Hallensteins menswear chain. The changing room is transformed to a single panel which reflects the user. These users can then use simple arm and hand gestures to ‘try on’ any apparel in the store, take a photo of any selected outfit and have it sent to their mobile phone. Newer versions of the technology eliminate the arm-waving altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/virtual-dressing-rooms-eyemagnet/ Trendhunter - Virtual Dressing Room]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion retailer Topshop installed a Kinect-powered virtual fitting room at its Moscow store. Created by AR Door, the Augmented Fitting Room system overlays 3D augmented reality clothes on the customer. Simple gestures and on-screen buttons let users "try on" different outfits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/11/kinect-dressing-room_n_860740.html/ Huffingtonpost - Kinect Dressing room]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the high variability of virtual fit platforms to predict consumer clothes sizes called into question the accuracy of these systems in their current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit is not yet Fit for Purpose: An Analysis of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|journal=3DBODY.TECH 2017|pages=210-217|doi=10.15221/17.210|url=http://www.3dbody.tech/cap/abstracts/2017/17210januszkiewicz.html|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication and Experience Co-Creation ==
Fashion is also a matter of socially negotiating what is "in" or "out", fashionable or not. In other words, fashion items do not only play on the economic market of physical goods, but also - and sometimes even pore importantly - on the semiotic market of the production of social tastes and customs.

Thanks to social media, and to all services offered by the so-called web2.0, laypeople can contribute to co-create the fashion world, shaping tastes, customs, and fashion-related values.

== Digital Fashion Education and Research ==
Nowadays, the fashion industry needs experts in digital fashion, equipped with the above-sketched knowledge and competences. Several Bachelor and Master programs in Fashion have in recent years integrated Digital Fashion courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalfashion.ch/programmes/|title=Master Programmes  {{!}}  Digital Fashion Communication Research|last=|first=|date=|website=digitalfashion.ch|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are not (yet) dedicated scientific journals devoted to the topic, several research activities have been done in the field. Among them, a dedicated Conference has taken place in 2015 in Seoul, South Korea (see its Proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfashionsociety.org/DFC/|title=Digital Fashion Conference|website=www.digitalfashionsociety.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2017, SComS - Studies in Communication Sciences, a Swiss-based Communication Journal, has launched a call for papers in the field of Fashion Communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hope.uzh.ch/scoms/pages/view/cfp|title=Call for Papers|website=www.hope.uzh.ch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; stressing the role of Digital Fashion Communication.

Fashion is closely related with Art and Heritage: among the most important initiatives to digitize fashion history, thus making such heritage available to researchers, practitioners and all interested people, two projects can be mentioned: Europeana Fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion|title=Europeana Fashion|website=www.europeana.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and We Wear Culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/project/fashion|title=We Wear Culture - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Google Arts and Culture.

{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[jurisprudence]], '''duress''' or '''coercion''' refers to a situation whereby a person performs an act as a result of violence, threat, or other pressure against the person. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (6th ed.) defines duress as "any unlawful [[intimidation|threat]] or [[coercion]] used... to induce another to act [or not act] in a manner [they] otherwise would not [or would]". Duress is pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act they ordinarily would not perform. The notion of duress must be distinguished both from [[undue influence]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]. In [[criminal law]], [[duress and necessity]] are different defenses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[People v. Unger]]'', 362 N.E.2d 319 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on Criminal Law 381 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Duress has two aspects. One is that it negates the person's [[consent]] to an act, such as [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or the entering into a contract; or, secondly, as a possible [[defense (legal)|legal defense]] or justification to an otherwise unlawful act.&lt;ref name=Gaines&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Larry |authorlink= |author2=Miller, LeRoy |title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006 |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location= |isbn=0-495-00305-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A defendant utilizing the duress defense admits to breaking the law, but claims that he/she is not [[Legal liability|liable]] because, even though the act broke the [[law]], it was only performed because of extreme unlawful pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pi1stclass.com/glossary.htm|title=1st Class Investigations Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty, admitting partial [[culpability]], so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted.

Duress or [[coercion]] can also be raised in an allegation of [[rape]] or other [[sexual assault]] to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation.

==Discussion==
A defendant who raises a defense of duress has actually done everything to constitute the ''[[actus reus]]'' of the crime, and has the ''[[mens rea]]'' because they intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of [[culpability]] already attaches to the defendant for what was done. 

In criminal law, the defendant's motive for breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an [[affirmative defense]] allowed for by law. (Duress may or may not be allowed as an affirmative defence for some particular charge -- in particular, it is generally forbidden for [[murder]], and many jurisdictions also forbid it for [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Malum in se]]'' offences, generally, are less likely to recognise duress as a defence than ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' offences.)

A successful affirmative defence means not that a criminal act was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no affirmative defence of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter [[sentence (law)|sentence]], typically in proportion to the degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.

In some rare cases, a successful argument of duress -- even when not an affirmative defence -- might result in the jury [[Jury nullification|nullifying]] the charge by refusing to convict.

The basis of the defense is that the duress actually overwhelmed the defendant's will and would also have overwhelmed the will of a person of ordinary courage (a hybrid test requiring both subjective evidence of the accused's state of mind, and an objective confirmation that the failure to resist the threats was reasonable), thus rendering the entire behavior involuntary. Thus, the liability should be reduced or discharged, making the defense one of [[exculpation]].

The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a matter of [[public policy]]. A state may say that no threat should force a person to deliberately break the law, particularly if this breach will cause significant loss or damage to a third person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law.

A mutant of duress involves [[hostage]] taking, where a person is forced to commit a criminal act under the threat, say, that their family member or close associate will be immediately killed should they refuse (commonly known as a [[Tiger kidnapping]]).  This has been raised in some cases of [[ransom]], where a person commits theft or embezzlement under orders from a kidnapper in order to secure a family member's life and freedom.  However, duress is not a complete defense to all crimes.  For example, the general rule, both at common law and today, is that duress is never a defense to murder; that is, one is never justified in killing another innocent person even if one's own life has been threatened, although this part may be questioned when multiple people are threatened with death if the defendant does not kill a single or fewer people than threatened (such a situation is similar to the [[trolley problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Anderson'', 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
For duress to qualify as a defense, four requirements must be met:&lt;ref name=Gaines /&gt;
# The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
# The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
# The threat must be immediate and inescapable
# The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

A person may also raise a duress defense when force or violence is used to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge.

== In contract law ==
{{Contract law}}
''Duress'' in the context of contract law is a [[common law]] defence brought about when one of the parties to the contract enjoyed an ascendant position in relation to the other party and abused that position by subjecting the other to ''threats.'' A party who has entered into a contract under duress is entitled to rescind or set aside the contract, rendering it voidable (in equity).

Duress is a threat of harm made to compel someone to do something against their will or judgment; especially a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition. - Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4lawnotes.com/outlines/duress.htm|title=Duress : Introduction to Contracts Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical duress
* Economic duress&lt;ref&gt; See ''Pao On v Lau Yiu Long'' [1979] 3 All ER 65; [[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]; Applied in ''Con Ange v Calogo Bloodstock AG t/as Coolmore Australia'' [2012] NSWSC 666. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical duress===
====Duress to the person====
Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts physical duress simply:  "Your money or your life."  
In ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] AC 104 [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1973/2.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a decision of the [[Privy Council]], Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff's decision to enter the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crescendo Management Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp'' (1988) 19 NSWLR 40, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law took a narrow view of the concept of duress in that it was concerned with actual or threatened violence to the person or unlawful imprisonment. Equity, however, adopted a broader "fusion" view of what sort of pressure could constitute coercion for purposes of relief and has since prevailed. &lt;ref&gt;See J Paterson, A Robertson and A Duke, ''Principles of Contract Law'', (4th edn Thomson Reuters 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Duress to goods====
In such cases, one party refuses to release the goods belonging to the other party until the other party enters into a contract with them. For example, in ''Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd v Helicopter Charter Pty Ltd'' (1991) 22 NSWLR 298, the contract was set aside after Hawker Pacific's threats to withhold the helicopter from the plaintiff unless further payments were made for repairing a botched paint job.

===The elements of economic duress===

Economic duress is the use of unlawful economic pressure to compel a party to a contract to agree to demands which they would not have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Wrongful or improper threat''': No precise definition of what is wrongful or improper.  Examples include: morally wrong, criminal, or tortious conduct; one that is a threat to breach a contract "in bad faith" or threaten to withhold an admitted debt "in bad faith".
#'''No reasonable alternative (but to accept the other party's terms)'''. If there is an available legal remedy, an available market substitute (in the form of funds, goods, or services), or any other sources of funds this element is not met.

==Insane duress==
In criminal law, when a person is found legally insane because they believed God ordered them to do the crime ("[[deific-decree]]"), one interpretation of the insanity is that they acted under a delusion of duress by God.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|615-625}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">'''Dysfunctional impulsivity''' is a type of [[impulsivity]]{{vague|date=January 2014}} that is associated with a tendency to make quick decisions when this type of decision-making is non-optimal. This differs from [[functional impulsivity]] which is a tendency to make quick decisions where this is optimal. As dysfunctional impulsivity is often associated with a failure to consider the consequences of one’s behavior, it can often lead to life difficulties.&lt;ref name="Dickman"&gt;Dickman, S. J. (1990). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity: Personality and cognitive correlates. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 58(1), 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dickman Impulsivity Inventory ==

The distinction between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity was suggested by Scott J. Dickman in an article published in 1990. Before this, impulsivity was considered a complex construct that was made up of several different aspects. The Dickman Inventory classifies impulsivity into functional and dysfunctional categories.&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt;

Many of the previously used impulsivity scales have been significantly correlated to measures of dysfunctional impulsivity. These include the impulsiveness scale of Eysenck’s Impulsivity Inventory (part of the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire]]) as well as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Cosi, S., Morales-Vives, F., Canals, J., Lorenzo-Seva, U., &amp; Vigil-Colet, A. (2008). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in childhood and adolescence. ''Psychological Reports'', 103, 67-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the questions used in the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory mirror those used on past questionnaires, and are used to assess overall impulsivity. Of the 23 questions on the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, 12 of the items are used to measure dysfunctional impulsivity. This includes questions such as “I often get into trouble because I don’t think before I act” as well as “I often say and do things without considering the consequences”&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt; This scale has been adapted for use in children with similar results: clear distinctions between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.&lt;ref&gt;Brunas-Wagstaff, J., Tilley, A., Verity, M., Ford, S., &amp; Thompson, D. (1997). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in children and their relationship to Eysenck’s impulsiveness and venturesomeness dimensions. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 22(1), 19-35.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been translated into several languages, yielding similar results

Dysfunctional impulsivity is associated with both disorderliness and a tendency to ignore hard facts before making a decision.&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt; Individuals who are high in dysfunctional impulsivity are more likely to be punished for their behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Smillie, L. D. &amp; Jackson, C. J. (2006). Functional impulsivity and reinforcement sensitivity theory. ''Journal of Personality'', 74(1), 1-37.  {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00369.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopathy,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. N. &amp; Paulhus, D. L. (2011).

Dysfunctional, but not functional, impulsivity is associated with a history of seriously violent behavior and reduced orbitofrontal and hippocampal volumes in schizophrenia. ''Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging'', 173, 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt; have all been significantly associated with dysfunctional impulsivity. Individuals high in dysfunctional impulsivity have been shown to have slight deficits in executive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, E. J. P., Sanchez de Leon, J. M. R., Mota, G. R., Luque, M. L., &amp; Garcia, C. P. (2012). Caracterización neuropsicológica de la impulsividad funcional y disfuncional en adictos a sustancias: implicaciones clínicas.

E., &amp; Yeomans, M. R. (2007). Relationships between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity, delay discounting, and cognitive distortions. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 43, 1517-1528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substance abuse ===

Impulsivity is significantly correlated with individuals being at a greater risk for [[substance abuse]]. Several studies have furthered this association to specifically relate dysfunctional impulsivity to this tendency.

[[Binge drinkers]] were found to have significantly higher scores of dysfunctional impulsivity compared to control groups. The same study found no difference in levels of functional impulsivity between groups, indicating that dysfunctional impulsivity was the version of impulsivity that led to substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Adan, A. (2011). Impulsividad functional y disfuncional en jovenes con consume intensive de alcohol (binge drinking). [Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in young binge drinkers.] [Abstract]. ''Addicciones'', 24(1), 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship with dysfunctional impulsivity has also been found in regards to cigarette smoking. Higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity have been related to difficulty restraining oneself from smoking in inappropriate places, smoking without being aware of doing so, and overall craving for cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, S. R. &amp; Leventhal A. M. (2012). Associations of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity to smoking characteristics. ''Journal of Addiction Medicine'', 6(3), 226-232. doi.10.1097/ADM.0b013e31825e2a67&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional impulsivity scores have also been found to be higher in heroin users&lt;ref&gt;Mokri, A., Ekhtiari, H., Edalati, H., Ganjgahi, H., &amp; Naderi, P. (2008). Relationship between craving intensity and risky behaviors and impulsivity factors in different groups of opiate addicts [Abstract].

[Assessment of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in substance-addicted patients by means of Dickman’s Inventory.] [Abstract.] ''Psicothema'', 21(4), 585-591.&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to non-drug abusing control groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11711">[[File:Constantine Chiaramonti Inv1749.jpg|thumb|Bust of Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Roman, 4th century.]]
The '''Edict of Milan''' ({{lang-la|Edictum Mediolanense}}) was the February 313 AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;Frend, W. H. C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], who controlled the Balkans, met in [[Milan]] and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt; following the [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] issued two years earlier in [[Serdica]]. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity a legal status, but did not make Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]; this took place under Emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 380 AD with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The document is found in [[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' and in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s [[Church History (Eusebius)|''History of the Church'']] with marked divergences between the two.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"&gt;Cross and Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' 1974 art. '''Milan, Edict of.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'&amp;thinsp; is debated by some.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"/&gt; It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ImperialpalaceMilan.jpg|thumb|300 px|Remains of the Imperial palace of Mediolanum (Milan). The imperial palace (built in large part by [[Maximian]], colleague of [[Diocletian]]) was a large complex with several buildings, gardens, and courtyards, used for the Emperor's private and public activities, and for his court, family, and imperial bureaucracy.]]
Ever since the fall of the [[Severan dynasty]] in 235 AD, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuting Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The previous [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] had been recently issued by the emperor [[Galerius]] from [[Serdica]] and was posted at [[Nicomedia]] on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the commonwealth may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.}}

Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313, when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.}}

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute this order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may "preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state."

The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in [[Lactantius]]' ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'' (''De mortibus persecutorum''), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius's Edict of Toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius's letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 34.1–35.1, 48.1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his ''History of the Church'' (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of [[Palaestina Prima]] (probably at its capital, [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]]) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius's Edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Edict was in effect directed against [[Maximinus Daia]], the Caesar in the East who was at that time styling himself as Augustus. Having received the emperor Galerius' instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death-sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"&gt;Inscription printed in Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Galerius' death, Maximin was no longer constrained; he enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximin but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a "request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"/&gt;

The Edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity, and even to make Christianity the official religion of the Empire (which recognition did not actually occur until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380). Indeed, the Edict expressly grants religious liberty not only to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but goes even further and grants liberty to all religions:

{{quote|text=When you see that this has been granted to [Christians] by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity of any religion.|sign="Edict of Milan"|source=Lactantius, ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De Mortibus Persecutorum)'', ch. 48. opera, ed. 0. F. Fritzsche, II, p 288 sq. (''Bibl Patr. Ecc. Lat.'' XI).&lt;ref&gt;And similarly in [http://wadsworth.com/history_d/special_features/ilrn_legacy/wawc1c01c/content/wciv1/readings/eusebius.html Eusebius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Licinius composed the Edict with the intent of publishing it in the east{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, who was already a Christian. Constantine's own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity: he tolerated paganism and other religions, but he actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine’s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine's first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, who he considered the strongest deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sordi, Marta. ''The Christians and the Roman Empire.'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p134.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the Edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine's ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign. &lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L. ''Eusebius: The Church History''. Grand Rapids: Kegel Publications, 1999. p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Edict of Milan required that the wrong done to the Christians be righted as thoroughly as possible; it claims “it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.”&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;"Paul Halsall, “Galerius and Constantine: Edicts of Toleration 311/313,” Fordham University; [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp Fordham.edu]; Internet, accessed 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians, claiming that “the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.” These provisions indicate that more than just the establishment of justice was intended. After demanding the immediate return of what was lost by the Christians, the edict states that this should be done so that “public order may be secured”, not for the intrinsic value of justice or the glory of God.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt; The exhortation to urgently right wrongs reflects the leaders' desires to avoid unfavorable consequences, which in this case included social unrest and further conquests. Constantine was superstitious and believed enough in the existence of the non-Christian gods to not want to offset the balance of good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yuri Koszarycz |title=Constantinian Christianity |publisher=The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |url=http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |website=The-orb.net |access-date=14 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120014/http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |archivedate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that, the sooner this balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

{{Tort law}}
'''''{{lang|la|Ex turpi causa non oritur actio}}''''' ([[Latin]] "from a dishonorable cause an action does not arise") is a [[legal doctrine]] which states that a [[plaintiff]] will be unable to pursue [[legal remedy]] if it arises in connection with his own illegal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/ex-turpi-causa-non-oritur-actio/ |title=Legal Definition of Ex turpi causa non oritur actio |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly relevant in the law of [[contract]], [[tort]] and [[trusts]],&lt;ref&gt;Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort, 15th edition, 866, suggest that the doctrine should be purely confined to contract&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' is also known as the '''illegality defence''', since a defendant may plead that even though, for instance, he broke a contract, conducted himself negligently or broke an equitable duty, nevertheless a claimant by reason of his own illegality cannot sue.
The UK Supreme Court provided a thorough reconsideration of the doctrine in 2016 in [[ Patel v Mirza]].&lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the early case of ''[[Holman v Johnson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Mansfield]] CJ set out the rationale for the illegality doctrine.

{{quote|The objection, that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this; ''{{lang|la|ex dolo malo non oritur actio}}'' ["no action arises from deceit"]. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff's own standing or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' ["from an immoral cause"], or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both were equally in fault, ''{{lang|la|[[potior est conditio defendentis]]}}'' ["stronger is the position of the defendant"].}}

==English law==
{{main article|Illegality in English law}}

===Tort===
{{see also|English tort law}}
In the law of [[tort]], the principle would prevent a criminal from bringing a claim against (for example) a fellow criminal. In ''[[National Coal Board v England]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1954] AC 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone|Lord Asquith]] said,

{{quote|If two burglars, A and B, agree to open a safe by means of explosives, and A so negligently handles the explosive charge as to injure B, B might find some difficulty in maintaining an action for negligence against A.}}

In ''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'' [2002] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1821.html EWCA Civ 1821]&lt;/ref&gt; an employee who had obtained his position by concealing his epilepsy was held not to be entitled to claim compensation for future loss of earnings as a result of his employer's negligence, since his deception (resulting in a pecuniary advantage contrary to the Theft Act 1968) would prevent him from obtaining similar employment in future.

It is not absolute in effect. For example, in ''[[Revill v Newbery]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1996] 1 All ER 291&lt;/ref&gt; an elderly [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] holder was sleeping in his shed with a [[shotgun]], to deter [[burglar]]s.  On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun through a hole in the shed, injuring the plaintiff.  At first instance, the judge awarded damages on the basis that the defendant had used violence in excess of the reasonable limits allowed by lawful self-defence and was negligent to the standard of care expected of a reasonable man who found himself in such a situation. On appeal the defendant raised the defence of ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'', but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that while public interest required that someone should not benefit from his illegal conduct, different considerations applied in cases arising in tort as opposed to those in a property or contract context. Old common law authorities and the Law Commission report (Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers) acknowledged the existence of some duty towards trespassers and the defendant could not rely on the doctrine to relieve himself of liability.

The precise scope of the doctrine is not certain. In some cases, it seems that the illegality prevents a [[duty of care]] arising in the first place. For example, in ''[[Ashton v Turner]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1981] QB 137&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant injured the plaintiff by crashing the car they sat in together in the course of fleeing the scene of a burglary they had committed together. Ewbank J held that the court may not recognise a duty of care in such cases as a matter of [[public policy]]. Similarly, in ''[[Pitts v Hunt]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] 3 All ER 344&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal rationalised this approach, saying that it was impossible to decide the appropriate standard of care in cases where the parties were involved in illegality.

If the illegality vanishes by result of legislative action (such as if the law that made the act that caused the injury was a crime is repealed) or some subsequent court case (where the law is declared invalid), the tort action will stand. In the case of ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'', the two parties were [[girlfriend]] and [[boyfriend]] until Martin discovered Ziherl had given her herpes. Martin sued Ziherl for damages in Virginia Circuit Court, and Ziherl argued that because of the case of ''Zyzk v. Zysk'' since having sex with someone they were not married to was technically the crime of fornication, Martin could not sue Ziherl because she got herpes as result of the illegal act. Martin argued the act was unconstitutional. The court agreed with Ziherl and against Martin. Martin appealed, and the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, agreeing with Martin's argument that because the United States Supreme Court had decided in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that noncommercial, private intimacy was a protected right, the law making fornication a crime was unconstitutional, thus Martin could now sue since the law that made having sex with someone they were not married to was struck down as void.

===Trusts===
{{see also|English trusts law}}
In other cases, the courts view ''{{lang|la|ex turpi}}'' as a [[defense (legal)|defence]] where otherwise a claim would lie, again on grounds of public policy.  In ''[[Tinsley v Milligan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] Ch 310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Nicholls|Nicholls LJ]] in the Court of Appeal spoke of the court having to "weigh or balance the adverse consequences of granting relief against the adverse consequences of refusing relief". The plaintiff was ultimately successful in ''Tinsley v Milligan'' in the [[House of Lords]], which allowed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff did not need to rely on the illegality.

A later case, ''[[Gray v Thames Trains]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] 3 WLR 167&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld the basic rule of public policy that disallowed recovery of anything stemming from Plaintiff's own wrongdoing. 

*''[[Moore Stephens v Stone Rolls Ltd]]'' [2009] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html UKHL 39]

===Contract===
The doctrine in the aspect of contract essentially does the same thing as one of the vitiating contractual elements known as 'Illegality' .Here contractual remedies can not be enforced by a court on a defendant if it 
is manifest that the subject matter of the contract is in anyway whether directly or by implication, contrary to public policy or in contradiction with any existing law or custom.
{{see also|English contract law}}

==Major reconsideration of the doctrine by the Supreme Court==

In 2016 the Supreme Court provided a major reconsideration of this doctrine, in [[ Patel v Mirza]] &lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;, over-ruling the test in [[Tinsley v Milligan]] and replacing it with a new set of principles. 
The changes were described as 'revolutionary' by a dissenting judge on the case, Lord Sumption (at [261] in the judgement).

[[Image:Lenz Entwurf zu einem Engel.jpg|175px|thumb|In many religions, [[angel]]s are considered good beings.  In the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, [[God]]&amp;nbsp;—being the creator of all life&amp;nbsp;—is seen as the personification of good.]]

In its most general context, the concept of '''good''' denotes that conduct which is to be or should be preferred when posed with a choice between a set of possible actions. Good is generally considered to be the opposite of [[evil]]. The concept is of interest in the study of morality, ethics, religion and philosophy, and the specific meaning and etiology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages has varied substantially in its inflected meaning depending on circumstances of place, history, religious context, or philosophical context.

==History of ideas on the topic==
{{Further|Form of the good|Origins of morality|Morality}}
Every language has a word expressing ''good'' in the sense of "having the right or desirable quality" ([[Arete (moral virtue)|ἀρετή]]) and ''bad'' in the sense "undesirable". A sense of [[morality|moral judgment]] and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are [[cultural universals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato and Aristotle===
[[File:Socrates Pio-Clementino Inv314.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Bust of Socrates in the [[Vatican Museum]]]]
Although the history of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of 'good' are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of significant historical effect. The first references that are seen in Plato's ''The Republic'' to the [[Form of the Good]] are within the conversation between [[Glaucon]] and [[Socrates]] (454c–d). When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of [[justice]], Plato identifies that we should not “introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature” instead we must focus on "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves” which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508a–c) Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things.  Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight.  But he makes a very important distinction, “sun is not sight” but it is “the cause of sight itself.”  As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the [[Intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligible]] realm. It is “what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower”.  It is not only the “cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge”.
 
Plato identifies how the form of the Good allows for the cognizance to understand such difficult concepts as justice. He identifies knowledge and truth as important, but through Socrates (508d–e) says, “good is yet more prized”.  He then proceeds to explain “although the good is not being” it is “superior to it in rank and power”, it is what “provides for knowledge and truth” (508e).&lt;ref name=Reeve&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Plato ; revised by C.D.C.|title=Republic|date=1992|publisher=Hackett Publ. Co|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=978-0-87220-136-1|edition=[2nd ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Plato, [[Aristotle]] discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms several times in both of his major surviving ethical works, the ''[[Eudemian Ethics|Eudemian]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Aristotle argues that Plato's Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign “goodness” to anything in the existing world. Because Plato's Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans have no reason to believe that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.&lt;ref name=plat&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Gail|title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-924559-2|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato and Aristotle were not the first contributors in ancient Greece to the study of the 'good' and discussion preceding them can be found among the pre-Socratic philosophers. In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], in particular [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Kahn, ''Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology'', The American Journal of Philology (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of [[Plato]], together with the emergence of [[monotheistic]] thought (notably in ''[[Euthyphro]]'', which ponders the concept of piety ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in [[Late Antiquity]] by [[Neoplatonists]], [[Gnostics]], and [[Church Fathers]].

===Ancient religions===
[[File:Faravahar.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''Fravashi'' (guardian spirit)|right]]
{{See|Zoroastrianism|Gnosticism}}
Aside from ancient Greek studies of the 'good', the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran|Persia]] almost five thousand years ago a religious philosopher called [[Zoroaster]] simplified the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of early Iranian gods&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_6-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=6–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Dualistic cosmology|two opposing forces]]: [[Ahura Mazda]] ([[Light (theology)|Illuminating]] [[Wisdom]]) and [[Angra Mainyu]] ([[devil|Destructive Spirit]]) which were in conflict.

For the western world, this idea developed into a religion which spawned many [[sect]]s, some of which embraced an extreme [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] belief that the [[nature|material world]] should be shunned and the [[Sacred|spiritual world]] should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many [[Ancient history|ancient]] religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion| year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK|author=John Hinnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teach that ''[[gnosis]]'' (variously interpreted as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[salvation]], [[emancipation]] or [[Buddhahood|'oneness with God']]) may be reached by practising [[philanthropy]] to the point of personal [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence]] (as far as possible for ''[[wikt:disciple#Noun|hearers]]'', total for ''[[Initiation|initiates]]'') and diligently searching for [[wisdom]] by helping others.&lt;ref name=gph&gt;{{cite book |title=Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times|first=Tobias |last=Churton|publisher=Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company |date=2005|ISBN=978-159477-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ''[[ethics]]'' and ''[[morality]]'' both being derived from terms for "regional custom", Greek ἦθος and Latin ''mores'', respectively (see also ''[[:wikt:siðr|siðr]]'').

===Medieval period===
{{see|Christian philosophy}}
[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]
Medieval [[Christian philosophy]] was founded on the work of the Bishop [[Augustine of Hippo]] and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] who understood evil in terms of [[Biblical infallibility]] and [[Biblical inerrancy]], as well as the influences of Plato and Aristotle in their appreciation of the concept of the [[Summum bonum]].  Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kojeve, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (1980) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Many medieval Christian [[theologian]]s both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of ''Good and evil'' until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition|author=Farley, E|publisher=Fortress Press / Vanderbilt University|year=1990|isbn=978-0800624477}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
* a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn [[praise]] or [[punishment]] from the [[Theocracy|religious authorities]]
* religious obligation arising from [[Divine law]] leading to [[saint]]hood or [[damnation]].
* a generally accepted [[Norm (social)|cultural standard]] of behaviour which might enhance group [[Human evolution (origins of society and culture)|survival]] or [[wealth]]
* [[natural law]] or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction
* [[State (polity)|statute law]] imposing a legal [[duty]]

===Modern ideas===
====Kant====
{{main|Kant|Critique of Practical Reason}}
A significant enlightenment context for studying the 'good' has been its significance in the study of "[[Transcendentals|the good, the true and the beautiful]]" as found in [[Immanuel Kant]] and other Enlightenment philosophers and religious thinkers. These discussion were undertaken by Kant particularly in the context of his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]''.

====Rawls====
[[John Rawls]]' book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to [[justice]]. Rawls defined justice as ''fairness'', especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals'  goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the [[original position]], a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations.

==Good and evil==
[[File:Extermination of Evil Sendan Kendatsuba crop.jpg|thumb|right|475px|One of the five paintings of ''[[Extermination of Evil]]'' portrays Sendan Kendatsuba, one of the eight guardians of Buddhist law, banishing evil.]]
{{main|good and evil}}
In [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[philosophy]], "[[good and evil]]" is a very common [[dichotomy]]. In cultures with [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] and [[Abrahamic]] religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the antagonistic [[dualistic cosmology|opposite of good]]. Good is that which should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"&gt;Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. ''Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation''. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. P. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, this antagonistic duality itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Śūnyatā]]'', or emptiness.  This is the recognition of good and evil not being unrelated, but two parts of a greater whole; unity, oneness, a [[Monism]].&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"/&gt;

As a religious concept, basic ideas of a [[dichotomy]] between good and evil has developed so that today:
*''[[Good (religion)|Good]]'' is a broad concept but it typically deals with an association with [[life]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], continuity, [[happiness]], [[love]] and [[justice]].
*''[[Evil]]'' is typically associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary and/or indiscriminate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the dilemma of the [[human condition]] and humans' and their capacity to perform both good and evil activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/human-condition/ |title=The Human Condition |work=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |first=Jeremy |last=Griffith |year=2011 |isbn= 9781741290073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodness and morality in biology==
The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with [[morality]], is regarded by some biologists (notably [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]], [[Jeremy Griffith]], [[David Sloan Wilson]] and [[Frans de Waal]]) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward Osborne |last=Wilson |authorlink= E.

A '''hidden message''' is information that is not immediately noticeable, and that must be discovered or uncovered and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] codes such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as [[backmasking]] and [[steganography]], many so-called hidden messages are merely [[Pareidolia|fanciful imaginings]] or [[apophany]].

== Description ==
The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include [[Backmasking|backwards audio messages]], hidden visual messages, and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] [[code]]s such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.

== Backward audio messages ==
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate [[backmasking]], while others are simply [[phonetic reversal]]s resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, [[video game]]s, [[music video]]s, [[movies]], and [[television show]]s.

=== Backmasking ===
{{Main|Backmasking}}
Backmasking is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by [[The Beatles]], who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]].'' The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to [[Book burning|record-burnings]] and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Phonetic reversal ===
{{Main|Phonetic reversal}}

Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their [[phoneme]]s are reversed—a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, "Kiss" backwards sounds like "sick", and so the title of [[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Kiss Kiss Kiss (Yoko Ono song)|Kiss Kiss Kiss]]" sounds like "Sick Sick Sick" or "Six Six Six" backwards. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as "It's fun to smoke marijuana"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1= N. |last1= Epley |first2= B. |last2= Keysar |first3= L. |last3= Van Boven |first4= T. |last4= Gilovich |title= Perspective Taking as Egocentric Anchoring and Adjustment |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 87 |issue= 3 |pages= 327–339 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15382983 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/its_fun_to_smoke_dust_satanic_panic_preacher_gets_mashed-up_with_queen|title= It's Fun To Smoke Dust!

According to proponents of [[reverse speech]], phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, "Feel the Curves!!"

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards [[PETCO]], a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the [[San Diego Padres]] baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased [[naming rights]] to [[Petco Park]] stadium, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: "Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting [[acrostic]] reads "BOYCOTT PETCO".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="117666">The '''history of eugenics''' is the study of development and advocacy of ideas related to [[eugenics]] around the world. Early eugenic ideas were discussed in Ancient Greece and Rome. The height of the modern eugenics movement came in the late 19th and early 20th century. Today eugenics continues to be a topic of political and social debate.

==History==

===Pre-Galtonian philosophies===
The philosophy was most famously expounded by [[Plato]], who believed human reproduction should be monitored and controlled by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/|title = Eugenics|date = Jul 2, 2014|accessdate = January 2, 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher = Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato understood this form of government control would not be readily accepted, and proposed the truth be concealed from the public via a fixed lottery. Mates, in Plato's Republic, would be chosen by a "marriage number" in which the quality of the individual would be quantitatively analyzed, and persons of high numbers would be allowed to procreate with other persons of high numbers. In theory, this would lead to predictable results and the improvement of the human race. However, Plato acknowledged the failure of the "marriage number" since "gold soul" persons could still produce "bronze soul" children.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, 457c10-d3&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's ideas may have been one of the earliest attempts to mathematically analyze genetic inheritance, which was later improved by the development of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]ian genetics and the mapping of the [[human genome]].

In Sparta, newborns were inspected by the city's elders, who decided the fate of the infant. If the child was deemed incapable of living, it was usually exposed&lt;ref&gt;''Making Patriots'' by [[Walter Berns]], 2001, page 12, "and whose infants, if they chanced to be puny or ill-formed, were exposed in a chasm (the Apothetae) and left to die;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Plutarch | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/lycurgus*.html | last=Plutarch | title=Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Apothetae'' near the [[Taygetus]] mountain.

Trials for babies included bathing them in wine and exposing them to the elements. To Sparta, this would ensure only the strongest survived and procreated.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Roper, ''Ancient Eugenics'' (Oxford: Cliveden Press, 1913), text at [http://www.euvolution.com/articles/ancient.htm Euvolution.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Hitler considered Sparta to be the first "[[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'']] State", and much like [[Ernst Haeckel]] before him, praised Sparta for its selective infanticide policy, though the Nazis believed the children were killed outright and not exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Twelve Tables|Twelve Tables of Roman Law]], established early in the formation of the [[Roman Republic]], [[Twelve Tables#TABLE IV (Parents and children)|stated in the fourth table]] that deformed children must be put to death. In addition, patriarchs in Roman society were given the right to "discard" infants at their discretion. This was often done by drowning undesired newborns in the [[Tiber River]]. Commenting on the Roman practice of eugenics, the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote that: "We put down mad dogs; we kill the wild, untamed ox; we use the knife on sick sheep to stop their infecting the flock; we destroy abnormal offspring at birth; children, too, if they are born weak or deformed, we drown.

===Galton's theory===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sir [[Francis Galton]] initially developed the ideas of eugenics using social statistics.]]

Sir [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911) systematized these ideas and practices according to new knowledge about the evolution of man and animals provided by the theory of his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]] during the 1860s and 1870s. After reading Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Galton built upon Darwin's ideas whereby the mechanisms of [[natural selection]] were potentially thwarted by human [[civilization]]. He reasoned that, since many human societies sought to protect the underprivileged and weak, those societies were at odds with the natural selection responsible for extinction of the weakest; and only by changing these social policies could society be saved from a "reversion towards mediocrity", a phrase he first coined in statistics and which later changed to the now common "[[regression towards the mean]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 3 in [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]], ''Statistics in Britain, 1865–1930: The social construction of scientific knowledge'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton first sketched out his theory in the 1865 article "Hereditary Talent and Character", then elaborated further in his 1869 book ''Hereditary Genius''.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Galton, [http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1860-1869/galton-1865-hereditary-talent.pdf "Hereditary talent and character"], ''Macmillan's Magazine'' 12 (1865): 157–166 and 318–327; [[Francis Galton]], [http://www.mugu.com/galton/books/hereditary-genius/ ''Hereditary genius: an inquiry into its laws and consequences''] (London: Macmillan, 1869).&lt;/ref&gt; He began by studying the way in which human intellectual, moral, and personality traits tended to run in families. Galton's basic argument was [[inheritance of intelligence|"genius" and "talent" were hereditary traits in humans]] (although neither he nor Darwin yet had a working model of this type of heredity). He concluded since one could use [[artificial selection]] to exaggerate traits in other animals, one could expect similar results when applying such models to humans. As he wrote in the introduction to ''Hereditary Genius'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I propose to show in this book that a man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world. Consequently, as it is easy, notwithstanding those limitations, to obtain by careful selection a permanent breed of dogs or horses gifted with peculiar powers of running, or of doing anything else, so it would be quite practicable to produce a highly gifted race of men by judicious marriages during several consecutive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Galton, ''Hereditary Genius'': 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galton claimed that the less intelligent were more fertile than the more intelligent of his time. Galton did not propose any selection methods; rather, he hoped a solution would be found if social [[mores]] changed in a way that encouraged people to see the importance of breeding. He first used the word ''eugenic'' in his 1883 ''Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=179}} "Galton coined the word "eugenics" in his 1883 book, ''Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development''.&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which he meant "to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with 'eugenic' questions". He included a footnote to the word "eugenic" which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'' namely, good in stock, hereditary endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalized one than ''viriculture'' which I once ventured to use.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Galton, [http://www.mugu.com/galton/books/human-faculty/ ''Inquiries into human faculty and its development''] (London, Macmillan, 1883): 17, fn1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1908, in ''Memories of my life'', Galton stated the official definition of eugenics: "the study of agencies under social control that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations, either physically or mentally".&lt;ref name="Galton1908"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Francis Galton|title=Memories of My Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npRh7kVgKHwC|year=1908|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been agreed in consultation with a committee that included the [[biometrician]] [[Karl Pearson]]. It was slightly at odds with Galton's preferred definition, given in a lecture to the newly formed Sociological Society at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1904: "the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage".&lt;ref name="Galton1904"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=July 1904 |title=Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=X |issue=1 |accessdate=2010-12-27 |url=http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082723/http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archivedate=2007-11-03 |quote=Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. |bibcode=  1904Natur..70...82.|pages=82, 1st paragraph |doi=10.1038/070082a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter definition, which encompassed nurture and environment as well as heredity, was favoured by broadly left wing, liberal elements of the ensuing ideological divide.&lt;ref name="Freeden2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeden|first1=Michael|title=Eugenics and Progressive Thought: a Study in Ideological Affinity|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=22|issue=03|year=2009|pages=645|issn=0018-246X|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00017027}}{{rp|645–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton's formulation of eugenics was based on a strong [[statistics|statistical]] approach, influenced heavily by [[Adolphe Quetelet]]'s "social physics". Unlike Quetelet, however, Galton did not exalt the "average man" but decried him as mediocre. Galton and his statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]] developed what was called the [[biometrics|biometrical]] approach to eugenics, which developed new and complex statistical models (later exported to wholly different fields) to describe the heredity of traits. However, with the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s hereditary laws, two separate camps of eugenics advocates emerged. One was made up of statisticians, the other of biologists. Statisticians thought the biologists had exceptionally crude mathematical models, while biologists thought the statisticians knew little about biology.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapters 2 and 6 in MacKenzie, ''Statistics in Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenics eventually referred to human selective reproduction with an intent to create children with desirable traits, generally through the approach of influencing [[differential birth rates]]. These policies were mostly divided into two categories: ''positive eugenics'', the increased reproduction of those seen to have advantageous hereditary traits; and ''negative eugenics'', the discouragement of reproduction by those with hereditary traits perceived as poor. Negative eugenic policies in the past have ranged from paying those deemed to have bad genes to voluntarily undergo sterilization, to attempts at [[Racial segregation|segregation]] to compulsory [[compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] and even [[genocide]]. Positive eugenic policies have typically taken the form of awards or bonuses for "fit" parents who have another child. Relatively innocuous practices like [[marriage counseling]] had early links with eugenic ideology. Eugenics is superficially related to what would later be known as [[Social Darwinism]]. While both claimed intelligence was hereditary, eugenics asserted new policies were needed to actively change the status quo towards a more "eugenic" state, while the Social Darwinists argued society itself would naturally "check" the problem of "[[dysgenics]]" if no welfare policies were in place (for example, the poor might reproduce more but would have higher mortality rates).&lt;ref name="Donald MacKenzie 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Donald |title=Eugenics in Britain |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=503 |year=1975 |doi=10.1177/030631277600600310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Davenport===
[[Charles Davenport]] (1866-1944), a scientist from the United States, stands out as one of history's leading eugenicists. He took eugenics from a scientific idea to a worldwide movement implemented in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=34}}, describes Davenport as eugenics crusader-in-chief&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport obtained funding from the Carnegie Institution, to establish the [[Station for Experimental Evolution]] at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Eugenics Records Office in 1910, which provided the scientific basis for later Eugenic policies such as [[enforced sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became the first President of the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] (IFEO) in 1925, an organization he was instrumental in building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davenport was located at Cold Spring Harbor and received money from the Carnegie Institute of Washington, the organization known as the [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) started to become an embarrassment after the well-known debates between Davenport and [[Franz Boas]]. Instead, Davenport occupied the same office and the same address at Cold Spring Harbor, but his organization now became known as the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, which currently retains the archives of the Eugenics Record Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.cshl.edu/archives/archives/ciwfiles.htm |title=CIW files |publisher=Library.cshl.edu |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Davenport's racist{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} views were not supported by all geneticists at Cold Spring Harbor, including [[H. J. Muller]], [[Bentley Glass]], and [[Esther Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Eugenics%20(Anecdotes).html |title=Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg: Eugenics |publisher=Estherlederberg.com |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Davenport welcomed [[Ernst Rüdin]], a prominent Swiss eugenicist and race scientist, as his successor in the position of President of the IFEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rüdin, director of the ''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (German Research Institute for Psychiatry, located in Munich), a [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Walter Schmuhl, "The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927-1945", Springer Science + Business Media B. V., 2008, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; was a co-founder (with his brother-in-law [[Alfred Ploetz]]) of the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=285}}. [[Richard Weikart]] From Darwin to Hitler – Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany, describes this as the world's first Eugenic organization. (Weikart, p 15)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent figures in eugenics who were associated with Davenport included [[Harry Laughlin]] (United States), [[Havelock Ellis]] (United Kingdom), [[Irving Fischer]] (United States), [[Eugen Fischer]] (Germany), [[Madison Grant]] (United States), [[Lucien Howe]] (United States), and [[Margaret Sanger]] (United States, founder of [[Planned Parenthood]]).&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{harvnb|Black|2003}} and index entries&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Galton class eugenics.svg|right|thumb|400px|Galton's view of the British class structure was the basis and emphasis of the eugenics movement in Britain.]]

In September 1903, an "Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration" chaired by Almeric W. FitzRoy was appointed by the government "to make a preliminary enquiry into the allegations concerning the deterioration of certain classes of the population as shown by the large percentage of rejections for physical causes of recruits for the Army", and gave its Report to both houses of parliament in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/b21358916 Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration], London, 1904, as digitized in 2015 by the Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its recommendations, originating from professor [[Daniel John Cunningham]], were an anthropometric survey of the British population. The Catholic church was opposed to eugenics, as illustrated in the writings of Father [[Thomas John Gerrard]].&lt;ref name="Scotti2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paschal Scotti|title=Out of Due Time: Wilfrid Ward and the Dublin Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szxVd-QDzqsC&amp;pg=PA159|date=February 2006|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1427-6|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United Kingdom, eugenics never received significant state funding, but it was supported by many prominent figures of different political persuasions before World War I, including: [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] economists [[William Beveridge]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]; [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialists]] such as Irish author [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Sidney Webb]]; and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] such as the future Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Arthur Balfour]].&lt;ref name=Okuefuna&gt;{{cite web

These groupings are shown in the figure and indicate the proportion of society falling into each group and their perceived genetic worth. Galton suggested that negative eugenics (i.e. an attempt to prevent them from bearing offspring) should be applied only to those in the lowest social group (the "Undesirables"), while positive eugenics applied to the higher classes. However, he appreciated the worth of the higher working classes to society and industry.

One of the earliest modern advocates of eugenics (before it was labeled as such) was [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. In 1881 Bell investigated the rate of [[deaf]]ness on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]]. From this he concluded that deafness was hereditary in nature and, through noting that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children, tentatively suggested that couples where both were deaf should not marry, in his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on 13 November 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bell, Alexander Graham|title=Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race  | publisher =Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf  | year =1883  | url =http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED033502&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED033502 | accessdate = 2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/bell_nad.html |title=Through Deaf Eyes .

The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce, Robert V.|title=Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1990|pages=410; 417|isbn=0-8014-9691-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist considered the "father of the American eugenics movement" was [[Charles Benedict Davenport]].&lt;ref name=Micklos&gt;{{cite web |author1=Micklos, David |author2=Carlson, Elof |title=Engineering American society: the lesson of eugenics  | publisher =Macmillan Magazines  | date =Nov 2000  | url =http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kahales/pdfs/pdfsprot/MicklosCarlsoneugenics.pdf | accessdate = 2011-04-13 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1904 he secured funding for the Station for Experimental Evolution, later renamed the Carnegie Department of Genetics.  It was also around that time that Davenport became actively involved with the [[American Breeders' Association]] (ABA).  This led to Davenport's first eugenics text, "The science of human improvement by better breeding", one of the first papers to connect agriculture and human heredity.&lt;ref name=Micklos/&gt; Davenport later went on to set up a Eugenics Record Office (ERO), collecting hundreds of thousands of medical histories from Americans, which many considered to have a racist and anti-immigration agenda.&lt;ref name=Micklos/&gt; Davenport and his views were supported at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] as late as 1963, when his views began to be de-emphasized.

As the science continued in the 20th century, researchers interested in familial mental disorders conducted a number of studies to document the heritability of such illnesses as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Their findings were used by the eugenics movement as proof for its cause. State laws were written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to prohibit marriage and force sterilization of the mentally ill in order to prevent the "passing on" of mental illness to the next generation. These laws were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1927 and were not abolished until the mid-20th century.  All in all, 60,000 Americans were sterilized.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt;

Bell]] 274 U.S. 200, 205 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Connecticut]] in 1896, many states enacted marriage laws with eugenic criteria, prohibiting anyone who was "epileptic, [[imbecile]] or [[feeble-minded]]" from marrying. In 1898 [[Charles Benedict Davenport|Charles B. Davenport]], a prominent American [[biology|biologist]], began as director of a biological research station based in [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] where he experimented with evolution in plants and animals. In 1904 Davenport received funds from the [[Carnegie Institution]] to found the Station for Experimental Evolution. The [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) opened in 1910 while Davenport and [[Harry H. Laughlin]] began to promote eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;The history of eugenics in the United States is discussed at length in {{cite book|author=Haller, Mark H. |title=Eugenics: hereditarian attitudes in American thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtgnAAAAYAAJ |year=1963 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location=New Brunswick NJ}} and {{harvnb|Kevles|1985}} ''In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity'', the latter being the standard survey work on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immigration Restriction League]] (founded in 1894) was the first American entity associated officially with eugenics. The League sought to bar what it considered dysgenic members of certain races from entering America and diluting what it saw as the superior American racial stock through procreation. They lobbied for a literacy test for immigrants, based on the belief that literacy rates were low among "inferior races". Literacy test bills were vetoed by Presidents in 1897, 1913 and 1915; eventually, President Wilson's second veto was overruled by Congress in 1917. Membership in the League included: A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard, William DeWitt Hyde, president of Bowdoin College, James T. Young, director of Wharton School and David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University. The League allied themselves with the American Breeder's Association to gain influence and further its goals and in 1909 established a eugenics committee chaired by David Starr Jordan with members Charles Davenport, Alexander Graham Bell, Vernon Kellogg, Luther Burbank, William Earnest Castle, Adolf Meyer, H. J. Webber and Friedrich Woods.&lt;ref name="Anglo-America, Ladelle McWhorter 2009, pg 204-205"&gt;{{cite book |author=McWhorter, Ladelle |title=Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2009 |pages=204–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA's immigration legislation committee, formed in 1911 and headed by League's founder Prescott F. Hall, formalized the committee's already strong relationship with the Immigration Restriction League.&lt;ref name="Anglo-America, Ladelle McWhorter 2009, pg 204-205"/&gt;

In years to come, the ERO collected a mass of family pedigrees and concluded that those who were unfit came from economically and socially poor backgrounds. Eugenicists such as Davenport, the [[psychology|psychologist]] [[Henry H. Goddard]] and the conservationist [[Madison Grant]] (all well respected in their time) began to lobby for various solutions to the problem of the "unfit". (Davenport favored [[immigration restriction]] and sterilization as primary methods; Goddard favored segregation in his ''[[The Kallikak Family]]''; Grant favored all of the above and more, even entertaining the idea of extermination.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kevles|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though their methodology and research methods are now understood as highly flawed, at the time this was seen as legitimate scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;See Pg. 23 "'Human Progress' through Eugenics" from Psychology of Mental Fossils, toward an Archeo-psychology by Douglas Keith Candland at [http://www.douglascandland.com/images/chapter7.pdf Douglascandland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, have scientific detractors (notably, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], one of the few Mendelians to explicitly criticize eugenics), though most of these focused more on what they considered the crude methodology of eugenicists, and the characterization of almost every human characteristic as being hereditary, rather than the idea of eugenics itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cravens, Hamilton |title=The triumph of evolution: American scientists and the heredity-environment controversy, 1900–1941 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |year=1978 |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states sterilized "imbeciles" for much of the 20th century. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1927 ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' case that the state of [[Virginia]] could sterilize individuals under the [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924]]. The most significant era of [[compulsory sterilization|eugenic sterilization]] was between 1907 and 1963, when over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenics legislation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lombardo, "Eugenic Sterilization Laws", essay in the Eugenics Archive, available online at [http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html Eugenicsarchive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; A favorable report on the results of sterilization in [[California]], the state with the most sterilizations by far, was published in book form by the biologist [[Paul Popenoe]] and was widely cited by the Nazi government as evidence that wide-reaching sterilization programs were feasible and humane.

Such legislation was passed in the U.S. because of widespread public acceptance of the eugenics movement, spearheaded by efforts of progressive reformers.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2698847|year=1989|last1=Allen|first1=GE|title=Eugenics and American social history, 1880–1950|volume=31|issue=2|pages=885–9|journal=Genome / National Research Council Canada = Genome / Conseil national de recherches Canada|doi=10.1139/g89-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 19 million people attended the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, open for 10 months from February 20 to December 4, 1915.&lt;ref name=Stern05&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexandra Minna |last=Stern |title=Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America |publisher=University of California Press |year=2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PPIE was a fair devoted to extolling the virtues of a rapidly progressing nation, featuring new developments in science, agriculture, manufacturing and technology. A subject that received a large amount of time and space was that of the developments concerning health and disease, particularly the areas of tropical medicine and race betterment (tropical medicine being the combined study of bacteriology, parasitology and entomology while racial betterment being the promotion of eugenic studies). Having these areas so closely intertwined, it seemed that they were both categorized in the main theme of the fair, the advancement of civilization. Thus in the public eye, the seemingly contradictory areas of study were both represented under progressive banners of improvement and were made to seem like plausible courses of action to better American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2005|pp=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of California was at the vanguard of the American eugenics movement, performing about 20,000 sterilizations or one third of the 60,000 nationwide from 1909 up until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stern05/&gt; By 1910, there was a large and dynamic network of scientists, reformers and professionals engaged in national eugenics projects and actively promoting eugenic legislation. The American Breeder's Association was the first eugenic body in the U.S., established in 1906 under the direction of biologist Charles B. Davenport. The ABA was formed specifically to "investigate and report on heredity in the human race, and emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood". Membership included Alexander Graham Bell, Stanford president David Starr Jordan and Luther Burbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2005|pp=82–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nazi administrators went on trial for [[war crimes]] in [[Nuremberg]] after [[World War II]], they attempted to justify the mass sterilizations (over 450,000 in less than a decade) by citing the United States as their inspiration.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;The connections between U.S. and Nazi eugenicists is discussed in {{cite news |author=Black, Edwin |title=Eugenics and the Nazis – the California connection |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=9 November 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL}}, as well as {{harvnb|Black|2003}}. Stefan Kühl's work, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), is considered the standard scholarly work on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis had claimed American eugenicists inspired and supported Hitler's racial purification laws, and failed to understand the connection between those policies and the eventual genocide of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780195149784| page = 192| last = Kühl| first = Stefan| title = The Nazi Connection| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kallikaks chart1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A [[pedigree chart]] from ''[[The Kallikak Family]]'' meant to show how one illicit tryst could lead to an entire generation of [[imbecile]]s.]]

The idea of "genius" and "talent" is also considered by [[William Graham Sumner]], a founder of the American Sociological Society (now called the American Sociological Association). He maintained that if the government did not meddle with the social policy of ''laissez-faire'', a class of genius would rise to the top of the system of social stratification, followed by a class of talent. Most of the rest of society would fit into the class of mediocrity. Those who were considered to be defective (mentally retarded, handicapped, etc.) had a negative effect on social progress by draining off necessary resources. They should be left on their own to sink or swim. But those in the class of delinquent (criminals, deviants, etc.) should be eliminated from society ("Folkways", 1907).

However, methods of eugenics were applied to reformulate more restrictive definitions of white racial purity in existing state laws banning [[interracial marriage]]: the so-called [[anti-miscegenation laws]]. The most famous example of the influence of eugenics and its emphasis on strict racial segregation on such "anti-[[miscegenation]]" legislation was Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] overturned this law in 1967 in [[Loving v. Virginia]], and declared anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional.

With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], eugenicists for the first time played an important role in the Congressional debate as expert advisers on the threat of "inferior stock" from eastern and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Anthropometry]] demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 eugenics conference.]]

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that restrictions on [[immigration]] passed in the United States during the 1920s (and overhauled in 1965 with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]]) were motivated by the goals of eugenics. During the early 20th century, the United States and Canada began to receive far higher numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. It has been argued that this stirred both Canada and the United States into passing laws creating a hierarchy of nationalities, rating them from the most desirable [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Nordic race|Nordic]] peoples to the Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who were almost completely banned from entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;See Lombardo, "Eugenics Laws Restricting Immigration"; and {{harvnb|Gould|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several people, in particular [[Franz Samelson]], [[Mark Snyderman]] and [[Richard Herrnstein]], have argued, based on their examination of the records of the congressional debates over immigration policy, Congress gave virtually no consideration to these factors. According to these authors, the restrictions were motivated primarily by a desire to maintain the country's [[culture|cultural]] integrity against the heavy influx of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (Free Press, 1994): 5; and [[Mark Syderman]] Richard Herrnstein, "Intelligence tests and the Immigration Act of 1924", ''American Psychologist'' 38 (1983): 986–995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, eugenic supporters included [[Theodore Roosevelt]],&lt;ref&gt;"Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce." http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/36.3/br_7.html&lt;/ref&gt; Research was funded by distinguished philanthropies and carried out at prestigious universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/5/4/186 |title=Eugenics in the Colleges |volume=5 |issue=4 |page=186 |journal=Journal of Heredity |date=April 1914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taught in college and high school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211959/http://www.justicematters.org/jmi_sec/jmi_dwnlds/forgotten_history.pdf |date=26 July 2011 |title=The Forgotten History of Eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Sanger]] founded [[Planned Parenthood of America]] to urge the legalization of [[contraception]] for poor, immigrant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/history-and-successes.htm#Sanger |title=History &amp; Successes |publisher=Plannedparenthood.org |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its time eugenics was touted by some as scientific and progressive,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; the natural application of knowledge about breeding to the arena of human life. Before the realization of [[Extermination camp|death camps]] in [[World War II]], the idea that eugenics would lead to [[genocide]] was not taken seriously by the average American.

===Australia===
{{main article|Stolen Generations}}

The policy of removing mixed race [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] children from their parents emerged from an opinion based on Eugenics theory in late 19th and early 20th century Australia that the 'full-blood' [[tribal]] Aborigine would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to inevitable extinction, as at the time huge numbers of aborigines were in fact dying out, from diseases caught from European settlers.&lt;ref name=McG&gt;Russell McGregor, ''Imagined Destinies. Aboriginal Australians and the Doomed Race Theory, 1880–1939'', Melbourne: MUP, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ideology]] at the time held that mankind could be divided into a civilizational hierarchy. This notion supposed that Northern [[Europe]]ans were superior in civilization and that Aborigines were inferior. According to this view, the increasing numbers of mixed-descent children in Australia, labeled as "half-castes" (or alternatively "crossbreeds", "quadroons", and "octoroons") should develop within their respective communities, white or aboriginal, according to their dominant parentage.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (1997: 151)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, this led to policies and legislation that resulted in the removal of children from their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.aus-vn672744-2x |title=Aborigines Act of 1904 |publisher=Nla.gov.au |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stated aim was to [[Cultural assimilation|culturally assimilate]] [[multiracial|mixed-descent]] people into contemporary Australian society. In all states and territories legislation was passed in the early years of the 20th century which gave Aboriginal protectors guardianship rights over Aborigines up to the age of sixteen or twenty-one. Policemen or other agents of the state (such as Aboriginal Protection Officers), were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their communities into institutions. In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government or [[missionary]]) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-richardson.net/misc/stolen_generation.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001216154300/http://www.tim-richardson.net/misc/stolen_generation.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-12-16 |title=Stolen Generation by Tim Richardson |publisher=Tim-richardson.net |date=2003-08-11 |accessdate=2011-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special//rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen13.html Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission – Bringing them Home – The Report]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 movie [[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|''Rabbit-Proof Fence'']] portrays a true story about this system and the harrowing consequences of attempting to overcome it.

In 1922, [[A.O. Neville]] was appointed the second Western Australia State ''[[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]]''. During the next quarter-century, he presided over the now notorious 'Assimilation' policy of removing mixed-race [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] children from their parents.

Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to 'uplifting the Native race'. Speaking before the [[Moseley Royal Commission]], which investigated the administration of Aboriginals in 1934, he defended the policies of [[Forced settlement of Australian aboriginals|forced settlement]], removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that "they have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patient's will". In his twilight years Neville continued to actively promote his policy. Towards the end of his career, Neville published ''Australia's Coloured Minority'', a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of aboriginal people into white Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jacobs | first=Pat | title=Mister Neville, A Biography | publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press | isbn=0-949206-72-5 | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kinnane| first=Stephen | title=Shadow Lines | publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press | isbn=1-86368-237-6 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

[[File:Redenção.jpg|thumb|right| Portrait "Redenção de Can" (Ham's Redemption), (1895), by [[Modesto Brocos]],  illustrating the process of racial whitening (''[[blanqueamiento]]'') through [[miscegenation]] in [[Brazil]].

The idea of  Social Darwinism was widespread among Brazil's leading scientists, educators, social thinkers, as well as many elected officials, in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This led to the "Politica de Branqueamento" (Whitening Policies) set in practice in Brazil in the early part of the 20th century. This series of laws intended to enlarge the numbers of the white race in [[Brazil]] while reducing the numbers of descendents of African Slaves and Asians made the ground fertile for eugenic theories.

The first official organized movement of eugenics in South America was a Eugenics Conference in April 1917, which was followed in January 1918 by the founding of the São Paulo Society of Eugenics. This society worked with health agencies and psychiatric offices to promote their ideas. The year 1931 saw the foundation of the "Comitê Central de Eugenismo" (Central Committee on Eugenics) presided by Renato Kehl. Among its suggestions were an end to the immigration of non-whites to Brazil, and the spread of policies against miscegenation.&lt;ref name="pmid21259999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kehl |first= R | title = 3.-In Brazil | journal = [[The Eugenics Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–7 | year = 1931 | pmid = 21259999 | pmc = 2985066 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Central Committee on Eugenics clashed with the Whitening Policies of the beginning of the 20th century. While the Whitening Policies advocated miscegenation in order to reduce the numbers of pure Africans in Brazil in favor of mulattos, who were expected to then produce white off-spring - a policy very similar to the "uplifting the Native race" in Australia - the Central Committee on Eugenics advocated no miscegenation at all and separation between the whites and non-whites in Brazil. When it became obvious that the future of Brazil was in industrialization (just as it was for other countries around the world), Brazil had to face whether they had a working force capable of being absorbed by an industrial society. {{dubious|date=June 2016}}{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A new ideology was needed to counter such racialist claims. This ideology, known as [[Lusotropicalism]], was associated with [[Gilberto Freyre]], and became popular throughout the Portuguese Empire: specifically, [[Brazil]] and [[Angola]]. Lusotropicalism claimed that its large population of mixed-race people made Brazil the most capable country in tropical climates to carry out a program of industrialization.{{dubious|date=June 2016}} Its mixed race population had the cultural and intellectual capabilities provided by the white race,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} which could not work in tropical climates, combined with the physical ability to work in tropical climates, provided by the African black race. This excluded the fact that white prisoners, working under penal servitude in Puerto Rico, seemed quite capable of working in a tropical environment. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil====

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the work of the Rockefeller Foundation was decisive for the implementation of public health initiatives in Brazil, especially in the so-called public health movement. At that time, Brazilian eugenics was the same as public health, as expressed in the maxim "to sanitize is to eugenize".&lt;ref&gt;The Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil, [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1517-45222009000200012&amp;script=sci_arttext] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the eugenics movement gained support early in the 20th century as prominent physicians drew a direct link between heredity and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenics was enforced by law in two Canadian provinces. In [[compulsory sterilization|Alberta]], the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta|Sexual Sterilization Act]] was enacted in 1928, focusing the movement on the sterilization of [[mental deficiency|mentally deficient]] individuals, as determined by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign to enforce this action was backed by groups such as the United Farm Women's Group, including key member [[Emily Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sterlization Act has Much Backing'', Edmonton Journal (9 March 1928) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other former British Empire colonies, eugenic policies were linked to racist (and racialist) agendas pursued by various levels of government, such as the [[Compulsory sterilization in Canada|forced sterilization of Canada's indigenous peoples]] and specific provincial government initiatives, such as [[Alberta Eugenics Board|Alberta's eugenics program]]. As a brief illustration, in 1928 the province of Alberta started an initiative, "…allowing any inmate of a native residential school to be sterilized upon the approval of the school Principal. At least 3,500 Indian women are sterilized under this law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadiangenocide.nativeweb.org/intro2.html|title=Hidden from History: The Canadian Holocaust - Chronology of Events|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, research into extant archival records of sterilization and direct killing of [[First Nations]] youth (through intentional transmission of disease and other means) under the residential school program is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ottawa, churches playing hardball over residential school historical documents, TRC charges |url= http://aptn.ca/pages/news/2011/11/22/ottawa-churches-playing-hardball-over-residential-school-historical-documents-trc-charges/ |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120114075404/http://aptn.ca/pages/news/2011/11/22/ottawa-churches-playing-hardball-over-residential-school-historical-documents-trc-charges/ |archive-date= 14 January 2012 |publisher= Aboriginal Peoples Television Network |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals were assessed using [[IQ tests]] like the Stanford-Binet. This posed a problem to new [[Canadian immigrants|immigrants]] arriving in Canada, as many had not mastered the English language, and often their scores denoted them as having impaired intellectual functioning. As a result, many of those sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were immigrants who were unfairly categorized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sterilization of Leilani Muir'' (film). Produced by the North West Center, National Film Board of Canada, 1996. Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The province of [[British Columbia]] enacted its own Sexual Sterilization Act in 1933. As in Alberta, the British Columbia Eugenics Board could recommend the sterilization of those it considered to be suffering from "mental disease or mental deficiency".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not enforced by laws as it was in Canada's western provinces, an obscenity trial in Depression-era Ontario, can be seen as an example of the influence of eugenics in Ontario. [[Dorothea Palmer]], a nurse working for the Parents Information Bureau - a privately funded birth control organization based out of [[Kitchener, Ontario]] - was arrested in the predominantly Catholic community of [[Vanier, Ontario|Eastview, Ontario]] in 1936. She was accused of illegally providing birth control materials and knowledge to her clients, primarily poor women. The defense at her trial was mounted by an industrialist and influential eugenicist from Kitchener, A.R. Kaufman. Palmer was acquitted in early 1937. The trial lasted less than a year, and later became known as [[The Eastview Birth Control Trial]], demonstrating the influence of the eugenics lobby in Ontario.

The popularity of the eugenics movement peaked during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] when sterilization was widely seen as a way of relieving society of the financial burdens imposed by defective individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|pp=117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eugenics excesses of [[Nazi Germany]] diminished the popularity of the eugenics movement, the Sexual Sterilization Acts of Alberta and British Columbia were not repealed until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] was well known for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a "pure" [[Aryan race]] through a series of programs that ran under the banner of [[racial hygiene]]. Among other activities, the Nazis performed extensive experimentation on live human beings to test their genetic theories, ranging from simple measurement of physical characteristics to the research for [[Otmar von Verschuer]] carried out by [[Karin Magnussen]] using "human material" gathered by [[Josef Mengele]] on twins and others at [[Auschwitz]] death camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miklós Nyiszli]], "Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account", Arcade Publishing, New York, 1960, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi regime used [[forced sterilization]] on hundreds of thousands of people whom they viewed as mentally ill, an estimated 400,000 between 1934 and 1937. The scale of the Nazi program prompted one American eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of their program, with one complaining that "the Germans are beating us at our own game."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal |author=Selgelid, Michael J. |title=Neugenics? |journal=Monash Bioethics Review |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=9–33 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/bf03351241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis went further, however, murdering tens of thousands of the institutionalized disabled through compulsory "[[euthanasia]]" programs such as [[Aktion T4]]. They used [[gas chamber]]s and lethal injections to murder their victims.&lt;ref&gt;The Nazi eugenics policies are discussed in a number of sources. A few of the more definitive ones are Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]], 1988) and Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, DC: [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], 2004) ([http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/deadlymedicine/ online exhibit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026014306/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/deadlymedicine/ |date=2012-10-26 }}). On the development of the [[racial hygiene]] movement before National Socialism, see Paul Weindling, ''Health, race and German politics between national unification and Nazism, 1870–1945'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

They also implemented a number of "positive" eugenics policies, giving awards to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] women who had large numbers of children and encouraged a service in which "racially pure" single women could deliver illegitimate children. Allegations that such women were also impregnated by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers in the ''[[Lebensborn]]'' were not proven at the Nuremberg trials, but new evidence (and the testimony of Lebensborn children) has established more details about Lebensborn practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article626101.ece |title='Himmler was my godfather' |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "racially valuable" children from occupied countries were forcibly removed from their parents and adopted by German people. Many of their concerns for eugenics and racial hygiene were also explicitly present in their systematic killing of millions of "undesirable" people, especially [[Jew]]s who were singled out for the [[Final Solution]], this policy led to the horrors seen in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269548/Holocaust "Holocaust", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2009]: "the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women, and children and millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II ... The Nazis also singled out the Roma (Gypsies). They were the only other group that the Nazis systematically killed in gas chambers alongside the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope and coercion involved in the German eugenics programs along with a strong use of the rhetoric of eugenics and so-called "racial science" throughout the regime created an indelible cultural association between eugenics and the [[Third Reich]] in the post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;See Proctor, ''Racial hygiene'', and Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scholars, [[John Glad]] and [[Seymour W. Itzkoff]] of [[Smith College]], have questioned the relation between eugenics and the Holocaust. They argue that, contrary to popular belief, Hitler did not regard the Jews as intellectually inferior and did not send them to the concentration camps on these grounds. They argue that Hitler had different reasons for his genocidal policies toward the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/archives/vol4no1/rl-black.html TOQ-Richard Lynn-Black BR-Vol 4 No 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Itzkoff writes that the Holocaust was "a vast dysgenic program to rid Europe of highly intelligent challengers to the existing Christian domination by a numerically and politically minuscule minority". Therefore, according to Itzkoff, "the Holocaust was the very antithesis of eugenic practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| quote = I would like to add a comment to Dr. Glad's clear and decisive puncturing of the balloon of myths surrounding the Nazi perversion of eugenics. (For that matter, they also claimed to be a party of socialism!) If we define eugenics as encompassing programs of human betterment, physical as well as mental, practices that benefit community in the local sense as well as the species in general, we can say that the Holocaust was the antithesis of eugenic practice.

The ideas of eugenics and race were used, in part, as justification for German colonial expansion throughout the world. Germany, as well as Great Britain, sought to seize the colonial territories of other 'dying' empires which could no longer protect their possessions. Examples included China, the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Empire and the Danish Empire.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the colonies Germany required for her bursting population, as markets for her overproductive industries and sources of vital raw materials, and as symbols of her world power would simply have to be taken from weaker nations, so the pan-Germans asserted publicly and the German government believed secretly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, "The Samoan Tangle: A Study in Anglo-German-American Relations, 1878-1900", Harper &amp; Row, 1974, pp. 124-125, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Granted that the book was used to strengthen Britain's position vis-a-vis Germany, it must however be borne in mind that the bulk of the evidence contained in the 'Blue Book' is little more than the literal translation of German texts published at the time which were the findings of a German commission of inquiry into the effects of corporal punishment." Thus, when the Blue Book was withdrawn from the public after Germany and England came to an agreement about how to share access to GSWA minerals, this was not censorship; it was just business.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

German colonies in Africa from 1885 to 1918 included [[German South-West Africa]] (present-day [[Namibia]]), [[Kamerun]] (present-day [[Cameroon]]), [[Togoland]] (present-day [[Togo]]) and [[German East Africa]] (present-day [[Tanzania]]. [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). [[Genocide]] was carried out there, against the [[Herero people|Herero]] people of present-day Namibia and later a programme of research in physical anthropology was conducted using their skulls.

The rulers of German South West Africa carried out a programme of genocide against the aboriginal Herero people. One of the officials enacting this program was [[Heinrich Ernst Göring]] (the father of [[Hermann Göring]]), as well as General [[Adrian Dietrich Lothar von Trotha]].

The 1918 British "Bluebook" documented the genocide that took place at [[Shark Island Concentration Camp|Shark Island]] and [[Windhoek Concentration Camp]]s, including photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |title=Herero and Namaqua Genocide - Herero Genocide Nama Genocide |publisher=Ezakwantu.com |date=1905-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209033514/http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bluebook was used as a negotiating tool by the British at the end of World War I to gain control of what had been German Southwest Africa, after Germany was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;"Words Cannot Be Found: German Colonial Rule in Namibia : An Annotated Reprint of the 1918 Blue Book", Brill Academic Pub., June 1, 2003. {{ISBN|90-04-12981-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skulls of the Herero were collected from Rehoboth, Namibia in about 1904, for the purpose of demonstrating the supposed physical inferiority of these people. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute used the Herero skulls by 1928.&lt;ref&gt;(See citations and photographs at [[Eugen Fischer#Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics|Eugen Fischer]] and [[Shark Island Extermination Camp#Medical experimentation|Shark Island Extermination Camp]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical anthropologists used measurements of skull capacity, etc., in an attempt to prove that Jews, Blacks and Italians were inherently "inferior" to Whites. Examples of such activity were found from about 1928 at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]]. This contrasted with a lot of 19th century German anthropology which was generally more cosmopolitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=H.

Rita Hauschild, a doctoral student and then staff member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Human Heredity, Anthropology, and Eugenics, carried out "[[bastard studies]]", anthropometric studies of mixed-heritage populations in [[Trinidad]] and [[Venezuela]], in pursuit of the Nazi doctrine of "racial hygiene". Her research was at first confined to [[Colonia Tovar|Tovar]], Venezuela, a former German colony, and was extended to Trinidad with support from the UK Foreign Office. The populations studied, in 1935 to 1937, were "Chinese-Negro hybrids" in Trinidad, "Chinese-Indian" and "Chinese-Negro" "hybrids" in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmuhl|first=Hans-Walter|title=The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, 1927—1945|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Houten, Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-6600-9|page=171 and n.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Johannes Schaeuble engaged in "bastard studies" in Chile.

{{Main article|Eugenics in Japan}}

In the early part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments executed a eugenics policy to limit the birth of children with "inferior" traits, as well as aiming to protect the life and health of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;"The National Eugenic Law" The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第一条　本法ハ悪質ナル遺伝性疾患ノ素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ防遏スルト共ニ健全ナル素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ図リ以テ国民素質ノ向上ヲ期スルコトヲ目的トス, Kimura, Jurisprudence in Genetics, [http://www.bioethics.jp/licht_genetics.html Bioethics.jp]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Race Eugenic Protection Law'' was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Diet. After four amendments, this draft was promulgated as the ''National Eugenic Law''  in 1940 by the [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe]] government.&lt;ref&gt;"The Eugenic Protection Law" (国民優生法)The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第二条　本法ニ於テ優生手術ト称スルハ生殖ヲ不能ナラシムル手術又ハ処置ニシテ命令ヲ以テ定ムルモノヲ謂フ, [http://www.res.otemon.ac.jp/~yamamoto/be/BE_law_04.htm Otemon.ac.jp] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Eugenic Protection Law'' (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals "with genetic predisposition to commit crime", patients with genetic diseases such as total color-blindness, [[hemophilia]], [[albinism]] and [[ichthyosis]], and mental affections such as [[schizophrenia]], and manic-depressiveness, and those with [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |title=SOSHIREN / 資料・法律−優生保護法 |publisher=Soshiren.org |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental illnesses were added in 1952.

The ''Leprosy Prevention laws'' of 1907, 1931 and 1953, the last one only repealed in 1996, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common, even if the laws did not refer to it, and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace", as most Japanese leprologists believed that vulnerability to the disease was inheritable.&lt;ref&gt;Michio Miyasaka, ''A Historical and Ethical Analysis of Leprosy Control Policy in Japan'', [http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html clg.niigata-u.ac.jp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060946/http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |date=2011-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a few Japanese leprologists such as Noburo Ogasawara who argued against the "isolation-sterilization policy" but he was denounced as a traitor to the nation at the 15th conference of the Japanese Association of Leprology in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |title=Michio Miyasaka |publisher=Clg.niigata-u.ac.jp |accessdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060946/http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |archivedate=2011-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last eugenic measures of the Shōwa regime was taken by the [[Naruhiko Higashikuni|Higashikuni]] government. On 19 August 1945, the Home Ministry ordered local government offices to establish a [[prostitution]] service for allied soldiers to preserve the "purity" of the "Japanese race". The official declaration stated: "Through the sacrifice of thousands of "Okichis" of the [[Shōwa era]], we shall construct a [[wikt:dike|dike]] to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 538, citing Kinkabara Samon and Takemae Eiji, ''Showashi : kokumin non naka no haran to gekido no hanseiki-zohoban'', 1989, p.244.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Pure blood theory in Korea}}

Early in the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese administration of Korea]], staff at the Japanese Association of Leprology attempted to discourage marriage between Japanese women and Korean men who had been recruited from the peninsula as laborers following its annexation by Japan in 1910. In 1942, a survey report argued that "the Korean laborers brought to Japan... are of the lower classes and therefore of inferior constitution...By fathering children with Japanese women, these men could lower the caliber of the [[Yamato people|Yamato minzoku]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson  |first=Jennifer |date=2002 |title=Blood talks: Eugenic modernity and the creation of new Japanese |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0275720022000025547?journalCode=ghan20#.VxbUwWNWJg0|journal=History and Anthropology |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=191–216 |doi= |access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eugenics pioneer Unno Kōtoku of [[Ryukyu University]] influentially argued based on [[heterosis]] in plants that exclusive Japanese [[endogamy]] might cause "degeneration" of the Japanese race. Since he regarded intermarriage with white or black people as "disastrous", he advocated intermarriage with [[Koreans|Korean]]s, whose "inferior" physical characteristics would be subsumed by the "superior" Japanese, according to his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=An Island Nation of Pure Blood|title=A Genealogy of 'Japanese' Self-Images|first=Eiji|last=Oguma|authorlink1=Eiji Oguma|publisher=Trans Pacific Press|year=2002|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese-Korean intermarriage was promoted by the government in Korea using [[serological]] studies that claimed to prove that Japanese and Koreans had the same pure ancestral origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Struggle for National Survival: Eugenics in the Second Sino-Japanese War and Population Policies|first=Juliette|last=Chung|title=Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Jensen|editor2-first=Jon|editor2-last=Davidann|editor3-first=Yoneyuki|editor3-last=Sugita|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2003|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Eugenics was one of many ideas and programs debated in the 1920s and 1930s in [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republican China]], as a means of improving society and raising China's stature in the world.  The principal Chinese proponent of eugenics was the prominent sociologist [[Pan Guangdan]], and a significant number of intellectuals entered into the debate, including [[Gao Xisheng]], biologist [[Zhou Jianren]], sociologist [[Chen Da (sociologist)|Chen Da]], and [[Chen Jianshan]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dikotter|first=Frank|title=Imperfect Conceptions: Medical Knowledge, Birth Defects, and Eugenics in China|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dikotter|first=Frank|title=The Disourse of race in modern China|year=1992|publisher=C. Hurst, Stanford University Press, Hong Kong University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen Da is notable for the link he provides to the [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China#Census|family planning policy]] and [[One Child Policy]] enacted in China after the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]].

The [[Beijing Genomics Institute]] does whole genome sequencing of very high IQ individuals around the world.  [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] claims that the Chinese may use this genetic data to increase the IQ of each subsequent generation by five to fifteen IQ points through the use of preimplantation embryo selection.&lt;ref name="edge.org"&gt;Edge, What should we be worried about. http://edge.org/response-detail/23838/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
{{main article|Population control in Singapore}}

[[Singapore]] practiced a limited form of eugenics that involved discouraging marriage between [[university]] graduates and nongraduates through segregation in matchmaking agencies, in the hope that the former would produce better children; and paid incentives for the uneducated to undergo sterilisation, among other procedures. The government introduced the "Graduate Mother Scheme" in the early 1980s to entice graduate women with incentives to get married, which was eventually scrapped due to public criticism and the implications it had on [[meritocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;See Diane K. Mauzy, Robert Stephen Milne, ''Singapore politics under the People's Action Party'' (Routledge, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Other countries that adopted some form of eugenics program at one time include [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Switzerland]] with programs to sterilize people the government declared to be mentally deficient.&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of works discussing eugenics in various countries around the world. For the history of eugenics in Scandinavia, see [[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005). Another international approach is Mark B. Adams, ed., ''The Wellborn Science: Eugenics in Germany, France, Brazil, and Russia'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marginalization after World War II===
[[File:Eugenics Quarterly to Social Biology.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In the decades after [[World War II]], eugenics became increasingly unpopular within academic science. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy, as when ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969.]]

Beginning in the late 1920s, greater appreciation of the difficulty of predicting characteristics of offspring from their heredity, and scientists' recognition of the inadequacy of simplistic theories of eugenics, undermined whatever scientific basis had been ascribed to the social movement. As the Great Depression took hold, criticism of economic value as a proxy for human worth became increasingly compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = CSHL Press | isbn = 9780879695873 | last = Carlson | first = Elof Axel | pages = 337–356 | title = The Unfit: A History of a Bad Idea | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the experience of Nazi Germany, many ideas about "racial hygiene" and "unfit" members of society were discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Harvard University Press | isbn = 9780674445574 | last = Kevles | first = Daniel J.  | title = In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nuremberg Trials]] against former Nazi leaders revealed to the world many of the regime's genocidal practices and resulted in formalized policies of medical ethics and the 1950 [[UNESCO]] statement on race. Many scientific societies released their own similar "race statements" over the years, and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], developed in response to abuses during the Second World War, was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 and affirmed, "Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm | title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights | accessdate=2006-08-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060824210743/http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm  |archivedate = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuation, the 1978 [[UNESCO]] declaration on race and racial prejudice states that the fundamental equality of all human beings is the ideal toward which ethics and science should converge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_prejud.htm | title=Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice | accessdate=2006-08-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124402/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_prejud.htm  |archivedate = 2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to Nazi abuses, eugenics became almost universally reviled in many of the nations where it had once been popular (however, some eugenics programs, including sterilization, continued quietly for decades). Many pre-war eugenicists engaged in what they later labeled "crypto-eugenics", purposefully taking their eugenic beliefs "underground" and becoming respected anthropologists, biologists and geneticists in the postwar world (including [[Robert Yerkes]] in the U.S. and [[Otmar von Verschuer]] in Germany).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Californian eugenicist [[Paul Popenoe]] founded [[marriage counseling]] during the 1950s, a career change which grew from his eugenic interests in promoting "healthy marriages" between "fit" couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkan|1992}} discusses the general changes in views towards genetics and race after World War II&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The reference is incomplete and unclear.|date=May 2016}}

The [[American Life League]], an opponent of abortion, charges that eugenics was merely "re-packaged" after the war, and promoted anew in the guise of the population-control and environmentalism movements. They claim, for example, that [[Planned Parenthood]] was funded and cultivated by the Eugenics Society for these reasons. [[Julian Huxley]], the first Director-General of [[UNESCO]] and a founder of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], was also a Eugenics Society president and a strong supporter of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;American Bioethics Advisory Commission, [http://www.all.org/abac/eugen02.htm "Eugenics"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517043304/http://www.all.org/abac/eugen02.htm |date=May 17, 2013 }}, ABAC website&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]ven though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable. --Julian Huxley&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO: Its Purpose and its Philosophy'' (Washington D.C. 1947), cited in Liagin, Excessive Force: Power Politics and Population Control, at 85 (Washington, D.C.: Information Project for Africa 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

High school and college textbooks from the 1920s through the 1940s often had chapters touting the scientific progress to be had from applying eugenic principles to the population. Many early scientific journals devoted to heredity in general were run by eugenicists and featured eugenics articles alongside studies of heredity in nonhuman organisms.  Even the names of some journals changed to reflect new attitudes. For example, ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969 (the journal still exists today, though it looks little like its predecessor). Notable members of the [[American Eugenics Society]] (1922–94) during the second half of the 20th century included [[Joseph Fletcher]], originator of [[Situational ethics]]; [[Clarence Gamble]] of the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] fortune; and [[Garrett Hardin]], a [[population control]] advocate and author of the essay ''[[Tragedy of the Commons|The Tragedy of the Commons]]''.

In the United States, the eugenics movement had largely lost most popular and political support by the end of the 1930s, while forced sterilizations mostly ended in the 1960s with the last performed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;See Broberg and Nil-Hansen, ed., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State'' and Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Many US states continued to prohibit biracial marriages with "anti-miscegenation laws" such as Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924, until they were overruled by the Supreme Court in 1967 in [[Loving v. Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay_7_fs.html |title=Essay 7: Marriage Laws |publisher=Eugenicsarchive.org |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Restriction Act]] of 1924, which was designed to limit the immigration of "dysgenic" Italians, and eastern European Jews, was repealed and replaced by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay_9_fs.html |title=Essay 9: Immigration Restriction |publisher=Eugenicsarchive.org |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some prominent academics continued to support eugenics after the war. In 1963 the [[Ciba Foundation]] convened a conference in London under the title "Man and His Future", at which three distinguished biologists and Nobel laureates ([[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]], [[Joshua Lederberg]], and [[Francis Crick]]) all spoke strongly in favor of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;John Glad: "Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century", Hermitage Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; A few nations, notably  the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], maintained large-scale eugenics programs, including forced sterilization of mentally handicapped individuals, as well as other practices, until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Emily |title=Regulating Reproduction|publisher=Hart|location=Oxford, England|date=October 2001|page=45|isbn=1-84113-054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation==
Beginning in the 1880s, the history and concept of eugenics were widely discussed as knowledge about [[genetics]] advanced significantly, making practical [[genetic engineering]], which has been widely used to produce [[genetically modified organism]]s, with [[genetically modified food]]s being most visible to the general public. Endeavors such as the [[Human Genome Project]] made the effective modification of the human species seem possible again (as did Darwin's initial theory of evolution in the 1860s, along with the rediscovery of [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's laws]] in the early 20th century).  Article 23 of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] prohibits compulsory sterilization of disabled individuals and guarantees their right to adopt children.

A few scientific researchers such as psychologist [[Richard Lynn]], psychologist [[Raymond Cattell]], and scientist [[Gregory Stock]] have openly called for eugenic policies using modern technology, but they represent a minority opinion in current scientific and cultural circles.&lt;ref&gt;See, i.e., [[Richard Lynn]], ''Eugenics: A Reassessment (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)'' (Praeger Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; One attempted implementation of a form of eugenics was a "[[Repository for Germinal Choice|genius sperm bank]]" (1980–99) created by [[Robert Klark Graham]], from which nearly 230 children were conceived (the best-known donors were [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[William Shockley]] and [[James D. Watson|J. D. Watson]]). After Graham died in 1997 funding ran out, and within two years his sperm bank had closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellows|first=Alan|title=Eugenics and You|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/eugenics-and-you/|work=Damn Interesting|publisher=Alan Bellows|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Bell Curve]]'' argued that immigration from countries with low [[national IQ]] is undesirable. According to [[Raymond Cattell]], "when a country is opening its doors to immigration from diverse countries, it is like a farmer who buys his seeds from different sources by the sack, with sacks of different average quality of contents".&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1987). Beyondism: Religion from science. New York: Praeger, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
A screening policy (including prenatal screening and abortion) intended to reduce the incidence of [[thalassemia]] exists in both jurisdictions on the island of [[Cyprus]]. Since the program's implementation in the 1970s, it has reduced the ratio of children born with the hereditary blood disease from 1 out of every 158 births to almost zero. Tests for the gene are compulsory for both partners, prior to church wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ioannou|first=Panayiotis|title=The ethics of genetic screening|editor=Chadwick, Ruth F|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Den Haag, Netherlands|year=1999|pages=61–67|isbn=978-0-7923-5614-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=Ruth Schwartz|title=Heredity and Hope|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2008|pages=208–216|isbn=978-0-674-02424-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Eugenic concerns have been prominent in China for some time, with the PRC's 1950 Marriage Law stating that "impotence, venereal disease, mental disorder and leprosy", as well as any other diseases seen by medical science as making a person unfit to marry, were grounds for prohibition from marriage. The 1980 law dropped all specific conditions bar leprosy, and the 2001 law now specifies no conditions, simply approval by a medical doctor.&lt;ref name="ssm"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3dGGnbVKIYC&amp;pg=PA70|pages=70–1|isbn=0-415-37632-7|title=Sex, Science and Morality in China|author=Joanna McMillan|publisher=Routledge|date=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various provinces began to pass laws barring certain classes of people, such as the mentally retarded, from reproducing in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="ssm"/&gt; The Chinese Maternal and Infant Health Care Law (1994), which has been referred to as the "Eugenic Law" in the West, required a health check prior to marriage. Carriers of certain genetic diseases were allowed to marry only if they are sterilized, or agree to use some other form of long-term contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bobrow M |title=Redrafted Chinese law remains eugenic |journal=J. Med. Genet. |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=409 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7666390 |pmc=1050477 |url=http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7666390 |doi=10.1136/jmg.32.6.409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the requirement for the health check has been dropped at the national level, it continues to be required by some provinces. Local medical doctors make the decision on who is "unfit" to marry.&lt;ref name="ssm"/&gt; Much Western comment on the law has been critical, but many Chinese geneticists are supportive of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mao X |title=Chinese eugenic legislation |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9045 |pages=139 |date=January 1997 |pmid=8996454 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)60930-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(05)60930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese province of [[Sichuan]] in 1999, a sperm bank called Notables' Sperm Bank opened, with professors as the only permitted donors. The semen bank was approved by the authority for family planning in the provincial capital [[Chengdu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua|Xinhua News Agency]]: [http://www.people.com.cn/english/199906/25/chnmedia.html ''China's 1st Notables' Sperm Bank Opens.''] 24. June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In postwar Japan, the {{nihongo|'''Eugenic Protection Law'''|[[:ja:優生保護法]]|Yusei Hogo Hō}} was enacted in 1948 to replace the National Eugenic Law of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''Postwar Japan as History'', pp.306&lt;/ref&gt; The main provisions allowed for the surgical sterilization of women, when the woman, her spouse, or family member within the 4th degree of kinship had a serious [[genetic disorder]], and where pregnancy would endanger the life of the woman. The operation required consent of the woman, her spouse and the approval of the Prefectural Eugenic Protection Council.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto pp.167"&gt;Sugimoto, An Introduction to Japanese Society, pp.167&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also allowed for abortion for pregnancies in the cases of [[rape]], leprosy, hereditary-transmitted disease, or if the physician determined that the fetus would not be viable outside of the womb. Again, the consent of the woman and her spouse were necessary. [[Birth control]] guidance and implementation was restricted to doctors, nurses and professional [[midwife|midwive]]s accredited by the Prefectural government. The law was also amended in May 1949 to allow abortions for economic reasons at the sole discretion of the doctor, which in effect fully legalized abortion in Japan.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto pp.167"/&gt;

Although the law's wording is unambiguous, the it was used by local authorities as justification for measures enforcing [[compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]] and abortions upon people with certain [[genetic disorder]]s, as well as [[leprosy]], as well as an excuse for legalized discrimination against people with physical and mental handicaps.&lt;ref name=formerhansen&gt;{{cite web

===Russia===
In Russia, one supporter of preventive eugenics is the president of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] [[Yuri Savenko]], who justifies [[forced sterilization]] of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes. He states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.”&lt;ref name="Лишённые"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Лишённые наследства.

===Israel===
{{Main article|Dor Yeshorim|Medical genetics of Jewish people}}

Dor Yeshorim, a program which seeks to reduce the incidence of [[Tay-Sachs disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan disease]], [[Fanconi anemia]], [[familial dysautonomia]], [[glycogen storage disease]], [[Bloom's Syndrome]], [[Gaucher disease]], [[Niemann-Pick disease]], and [[mucolipidosis IV]] among certain [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish communities]], is another screening program which has drawn comparisons with [[liberal eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shidduchim.info/medical.html |title=Shidduchim.info |publisher=Shidduchim.info |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]], at the expense of the state, the general public is advised to carry out genetic tests to diagnose these diseases early in the pregnancy. If a fetus is diagnosed with one of these diseases, among which Tay-Sachs is the most commonly known, the pregnancy may be terminated, subject to consent.

Most other [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish communities also run screening programs because of the higher incidence of genetic diseases. In some Jewish communities, the ancient custom of matchmaking (shidduch) is still practiced, and some matchmakers require blood tests so that they can avoid making matches between individuals who share the same recessive disease traits. In order to attempt to prevent the tragedy of infant death which always results from being [[homozygous]] for Tay-Sachs, associations such as the strongly observant Dor Yeshorim (which was founded by Rabbi Joseph Ekstein, who lost four children to the disease) with the purpose of preventing others from suffering the same tragedy test young couples to check whether they carry a risk of passing on fatal conditions.

If both the young man and woman are Tay-Sachs carriers, it is common for the match to be broken off. Judaism,{{dubious|date=October 2011}} like numerous other religions, discourages abortion unless there is a risk to the woman, in which case her needs take precedence. The effort is not aimed at eradicating the hereditary traits, but rather at the occurrence of homozygosity. The actual impact of this program on [[allele]] frequencies is unknown, but little impact would be expected because the program does not impose genetic selection. Instead, it encourages [[disassortative mating]].

===Ethical re-assessment===
Modern inquiries into the potential use of genetic engineering have led to an increased invocation of the history of eugenics in discussions of [[bioethics]], most often as a cautionary tale. Some suggest that even non-coercive eugenics programs would be inherently unethical.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Bill McKibben]], ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'' (Owl, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged by such [[bioethics|bioethicist]] critics as [[Nicholas Agar]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Nicholas Agar]], ''Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement'' (Blackwell, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern bioethics literature, the history of eugenics presents many moral and ethical questions. Supporters of eugenics programs note that [[Francis Galton]] did not advocate coercion when he defined the principles of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Allen |author2=Dan W. Brock |author3=Norman Daniels |author4=Daniel Wikler |title=From Chance to Choice|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|chapter=Violations of reproductive freedoms|isbn=0-521-66977-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galton's definition, eugenics is the proper label for bioengineering of better human beings, whether coercive or not.

[[Daniel Kevles]] argues that eugenics and the conservation of natural resources are similar propositions. Both can be practiced foolishly so as to abuse individual rights, but both can be practiced wisely. [[James D. Watson]], the first director of the [[Human Genome Project]], initiated the ''Ethical, Legal and Social Implications Program'' (ELSI) which has funded a number of studies into the implications of human genetic engineering (along with a prominent website on the history of eugenics), because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In putting ethics so soon into the genome agenda, I was responding to my own personal fear that all too soon critics of the Genome Project would point out that I was a representative of the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] that once housed the controversial [[Eugenics Record Office]]. My not forming a genome ethics program quickly might be falsely used as evidence that I was a closet eugenicist, having as my real long-term purpose the unambiguous identification of genes that lead to social and occupational stratification as well as genes justifying racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=James D. |authorlink=James D.

Which ideas should be described as "eugenic" are still controversial in both public and scholarly spheres. Some observers such as [[Philip Kitcher]] have described the use of genetic screening by parents as making possible a form of "voluntary" eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kitcher |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Kitcher |title=The Lives to Come |publisher=Penguin |year=1997 |isbn=0-14-024490-5 }}.

In 2006, [[Richard Dawkins]] stated that breeding humans for traits is possible and society should not be afraid to debate the ethical differences between breeding a child for an ability versus forcing a child to gain an ability through training.&lt;ref&gt;From the Afterward, by Richard Dawkins, The Herald, (2006). http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 Retrieved on Oct 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel C.

Comfort claims that the question is not whether this eugenic impulse should exist or even whether the modern genetic movement should be called eugenics because these things "just are". Additionally, Dr Nathaniel Comfort claims, "the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic biomedicine are too great for us to do otherwise." &lt;ref&gt;The Eugenics Impulse, The Chronicle Review, By Nathaniel Comfort. 12 November 2012. http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/ Retrieved on 9. September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Bio-ethicist Stephen Wilkinson of [[Keele University]] and Honorary Research Fellow Eve Garrard at the [[University of Manchester]], claim that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral. In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that "[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|PGD]], and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they’re wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction, Stephen and Eve Garrard, published by Keele University 2013. http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf Retrieved on September 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] claims that 21st century Chinese eugenics may allow the Chinese to increase the IQ of each subsequent generation by five to fifteen IQ points, and after a couple generations it "would be game over for Western global competitiveness." Miller recommends that we put aside our "self-righteous" Euro-American ideological biases and learn from the Chinese.&lt;ref name="edge.org"/&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] claims that new eugenics is not something that should be restricted lightly because it is driven by a motivation for ourselves and our children to be "healthy, intelligent, and fit," and it is not driven by "draconian top-down measures" or a "desire to improve the species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462.html|title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the "New Eugenics"|first1=Jon Entine Exec|last1=Director|first2=Genetic Literacy Project; Senior|last2=Fellow|first3=Institute for|last3=Food|first4=Agricultural|last4=Literacy|first5=University of|last5=California-Davis|date=30 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Identity control theory''' is a [[theory]] in [[sociology]] concerned with the development&lt;!-- "development" in this context should probably have an appropriate wikilink --&gt; of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of social psychology|chapter=Self and Identity|editor=John D. DeLamater|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn= 978-0-306-47695-2|author=Timothy J. Owens|pages=214&amp;ndash;216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Peter Burke, it focuses on the nature of peoples' identities and the relationship between their identities and their behavior within the realm of their social structure. The identities of the individual are rooted in their social structure. Identity Control Theory was created based on traditional symbolic interaction views where people choose their own behaviors and how their behaviors correspond to the meanings of their identity. One of the main aspects ICT deals with is how individuals view their own identities and respond to the reactions to their identities of those around them. When an individual is acting according to the identity control theory they reflect on the identity they display and how others approve or disapprove of their identity. If the individual does not like the responses of others they will look at how they can change their views of their identity or their identity towards themselves to produce a positive outcome. One of the main benefits of this theory is how negative feelings can be prevented by individuals and by those around them. The people around someone who is displaying a certain identity have the ability to be more sensitive and prevent negative feelings if they understand identity control theory because they know what will bring out a negative response. On the other hand, the individual can prevent negative feelings that coincide with the teachings of identity control theory if they understand these teachings and can apply them to their own lives.

==Identity Control Theory Components==
There are four main components of the identity control theory being '''identity standard''', '''input''', '''comparator''', and '''output'''. Each identity is viewed as a control system with these four components (Burke, 2007).

'''Identity standard''' is the first of the four components of identity control theory. Identity standard defines what it means to be who one is in a situation. The identity standard stores the self-meanings tied to social roles and membership in groups. This is the set of meanings for a given identity. The meanings in identity standard represent the goals or the way the situation is supposed to be. People act to verify or confirm their identities and in doing so they bring about a situation in which relevant meanings are consistent with their identity standard.

The next of the four components is '''input''' or also known as perceptions. Input is the meanings of how one sees oneself in a situation. These self-meanings often are derived from the way in which others see the self. This results from the feedback others have about how we come across in a given situation.

The third component of the identity control theory is '''comparator'''. The comparator compares the meanings from the input with those from the standard and registers the difference between them. This compares the perceived meanings with the meanings in the identity standard.

The final component of the theory is '''output''' or sometimes called an error or discrepancy. Output is the differences that result from the perceptions and the identity standard. Then as a function of the output, there is meaningful behavior enacted in the situation that conveys meanings about our identity. If in a setting people perceive their identity relevant meanings to be congruent with the meanings in their identity standard, that is the discrepancy is zero, people continue to do what they have been doing. If the discrepancy is not zero, people change their behavior in such a way as to counteract the disturbance and reduce the discrepancy back toward zero (Burke, 2007). These altered meanings are perceived and again compared to the meanings in the identity standard. Thus, each identity is a control system that acts to control perceptions by bringing them into congruency with the meanings of their identity standards, thus reducing toward zero any discrepancy or error caused by a disturbance(Burke,2007).

People act to verify or confirm their identities and in doing so they bring about a situation in which perceived meanings are consistent with their identity standard. If the identity is a role identity, then the behavior that brings about the changes in the situational meanings to make them consistent with the identity standard is appropriate role behavior.  If the identity is a group or category based identity, the behavior which verifies the identity is the behavior that maintains group boundaries and divisions in the social structure. By verifying identities, people create and maintain the social structure in which the identities are embedded(Burke,2007).

==Identity Control and Emotions==

As one might guess, the identity control theory has a direct correlation to an individual's emotions. This mainly stems from whether or not the person's identity is fully recognized by those around them. If they are fully recognized or recognized greatly positive emotions will be produced. On the reverse side a small amount of recognition, or a lack of recognition will produce negative emotions like anger and depression.

===Positive Emotions===

When people surrounding an individual are able to correctly notice the personal identity that the individual is attempting to convey the self-esteem of the individual is increased. Their disposition also becomes filled with positive emotions. Another thing that will increase positive emotions is if the people closest to the individual reassure the individual of their identity. This reassurance allows the individual to feel secure in their actions and be able to further predict the responses of others. These feelings of security allow the individual to express themselves in the manner they wish. This is why the positive emotions become so prominent for the individuals who experience this. The only other part of identity control theory that increases positive emotions is if an individuals identity matches their perceptions of their identity. This creates harmony for the individual and allows them to be happier than if their perceptions did not match the actual outcome of their identities.

===Negative Emotions===
[[File:Self-Discrepancy Theory2.jpg|thumb|Self-Discrepancy model explaining the outcome of actual:ideal and actual:ought discrepancies experienced by restrained eaters]]

With the identity control theory, there is more opportunity for negative emotions than positive emotions. This is because there are many more opportunities for people to misunderstand what identity an individual is attempting to display. In fact, there are four main ways a person's identity can be misinterpreted that will produce emotions of anger and other negative aspects. These four are a discrepancy between the output and the input, a lack of attention to the identity trying to be displayed, too much control over the specific identity, and a lack of practice with the identity.

'''Input vs Output''': When an individual's identity is not received by others as the individual intended, then the possibility for negative emotions increases. Often those around the individual place a different meaning on the identity than the person intended there to be. This causes great frustration for the individual and can often lead to anger as well. Another part of this discrepancy is if those around the individual completely ignore the identity the individual is hoping to display. The complete unrecognition will produce even more frustration and anger than an incorrect view of the identity.

'''Lack of Attention''': If an individual does not focus enough attention on the identity they wish to portray it will not be received fully either. This usually happens because all of their attention is normally focused on another aspect of their identity and all other facets are neglected. These neglected aspects are not displayed well by the individual, so they are not received by others as the individual hoped. This is a sure way for the individual to become down upon themselves or even extremely angry with themselves for not developing that aspect of their identities and being misunderstood.

'''Too Much Control''': When someone tries to control a certain aspect of their identity too much, they will most likely find themselves experiencing very negative feelings. This is because all the aspects of their personality are closely related because they are controlled so much. Therefore, if one aspect of their personality is not received as they had hoped, all other aspects of their personality will not be unverified. This has the potential to cause a complete identity crisis because no part of the person's identity will be reassured. This can cause the individual to panic and become filled with nervousness.
 
'''Lack of Practice''': If an individual does not practice the identity they wish to convey enough, not only will they be unsure of it, those around them will be unsure of how to respond to the individual. In fact, those around the individual will most likely show great disapproval of the individual. If that does not happen, though, they will receive very irregular responses from those around them. Disapproval can severely drop the persons self-esteem or push the individual to be hostile with those around them due to their reactions. On the other hand, irregular responses can cause the individual to become frustrated with their outcome which can lead to a great deal of anger if it is repeated many times.

One final thing to remember about all emotions that can be created through the identity control theory is the degree of closeness those evaluating the identity are to the individual. If the people around the individual are very close to the individual and they assure their identity, the individual will most likely experience extreme positive emotions. However, if they criticize the identity, the individual will experience extreme negative emotions. The opposite of this, meaning that those evaluating the identity are not extremely close to the individual, the individual's emotions will not become very extreme at all. This is because the opinions of the people close to an individual hold more weight in the individual's mind than the opinions of the people they are not close to.

==Coping Responses==
Coping responses are the product of a person processing external or internal demands that can drain a person’s mental or physical resources (Foulton, 1982).  External demands could be need for warmth, chores around the house or job, and cleanliness. Internal demands could be hunger, happiness, and control over environment. There are two parts to coping responses: first is the process of coping responses and second is the relationship between the person and outside forces.

=== The Process ===
The process can be separated into two parts. The first is summarized by what is currently happening. This includes the person's thoughts, feelings, and actions to reduce different demands (Foulton, 1982). Demands can be jobs, chores, relationships with others, and even body functions such as eating and sleeping. With different demands, one person can act in many different ways. For instance, if two people are hungry and are having problems at work, the first person might eat first then try to fix their job situation. The second person could fix their job first and then eat later. Demands are not limited to two things at a time: there can be many demands at the same time. So each person's different actions can affect the future or how things turn out. This is the second part: how current events (what is happening) affect changes in daily life or even the person's environment over time. The environment is not just limited to the outdoors, it is also the relationships with others. Acting in a certain way will bring out a certain change in the person's life, whether in the environment or in their every day life.

=== The Relationship ===
The relationship between the person and outside forces is the second part of coping responses. This relationship can be summarized by how the person views the environment. Again, the environment is not just the outdoor life, it is also the relationships in a person's life with others. A person first evaluates what is at stake in the environment. Beliefs, values, goals, commitments, and physical safety are all at stake (Foulton, 1982). After the stakes have been figured out, the person then must figure out what they can do. This depends on the availability of resources to keep all that is at stake. When the stakes go up, and the resources go down, more coping responses must be used: there is more stress (Foulton, 1982). Coping responses hopefully change the relationship between the person and the environment by changing the situation or the person's feelings about it.

=== The Functions ===
The [[Function (biology)|functions]] of coping responses are to reduce [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]; they help restore an equilibrium (Foulton, 1982). Here are some examples: defense mechanisms help reduce tension; decision-making responses involves seeking and evaluating information; coping responses with illness involves the reduction of harmful environmental conditions and the maintenance of a positive self-image (Foulton, 1982). There are two groups that these responses can be broken down to. One group is problem-focused and the other is emotional-focused (Foulton, 1982). '''Problem-focused''' responses include cognitive strategies and behavioral strategies. A [[cognitive]] strategy would be analyzing the situation. [[Behavioral]] would be figuring out how to act or which actions to use. These responses are more likely to occur when there is more opportunity for personal control (Foulton, 1982). When there is less opportunity for personal control, then emotion focused responses are used. '''Emotion-focused''' responses also include cognitive strategies and behavioral strategies. A [[cognitive]] response is thinking positively or even looking at things from a different perspective. A [[behavioral]] response would be to seek emotional support (Foulton, 1982). Getting a pet or making new friends could also fit in this category. Both problem and emotional influence each other. For instance, if someone is consumed by an emotion, then they might have to get that under control before they can begin to analyze the situation. Or to control an emotion, someone would reason out what was causing the emotion, thus controlling it.

==New Research==

===Identity Control and Social Interaction===

One aspect of new research found with the identity control theory relates to [[social interaction]] and identities. According to social psychologist [[Richard L. Jenkins|Richard Jenkins]], they are vital to each other. The basic principle that Jenkins tries to present is that if social interactions do not exist it is impossible for the main principles of Burke's identity control theory to exist. An individual's identity cannot be approved or disapproved if they do not interact with others. In the reverse direction, if people do not develop their identities enough, it would be impossible for them to interact with those around them fully. Jenkins says that the two go hand in hand and allow the other to function as sociologists have predicted them to. To further understand the relation between social interaction and identity control theory, one must look at the relationships between identity control theory and other sociological ideas. Many other ideas in sociology concern how individuals act in social interactions, which can further the idea of identity control theory. Individuals derive meanings of the majority of the occurrences in their lives through interactions with others. Because of this, it is safe to look at identity control theory and say that as an individual repeats social interactions and receives the same reactions, they can become secure and feel positive emotions regarding their identity. However, if the reactions are inconsistent, the security needed for positive emotions related to their identity is not present. This is because the social interactions confuse the individual instead of allowing them to understand what is occurring around them. Without fully understanding what is going on around them, it would be impossible to fully form and be confident in their identity.

==Connections to Other Sociological Ideas==

===Looking Glass Self===

Looking Glass Self is a sociological term that was introduced by a man named Charles Horton Cooley. This term makes a connection between the reactions of a group and the reactions of an individual. Cooley is saying that a person's opinion of oneself is determined by the opinions of those around them. The group around the person acts as a mirror for them and shows a reflection of how they should view themselves. According to this, if the group thinks an individual is "odd" the individual will view themselves as "odd". This relates to identity control theory in many ways, in fact this idea allowed the identity control theory to be formed. In identity control theory, the individuals feelings arise from the reactions of the group around them. If these two ideas are looked at collectively, an individual would view themselves exactly how the group did and then their feelings would be brought out by whether their current view of self matched their previous view of self. For example, if an individual originally viewed themselves as more of a scholar than an athlete, but the group around them started to view them as an athlete more than an individual their view of themselves would turn to more of an athlete according to looking glass self. But, following identity control theory this individuals input would not match their output which would have the potential to induce negative feelings. This can also be seen in the reverse because if the principle of looking glass self caused the output of an individual to match their input, positive emotions would be brought out. With that being said, the idea of looking glass self has the ability to manipulate the emotional responses of individuals in regards to identity control theory.

===Mead's Mind and Self===

A man named George Herbert Mead furthered the ideas of self that were started by Cooley. Mead used two terms to further the understanding of social interaction. The first of these terms is '''mind'''. Mind, in this sense of the word, is being able to understand symbols that are used in everyday social interactions. Mead states that as an individual's interaction with others is repeated their mind becomes more developed. In other words, as people repeatedly interact with those around them, their ability to understand the symbols involved in the interactions more clearly. The more developed an individual's mind is, the easier social interaction will be for them. The second term brought about by Mead is '''self'''. In this context, self is the understanding a person creates of how others respond to them. Like the concept of mind, self is brought out by social interaction. By looking at how a group reacts to an individual, Mead says that the individual can not only come to understand their own identity but to also see things from the perspective of another individual. This means that one can imagine what things would be like if they were in another's situation. If this occurs over and over again the individual can begin to generalize what others will expect of the individual and how they will react to them. These relate to identity control theory because understanding the symbols involved in social interaction and being able to predict the outcomes of interaction can help and individual prevent the negative feelings that can be associated with identity control theory. If one can predict how people will react to their identity, they can make changes to their identity that will allow their personal view of their identity to match the view others have of their identity. This will draw positive emotions from the person rather than negative ones, which is what individuals strive for in regards to identity control theory.

'''Infallibility''' is the inability to be wrong. Its importance and meaning is debated in [[epistemology]] and major religions.

==In philosophy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[Epistemology]], a branch of [[philosophy]], is concerned with the question of what, if anything, humans can know. The answer to the issue of whether or not a human can be infallible depends on the philosophical school.

*Advocates of [[philosophical skepticism]] claim that one cannot know anything with certainty, much less be infallible. [[fallibilism|Fallibilists]] hold a similar position, but claim that what is true today could be wrong tomorrow.{{Dubious|date=September 2011}}
*Advocates of [[subjectivism]] claim that there is no objective reality or truth, and therefore anyone can be considered infallible, since whatever is within a person's consciousness ''is'' considered the real and the true.
*Advocates of [[reason]] and [[rationality]] claim that one ''can'' gain certainty of knowledge, through a process of extreme refinement measures unlikely to be perfected enough for someone to assurably say "certainty of this knowledge is absolute", yet also assume by chance that one could land on the objective without the knowledge being confidently described as "universally certain", thus as a result, advocates tend to avoid this altogether and instead rely upon [[Occam's Razor]] as a suitable means for obtaining knowledge.

==In theology==
===Christianity===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
{{See also|Biblical infallibility|Biblical inerrancy|Infallibility of the Church|Papal infallibility}}
Human involvement in the revelatory process is very important because God has no choice but to communicate in human language through human agents. But if this must be so, God can at least be expected to prevent human weakness and shortcoming from marring this divine process. If our sources of knowledge are not infallible, then who is going to decide what to accept and what to reject? &lt;ref&gt;Daniel,W.Brown, "Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought", p61. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999. {{ISBN|0521653940}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' defines infallibility as "Inability to err in teaching revealed truth".&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F.L. and Livingstone, E.A. (eds), "infallibility" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', p831. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-211655-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church theology claim that the [[Christian Church|Church]] is infallible, but disagree as to where infallibility exists, whether in doctrines, scripture, or church authorities.

In contrast, Protestant and non-denominational Christian churches believe that the Christian Church is indeed fallible—as evidenced by the requirement of Christ's sacrifice on the cross to pay for the sins of the world, including those of his Church—and that only God's word in Scripture is infallible. They also completely reject the Roman Catholic claim regarding Papal Infallibility, citing not just scriptural reasons, but also the many times popes have contradicted each other and the history of mistakes committed by many popes throughout Roman Catholic Church history. 

Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse infallibility and [[impeccability]], as if the Pope were immune from sin, but that is not the Roman Catholic Church's doctrine. In [[Roman Catholic]] theology, only the actual act of teaching may properly be called "infallible". According to the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–71) and as reaffirmed at [[Vatican II]] (1962–1965) the Pope is infallible when speaking ''[[ex cathedra]]'' on matters of faith and morals. Thus the Pope may sin in his private life, but he is infallible while on the clock.

===Judaism===
The notion of infallibility in Judaism as it relates to the [[Tannaim]] and [[Amoraim]] of the [[Talmud]], as well as the [[Rishonim]], [[Achronim]] and modern day [[Gedolim]] is one surrounded by debate.

Some who reject infallibility cite the Talmud, [[Pesachim]] 94b:

{{quote|The sages of Israel say: "The sphere ([[Earth]]) remains fixed and the [[constellations]] revolve," while the sages of the nations say: "The sphere revolves and the constellations remain fixed."...the sages of Israel say: "during the day the [[sun]] moves below the canopy (sky) and at night above the canopy," while the sages of the nations say: "during the day the sun moves below the canopy and at night below the ground."  Rebbi said: "Their words seem more correct than ours..."}}

The words of the [[Mishna]] are commented on by numerous commentators, and Yehuda Levi argues that evidence mounts that the [[Geonim]] and the [[Rambam]] perceived that the sages of the Talmud "erred in a matter of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Yehuda, ''The Science in Torah'', Feldheim Publishers 2004, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rambam wrote that the great sages are not expected to advocate positions perfectly in-line with modern science because they were "scholars of that generation," often basing their assessments of what "they learned from the scholars of the era."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonidies]], ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' part 3, chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hasidism|Hassidic]] tradition, however, infallibility is taught in the [[Chabad]] tradition in connection with a [[Rebbe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tzaddikim.blogspot.com/search/label/infallibility Sources about infallibility of Tzaddikim]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
====Universal teachings====
[[Islam]] teaches that the teachings and guidance by the [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]] with regard to bringing the message of the One true God was infallible. Islam also teaches that the Qur'an is an infallible text.

====Additional Shi'a teachings====
{{main|Ismah}}
In [[Shi'a]] theology, the belief is that the [[Ahl al-Bayt]], including [[Muhammad]], his daughter [[Fatima Zahra]] and  [[Shi'a Imams]] are all infallible and do not make mistakes.  It is believed that they are infallible in the sense that all statements or teachings made by them can be relied on to be certainly true, that all information believed by themselves is true, ''and'' that they have complete knowledge about right and wrong and never intend to disobey God, in a sense, ''perfect creation''.  It is also held by Shi'as that there were 124,000 [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]], beginning with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and ending with [[Muhammad]] - with all, including the latter, being infallible in the same sense as the Ahl al-Bayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.shianews.com/hi/articles/islam/0000006.php |title=Shia News:Infallibility of the Prophets|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.answering-ansar.org/shia_viewpoint/khalifatullah_in_shia/en/index.php |title=Answering-Ansar.org - The Khalifatullah in Shi'a Belief|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for information about whether or not [[Islam]] states that Moḥammad and other [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Messengers]] or Prophets were always infallible, or unquestionable for any of their acts, see the Qur'an (5: 116) (11: 36 - 37, 40 - 47) (37: 139 - 142) (66: 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|116|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|36|e=47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=142|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|66|1|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaishnavism (Hinduism)===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna (Bg 15.16 to 15.20) "There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every living entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every living entity is called infallible. Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Supreme Soul, the imperishable Lord Himself, who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them. Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person. Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata. This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/15/16/en Bhagavad Gita]&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=March 2017}}

'''Karma yoga''', also called '''Karma marga''', is one of the four spiritual paths in [[Hinduism]], one based on the "[[yoga]] of action".&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Raju (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397554 The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 210&lt;/ref&gt; To a ''karma yogi'', right work done well is a form of prayer.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt; It is one of the paths in the spiritual practices of Hindus, others being [[Raja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga]] (path of knowledge) and [[Bhakti yoga]] (path of loving devotion to a personal god).&lt;ref&gt;John Lochtefeld (2014), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|978-0823922871}}, pages 98-100, also see articles on bhaktimārga and jnanamārga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1989|pages=210–212|isbn=978-0-88706-807-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 14-15, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The three paths are not mutually exclusive in Hinduism, but the relative emphasis between Karma yoga, Jnana yoga and Bhakti yoga varies by the individual.&lt;ref name="Horosz2012p258"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. Horosz|author2=Tad Clements|title=Religion and Human Purpose: A Cross Disciplinary Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5-hBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|year=2012|publisher=Springer Science|isbn=978-94-009-3483-2|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[Four Yogas (Hinduism)|paths to spiritual liberation]] in Hinduism, karma yoga is the path of unselfish action.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228&gt;Robert A. McDermott (1975), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397942 Indian Spirituality in the West: A Bibliographical Mapping], Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr 1975), pp. 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward2012p142"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold G. Coward|title=Perfectibility of Human Nature in Eastern and Western Thought, The|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVsXcS3xPFsC&amp;pg=PA142 |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7885-1|pages=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It teaches that a spiritual seeker should act according to [[dharma]], without being attached to the fruits or personal consequences. Karma Yoga, states the ''Bhagavad Gita'', purifies the mind. It leads one to consider dharma of work, and the work according to one's dharma, doing god's work and in that sense becoming and being "like unto god Krishna" in every moment of one's life.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt;

==Concept==
According to James Lochtefeld, Karma yoga (also called ''karmamarga'') is the spiritual practice of "selfless action performed for the benefit of others".&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p352"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Brodd|title=World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOM3XgY1ITMC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|isbn=978-0-88489-997-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma yoga is a path to reach spiritual [[moksha]] (liberation) through work. It is rightful action without being attached to fruits or being manipulated by what the results might be, a dedication to one's duty, and trying one's best while being neutral to rewards or outcomes such as success or failure.&lt;ref name=zubin342&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mulla | first=Zubin R. | last2=Krishnan | first2=Venkat R. | title=Karma-Yoga: The Indian Model of Moral Development | journal=Journal of Business Ethics | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=123 | issue=2 | year=2013 | pages=342–345, context: 339–351 | doi=10.1007/s10551-013-1842-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency for a human being to seek the fruits of action is normal, state Hindu texts, but an exclusive attachment to fruits and positive immediate consequences can compromise dharma (ethical, rightful action). Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, is "ethically fine-tuned action".&lt;ref name="Hooft2014p302"&gt;{{cite book|author=P Bilimoria|editor=S van Hooft|title=The Handbook of Virtue Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i19_BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-54477-7|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, "only [[dharma|dharmic]] action" is suitable in ''karma yoga'', where one downplays one's own exclusive role or one's own exclusive interests. Instead, the ''karma yogi'' considers the interests of all parties impartially, all beings, the elements of ''[[Prakṛti]]'' and then does the right thing.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite book|author= Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99| year=2009|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-14485-8|pages= 97–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Phillips, there are commentators who disagree and state "any action can be done as karma yoga" and it doesn't have to be consistent with dharma.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Blizek|title=The Continuum Companion to Religion and Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E5uV9aOuyRUC&amp;pg=PA161| year=2009|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn= 978-0-8264-9991-2|pages =161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, does not mean forfeiture of emotions or desires, rather it means action driven by "equanimity, balance", with "dispassion, disinterest", avoiding "one sidedness, fear, craving, favoring self or one group or clan, self-pity, self-aggrandizement or any form of extreme reactiveness".&lt;ref name="Hooft2014p302"/&gt; A Karma yogi acts and does his or her duty, whether that be as "a homemaker, mother, nurse, carpenter or garbage collector, with no thought for one's own fame, privilege or financial reward, but simply as a dedication to the Lord", states [[Harold Coward]] – professor of Religious Studies with a focus on Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold G. Coward|title=Perfectibility of Human Nature in Eastern and Western Thought, The|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVsXcS3xPFsC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7885-1|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Phillips, Karma yoga applies to "any action in any profession or family activities", where the yogi works selflessly to others' benefit.

According to the ''Bhagavad Gita'', selfless service to the right cause and like-minded others, with the right feeling and right attitude, is a form of worship and spirituality.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year =2009|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-14485-8|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The first six chapters of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' discuss Karma yoga, chapters 7-12 focus on [[Bhakti yoga]], while chapters 13-18 describe the [[Jnana yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Hodgkinson|title=The Essence of Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIQEAwAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=London: Arcturus|isbn=978-1-84858-409-9|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The verse 3.4 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' states that avoiding work or not starting work is not the path to become free of bondage, just like renouncing the world and wearing monk's dress does not automatically make one spiritual.&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt; Not acting is a form of action with consequences and karmic impact, and the nature of existence is such that human beings are always acting in their environment, body or mind, and never for a moment are they not, according to verse 3.5.&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan|title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses 3.6 to 3.8 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' state that the action can be motivated by body or manipulated by external influences. Alternatively, it can be motivated by one's inner reflection and true self (soul, Atman, Brahman).&lt;ref name=zubin342/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch2004p64"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eliot Deutsch|author2=Rohit Dalvi|title=The Essential Vedanta: A New Source Book of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vDsAAAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=World Wisdom|isbn=978-0-941532-52-5|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former creates bondage, the latter empowers freedom. The spiritual path to the liberated state of bliss is to do the best one is able to while being detached to outcomes, to fruits, to success or failure.

A part of the premise of "disinterested action" is that the more one acts with the hope of getting rewards, the more one is liable to disappointment, frustration or self-destructive behavior. Further, another part of the premise is that the more one is committed to "disinterested action", the more one considers the dharma (ethical dimension), focuses on other aspects of the action, strives to do one's best, and this leads to liberating self-empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonardon Ganeri|title=The Concealed Art of the Soul: Theories of Self and Practices of Truth in Indian Ethics and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dITDAAAQBAJ|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920241-6|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to chapter 5 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', both ''[[sannyasa]]'' (renunciation, monastic life) and ''karma yoga'' are means to liberation. Between the two, it recommends ''karma yoga'', stating that anyone who is a dedicated karma yogi neither hates nor desires, and therefore such as person is the "eternal renouncer".&lt;ref name="Deutsch2004p64"/&gt;

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' gives a summary of the karma yoga process.&lt;ref&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 131 (v 45), p 144 (v.51), p 149-150 (v.54)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gita'' itself is a chapter from the epic known as ''[[Mahabharata]]'', wherein a dialogue takes place between the prince [[Arjuna]], and his friend and chariot driver, Lord [[Krishna]], on the brink of a great dynastic war. Their conversation is prompted by Arjuna as he is engulfed by sorrow and misgivings regarding the oncoming battle in which he has friends and relatives on both sides. In reply, Krishna then elucidates upon a number of philosophical [[yoga]] systems and practices (including karma yoga) by/through which Arjuna should indeed continue with the fight on righteous principles.

In the ''Bhagavad Gita'', Krishna says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"tasmad asaktah satatam karyam karma samacara asakto hy acaran karma param apnoti purushah" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, without being attached to the results of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/19/en1 Chapter 3, Text 19], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311062756/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/19/en1 |date=11 March 2007 }} Bhagavad Gita&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other Hindu texts===
The earliest texts that are forerunners of the karma yoga ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are the ancient Upanishads, such as the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlOrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14484-1|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vedic texts as well as post-Vedic literature of the [[Mimamsa]] school of Hindu philosophy mention ''karma marga'', but these contextually refer to the path of rituals.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2007p119"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_6-JbUiHB4C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7082-4|pages=119–121, 133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raju, the Mimamsa ideas, though orthodox, were the fertile grounds on which the later ideas of ''Karma yoga'' developed.&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Raju (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397554 The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma yoga is discussed in many other Hindu texts. For example, the section 11.20 of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' states that there are only three means to spiritual liberation: ''jnana yoga'' (knowledge), ''karma yoga'' (action) and ''bhakti yoga'' (devotion).&lt;ref name="Werner2013p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.R. Sharma|editor=Karel Werner|title=Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mldcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-77468-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are of philosophical bent, prefer the "knowledge path". Those who are inclined to productive application of arts, skills and knowledge, prefer the "karma path". Those who prefer emotional connection, prefer the "devotional path". These three paths overlap, with different relative emphasis.&lt;ref name="Horosz2012p258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner2013p85"/&gt;

Discussions on Karma yoga are also found in chapter 33 of ''[[Narada Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|title=Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7XOnIkBQ0QC&amp;pg=PA169 |year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-301-8|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, new movements within Hinduism added [[raja yoga]] as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Hindery|title=Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FswBLvTkvQC |year=1978|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0866-9|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George D.

==Karma yoga versus Kriya yoga==
According to Constance Jones and James Ryan, karma yoga is "yoga of action" while kriya yoga is "yoga of ritual action". Kriya yoga is found in tantric texts, and believed by its practitioners to activate [[chakra]] and energy centers in the body. In that sense, kriya yoga is a subset of karma yoga. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

'''Kirill Formanchuk''' is an [[activist]] for [[driving|motorists]]' rights in [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Russia]].  On October 12, 2007, he suffered severe injuries from a beating while in police custody, which has led to increased public and media scrutiny of traffic police in a number of Russian cities.

He was a member of the Committee to Protect the Rights of Motorists, an activist group.  He was previously employed by the Yekaterinburg municipal government.

== Activism ==

Prior to the attack, Formanchuk had achieved local notoriety by challenging the lawfulness of traffic patrol stops, which are widely perceived in Russia to be corrupt and motivated by  a desire for [[bribery|bribes]].  Formanchuk repeatedly refused to bribe traffic patrol officers, instead challenging them on their knowledge of traffic regulations and other laws governing traffic stops.

== Beating ==

According to Formanchuk, he went to a police station on October 12, 2007 to register his car.  He attempted to record video of his interaction with the officers, which he says infuriated them.  He was subsequently attacked.  Formanchuk did not positively identify his attackers as police officers, but he alleges that officers on duty did nothing to restrain the attackers.

The police allege that Formanchuk became belligerent in the police station, was arrested, and suffered his injuries when he instigated a fight with the other occupants of his jail cell.

Formanchuk was hospitalized after the attack, which caused injuries to his skull and brain.
[[File:Ekaterinburg Senate 18.12.13-Formanchuk.jpg|thumb|Formanchuk addresses [[Monarchist Party#Ekaterinburg Senate|Ekaterinburg Senate]]]]

== Response ==

After Formanchuk's beating became public, motorists' groups in Yekaterinburg, [[St. Petersburg]], and [[Moscow]] held demonstrations against the police.  An Internet posting in support of Formanchuk has received over 200,000 hits.  State-run media, which is usually reluctant to air criticism of government authorities, has begun to focus on Formanchuk's story, with one channel referring to his treatment as "outrageous."

The Yekaterinburg edition of [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]], the official government newspaper, cited Formanchuk's situation while admonishing law enforcement services to be more cooperative with motorists.

Law enforcement officials denied any involvement with Formanchuk's beating and accused Formanchuk's activist group of inciting the public against the police.  They further alleged that Formanchuk is a draft dodger with many serious traffic violations.

== Ekaterinburg Senate ==
Formanchuk nowadays also acts as a senator in civil [[Monarchist Party#Ekaterinburg Senate|Ekaterinburg Senate]] aimed at providing public control for official authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} http://esenat.ru/senators.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He focuses on automobile-related affairs.

[[File:Landfill gas collection from capped landfill area.jpg|thumb|Landfill gas collection from capped landfill area]]

'''[[Landfill gas]] utilization''' is a process of gathering, processing, and treating the [[methane]] gas emitted from decomposing garbage to produce electricity, heat, fuels, and various chemical compounds. The number of landfill gas projects, which convert the gas into power, went from 399 in 2005 to 519 in 2009 in the United Kingdom, according to the Environment Agency. These projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. These projects collect the methane gas and treat it, so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas.  These projects power homes, buildings, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landfill Projects on the rise|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-24-landfill-energy_N.htm|accessdate=2010-04-25 | first=Wendy | last=Koch | date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landfill gas]] (LFG) is generated through the degradation of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) and other biodegradable waste, by [[microorganisms]]. Aerobic conditions, presence of oxygen, leads to predominately {{CO2}} emissions. In anaerobic conditions, as is typical of landfills, methane and {{CO2}} are produced in a ratio of 60:40. [[Methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) is the important component of landfill gas as it has a calorific value of 33.95 MJ/Nm^3 which gives rise to energy generation benefits.&lt;ref name="SEPA"&gt;Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Guidance on Landfill Gas Flaring. November 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/idoc.ashx?docid=d2a6df2b-8ea9-4326-af87-e6803f769d47&amp;version=-1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of methane that is produced varies significantly based on composition of the waste. Most of the methane produced in MSW landfills is derived from food waste, composite paper, and corrugated cardboard which comprise 19.4 ± 5.5%, 21.9 ± 5.2%, and 20.9 ± 7.1% respectively on average of MSW landfills in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Staley, Bryan, Morton Barlaz, and Morton Barlaz. "Composition of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States and Implications for Carbon Sequestration and Methane Yield." Journal of Environmental Engineering, 135.10 (2009): 901-909.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of landfill gas production varies with the age of the landfill. There are 4 common phases that a section of a MSW landfill undergoes after placement. Typically, in a large landfill, different areas of the site will be at different stages simultaneously. The landfill gas production rate will reach a maximum at around 5&amp;nbsp;years and start to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, H. "Electricity Generation: Options for Reduction in Carbon Emissions." , 360.1797 (2002): 1653-1668. .&lt;/ref&gt;  Landfill gas follows first-order kinetic decay after decline begins with a k-value ranging 0.02 yr-1 for arid conditions and 0.065 yr-1 for wet conditions.&lt;ref name="Landfill Gas Modeling"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Landfill Gas Modeling." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 30 January 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) provides first order decay model to aid in the determination of landfill gas production named LandGEM (Landfill Gas Emissions Model).&lt;ref name="Landfill Gas Modeling"/&gt; Typically, gas extraction rates from a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill range from 25 to 10000&amp;nbsp;m³/h where Landfill sites typically range from 100,000&amp;nbsp;m³ to 10&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;m³.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt;  MSW landfill gas typically has roughly 45 to 60% methane and 40 to 60% carbon dioxide, depending on the amount of air introduced to the site through active gas extraction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Landfill Gas Energy Basics." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 16 February 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many other minor components that comprises roughly 1% which includes {{chem|H|2|S}}, {{chem|NO|x}}, {{chem|SO|2}}, {{chem|CO}}, [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s (NMVOCs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] (PCDDs), [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] (PCDFs), etc. All of the aforementioned agents are harmful to human health at high doses.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt;

Landfill gas collection is typically accomplished through the installation of wells installed vertically and/or horizontally in the waste mass.  Design heuristics for vertical wells call for about one well per acre of landfill surface, whereas horizontal wells are normally spaced about 50 to 200 feet apart on center.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Project Technology Options." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 9 September 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient gas collection can be accomplished at both open and closed landfills, but closed landfills have systems that are more efficient, owing to greater deployment of collection infrastructure since active filling is not occurring.  On average, closed landfills have gas collection systems that capture about 84% of produced gas, compared to about 67% for open landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimates of solid waste disposal rates and reduction targets for landfill gas emissions|url = http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2804.html|journal = Nature Climate Change|date = 2015-09-21|issn = 1758-6798|volume = advance online publication|doi = 10.1038/nclimate2804|language = en|first = Jon T.|last = Powell|first2 = Timothy G.|last2 = Townsend|first3 = Julie B.|last3 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Landfill gas can also be extracted through horizontal trenches instead of vertical wells. Both systems are effective at collecting. Landfill gas is extracted and piped to a main collection header, where it is sent to be treated or flared. The main collection header can be connected to the leachate collection system to collect condensate forming in the pipes. A blower is needed to pull the gas from the collection wells to the collection header and further downstream. A {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} landfill gas collection system with a flare designed for a 600&amp;nbsp;ft³/min extraction rate is estimated to cost $991,000 (approximately $24,000 per acre) with annual operation and maintenance costs of $166,000 per year at $2,250 per well, $4,500 per flare and $44,500 per year to operate the blower (2008). LMOP provides a software model to predict collection system costs.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

=== Flaring ===
[[File:Open (left) and enclosed (right) flare.JPG|thumb|alt= Open_(left)_and_enclosed_(right)_flare.JPG|Flares: Open (left) and enclosed (right) flare.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

If gas extraction rates do not warrant direct use or electricity generation, the gas can be flared off. One hundred&amp;nbsp;m³/h is a practical threshold for flaring in the US. In the U.K, gas engines are used with a capacity of less than 100m3/h.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt; Flares are useful in all landfill gas systems as they can help control excess gas extraction spikes and maintenance down periods. In the U.K and EU enclosed flares are mandatory at modern landfill sites. Flares can be either open or enclosed. Enclosed flares are typically more expensive, but they provide high combustion temperatures and specific residence times as well as limit noise and light pollution. Some US states require the use of enclosed flares over open flares. Higher combustion temperatures and residence times destroy unwanted constituents such as un-burnt hydrocarbons. General accepted values are an exhaust gas temperature of 1000°C with a retention time of '''0,3 seconds''' which is said to result in greater than 98% destruction efficiency.

=== Landfill gas treatment ===
Landfill gas must be treated to remove impurities, condensate, and particulates. The treatment system depends on the end use. Minimal treatment is needed for the direct use of gas in boiler, furnaces, or kilns. Using the gas in electricity generation typically requires more in-depth treatment. Treatment systems are divided into primary and secondary treatment processing. Primary processing systems remove moisture and particulates. Gas cooling and compression are common in primary processing. Secondary treatment systems employ multiple cleanup processes, physical and chemical, depending on the specifications of the end use. Two constituents that may need to be removed are [[siloxanes]] and [[sulfur compounds]], which are damaging to equipment and significantly increase maintenance cost. Adsorption and absorption are the most common technologies used in secondary treatment processing.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

== Use of landfill gas ==
=== Direct use ===
==== Boiler, dryer, and process heater ====

Pipelines transmit gas to boilers, dryers, or kilns, where it is used much in the same way as natural gas. Landfill gas is cheaper than natural gas and holds about half the heating value at 16,785 – 20,495 kJ/m3 (450 – 550 Btu/ft3) as compared to 35,406 kJ/m3 (950 Btu/ft3) of natural gas.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen Addition"&gt;Bade Shrestha, S.O, G Narayanan, and G Narayanan. "Landfill Gas with Hydrogen Addition a Fuel for SI Engines." Fuel, 87.17/18 (2008): 3616-3626.&lt;/ref&gt; Boilers, dryers, and kilns are used often because they maximize use of the gas, limited treatment is needed, and the gas can be mixed with other fuels. Boilers use the gas to transform water into steam for use in various applications. For boilers, about 8,000 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;pounds per hour of steam can be generated for every 1&amp;nbsp;million metric tons of waste-in-place at the landfill.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Most direct use projects use boilers. [[General Motors]] saves $500,000 on energy costs per year at each of the four plants owned by General Motors that has implemented landfill gas boilers.&lt;ref name="boilers"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Adapting Boilers to Utilize Landfill Gas: An Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Opportunity." September 2008. Web. 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages of Boilers, dryers, and kilns are that they need to be [[retrofitted]] in order to accept the gas and the end user has to be nearby (within roughly 5&amp;nbsp;miles) as pipelines will need to be built.

==== Infrared heaters, greenhouses, artisan studios ====
In situations with low gas extraction rates, the gas can go to power infrared heaters in buildings local to the landfill, provide heat and power to local greenhouses, and power the energy intensive activities of a studio engaged in pottery, metalworking or glass-blowing. Heat is fairly inexpensive to employ with the use of a boiler. A microturbine would be needed to provide power in low gas extraction rate situations.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

==== Leachate evaporation ====
[[File:Leachate evaporation system.JPG|thumb|alt= Leachate_evaporation_system.JPG|[[Leachate]] evaporation system.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

The gas coming from the landfill can be used to evaporate [[leachate]] in situations where leachate is fairly expensive to treat. The system to evaporate the leachate costs $300,000 to $500,000 to put in place with operations and maintenance costs of $70,000 to $95,000 per year. A 30,000&amp;nbsp;gallons per day evaporator costs $.05 - $.06 per gallon. The cost per gallon increases as the evaporator size decreases. A 10,000&amp;nbsp;gallons per day evaporator costs $.18 - $.20 per gallon.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2007&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Pipeline-quality gas, CNG, LNG ====
[[File:Gas separator membrane skid for PSA process of landfill gas.jpg|thumb|Gas separator membrane skid used in membrane separation process to extract carbon dioxide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SWANA 2012 Excellence Award Application "Landfill Gas Control" Seneca Landfill, Inc|url=https://swana.org/Portals/0/Awards/2012Noms/Landfill_Gas_Control_silver.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Landfill gas can be converted to high-Btu gas by reducing its carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen content. The high-Btu gas can be piped into existing natural gas pipelines or in the form of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) or LNG ([[liquid natural gas]]). CNG and LNG can be used on site to power hauling trucks or equipment or sold commercially. Three commonly used methods to extract the carbon dioxide from the gas are membrane separation, molecular sieve, and amine scrubbing. Oxygen and nitrogen are controlled by the proper design and operation of the landfill since the primary cause for oxygen or nitrogen in the gas is intrusion from outside into the landfill because of a difference in pressure. The high-Btu processing equipment can be expected to cost $2,600 to $4,300 per standard cubic foot per minute (scfm) of landfill gas. Annual costs range from $875,000 to $3.5&amp;nbsp;million to operate, maintain and provide electricity to.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Costs depend on quality of the end product gas as well as the size of the project. The first landfill gas to LNG facility in the United States was the [[Frank R. Bowerman Landfill]] in [[Orange County, California]]. The same process is used for the conversion to CNG, but on a smaller scale. The CNG project at [[Puente Hills Landfill]] in Los Angeles has realized $1.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent with the flow rate of 250 scfm.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Cost per gallon equivalent reduces as the flow rate of gas increases. LNG can be produced through the liquidfication of CNG. However, the oxygen content needs to be reduced to be under 0.5% to avoid explosion concerns, the carbon dioxide content must be as close to zero as possible to avoid freezing problems encountered in the production, and nitrogen must be reduced enough to achieve at least 96% methane. A $20&amp;nbsp;million facility is estimated to achieve $0.65/gallon for a plant producing 15,000&amp;nbsp;gallons/day of LNG (3,000 scfm).&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2007&amp;nbsp;dollars.

=== Electricity generation ===
If the landfill gas extraction rate is large enough, a gas turbine or internal combustion engine could be used to produce electricity to sell commercially or use on site.

==== Reciprocating piston engine ====
[[File:IC engines.JPG|thumb|alt= IC_engines.JPG| Internal combustion engines to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

More than 70 percent of all landfill electricity projects use [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston (RP) engines]], a [[Internal combustion engine|form of internal combustion engine]], because of relatively low cost, high efficiency, and good size match with most landfills. RP engines usually achieve an efficiency of 25 to 35 percent with landfill gas. However, RP engines can be added or removed to follow gas trends. Each engine can achieve 150kW to 3&amp;nbsp;MW, depending on the gas flow. An RP engine (less than 1&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $2,300 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $210 per kW. An RP engine (greater than 800&amp;nbsp;kW) can typically cost $1,700 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $180 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Gas turbine ====
[[File:Gas turbines.JPG|thumb|alt= Gas_turbines.JPG|Gas turbines that utilize landfill gas.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

[[Gas turbine|Gas turbines]], another form of internal combustion engine, usually meet an efficiency of 20 to 28 percent at full load with landfill gas. Efficiencies drop when the turbine is operating at partial load. Gas turbines have relatively low maintenance costs and nitrogen oxide emissions when compared to RP engines. Gas turbines require high gas compression, which uses more electricity to compress, therefore reducing the efficiency. Gas turbines are also more resistant to corrosive damage than RP engines. Gas turbines need a minimum of 1,300 cfm and typically exceed 2,100 cfm and can generate 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;MW. A gas turbine (greater than 3&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $1,400 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $130 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;  Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Microturbine ====
Microturbines can produce electricity with lower amounts of landfill gas than gas turbines or RP engines.  Microturbines can operate between 20 and 200 cfm and emit less nitrogen oxides than RP engines. Also, they can function with less methane content (as little as 35 percent). Microturbines require extensive gas treatment and come in sizes of 30, 70, and 250&amp;nbsp;kW. A microturbine (less than 1&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $5,500 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $380 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Fuel cell ====
Research has been performed indicating that molten carbonate [[Fuel cell|fuel cells]] could be fueled by landfill gas. Molten carbonate fuel cells require less purity than typical fuel cells, but still require extensive treatment. The separation of acid gases (HCl, HF, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), VOC oxidation (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S removal) and siloxane removal are required for molten carbonate fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, W, H Lohmann, J.I. Salazar Gomez, H Lohmann, and J.I. Salazar Gomez. "Catalytically Upgraded Landfill Gas as a Cost-effective Alternative for Fuel Cells." Journal of Power Sources, 193.1 (2009): 359-366.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel cells are typically run on hydrogen and hydrogen can be produced from landfill gas. Hydrogen used in fuel cells have zero emissions, high efficiency, and low maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen Addition"/&gt;

== Project incentives ==
[[File:States with state or private incentives.JPG|thumb|alt= States_with_state_or_private_incentives.JPG|States with state or private incentives.&lt;ref&gt;"EPA - LMOP - Funding Guide." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 8 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/guide/state_resources.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:States with RPS.JPG|thumb|alt= States_with_RPS.JPG|States with Renewable Portfolio Standard.&lt;ref name="state rps"/&gt;]]

Various landfill gas project incentives exist for United States projects at the federal and state level. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], and [[Department of Commerce]] all provide federal incentives for landfill gas projects. Typically, incentives are in the form of tax credits, bonds, or grants. For example, the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) gives a corporate tax credit of 1.1&amp;nbsp;cents per kWh for landfill projects above 150&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name="Fed Resources"&gt;"EPA - LMOP - Funding Guide: Federal Resources." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 8 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/guide/federal.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Various states and private foundations give incentives to landfill gas projects. A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is a legislative requirement for utilities to sell or generate a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources including landfill gas. Some states require all utilities to comply, while others require only public utilities to comply.&lt;ref name="state rps"&gt;"EPA - LMOP - Funding Guide: State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 8 November 2009. &lt; http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/guide/state_rps.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:Current landfill gas projects in the United States and landfills that could utilize a landfill gas project.JPG|thumb|alt=Current_landfill_gas_projects_in_the_United_States_and_landfills_that_could_utilize_a_landfill_gas_project.JPG|Current landfill gas projects in the United States and landfills that could use a landfill gas project.&lt;ref&gt;"Biomass Combined Heat and Power Catalog of Technologies." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. September 2007. Web. 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2005, 166&amp;nbsp;million tons of MSW were discarded to landfills in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, P. Ozge, Joseph Decarolis, Susan Thorneloe, Joseph Decarolis, and Susan Thorneloe. "Is It Better to Burn or Bury Waste for Clean Electricity Generation?." Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 43.6 (2009): 1711-1717.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly 120&amp;nbsp;kg of methane is generated from every ton of MSW. Methane has a [[global warming]] potential of 23 times more effective of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide on a 100-year time horizon. It is estimated that more than 10% of all global anthropogenic methane emissions are from landfills.&lt;ref&gt;Lohila, Annalea, Tuomas Laurila, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Mika Aurela, Juha Hatakka, Tea Thum, Mari Pihlatie, Janne Rinne, Timo Vesala, Tuomas Laurila, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Mika Aurela, Juha Hatakka, Tea Thum, Mari Pihlatie, Janne Rinne, and Timo Vesala. "Micrometeorological Measurements of Methane and Carbon Dioxide Fluxes at a Municipal Landfill." Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 41.8 (2007): 2717-2722.&lt;/ref&gt; Landfill gas projects help aid in the reduction of methane emissions. However, landfill gas collection systems do not collect all the gas generated. Around 4 to 10 percent of landfill gas escapes the collection system of a typical landfill with a gas collection system.&lt;ref name="Benefits"&gt;”Environmental Protection Agency LMOP: Benefits of Energy.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 27 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/benefits.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of landfill gas is considered a [[green fuel]] source because it offsets the use of environmentally damaging fuels such as oil or [[natural gas]], destroys the heat-trapping gas methane, and the gas is generated by deposits of waste that are already in place. 450 of the 2,300 landfills in the United States have operational landfill gas utilization projects as of 2007. LMOP has estimated that approximately 520 landfills that currently exist could use landfill gas (enough to power 700,000 homes). Landfill gas projects also decrease local pollution, and create jobs, revenues and cost savings.&lt;ref name="Benefits"/&gt;  Of the roughly 450 landfill gas projects operational in 2007, 11&amp;nbsp;billion kWh of electricity was generated and 78&amp;nbsp;billion cubic feet of gas was supplied to end users. These totals amount to roughly {{convert|17500000|acre|ha}} of pine or fir forests or annual emissions from 14,000,000 passenger vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In [[demography]] (the branch of [[statistics]] that deals with the study of populations) a '''Lexis diagram''' (named after economist and social scientist [[Wilhelm Lexis]]) is a two dimensional diagram that is used to represent events (such as births or deaths) that occur to individuals belonging to different [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s.  Calendar time is usually represented on the horizontal axis, while age is represented on the vertical axis. In some textbooks the y-axis is plotted backwards, with age 0 at the top of the page and increasing downwards. However, other arrangements of the axes are also seen. As an example the death of an individual in 2009 at age 80 is represented by the point (2009,80); the cohort of all persons born in 1929 is represented by a diagonal line starting at (1929,0) and continuing through (1930,1) and so on.

'''Medical necessity''' is a [[United States]] [[legal doctrine]], related to activities which may be justified as reasonable, necessary, and/or appropriate, based on [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] clinical [[standard of care|standards of care]]. Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term '''clinical medical necessity''' is also used. In contrast, [[unnecessary health care]] lacks such justification.

== Implementations of the 'medical necessity' doctrines ==

=== Medicare ===

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pays for medical items and services that are "reasonable and necessary" for a variety of purposes. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are "reasonable and necessary"for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 42 U.S.C. &amp;sect; [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1862.htm 1395y(a)(1)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare has a number of policies, including [[National coverage determination]]s (NCDs) and [[Local Coverage Determination]]s (LCDs), formerly known as Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP), that describe coverage criteria.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/overview.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In a small number of cases, Medicare may determine if a method of treating a patient should be covered on a case-by-case basis. Even if a service is medically determined to be "reasonable and necessary," coverage may be limited if the service is provided more frequently than allowed under Medicare coverage policies.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [[Certificate of medical necessity]], [http://medicarelaw.info/wiki/Reasonable_and_Necessary]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, or [http://www.gotelecare.com/medical-billing].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific instances==

===Medical use of marijuana===
{{main|Medical cannabis}}
The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as marijuana) for medical purposes is a notable 'medical necessity' case. Cannabis is a plant whose active ingredients are widely reported by sufferers to be effective in pain control for various conditions, usually [[neuropathic]] in nature, where common painkillers have not had great benefit; however as a [[scheduled drug|Schedule I drug]] under the [[Controlled Substance Act]], it is illegal and is targeted by government, police, and anti-drug campaigners: in some states, possession is decriminalized for even non-medical purposes, wherein other states possession is a felony offense. In this case the doctrine of medical necessity would be used by a patient who believed marijuana was beneficial to them if charged with use or growing/production of illegal controlled substance relating to marijuana.

In several medical marijuana cases, the patients' physician has been willing to state to the court that the patient's condition requires this medicine and thus that the Court should not interfere. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of United States has outrightly rejected this defense in the landmark case ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'', in which the Court ruled that there was no medical necessity exception to drug laws, and federal government is free to [[Police raid|raid]], [[arrest]], [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who are using medical marijuana no matter if the medicine is crucially necessary to them. On the other hand, in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals told a sufferer in extreme pain that they could not rely on state law allowing medical use, but if arrested they could seek to use medical necessity as a defence.

In the state of [[Maryland]], a bill signed by former governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], became law in 2003 permitting patients to use medical necessity defense to marijuana possession in the state. The maximum penalty for these users cannot exceed $100. However, this law does not prevent federal prosecution of patients, as the federal law does not recognize medical necessity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14664">'''Mel Chin''' (born 1951 in [[Houston, Texas]], USA) is a [[conceptual art|conceptual]] visual artist. Motivated largely by political, cultural, and social circumstances, Chin works in a variety of art media to calculate meaning in modern life. Chin places art in landscapes, in public spaces, and in gallery and museum exhibitions, but his work is not limited to specific venues. Chin once stated: “Making objects and marks is also about making possibilities, making choices—and that is one of the last freedoms we have. To provide that is one of the functions of art.” &lt;ref name="art"&gt;Ned Rifkin. ''Directions: Mel Chin, February 1- April 23, 1989''. Hishorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Brochure, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Seesaw - Mel Chin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''See/Saw: The Earthworks'', 1976]]
In 1975, Chin graduated from [[Peabody College]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Shortly after, in 1976, Chin created ''See/Saw: The Earthworks'' for [[Hermann Park]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where the artist manipulated two sections of the park’s surface to create a kinetic, minimalist [[Earthworks (art)|earthwork]]. In this mimic of a childhood pastime, Chin altered the landscape with an underground hydraulic device that allowed the participant to shift large sections of earth with their body weight. The title also questions psychological perception of what is above and below an object's surface. This piece addressed three of the major art trends of the time: [[minimalism]], [[conceptualism]], and [[Earthworks (art)|earthworks]].

[[File:'The Manila Palm', sculpture by Mel Chin, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1978.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'The Manila Palm', sculpture by Mel Chin, [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]], 1978]]
In 1983, Chin moved to New York City. He created ''MYRRHA P.I.A. (Post Industrial Age)'' (1984), site specific to [[Bryant Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Susan Heller |last1=Anderson |first2=David |last2=Bird |title=The See-Through Woman Of Bryant Park |date=August 14, 1984 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/14/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-the-see-through-woman-of-bryant-park.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by the [[Public Art Fund]], the work was based on a [[Gustave Doré]] engraving depicting [[Myrrha]] in the 30th canto of Hell from [[Dante]]’s [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]. Chin created a three-dimensional figurative sculpture employing 19th century fabrication techniques, conjoined with space-age materials.

In 1989, Chin had a one-person exhibition at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In ''The Operation of the Sun through the Cult of the Hand'' (1987), Chin addressed ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Chinese philosophy]]. He investigated mythological constructions, and scientific information to contradict personal interpretations in the formulations of these works. Chin used nine planets of the solar system to launch this elaborate construction. The installation comments on the origins of word material and form from East and West by drawing upon mythology, alchemy, and science in each culture.

Also in this exhibition were three major pieces with political content; ''The Extraction of Plenty from What Remains: 1823-'' (1989) is composed of two replicated [[White House]] columns that squeeze a cornucopia hand-crafted of mahogany, banana, mud, coffee, and goats’ blood. In this artwork Chin reacted to the long history of American foreign policy that has fractured the ability of [[Latin America]]n countries to prosper on their own. The date in the title 1823-(ongoing) is in reference to the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. ''The Sigh of the True Cross'' (1988) is based on a single string Ethiopian masinqo, or  [[spike fiddle]]. Chin compounds the iconography of the musical instrument and the [[hammer and sickle]] to comment on famine, drought, failed politics, and foreign aid in the history of [[Ethiopia]]. ''The Opera of Silence'' (1988) is also complex and layered with meaning. An oversized [[Beijing opera drum]] rests on a staff made of human thigh bone, and the drum skins are woven into the emblem of the [[C.I.A.]] commenting on the interrelations of China, [[Tibet]], and the C.I.A..

Chin conceptually developed the [[GALA Committee]] for the project called ''In the Name of the Place''. ''In the Name of the Place'' covertly inserted art objects on the set of the [[prime-time]] television series ''[[Melrose Place]]''. Chin claimed, “I realized that somewhere in those industries was where I wanted to develop this conceptual public art project. At the same time I was thinking of the virus as a paradigm for this art project. Viruses are self-replicating, but they mutate, and to me, that’s like an art idea. I was wondering, how do you get an idea into a system, and let it replicate within that system? Using the virus as a model, how could I interact with television?” &lt;ref name="television"&gt;Tom Finkelpearl.''Interview: Mel Chin on Revival Field'', in ''Dialogues in Public Art'', Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;“Syndicated television as a host can serve as a place for the generational transfer of an idea.” &lt;ref name="insignificance"&gt;Interview with artist, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea to make an impression upon prime time television worked—and the project successfully placed fine art into popular culture. [[Sotheby's]] in Los Angeles auctioned the objects with proceeds going to two educational charities.

[[File:dopwiki.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Degrees of Paradise'', 1992]]
In 1992, Chin created ''Degrees of Paradise'' to be shown at the [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]] in New York City. Chin commissioned [[Kurd]]ish weavers to create a 9 foot by 23 foot carpet with patterns based on [[satellite telemetry]]. This was installed in the ceiling of one triangular room. In a second similar-shaped room, overhead monitors projected active [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] mathematically derived cloud patterns. The hand woven [[Turkish carpet]] juxtaposed with video monitors continued Chin’s commentary of new and old digital traditions by paying homage to both. This project was a precursor to ''The State of Heaven'' (not realized). Chin envisioned a massive carpet 66 feet by 66 feet that would represent the entire atmospheric envelope with each knot equating {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|0}}. The carpet was to be destroyed and rewoven in a constant process according to the depletion or accretion of the ozone hole. This was an attempt to make visible a phenomenon that we normally cannot see.

After a series of successful gallery and museum exhibits, Chin abandoned object making to pursue an activist, ecological artwork.  He began ''Revival Field'' in 1990. As a conceptual and scientifically grounded work ''Revival Field'' was developed with the intention of green remediation and ecological consciousness. In this landscape art project, Chin, with scientist, Dr [[Rufus Chaney]], used plants called [[hyperaccumulators]] that are known for their ability to draw heavy metals from soil. Chin’s project was located in the Pig’s Eye Landfill in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] for three years. [[Plot markers]] were placed to identify the individual plots. Inside them were Zinc, Copper, and Lead, all containing the correct ratios of the amount of metal in the soil. The project was not about the formal configuration but the conceptual realization of scientific process brought forth through art.  Other ''Revival Field'' sites have been located in [[Palmerton, Pennsylvania]] and [[Stuttgart]], Germany. This project materialized science, technology and art, while not adhering to the traditional object making of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melchin.org/oeuvre/plot-marker-used-in-revival-field|title=Plot Marker, used in Revival Field – mel chin|website=melchin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chin was featured on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series [[Art:21 - Art in the 21st Century]] where his pieces ''S.P.A.W.N.'' and ''KNOWMAD'' and ''Revival Field'' were highlighted. In ''S.P.A.W.N.'' Chin planned to reclaim abandoned buildings in the city of Detroit, Michigan. He looked at neglected homes that once thrived as a starting point for community development.  ''KNOWMAD'' explored persecuted cultures and used traditional tribal woven rugs in an interactive computer video game. He developed this project collaboratively with computer software engineers, with the hope of shedding light upon forgotten cultures and forgotten people.

In 2008 Chin proposed the idea of [[CLI- mate]] (climate linked individual- mate). [[CLI- mate]] is an app that is accessible in any language and free for its users.
The idea is that it will personalize anyone’s relationship with climate change.
Users input their daily habits, the app combines their information with every single users and it calculates their impact on the planet. Users will be able to combine their faces with the worlds. The app is missing information on climate changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melchin.org/oeuvre/cli-mate|title=CLI-Mate – mel chin|website=melchin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mel Chin was invited as a visiting artist at [[East Tennessee State University]]. While there, he completed the W.M.D. ("Warehouse of Mass Distribution"), which was driven to Houston, Texas in May, 2005, to participate in the [[Houston Art Car Parade]].

[[File:24.OSFlower.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Our Strange Flower of Democracy,'' 2005]]
The [[Station Museum of Contemporary Art]] held a major exhibition in Houston, Texas (2006) entitled ''Do Not Ask Me''. Prevailing themes that run through the work selected in this exhibition include war, social injustice, modern media, and individuality. Solo exhibitions of Chin’s art have appeared the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis]], MN, [[The Menil Collection]], [[Houston]], TX, [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]], New York, and [[The Fabric Workshop and Museum]], [[Philadelphia]], PA.

In 2006 the [[Frederieke Taylor Gallery]] in New York City featured a selection of pieces from the "Do Not Ask Me" exhibit, originally shown at the Station Museum, as well as new drawings. Chin exhibited "KNOWMAD" as well as "Render" at Frederieke Taylor Gallery in 2000 and 2003.

''9/11-9/11'' (2006) is Chin’s first animated film. Based on a graphic novella of the same name, which he wrote in 2002, it is a fictional love story set in [[Santiago, Chile]], 1973 and New York City, 2001. Chin’s film deals with the human impact of trauma and tragedy brought forth not by fate but by covert political machinations. Chin is the creator/director working with a 2-D, Chilean animation team.

Chin is compelled to make art in spite of his dark world view which is in keeping with his philosophy of “taking action as resistance to insignificance." &lt;ref name="insignificance"/&gt;

Mel Chin is the recipient of multiple awards including the US [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[New York State Council for the Arts]], [[Art Matters]], [[Creative Capital]], and the [[Penny McCall]], Pollock/Krasner, [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Rockefeller]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] Foundations and [[Nancy Graves]] Foundation Award. In 2010 he won a Fellow award granted by [[United States Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm United States Artists Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110032536/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm |date=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mel Chin has also exhibited in numerous group shows including the Fifth Biennial of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]; Seventh Architectural Biennial in [[Venice]], Italy; [[Kwangju Biennale]], Korea; [[Hirshhorn Museum]], [[Washington D.C.]]; [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]; the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]; [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]]; [[Museum of Modern Art]];  and the [[Asian American Arts Centre]], New York City among others.

In 2006 Mel Chin visited New Orleans after hurricane [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] to evaluate with fellow artists creative solutions to cure the aftermath of destruction as result of the storm. Chin began [[Operation Paydirt]] to find a solution for the high lead contimination in the soil of New Orleans, a problem that existed before Katrina. To assist the funding of [[Operation Paydirt]], the [[Fundred Dollar Bill Project]] was implemented in schools across the United States to symbolically raise 300,000,000 dollars to propose to Congress for an exchange of real dollars in the Summer of 2010.

In 2010 Chin received the biennial [[Fritschy Culture Award]] from the museum Het Domein, [[Sittard]] the Netherlands. "The jury praises the unique way in which Chin, in many of his projects, creates a form of art in which participation and other forms of engagement are key. In awarding the Fritschy Culture Award 2010 to Mel Chin, the jury members emphasize the critical engaged nature of this prize and the expression of contemporary global issues."&lt;ref&gt;[[Museum Het Domein]], Sittard, Official Website [http://www.hetdomein.nl/index.php?t=content&amp;p=447]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Fritschy Culture Award]], Mel Chin exhibited a solo show at the museum Het Domein, titled "Disputed Territories".

Chin has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's art Asia America digital archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artasiamerica.org/artist/detail/60|title=Chin, Mel - Profile - artasiamerica - A Digital Archive for Asian / Asian American Contemporary Art History|website=artasiamerica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''[[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey|Mount Laurel]]'' doctrine''' is a controversial judicial interpretation of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]]. The doctrine requires that municipalities use their [[zoning]] powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate income households.

The doctrine takes its name from the lead case in which it was first pronounced by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] in 1975: ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' (commonly called ''Mount Laurel I''), in which the plaintiffs challenged the zoning ordinance of [[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey]], on the grounds that it operated to exclude low and moderate income persons from obtaining housing in the municipality.

==History==

===Initial development===

After the decision in ''Mount Laurel I'', suits were filed against numerous municipalities. The plaintiffs in such suits fell into three classes: lower income persons who actually sought housing and advocacy organizations on their behalf; the New Jersey Public Advocate; and builders who sought to construct developments containing affordable housing.

These early exclusionary zoning suits were beset by numerous difficulties and little, if any, affordable housing resulted. In 1983 appeals in several of these cases (of which ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' was again the lead case), gave the New Jersey Supreme Court the opportunity to reaffirm and tweak the ''Mount Laurel'' Doctrine and provide several mechanisms and remedies to make the doctrine more effective.

===1980s legislative reaction===

The New Jersey Supreme Court was aware that the ''Mount Laurel II'' decision would be controversial and would engender debate about the proper role of the courts. The opinion invited legislative action to implement what the court defined as the constitutional obligation.

In 1985 the [[New Jersey Legislature]] responded by passing the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824154325/http://www.state.nj.us/dca/coah/fha.shtml Fair Housing Act]. Accepting the premise that there was some constitutional obligation for municipalities to foster some degree of affordable housing, this legislation created an administrative agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]] (COAH), to establish regulations whereby the obligation of each municipality in terms of the number of units and how the obligation could be satisfied.

A municipality which elected to participate in COAH's administrative process prior to being sued was provided with protection from litigation and especially the builder's remedy. As a transitional provision, the act provided that municipalities involved in litigation when the act was passed were to be able to transfer the litigation to COAH unless manifest injustice would result.

COAH developed regulations under which the specific number of affordable units that each municipality would be required to provide (its "pre-credited need") could be determined. Participating municipalities developed compliance plans to address this need by such means as the application of credits (''e.g.'' filtering, spontaneous rehabilitation, extra credit for rental units), the use of regional contribution agreements (transferring part of the obligation to a willing municipality, usually an urban center, in the same region along with payment in an amount agreed by the municipalities) and zoning for affordable housing (usually involving increased density and mandatory set-asides). When COAH approved a municipality's compliance plan it would grant "substantive certification" which was designed to provide the municipality with protection from exclusionary zoning litigation.

From the municipal point of view, the advantages of COAH's administrative process included the use of a formula to calculate fair share that might produce a lower obligation than the court would impose, the availability of the regional contribution agreement to reduce the number of units and the ability to determine where in the municipality that affordable housing ought to be developed rather than being forced to permit a development as a reward to a successful builder-plaintiff. Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating.

===Criticism of the decision===
While the Mount Laurel decision mandates a state constitutional obligation for every municipality in a "growth area" to provide a fair share of its region's present and prospective housing needs for low and moderate income families, there is no funding source specified for low or very-low income families, in a state that already has some of the nation's highest property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 "McHose Says 'Fair Housing' Bill Misses the Mark; Doesn't Address Why Housing is Unaffordable in New Jersey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027212202/http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 |date=2007-10-27 }}, [[Alison Littell McHose]] press release dated June 11, 2007 on PoliticsNJ.com. Accessed June 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have accused the decision for being an example of [[judicial activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DF123AF937A15751C0A960948260 "Judicial Duty in New Jersey"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 1986. Accessed June 22, 2007. "For 11 years, New Jersey's Supreme Court has struggled with the constitutional issues implicit in the desire of Mount Laurel, a Burlington County township, to zone out low-income housing. For its labor the court earned its share of criticism for ''judicial activism.'' Last week, it yielded supervision of housing to a new state agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]]. That was no defeat for judicial activism but a handsome vindication of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s judicial response to the Fair Housing Act===

The New Jersey Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature's adoption of the Fair Housing Act. A number of trial court decisions had denied transfer of pending cases to COAH under the manifest injustice standard, but the Supreme Court read that term very narrowly and ordered the cases transferred. The trial courts were directed to conform their rulings with regard to calculation of each municipality's obligation and how to meet it to COAH's regulations and the statute was found facially constitutional and interpreted to grant COAH ample authority, such as restraining the use of scarce resources (sewer capacity, potable water, land) for other than providing affordable housing, to assure that affordable housing might actually be built.

==The Council on Affordable Housing (COAH)==

COAH is a currently defunct government agency created in the 1980s to administer Mt. Laurel requirements. Some have argued it needs reinvigoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/07/21/explainer-coming-to-terms-with-the-intricacies-of-fair-housing-after-coah/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fair Share Housing Center==
The Fair Share Housing Center, or FSHC, is a Cherry Hill-based nonprofit organization founded in 1975 that litigates against towns in enforcement of fair housing development.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Fund for New Jersey's Support of a Housing Rights Group https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/housing/2014/10/7/behind-the-fund-for-new-jerseys-support-of-a-housing-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have alleged that the FSHC has "ties to developers."&lt;ref&gt;We must stop the affordable housing crisis https://njersy.co/2qut45a via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder's remedy lawsuits==
A "builder's remedy lawsuit" is a New Jersey lawsuit filed by a real estate developer in an attempt to force a New Jersey town to allow the construction of a large, multi-family housing complex that includes some affordable housing alongside ordinary apartments.

Usually, the developer's court papers will make specific mention of the Mt. Laurel doctrine, which holds municipalities responsible for providing affordable housing to low and moderate income households. Some have argued that developers exploit the Mount Laurel doctrine with the builder's remedy and prevent town efforts to combat overdevelopment and sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey's Housing Law Works Too Well, Some Say https://nyti.ms/2uKoAZx&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent "builder's remedy" lawsuits or related concerns include:

*Annandale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/hunterdon/index.ssf/2015/11/beaver_brook_development_likely_topic_in_clinton_t.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bridgewater.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/articles/k-hovnanian-proposes-townhome-development-off-ro&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cranford.  The developers Samuel and Peter Hekemian sued the Township of Cranford to allow a mass-density development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2008/10/hekemian_proposes_419_units_me.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case case=4188147394512128653&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cranfordtaxpayers.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; One Cranford local opined that the builder's remedy "takes the power from our township engineers, public safety officials, board of education members and budget offices and gives it to the S. Hekemian Group, a Paramus-based builder of apartment complexes. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. It is a court order based on what they refer to as builder remedy litigation. Apparently, progress is only found in concrete."&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_brian_campbell/2013/03/cranford_-_a_town_is_citified.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emerson. Local officials expressed concerns over impact of Mount Laurel on development of a 19-acre patch of woods that town officials have been trying to turn into a park.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/03/nyregion/new-jersey-s-housing-law-works-too-well-some-say.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Livingston. Despite the efforts of the Livingston-Short Hills Coalition, affiliates of the [[Kushner Companies]] filed an affordable housing suit to build developments in the town.&lt;ref&gt;https://patch.com/new-jersey/livingston/millburn-responds-to-public-on-affordable-housing-case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/08/livingston_makes_deal_to_allow.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Millburn.  Residents of [[Millburn, New Jersey]] objected to a proposed land development by Canoe Brook, which would create a 250-room hotel, 200 residential units and a multi-deck parking structure adjacent to the Mall at Short Hills.;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njbiz.com/article/20151110/NJBIZ01/151119977/carl-goldberg-at-the-intersection-of-development-and-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/millburn-slash-short-hills/articles/millburn-residents-say-no-to-new-housing-developm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Montvale. The S. Hekemian Group filed to intervene in Montvale's affordable-housing litigation to build 1,000 units, arguing the borough "is in violation of its constitutional duty to create sufficient realistic opportunities" for affordable housing. In June 2017, Mayor Mike Ghassali stated, "Now we are on a path to spend untold amounts of time, money and borough resources to defend our town from a monstrous development that would change our community forever" regarding the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/06/30/developer-seeks-build-1-000-housing-units-montvale-property/442753001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/04/20/montvale-seeks-best-outcome-affordable-housing-plan/100616524/&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Milford.  Despite objections from a community group, "Stop Overdevelopment New Milford,",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/SODofNewMilford/&lt;/ref&gt; the developer S.Hekemian Group (SHG), led by Robert S. Hekemian and Peter Hekemian, brought a Mount Laurel builder's remedy suit against [[New Milford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/12/development_of_14-acre_site_splits_north_jersey_to.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "I certainly do feel I have a gun to my head" said New Milford's mayor, Ann Subrizi at the close of 2016.  The township ultimately settled, causing development of one of the last undeveloped tracts of land in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freitnj.com/about-freit; http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/04/20/montvale-seeks-best-outcome-affordable-housing-plan/100616524/&lt;/ref&gt;
*West Orange.  The Fair Share Housing Center,and Garden Homes, an affiliate of the [[Zygi Wilf|Wilf family]], owners of the [[Minnesota Vikings]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Wilf]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} have brought legal action to create more affordable housing units in [[West Orange, New Jersey]].

==Regional Contribution Agreements (RCAs)==

In 1985, the Fair Housing Act created the now-repealed Regional Contribution Agreement system.  The RCAs meant that towns could pay to get out of up to half of their affordable housing obligation by funding affordable housing elsewhere as required by the New Jersey Supreme Court's Mt. Laurel decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njfuture.org/2007/01/31/rcas-regional-contribution-agreements/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, at the behest of the Fair Share Housing Center's Peter O' Connor and over the objections of some suburban Democrats, Governor Corzine signed a law barring RCAs. A500. He signed A-500 into law during a ceremony at Fair Share Housing Development's Ethel R. Lawrence Homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_john_atlas/2008/07/new_jersey_regional_coalition.html&lt;  ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/A0500/500_U1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/05/26/nj-gubernatorial-primary-guadagno-ciattarelli/102188626/&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have demanded that RCAs be returned to cut down on sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/05/23/letter-bring-back-rcas-affordable-housing/337819001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newjerseyconferenceofmayors.com/magazine/winter_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

In 1983, the NJ Supreme Court cautioned that, in requiring affordable housing, our State Constitution "does not require bad planning.  It does not require suburban spread.  It does not require rural municipalities to encourage large scale housing developments.  It does not require wasteful extension of roads and needless construction of sewer and water facilities for the out-migration of people from the cities and the suburbs.  There is nothing in our Constitution that says that we cannot satisfy our constitutional obligation to provide lower income housing and, at the same time, plan the future of the state intelligently."&lt;ref&gt;Southern Burlington County, et al. v. Township of Mount Laurel, et al., 92 N.J. 158, 238 (1983) (Mt Laurel II).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some commentators have denounced the environmental impact of the current regime. As the result of one successful builder's remedy lawsuit brought by S. Hekemian Group, developers may construct a 360-unit, high density housing development in [[Cranford, New Jersey]] next to a flood plain. Some assert such developments could worsen flooding in an already flood-prone area that was ravaged by [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mulshine, State Wants to Flood Cranford with High-Density Housing, THE STAR-LEDGER, September 7, 2011, http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2011/09/state_wants_to_flood_cranford.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New Jersey residents assert they fear sprawl, the destruction of historic New Jersey small town architecture, and crowding: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As an environmental scientist, I am concerned with the question of how many residents can be sustained before we reach an environmental tipping point. When do our water systems fail to provide the supply needed (remember the Bergen County dire drought warning last October?); when does the volume of traffic finally overwhelm our existing roadways and extend commuting times to impossible limits (remember the last time you sat in local traffic?); when does the air quality become too unhealthy to breath (remember the ozone and poor air-quality alerts just last month?); how many people can actually be sustained with a reasonable quality of life within our municipalities, counties and state?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/06/22/letter-schepisi-leads-important-discussion-housing/417571001/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One Parsippany resident stated, "I'm very frustrated that this significant tract of undeveloped land is being razed for development when so much property in Parsippany lies vacant," said Dave Kaplan, of the Stop the Overdevelopment at Waterview opposition group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/07/06/controversial-whole-foods-project-breaks-ground-parsippany/455311001/&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club applauded Christie's efforts to reform affordable housing law in 2010: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The current COAH law has had a bigger impact on land use and development than any other law in New Jersey's history. The Sierra Club strongly supports a requirement for affordable housing. As towns grow, they must provide a fair share of it. But the need for affordable housing should not undermine the environmental protections given to wetlands, flood plains, steep slopes, stream buffers that protect water supplies, ocean-fronts, and endangered species habitat. And no homes should be built where water supply is at critically low levels. Furthermore, new housing should be located where jobs are, to reduce the carbon footprints and pollution associated with automobile commuting.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Essential in Affordable Housing Review.http://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/new-jersey-chapter/njs_sierran/Sierran_10B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present-day demands for legislative reform==
Some believe the NJ Supreme Court seeks legislative action to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine based on recent rulings, as of mid-2017:

=== January 2017 NJ Supreme Court decision ===
In January 2017, the NJ Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that towns had to consider any historic failure to provide affordable housing.  As one commentator put it, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This case resolved affordable housing regulation debates that have been ongoing since 1999. However, the Court provided no guidance on the method of implementation of affordable housing accommodations that it now requires of municipalities. This decision leaves numerous unanswered questions and it will depend heavily on the Legislature to issue reform of affordable housing requirements. This decision requires implementation of affordable housing accommodations into township plans that have not otherwise considered them since 1999. It is likely that the open spaces in towns will now be filled with affordable housing units, which will bring an influx of population to municipalities. ...We will need to watch the Legislature to see how and if it will alter the current affordable housing regulations to comply with the Court's recent ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawgapc.com/blog/affordable-housing-in-new-jersey/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MaryAnn Spoto, N.J. on the hook for thousands more affordable housing units, Supreme Court says http://s.nj.com/SHt7UaT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Cook, Two River Times, http://tworivertimes.com/holmdel-talks-affordable-housing-with-residents/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Katzban, Archive: Confusion over COAH spreads https://njersy.co/2t98Tyn via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Symons, NJ Supreme Court says towns must catch up on affordable housing http://nj1015.com/nj-supreme-court-says-towns-must-catch-up-on-affordable-housing/?trackback=twitter_top @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In its January 2017 opinion, the NJ Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature to re-approach the affordable housing issue: "We recognize, as we have before, that the Legislature is not foreclosed from considering alternative methods for calculating and assigning a municipal fair share of affordable housing, and to that end, we welcome legislative attention to this important social and economic constitutional matter," Justice LaVecchia wrote.&lt;ref&gt;In re Declaratory Judgment Actions Filed by Various Muns., 446 N.J.Super. 259, 281 (App. Div. 2016), aff'd as modified on other grounds, 227 N.J. 508 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Rizzo, N.J. Supreme Court: Towns must have affordable housing http://northjersy.news/2k05wks via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislator outcry===
A Morris County Freeholder candidate,  Harding Committeeman Nicolas Platt, proposed in May 2017 that all mayors state-wide conduct a sit-in in Trenton and refuse to leave the statehouse until legislators acted to reduce the overdevelopment impact of the builder's remedy issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/05/30/freeholder-candidate-rallying-mayors-housing-issue/355671001/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen and Passaic County Assemblywoman [[Holly Schepisi]] argued in a July 2017 opinion piece that reform was urgently needed: "If built, the number of new homes alone would far exceed all the homes in the entire borough of Manhattan," she stated, calling the issue one of overdevelopment "madness."

In the summer of 2017, Schepisi held the first of several planned public hearing in Paramus with various civic leaders on mandated affordable housing with local mayors and other state assembly members.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblywoman hears mayors concerns on court-mandated affordable housing https://njersy.co/2syG9yI&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is long past time for the Legislature to act, and block [the nonprofit group Fair Share Housing Center] from their objective of destroying our suburban communities," said one mayor at the hearing according to the press. "We really need action. Nobody has done what they need to do."

Schepisi stated she invited the Fair Share Housing Center to attend but received a letter declining an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/16/assemblywoman-hears-mayors-concerns-court-mandated-affordable-housing/401538001/;
http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/17/affordable-housing-advocates-takes-aim-assemblywoman-over-forum/404679001/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Somerset County, Montgomery Township Mayor Ed Trzaska said the influx of apartment complex development would ruin the rural character of the area, "overwhelm the township's infrastructure, greatly increase property taxes and burden the school system and negatively impact the quality of life in the township."
.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing mandate threatens quality of life, mayor says http://s.nj.com/UYpPrLP&lt;/ref&gt;

In Union County, in the summer of 2017, the Clark town council issued a unanimous resolution demanding for the state legislature to take action to reform the affordable housing issue; the mayor stated that otherwise, "Union County will look like Queens in 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;State Legislators: 'Lead or Get Out of the Way' https://www.tapinto.net/towns/clark/articles/clarks-mayor-bonaccorso-to-state-legislators-l&lt;/ref&gt;

In Berkeley Heights in Union County in June 2017, Council President Marc Faecher said he considered the Legislature's failure to act on overdevelopment to be an "abject failure by our state government."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/berkeley-heights/articles/affordable-housing-the-who-what-when-and-why-e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public outcry==

In June 2018, NJ 101.5 radio host [[Bill Spadea]] advocated for a constitutional amendment to revoke the doctrine, arguing the imposition of unnecessary development increased tax burdens unfairly.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing law making NJ un-affordable (Opinion) http://nj1015.com/affordable-house-making-nj-un-affordable-opinion @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional town partnership approaches==
In the summer of 2017, the mayors of five Bergen County towns announced they were "teaming up to take a regional perspective on affordable housing, in an effort to find reasonable solutions that will protect the integrity of their communities."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2017-07-08/5-towns-team-up-to-make-progress-on-affordable-housing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vacant and abandoned properties==

"Owing to its ongoing high rate of residential foreclosures, New Jersey has become known the Land of the Zombie Houses."&lt;ref&gt;https://articles.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/07/dont_give_nj_zombie_homes_the_upper_hand_editorial.amp&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have argued that the deluge of abandoned and vacant properties in New Jersey should be taken into account before forced building occurs in less crowded areas.  They have also suggested that the state step up funding for code enforcement to reduce burdens of urban blight on attractive home development, including enforcement on absentee landlords.  The City of Newark is "working with the Urban League to identify vacant or abandoned properties that can be sold to small developers to then sell at cost to residents. About 16 percent of Newark's housing is vacant and the city has a high eviction and foreclosure rate according to a Rutgers report. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/02/a_year_later_newark_sweetheart_land_deals_harbor_m.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://urbanomnibus.net/2016/02/why-hasnt-anyone-built-on-newarks-1000-love-lots/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/newark/articles/new-quality-of-life-initiative-will-ramp-up-code&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2018/04/can_newark_be_a_model_city_to_curb_against_gentrif.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick Picks Committee, Law Firm to Move on Abandoned Houses https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/articles/new-brunswick-picks-committee-law-firm-to-move-o-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayoral Musings: Vacant and Abandoned http://www.snjtoday.com/story/38565358/mayoral-musings-vacant-and-abandoned#.W0d-k2SYxc8.twitter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacant and afraid: Getting a grip on abandoned homes | Opinion http://s.nj.com/gCDW8TI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-level (or multilevel) governance''' is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Political scientists [[Liesbet Hooghe]] and [[Gary Marks]] developed the concept of multi-level governance in the early 1990s and have continuously been contributing to the research program in a series of articles (see Bibliography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piattoni|first=Simona|title=Multi-level Governance: a Historical and Conceptual Analysis|journal=European Integration|year=2009|volume=2|series=31|pages=163–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their theory resulted from the study of the new structures that were put in place by the EU ([[Maastricht Treaty]]) in 1992. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It "illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority".

==Origins and significance of the concept of multi-level governance==
'Multi-level governance' is a recent concept, having first entered the lexicon of political science around fifteen years ago as comparativists became re-acquainted with European integration and discovered that authority was shifting not only from central states up to Europe, but also down to subnational authorities. The first efforts to understand this were descriptive, spawning concepts that have generated an extensive literature. Multi-level, polycentric, and multi-layered governance emphasize the dispersion of decision making from the local to the global level. In recent years these concepts have cross-pollinated subfields of political science including [[European studies]] and [[decentralization]], [[federalism]] and [[international organization]], [[public policy]] (e.g. [[environmental policy]], [[health policy]]) and public-private governance, [[local governance]] and [[transnational governance]].

The authors of a recent survey of the literature on the structure of government conclude that ‘We attribute many of the recent “cutting-edge” theoretical contributions in political science to studies of “multi-level governance”’ and they note that although students of federalism ‘considered the current subject matter of their field to be based on well-defined, well rooted and broadly accepted ideas, they were nevertheless open to a new flowering of federal theory as a result of fertilization by these new MLG theoretical developments’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Michael|author2=Lisa Turkewitsch|title=The Concept of Multilevel Governance in Studies of Federalism|journal=paper presented at the International Political Science Association|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing entirely new under the sun. Though scarcely recognized at the time, this research revives a rich tradition in political science represented by [[Karl Deutsch]] (1966) on the effect of societal transactions on government structure, [[Robert Dahl]] (1973) on the virtues and vices of multilevel democracy, and [[Stein Rokkan]] (1983) on identity and territorial politics.

==Application of the concept==
===Multi-level governance and the European Union===
The study of the [[European Union]] has been characterized by two different theoretical phases. The first phase was dominated by studies from the field of [[international relations]]; in the second phase these studies were revised and insights from among others, [[public policy]] were added. The most straightforward way of understanding this theoretical shift is to see it as a move away from treating the EU as an [[international organisation]] similar to others (e.g. [[NATO]]) to seeing it as something unique among international organisations. The uniqueness of the EU relates both to the nature and to the extent of its development. This means that in some areas of activity the EU displays more properties related to national political systems than to those of international organisations.

The theory of multi-level governance belongs to the second phase. Multi-level governance characterizes the changing relationships between actors situated at different territorial levels, both from the public and the private sectors. The multi-level governance theory crosses the traditionally separate domains of domestic and international politics and highlights the increasingly fading distinction between these domains in the context of [[European integration]]. 
Multi-level governance was first developed from a study of EU policy and then applied to EU [[decision-making]] more generally. An early explanation referred to multi-level governance as ''a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers''&lt;ref&gt;G. Marks, 'Structural policy and Multi-level governance in the EC' in: A. Cafruny and G. Rosenthal (ed.) ''The State of the European Community: The Maastricht Debate and Beyond'' (Boulder 1993) pp.391–411&lt;/ref&gt; and described how ''supranational, national, regional, and local governments are enmeshed in territorially overarching policy networks''.&lt;ref&gt;I.Bache, ''Europeanization and Britain: Towards Multi-level governance?'' Paper prepared for the EUSA 9th Biennal Conference in Austin, Texas, 31–2 March April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emphasized both the increasingly frequent and complex interactions between governmental actors and the increasingly important dimension of non-state actors that are mobilized in cohesion policy-making and in the EU policy more generally. As such, multi-level governance raised new and important questions about the role, power and authority of states.

No other international form of cooperation is characterized by such far-reaching integration as the [[European Union]]. This becomes evident by the number and scope of policy areas covered by the European Union and the way policy is developed. The European Union can be characterised by a mix of classic intergovernmental cooperation between sovereign states and far-reaching supranational integration.

Multi-level governance within the EU is understood as respecting competences, sharing responsibilities and cooperating between the various levels of governance: the EU, the Member States and the regional and local authorities. In this context, it refers to the principle of [[subsidiarity]], which places decisions as close as possible to the citizens and ensures that that action at Union level is justified in light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Multilevel governance: building Europe in partnership|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice Multilevel Governance within the EU is about participation and coordination between all levels of government both in the decision making process and in the implementation or evaluation of European policies.

The combination of communal decision-making with the wide area of policy areas results in a deep entanglement of the member states’ national policy levels with the European policy level. This entanglement is one of the basic principles of the multi-level governance theory. The multi-level governance theory describes the European Union as a [[political system]] with interconnected institutions that exist at multiple levels and that have unique policy features. The European Union is a political system with a European layer ([[European Commission]], [[European Council]] and [[European Parliament]]), a national layer and a regional layer. These layers interact with each other in two ways: first, across different levels of government (vertical dimension) and second, with other relevant actors within the same level (horizontal dimension).

Concerning with the changes of the institutional design of the European Union, the current model governance has been shaped as a setup of constraints upon political margin of discretion, applying the central tenet of ordoliberalism with the aim to use strong rules in order to reduce the discretionary exercise of powers by institutions so as to avoid an arbitrary use of them. This principle has achieved an extreme effect at the European level, that one not to avoid arbitrary use of political powers but to keep political responsibility and participation out of the decision-making process. As Laruffa concludes: 
"It is quite clear that such a model of governance, which is made only by rules without any role for a democratic policy-making process, imposes a de facto limit to on the political rights of the European citizens. This means that there is a control exercised by rules over the European citizens rather than a control by the European citizens over rules and policies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressiveeconomy.eu/sites/default/files/papers/Matteo%20Laruffa%20The%20European%20economic%20governance.pdf Laruffa Matteo, The European Economic Governance: Problems and Proposals for Institutional Innovations, Winning Paper for the Annual Meeting Progressive Economy, Brussels, 6 March 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Union: Multilevel Governance in Practise'''

Within the European Union nearly 95,000 local and regional authorities currently have significant powers in key sectors such as education, the environment, economic development, town and country planning, transport, public services and social policies. These local and regional authorities implement nearly 70% of EU legislation. They help ensure the exercise of European democracy and citizenship. Special rights and competences for regions, cities and communities are supposed to enable and preserve diversity of governance at local and regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande and Delebarre|title=Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multilevel Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; By thinking beyond traditional EU - Member States relations the EU multi-level governance concept further strengthens regional and transnational cooperation. In a broader sense, this concept also includes the participation of non-state players like economic and social partners and civil society in the decision making process of all levels of governance(thus taking up the vertical and horizontal dimensions of multilevel governance).

'''The Treaty of Lisbon as an important step towards Multilevel Governance'''

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] represents an important step towards institutional recognition of multi-level governance in the way the European Union operates. It strengthens the competences and influence of local and regional authorities in the Community decision-making process giving roles to national (and regional) parliaments and the [[Committee of the Regions]] and enshrines the territorial dimension of the European Union, notably territorial cohesion as part of the process of European integration. The Committee of the Regions has established a system to monitor the compliance with the subsidiarity thorough the whole EU policy and law making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of the Regions: Subsidiarity Monitoring Network|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/networks/Pages/subsidiarity-monitoring-network.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multilevel governance within the EU as an ongoing process'''

Nevertheless, multi-level governance within the EU is a dynamic and ongoing process. On 16 June 2009 the Committee of the Regions adopted a White Paper on multi-level governance which recommended specific mechanisms and instruments for stimulating all stages of the European decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|last2=Delebarre|first2=Michel|title=The Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multi-level Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document, together with the follow-up opinion "Building a European culture of Multilevel Governance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|title=Building a European Culture of Multilevel Governance: Follow-up to the Committee of the Regions' White Paper|url=http://www.toad.cor.europa.eu/ViewDoc.aspx?doc=cdr%5ccivex-v%5cdossiers%5ccivex-v-020%5cEN%5cCDR273-2011_FIN_AC_EN.doc&amp;docid=2829023|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed the Committee’s political commitment to Multi-level Governance, proposing a first political project for Building Europe in partnership. As a follow up to the 2009 White paper on Multi-level Governance, the Committee developed a "Scoreboard on Multi-level Governance" to monitor on a yearly basis the development of multi-level governance at European Union level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=The Multilevel Governance Scoreboard|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg-scoreboard.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe'''

On 3 April 2014 the Committee of the Regions adopted a Charter for Multi-level Governance calling public authorities of all levels of governance to use and promote multi-level governance in their future undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Charter for Multilevel Governance in Europe|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/charter-for-multiLevel-governance.aspx|website=www.cor.europa,eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter is open for signature to:

• all European Union local and regional authorities;

• European and national associations of local and regional authorities, as well as local and regional authorities' network are invited to officially commit to multilevel governance principles, giving the Charter their formal support;

• National and European political figures wishing to back up the Charter are also invited to declare their support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=New|first1=Europe|title=CoR: Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/cor-charter-multilevel-governance-europe|accessdate=3 April 2014|agency=New Europe|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level governance beyond the European Union===
The point of departure for multi-level governance was Europe, but recent books and articles have dealt with the dispersion of authority away from central states in Latin America, Asia, and North America. Decentralization has been at least as marked in Latin America as in Europe over the past two decades, and several Asian countries have decentralized in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand &amp; Laliberte 2010; Bird &amp; Vaillancourt 2008; Eaton 2008; Falleti 2010; Smoke et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion of authority above the national state is most evident in the EU, but it is not sui generis. A recent survey counts 32 regional IGOs pooling authority over quite wide areas of policy and which cover all but a handful of states in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Goertz &amp; Powers 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The number of governmental and non-governmental [[international organizations]] has increased markedly over the past two decades, as has their scope, range and intrusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya &amp; Johnston 2007; Farrell et al. 2005; Hurrell 1993; Volgy et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Crossborder interdependence – from migration to climate change to terrorism – has stimulated regional organization in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brondizio, Ostrom, Young 2009; Hurrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal dimension of multi-level governance==
The "vertical" dimension refers to the linkages between higher and lower levels of government, including their institutional, financial, and informational aspects. Here, local capacity building and incentives for effectiveness of sub national levels of government are crucial issues for improving the quality and coherence of public policy.

The "horizontal" dimension refers to co-operation arrangements between regions or between municipalities. These agreements are increasingly common as a means by which to improve the effectiveness of local public service delivery and implementation of development strategies.

==Consequences and practical relevance of multi-level governance==
There has been an intensification of research on the consequences as well as the character of multi-level governance. The concept was developed as a tool of pure research, but it now motivates policy makers. From the late 1990s the European Commission began to refer to its own mission as one of achieving multilevel governance, especially in cohesion policy.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardi (2005: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Commission set up a committee on multilevel governance to contribute to its White Paper on governance. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, claims that ‘the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge’ and that, in the current economic crisis, 'multilevel governance must be a priority'.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2008 resolution, the European Parliament called on the member states ‘to develop as quickly as possible the practical measures set out in the First Action Programme . . . with a view to strengthening multilevel governance’.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament resolution of 21 October 2008 on governance and partnership at national and regional levels and a basis for projects in the sphere of regional policy (2008/2064(INI)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 344 representatives of elected regional and local authorities across the EU approved a resolution on a 'European Union Charter for Multilevel Governance', which would bring localities and regions into European democratic decision making.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has been taken up by several political parties including the European Peoples Party, representing Christian democratic parties in the European Parliament, which recently stated that ‘multilevel governance should be one of the guiding principles of the EU, an integral part of any European strategy or policy where local and regional authorities are widely implicated, and monitored closely to ensure that it is indeed being put into practice on the ground’.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/News/Pages/18October2011.aspx (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

International organizations have also taken positions on the issue. In 2009, the United Nations Development Programme released a report, ‘Delivering Human Security through Multilevel Governance’, which argued that ‘the two-level approach to international relations . . . is being replaced by a much more complex multilevel system of governance that also involves local, sub-national providers of public goods as well as regional governance actors acting at a supranational but not a global level’. The World Bank has commissioned a series of studies examining multilevel governance; the United Nations has a research and training institute on comparative regional integration that studies ‘multilevel regulatory processes and the relations between sub- and supra-national regional governance’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103529/http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }} (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD has created a directorate on multilevel governance.

However, the consequences of multilevel governance are debated. In the eyes of its detractors, multilevel governance exacerbates corruption (Treisman 2000), leads to gridlock (Scharpf 2007), engenders moral hazard (Rodden 2006), constrains redistribution (Obinger, Castles, Leibfried 2005), obfuscates accountability (Peters &amp; Pierre 2004), and wastes money (Berry 2009). Research on both causes and consequences of multi-level governance is ongoing and more and more information about the subnational as well as the international dimension of multi-level governance is available in the context of larger data sets.&lt;ref&gt;For a current large-scale research project on multi-level governance see http://www.falw.vu/~mlg/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Amongst others, the project codes regional authority in 74 countries between 1950 and 2010 as well as international authority in 72 [[international governmental organizations]] from 1950 to 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=2011|volume=20|issue=6|ssrn=1970698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-level governance of climate change in cities ===
Global climate change is being contributed to by ever increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from decisions and activities of individuals and organisations at local, regional, national and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|author2=Kristine Kern|title=Local Government and the Governing of Climate Change in Germany and the UK|journal=Urban Studies|year=2006|volume=43|series=12|pages=2237–2259|doi=10.1080/00420980600936491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are suggested to contribute up to 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, reflecting the increasing proportions of global populations living and working in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2010|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we know, tackling climate change is an extensive, time-consuming and costly task, a task that cannot be achieved solely through the policy implementation and regulation from central governments and bodies alone. It has become increasingly clear that nation-states will be unable to commit to and meet international targets and agreements for offsetting climate change without engaging with the activity of sub-national and local action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereby, warranting the extreme importance of multi-level governance of climate change within cities.

Forms of governance at multi-levels have taken off increasingly at the local scale, building upon the notion of ‘think global, act local’, in cities in particular. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stem from certain activities that originate from specific places, bringing about thought that the local scale is the most appropriate political scale to produce necessary offsets in emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are exemplary of such specific places in which local governance action can and will help reduce GHG emissions. The levels of governance authority handed down to local governments within cities has been perceived to out-do policy goals within the national and international arena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some local governments taking on their own initiatives for tackling urban climate change. This sets an important stance to which the local scale of multi-level governance is important for tackling global climate change within the urban arena.

Four distinct modes of governance exist within the dynamics of climate change in cities. Each stems from the local level with the ability of being implemented on multi-scales to mitigate and adapt to urban climate change. Self-governing is the capacity of local governments to govern its own activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as improving energy efficiency within a designated city, without the burdening pressure to meet targets of increased energy efficiencies set by national governments. A form of self-governing within multi-level systems is horizontal collaboration where cities may collaborate with regions demonstrating multi-levels of governance to tackle urban climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; imperative to the success of city climate change policy. Governing through enabling is the co-ordination and facilitation of partnerships with private organisations by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kern|first = Kristine|title = Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal = Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change.|year = 2008|url = |last2 = Gotelind Alber}}&lt;/ref&gt; National governments also implement this mode of governance to implement policy and action within cities. Governing through provision, a form of vertical collaboration along with governing through enabling, applies itself to the multi-levels of governance. Climate change in cities is tackled here through the shaping of and delivery of services and resources, with additional support aided to local governments from regional and national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, another form of vertical collaboration, is governing through regulation. Such regulation characterises traditional forms of authoritative governance, exemplifying local to nation-state relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost nearly covering the entirety of the multi-level governance scale.

=== Subnational Integration of Climate Actions ===
Within the various initiatives of the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership ([[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)|LEDS GP]]), the thematic working group on Subnational Integration ([http://ledsgp.org/working-groups/subnational-integration-of-leds/ SNI-WG]) was created in 2013 to support learning and facilitate collaboration between national and subnational governments for accelerated effective climate actions. The SNI-WG realizes several activities at global and regional levels including organizing panels at multiple regional and global forums, hosting peer-learning discussions, publishing reports and case studies, along with facilitating technical workshops, webinars and providing advisory Remote Expert Assistance on LEDS ([http://ledsgp.org/assistance REAL]) support upon request. This process has generated observations, feedback and insights on the potential of the vertical integration and coordination of subnational climate actions to accelerate and scale-up both local and global emission reductions. Improving coordination and integration between the different levels of authority in a country is critical in determining both national and global capacity to govern climate change. City and subnational governments require support from the national government, and vice versa, in order to design and implement intersectoral policies and actions for domestic decarbonization pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/multilevel-governance-low-emission-development-lac/?loclang=en_gb|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America: Multilevel dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilevel governance theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that the coordination and vertical integration of climate actions can:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Coordination-and-vertical-integration-of-climate-actions-web-final.pdf|title = The Coordination and Vertical Integration of Climate Actions|last = Muller|first = Scott A|date = 2015|journal = LEDS GP Working Paper|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help alleviate domestic political constraints.
* Raise national government ambitions for more aggressive Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ([http://unfccc.int/focus/indc_portal/items/8766.php INDCs]) and [[Greenhouse gas|GHG mitigation]] commitments.
* Scale up, as well as unlock, additional and new mitigation opportunities at the subnational level.
* Accelerate the effective implementation of national targets, strategies and development priorities by “localizing” them. This can also provide opportunities for “bundled approaches” and increasing “co-benefits” by linking local priorities with diverse development objectives Improve the consistency of sub-national and national climate data sets; strengthening MRV.
* Create a more bankable “low-risk” environment for infrastructure finance and private sector investments.
* Enable safe learning and strengthen domestic institutions.
* Address recognized challenges and limits to sub-national [[Non-state actor|non-state actor (NSA)]] climate actions.
* Expand and accelerate the flow of international public and private climate finance to cities, urban infrastructure and local priorities.
* Help address some of the persistent collective action challenges to multilateral climate agreements.

==== Cities for Climate Protection program ====

The [[Cities for Climate Protection program|Cities for Climate Protection]] (CCP) program is one example of multi-level governance of climate change. Roles and responsibilities are shared within different levels of governance, from state actors to non-state actors (Betsill &amp; Bulkeley, 2006). Membership consists of 40 large cities worldwide ([[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]]), with local governments often working in close connection with national governments. However, the CCP can overlook the activity of nation-states giving local governments the opportunity to amend positions of policy implementation and regulation for offsetting urban climate change, which may be of a controversial nature to national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus illustrating even though climate change in cities can be addressed and governed at local, regional, national and international levels, it does not always follow a hierarchical order.

==Criticism on multi-level governance theory==
Many of the problems associated with multi-level governance revolve around the notion of levels. The very idea of levels and levels of analysis is imbued with hierarchical implications. However, different levels or social spaces often interact or cut across with one another in complex ways that are not strictly hierarchical. To what extent can 'levels' be identified at all? The notion that international bodies constitute a discrete level of authority and governance is contestable. International regulatory networks may not be separate sources of authority but instead represent the reconstitution of state authority and the pursuit of state-level governance by other means. While territorial levels make sense when we are referring to public forms of authority, they seem less compatible with private and market forms of authority.

Another criticism on the theory of multi-level governance is that it's not really a proper theory, rather that it is an approach. The main difference between multi-level governance and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between [[intergovernmentalism]] and [[supranationalism]] and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the [[sovereignty]] of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.

The identification of partial political measures and general macroeconomics is divided on diverse decisional levels. National governments maintain an important decisional role but the control unlocalizes at supranational level. Individual national sovereignty is dilated in this decisional process and the supranational institutions have an autonomic role.

== Arguments for multi-level governance ==
=== Security ===
The use of security as a means of instituting ideals of democracy. The shift to a multi-level governance perspective of enforcing the ideals prevents one nation from imposing its personal agenda or perception of what these ideals entail. Additionally, the use of supranational judgement creates a uniformity for the international portrayal and enforcement of democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of multi-level security governance allows for a pooling of resources to manage this enforcement, while still allowing States to act autonomously. The supranational level merely acts as a medium for allowing the promotion of mutually beneficial security. With the rise of transnational threats, a method for ensuring international security without the reliance on a single policing nation is required. Multi-level governance provides functional means of dealing with the deficiencies of merely national actors dealing with transnational issues on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Interdependence ===
The preliminary notion of the European Union was the European Coal and Steel Community. The union was between the nations of France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. Striving for the concept of European peace the nations sought to bind the nations through economic interdependence. Coming about as a reaction to World War II, the ECSC created an economic tie for previously independent nations. It provided the European peace the nations sought, and would evolve into the European Union seen today. It was not a new concept as trade has historically been viewed as a catalyst for peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating multi-level governance is shown to create the necessary ties for fostering economic interdependence to a greater degree than mere trade between nations. The linking of nations through a sharing of capital creates an adhesiveness that deters the escalation of political conflict from reaching a state of war. On the international stage, political conflict leads to war as a result of perception of potential gains being larger than the opportunity costs. Interdependence created by multi-level governance is shown to greatly reduce the probability of war by increasing the opportunity costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in opportunity cost to war can be viewed from even the economic ties perspective. It is seen by noting that economic ties between participatory nations makes the cost of disruption to the system through the escalation of the political sphere towards war illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Jean-Marc|last2=Ripsman|first2=Norrin|title=Qualitative Research on Economic Interdependence and Conflict: Overcoming Methodological Hurdles|journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate|date=2003|pages=310–323|jstor=10.3998/mpub.11952.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
Multi-level government has shown to increase efficiency of governance by creating an agreed upon standard for the implementation and execution of policies. To elaborate, the establishment of a supranational institution can be used to set standards for the way cooperating nations run their environmental, industrial, and safety policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor for multi-level governance is the terms the national actors agree to when forming the supranational institution as they will give certain decision making processes to the higher level, and agree to abide by the outcome. Nations consent to the terms as they face a common issue of international policy that has to deal with collective-action problems making it nonsensical to attend to by themselves. Agreements between nations to form a multi-level government creates an efficiency gain that allows them to all share in the positive benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepal Bhasa movement''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: नेपालभाषा आन्दोलन) refers to the struggle for [[linguistic rights]] by its speakers in [[Nepal]] in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbors. The campaign aims to increase the use of Nepal Bhasa in the home, education, government and business. Despite a high level of development, Newar culture and language are both under threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= Between the market and Comrade Mao: Newar cultural activism and ethnic/political movements (Nepal) |last= Grandin |first= Ingemar |date= |website= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newar]]s have been fighting to save their language from the time of the repressive [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime till today, and activists have been jailed, exiled and tortured.&lt;ref name="Hoek, Bert van den and Shrestha, Balgopal"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Education in the Mother Tongue: The Case of Nepal Bhasa (Newari)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_22_01_06.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1995}} Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sthavir| first =Dharmalok| url = http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/regmi/pdf/regmi_09.doc| title =A Journey to Great China| work = Regmi Research Series| publisher = Regmi Research| date=1 December 1977| accessdate = 11 October 2012}} Pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have even petitioned the Supreme Court to have its use barred.

The movement arose against the suppression of the language by the state that began with the rise of the [[Shah dynasty]] in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846-1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system (1960-1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Phatte Bahadur|title=Nepali Biharya Aitihasik Pristabhumi ("Historical Background of Nepali Bihar") |url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Jaa|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Pala, Tri-Chandra Campus|date=September 1979}} Page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbors grew following mass migration into the [[Kathmandu Valley]], leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority in their homeland. During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Nepal Bhasa dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-occupation-of-the-kathmandu..pdf |title=The Occupation of the Kathmandu Valley and its Fallout |last=Malla |first=Kamal P. |date= |website= |page=3 |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been listed as being "definitely endangered" by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap&amp;lid=1117 |title = UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |date = |accessdate= 27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language movement can be divided into the following eras.

*Shah/Rana era
*First democratic era
*Panchayat era
*Second democratic era
*Loktantra era

==Shah/Rana era==

''Jheegu Sahitya'' ("Our Literature"). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, development of the language and literature was stifled.

During the period 1909 to 1941 known as the Renaissance era, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers [[Nisthananda Bajracharya]], [[Siddhidas Mahaju]], [[Jagat Sundar Malla]] and [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]] are honored as the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]]. [[Shukraraj Shastri]] and [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]] were also at the forefront of the movement.

In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled ''Nepal Bhasa Vyakarana'' which was published from [[Kolkata]], [[India]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name "Nepal Bhasa" in place of the [[Khas]] imposed term "Newari".

===Writers jailed===

In 1940, the government mounted a crackdown against democracy activists and writers in which Shukraraj Shastri was hanged. A large number of authors were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. Dharmacharya was jailed for three months. [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] was sentenced to six years, [[Siddhicharan Shrestha]] was sentenced to 18 years, [[Phatte Bahadur Singh]] was sentenced to life imprisonment and [[Dharma Ratna Yami]] was sentenced to 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Siddhi Charan|title=97 Sal Parva|url= |accessdate= |newspaper=Inap Vol. 1, No. 3|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released in 1945 after serving five years. In prison, Hridaya produced his greatest work [[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html|title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=24 January 2012|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an epic poem on the life of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Lienhard, Siegfried 1992 Page 4"/&gt; Shrestha wrote a collection of poems entitled ''Seeswan'' ("Wax Flower", published in 1948) among other works.

===Monks expelled===

[[Theravada Buddhist]] monks stood up to the Rana regime and published books on Buddhism from India and brought them into Nepal. This led to the [[Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal]]. In 1944, eight monks were expelled for refusing to stop teaching Theravada Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. In 1946, the ban on writing was lifted, and the monks were allowed to return to Nepal following international pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their writings and public activities in Nepal Bhasa had a profound impact on the development of the language.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

===Working abroad===

Nepal Bhasa lovers took the movement to [[India]] and [[Tibet]] where they formed associations to organize writers and bring out publications to escape government suppression in Nepal. Newar merchants based in [[Kolkata]], [[Kalimpong]] and [[Lhasa]] were major patrons of the language movement.

''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'', the first ever magazine in Nepal Bhasa, was published from Kolkata in 1925 by [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]]. He also established a literary organization named Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal (Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Pages 27-28.

In 1944, the Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal went to [[Sarnath]] and formed an organization named Dharmodaya Sabha. In 1947, it launched ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine from [[Kalimpong]] funded by trader Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar. Monk [[Aniruddha Mahathera]] was the first editor.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.''

Newar traders based in Lhasa promoted ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' magazine which launched in Kathmandu in 1951. It was the first Nepal Bhasa magazine to be published from Nepal, and the first editor was a former merchant [[Purna Kaji Tamrakar]].

In 1950, a literary society named Chwasa Pasa (Pen Friend) was formed in [[Kolkata]] by [[Prem Bahadur Kansakar]] and another writer Madan Lochan Singh to bring together writers living in exile. The society moved to Nepal in 1951 after the advent of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First democratic era==

Following the fall of the Ranas and advent of democracy in 1951, there was greater linguistic freedom, and Nepal Bhasa struggled to catch up. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper ''[[Nepal Bhasa Patrika]]'' began publication in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://npi10month.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-nepali-journalism.html| title =History of Nepali Journalism| work = | publisher =Nepal Press Institute| date=15 February 2010| accessdate = 25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio===

State-owned [[Radio Nepal]] began broadcasting the news in Nepal Bhasa once a day in 1951. In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Nepal Bhasa in addition to the Nepali language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools and colleges===

Nepal Bhasa entered a vibrant phase in the educational system. It was included in the curriculum, and Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognized it as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it. In 1953, the government recognized Nepal Bhasa as a spoken language and an oriental language subject. The Nepal Educational Council adopted it as an optional subject.

Following lobbying by language lovers, Nepal Bhasa was included in the course of study at the high school level in 1954, at the intermediate level in 1960 and bachelor level in 1962. And for two decades, Nepal Bhasa was widely taught in schools and colleges in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other parts of Nepal with thousands of students studying it as an optional subject.&lt;ref name="Hoek, Bert van den and Shrestha, Balgopal"/&gt;

==Panchayat era==

In 1960, parliament was abolished, political parties were forbidden and the [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was established. Under this autocratic system, the government followed a one-language policy, and Nepal Bhasa suffered another period of suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawoti| first = Mahendra | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Lsjb4lexL1cJ:homepages.wmich.edu/~mlawoti/documents/PDF%2520Docs/ContentiousPolitics%26democratization.Lawoti.CPDN.Sage.pdf+buddhist+monks+expelled+from+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiqCfNrBWEOZ6J7vIgrqxMtVaKmvuuZHn4vr7DvQWUfsAbu8t6d0JVPUEiJs029IqiE17jUa-PlWyW-P_7yhRQJGCY3TPLi0k8qeFHj3pN33Exmpapqt-C9tohC7csDBREWViLL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTqR7b-EKriitUP0R55RhzLmEtMLA|title = Contentious Politics in Democratizing Nepal | work = | publisher = | date=| accessdate = 3 June 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was gradually pushed out of the media and the educational institutions, triggering protest movements.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictive policy of Panchayat encouraged the formation of literary associations to provide a forum for writers to present their works. In 1962, Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust) was formed in [[Bhaktapur]]. It organized annual literary meets which continue till today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Bhasha literary meet concludes |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8143&amp;cat_id=4|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jah'' magazine===

In 1960, Nepal Bhasa students at Tri-Chandra College in Kathmandu launched an annual magazine named ''Jah'' (ज:) (meaning "light" in Nepal Bhasa) after the college magazine ''Light'' refused to include Nepal Bhasa articles in it. The magazine led to the organization of students interested in Nepal Bhasa in the college. That same year, they started the annual Inter-College Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference and also produced a weekly radio program in Nepal Bhasa on Radio Nepal named ''Jeevan Dabu'' ("Life's stage"). In the successive years, ''Jah'' served as a breeding ground for new writers and language activists.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

===Movement of 1965===

In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality's decision to recognize Nepal Bhasa was revoked. In 1965, the language was banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timalsina|first=Ramji |title=Language and Political Discourse in Nepal|url=http://koshistjames.edu.np/journal/CET_Journal_Vol3_No1.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=CET Journal|publisher=Itahari: Itahari Research Centre, Circle of English Teachers (CET)|date=Spring 2011}} Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gurung |first=Kishor |date=Nov–Dec 1993 |title=What is Nepali Music? |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/himal/pdf/Himal_6_6.pdf |journal=Himal |location=Kathmandu |page=11 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of Nepal Bhasa from the country's only radio station sparked a protest movement which became known as the Movement of 1965 ("Bais Salya Andolan"). The protest took the form of literary meets as other types of demonstrations were prohibited. Literary programs were held weekly in market squares and courtyards where participants recited poems and sang songs containing critical messages.

The government cracked down by putting a number of activists in jail including writers Mangal Man Shakya, Pushpa Gopal Shrestha and Shree Krishna Anu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhist]] monk Bhikshu [[Sudarshan Mahasthavir]] was jailed for six months and six days.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Ishwari Maiya (2010).

Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent campaigners like [[Durga Lal Shrestha]], Hitkar Bir Singh Kansakar and Mangal Man Shakya (of Om Bahal) were forced to go underground. The movement was made leaderless, and it came to a stop after a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maharjan | first = Basanta | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:u07wVOvD30YJ:www.socialinclusion.org.np/download.php%3Fp%3DresearchReport%26f%3D7996_Finalreport.doc+nepal+bhasa+radio+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi9256j5vkAtxFmzLXi31AD1N_do6qcAL7_ULYcy41D7GeijuqJfwFf6QOzNSGbBVqAtC19vXNAftsB0vo841MGc1Igbje0xHXvmIkJtrPZcGLYjePEFO3Vvf1DUbefX-eLE5sX&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzWjezYJYvu6s-gHS7nSKs5N3RFw

The ban on Nepal Bhasa remained, but the 1965 Movement succeeded in raising awareness about linguistic rights and arousing public opinion against the Panchayat regime. Its most important achievement was creating a new generation of writers and campaigners who would take over from the activists who fought for the language during the Rana regime and lead the movement in the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

Page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala]], founded in 1979, is one of the organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights.

===Out of school===

The New Education System Plan brought out in 1971 disrupted the popular study of Nepal Bhasa in educational institutions. Under the plan, vernacular subjects were removed from the curriculum, and students were forced to choose between the mother tongue and technical subjects, leading to Nepal Bhasa being pushed into the background. Student enrolment in the course dropped, resulting in the subject being pulled out of many schools and a further decline in students.

From 1977, students could study Nepal Bhasa at the Master's level; but the university degree was not counted for promotion by the government, and so there were few takers for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hangen| first =Susan| url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/ps034.pdf| title =Creating a "New Nepal": The Ethnic Dimension| work = | publisher =Washington: East-West Center| year=2007| accessdate = 19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thlib.org"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Education in the Mother Tongue: The Case of Nepal Bhasa (Newari) |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_22_01_06.pdf |accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1995}} Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign radio===

In addition to government suppression, Nepal Bhasa has faced opposition from hostile critics. After [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] began broadcasting a weekly half-hour program in Nepal Bhasa on 6 November 1983, opponents in Nepal pressured the radio station to shut it down. Similar opposition led to [[All India Radio]] - Kurseong stopping broadcasting Nepal Bhasa songs during its Nepali service in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dakalay Nhapan|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Bhintuna-Pau|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala |year=1993}} Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Inap|publisher= |date=22 February 1984}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second democratic era==

Arbitrary actions increased resentment towards Panchayat. In 1988, police arrested participants in a procession marking the birth anniversary of Nepal Bhasa poet [[Siddhidas Mahaju]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the [[1990 People's Movement]] that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eagle|first=Sonia|title=The Language Situation in Nepal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/57090514/19/Newari-language-and-revitalisation|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|publisher=Scribd|year=1999}} Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; However, efforts to get Nepal Bhasa reincluded as an optional subject after a gap of two decades were unsuccessful due to lack of funding.

The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multi-ethnic and multilingual country. It also said that each community shall have the right to operate schools up to the primary level in its own mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepaldemocracy.org/documents/national_laws/constitution1990.htm#1|title=Constitution of Nepal 1990|publisher=Nepal Democracy|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government's responsibility was not stated and communities had to open such schools on their own. In 1991, Jagat Sundar Bwane Kuthi, the first Nepal Bhasa-medium school, opened in Kathmandu with the efforts of volunteers and the support of domestic and foreign donors.&lt;ref name="thlib.org"/&gt;

Meanwhile, years of efforts to gain official recognition for the standard name Nepal Bhasa finally succeeded. On 8 September 1995, the government decided that the name Nepal Bhasa should be used instead of Newari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Nepal Bhasa|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=9 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Central Bureau of Statistics has not been doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| title =Major highlights| work =| publisher =Central Bureau of Statistics| year =2013| accessdate =24 May 2013| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| archivedate =17 July 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics file suit===

On 25 July 1997, [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]] declared that its policy to recognize Nepal Bhasa, which had been passed on 18 April 1958 and cancelled by the Panchayat regime in 1963, would be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced in quick succession that they too would officially recognize Nepal Bhasa -- [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] Sub-Metropolitan City on 14 July, [[Bhaktapur]] Municipality on 23 July, [[Madhyapur Thimi]] Municipality on 10 September, and [[Kirtipur]] Municipality on 15 September 1997.

While Newars hailed the move, its detractors went to court. A group consisting of Lal Bahadur Thapa, Yagyanidhi Dahal, Hari Prasad Pokhrel, Achyut Raman Adhikari and Dhruba Raj Thebe filed a joint petition at the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] against their decision. And on 18 March 1998, the Supreme Court issued a stay order preventing Kathmandu Metropolitan City from using Nepal Bhasa pending a final verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Use Nepali, directs SC|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stay order to KMC to stop using Newari|url=|accessdate= |newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=20 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, on 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nepal&gt;{{cite news|last=Limbu|first=Ramyata|title=Attempt to Limit Official Language to Nepali Resented|url=http://ipsnews.net/print.asp?idnews=79142|publisher=IPS|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=|date=21 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was announced, demonstrators marched through Kathmandu in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenepaldigest.org/archive/the-nepal-digest-june%2016-1999.html |title= SC quashes decisions on local languages | newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |date=2 June 1999 |website=|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Day===

Newars have been observing June 1 as Black Day with protest meets and public demonstrations recalling the day when the Supreme Court barred Nepal Bhasa from being used in local bodies. On some occasions, the protests have been marked by vandalism and arrest of protestors by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kathmandu's sons go on warpath|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-01/south-asia/28196200_1_kathmandu-nepali-congress-girija-prasad-koirala|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loktantra era==

A second People's Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution stated that the use of one's mother tongue in a local body or office shall not be barred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063 (2007)|publisher=UNDP Nepal|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219220657/http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}} Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, subtle discrimination persists.

{{Classical mechanics}}

'''Newton's laws of motion''' are three [[physical law]]s that, together, laid the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They describe the relationship between a body and the [[force]]s acting upon it, and its [[motion (physics)|motion]] in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,&lt;ref&gt;For explanations of Newton's laws of motion by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in the early 18th century, by the physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early 21st century, see:-

The three laws of motion were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton]] in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''), first published in 1687.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.&lt;ref name=Motte&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~gravitee/axioms.htm Andrew Motte translation of Newton's ''Principia'' (1687) ''Axioms or Laws of Motion'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], explained [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

A '''fourth law''' is often also described in the bibliography, which states that forces add up like vectors, that is, that forces obey the [[Superposition principle|principle of superposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiner|first1=Walter|title=Classical mechanics: point particles and relativity|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-21851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeidler|first1=E.|title=Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications IV: Applications to Mathematical Physics|date=1988|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4612-4566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wachter|first1=Armin|last2=Hoeber|first2=Henning|title=Compendium of theoretical physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-387-25799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|150px|Isaac Newton (1643–1727), the physicist who formulated the laws]]
Newton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses,&lt;ref&gt;''[...]while Newton had used the word 'body' vaguely and in at least three different meanings, Euler realized that the statements of Newton are generally correct only when applied to masses concentrated at isolated points;''{{Cite book| last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford A.| last2 = Becchi| first2 = Antonio| last3 = Benvenuto| first3 = Edoardo| title = Essays on the history of mechanics: in memory of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell and Edoardo Benvenuto| publisher = Birkhäuser| date = 2003| location = New York| page = 207| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6LO_U6T-HvsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essays+in+the+History&amp;cd=9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22isolated%20points%22| isbn = 3-7643-1476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily. This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis, or the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] and rotation of the body are of no importance. In this way, even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.

In their original form, Newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of [[rigid bodies]] and [[deformable bodies]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called [[Euler's laws of motion]], later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. Euler's laws can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubliner |first=Jacob |title=Plasticity Theory (Revised Edition) |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2008 |url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |isbn=0-486-46290-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331022415/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of [[frames of reference]] called [[Inertial reference frame|Newtonian or inertial reference frames]]. Some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view, the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame, and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second. Other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.&lt;ref name=tseitlin&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/j42866672t863506/ |title= Newton's First Law: Text, Translations, Interpretations and Physics Education |journal= Science &amp; Education | author= Galili, I. | author2= Tseitlin, M. |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |year= 2003 |pages= 45–73 |doi= 10.1023/A:1022632600805 |bibcode = 2003Sc&amp;Ed..12...45G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/1np/ch04/ch04.html |title= Newtonian Physics |author= Benjamin Crowell |chapter= 4.

In the given interpretation [[mass]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and (most importantly) [[force]] are assumed to be externally defined quantities. This is the most common, but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities.

Newtonian mechanics has been superseded by [[special relativity]], but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;In making a modern adjustment of the second law for (some of) the effects of relativity, ''m'' would be treated as the [[relativistic mass]], producing the relativistic expression for momentum, and the third law might be modified if possible to allow for the finite signal propagation speed between distant interacting particles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
===Newton's first law===
{{Main|Inertia}}

The first law states that if the [[net force]] (the [[vector sum]] of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the [[velocity]] of the object is constant. Velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity which expresses both the object's [[speed]] and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.

The first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum \mathbf{F} = 0\; \Leftrightarrow\; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v} }{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently,
* An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.
* An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless a force acts upon it.

This is known as ''uniform motion''. An object ''continues'' to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continuously move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.

Newton placed the first law of motion to establish [[frames of reference]] for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one [[frame of reference]] called a Newtonian or [[inertial reference frame]], relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.&lt;ref name=tseitlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA6,M1 |title=Special relativity |page=6 |author=NMJ Woodhouse |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |location=London/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's first law is often referred to as the ''[[Inertia|law of inertia]]''. Thus, a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net [[force]] acting on it is zero. In this sense, the first law can be restated as:

{{quote|''In every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame Φ is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in Φ. That is, a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame Φ continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beatty, Millard F.|date=2006|title=Principles of engineering mechanics Volume 2 of Principles of Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics-The Analysis of Motion, |page=24| publisher =Springer|isbn=0-387-23704-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wr2QOBqOBakC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Newton's first and second laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame. Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. [[Galilean invariance]] or the [[principle of relativity|principle of Newtonian relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thornton, Marion|date=2004|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|page=53| publisher = Brooks/Cole| edition=5th|

===Newton's second law=== &lt;!-- [Newton's second law] --&gt;

The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(m\mathbf v)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration. Since Newton's second law is valid only for constant-mass systems,&lt;ref name="plastino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plastino|first=Angel R. |author2=Muzzio, Juan C.|year=1992|title=On the use and abuse of Newton's second law for variable mass problems|journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|volume= 53|issue= 3|pages=227–232|issn=0923-2958|bibcode=1992CeMDA..53..227P|doi=10.1007/BF00052611}} "We may conclude emphasizing that Newton's second law is valid for constant mass only.

I]t is essential to deal with the same set of particles throughout the time interval[. ...] Consequently, the mass of the system can not change during the time of interest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''m''}} can be taken outside the [[Derivative|differentiation]] operator by the [[constant factor rule in differentiation]]. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force applied, ''m'' is the mass of the body, and '''a''' is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration. In other words, if a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it. An application of this notation is the derivation of [[G Subscript C]].

Consistent with the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|first law]], the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with [[uniform circular motion]]. The relationship also implies the [[conservation of momentum]]: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.

Any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see [[#Variable-mass_systems|below]]).

Newton's second law is an approximation that is increasingly worse at high speeds because of [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects.

====Impulse====
An [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] '''J''' occurs when a force '''F''' acts over an interval of time Δ''t'', and it is given by&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, J, Hillier, M J, ''Applied Mechanics'', p221, Pitman Paperbacks, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Serway&gt;{{cite book |title=College Physics |page=161 |author=Raymond A. Serway |author2=Jerry S.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \int_{\Delta t} \mathbf F \,\mathrm{d}t .&lt;/math&gt;
Since force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \Delta\mathbf{p} = m\Delta\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
This relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book |title=The investigation of difficult things: essays on Newton and the history of the exact sciences in honour of D.T.

Variable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases, are not [[closed system|closed]] and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt; that is, the following formula is wrong:&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;
&lt;!-- If you have the Halliday book, please add the missing fields of the Cite book template. While you're at it, update the same citation found in [[Force]].--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big[m(t)\mathbf{v}(t)\big] = m(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{v}(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}. \qquad \mathrm{(wrong)}&lt;/math&gt;
The falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect [[Galilean invariance]]: a variable-mass object with '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= 0 in one frame will be seen to have '''F'''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 in another frame.&lt;ref name="plastino" /&gt;
The correct equation of motion for a body whose mass ''m'' varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is&lt;ref name="plastino"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F + \mathbf{u} \frac{\mathrm{d} m}{\mathrm{d}t} = m {\mathrm{d} \mathbf v \over \mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].
Under some conventions, the quantity '''u'''&amp;thinsp;d''m''/d''t'' on the left-hand side, which represents the [[advection]] of [[momentum]], is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity '''F'''. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation becomes '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= ''m'''''a'''.

===Newton's third law===
[[File:Skaters showing newtons third law.svg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of Newton's third law in which two skaters push against each other. The first skater on the left exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; on the second skater directed towards the right, and the second skater exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; on the first skater directed towards the left. &lt;br/&gt;The magnitudes of both forces are equal, but they have opposite directions, as dictated by Newton's third law.]]

The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object ''A'' exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on a second object ''B'', then ''B'' simultaneously exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="resnick83"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resnick|last2=Halliday|last3=Krane|title=Physics, Volume 1|edition=4th|page=83|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third law means that all forces are ''[[interaction]]s'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body ''A''; the force exerted by Body ''A'' on Body ''B'' is called the "action", and the force exerted by Body ''B'' on Body ''A'' is called the "reaction". This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the "action" and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; the "reaction". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the "action" and the other as the "reaction". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the ''action'' and which is called ''reaction''; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.&lt;ref name="resnick83" /&gt;

The two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).

From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Newtons laws in latin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's First and Second laws, in Latin, from the original 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'']]
===Newton's 1st Law===
From the original [[Latin]] of Newton's ''Principia'':
{{Cquote|''Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:
{{Cquote|Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''The Principia'', A new translation by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman, University of California press, Berkeley 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. [[Galileo Galilei]], however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the ''absence'' of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what [[Johannes Kepler]] had called ''inertia''.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"—no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.

The law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'': {{quote|style=margin-top: -0.5em; padding-left: 0.5em;|That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.&lt;ref name="cohen117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

===Newton's 2nd Law===
Newton's original Latin reads:
{{Cquote|''Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur''.}}

This was translated quite closely in Motte's 1729 translation as:

{{Cquote|Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.}}

According to modern ideas of how Newton was using his terminology,&lt;ref&gt;According to Maxwell in ''Matter and Motion'', Newton meant by ''motion'' "''the quantity of matter moved as well as the rate at which it travels" and by ''impressed force'' he meant "the time during which the force acts as well as the intensity of the force''". See Harman and Shapiro, cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:
''{{quote|The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.}}''
This may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the [[Wren Library]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.

Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:
''{{quote|If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.}}''

The sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example (1) I Bernard Cohen, "Newton's Second Law and the Concept of Force in the Principia", in "The Annus Mirabilis of Sir Isaac Newton 1666–1966" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1967), pages 143–185; (2) Stuart Pierson, "'Corpore cadente. . .': Historians Discuss Newton’s Second Law", Perspectives on Science, 1 (1993), pages 627–658; and (3) Bruce Pourciau, "Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.60 (2006), pages 157–207; also an online discussion by G E Smith, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/index.html#NewLawMot 5. Newton's Laws of Motion], s.5 of "Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''" in (online) ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's 3rd Law===
{{Cquote|''Lex III: Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:

{{Cquote|Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.}}
Newton's [[Scholium]] (explanatory comment) to this law:
{{quote|Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&lt;ref&gt;This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the ''[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]'' on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425035710/https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |date=25 April 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above, as usual, ''motion'' is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.

Newton used the third law to derive the law of [[momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]];&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Corollary III to the laws of motion&lt;/ref&gt; from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via [[Noether's theorem]] from [[Galilean invariance]]), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when [[force field (physics)|force fields]] as well as particles carry momentum, and in [[quantum mechanics]]. &lt;!-- In force fields I do not think the violation is a necessity; we could easily remodel the fields perhaps as interaction between particles at the quantum level and still have the 3rd law holding. I think the 3rd law breakdown is just a consequence of the model used --&gt;

==Importance and range of validity==
Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of [[universal gravitation]] and the mathematical techniques of [[calculus]], provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.

These three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and [[classical electrodynamics]]) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz factor]] must be included in the expression for momentum along with the [[rest mass]] and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a [[semiconductor]], optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected [[GPS]] systems and [[superconductivity]]. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear [[Operator (physics)|operators]] that operate on the [[quantum state]]; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;d'''p'''/d''t'', where '''F''' and '''p''' are [[four-vector]]s.

==Relationship to the conservation laws==
In modern physics, the [[Conservation law (physics)|laws of conservation]] of [[momentum]], energy, and [[angular momentum]] are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.

This can be stated simply, "Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed."

Because force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], etc.). The [[standard model]] explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as [[Gauge theory|gauge forces]] originate out of exchange by [[virtual particles]]. Other forces, such as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle#Consequences|fermionic degeneracy pressure]], also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of [[4-momentum]] in inertial motion via [[curved space-time]] results in what we call [[gravitational force]] in [[general relativity]] theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a [[momentum operator]] in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping [[wave functions]] of a pair of [[fermion]]s (particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the "repulsion" of the fermions.

Newton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase "[[Hypotheses non fingo|I feign no hypotheses]]". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving [[quantum entanglement]]. (In particular, this refers to [[Bell's theorem]] – that no [[local hidden variable theory|local model]] can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory.) Despite only being an approximation, in modern engineering and all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.

The discovery of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in the 19th century showed that not every physical quantity is conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a "steady-state" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take [[entropy]] into account.

The '''Oath ''More Judaico''''' or '''Jewish Oath''' was a special form of [[oath]], rooted in antisemitsm and accompanied by certain ceremonies and often intentionally humiliating, painful or dangerous, that Jews were required to take in [[Europe]]an [[court]]s of [[law]] until the 20th century. ''More Judaico'' is [[Latin]] for "on/by the Jewish custom." The question of the trustworthiness of the Jewish oath was intimately connected with the meaning that [[Christian]] authorities assigned to the ''[[Kol Nidre]]'' prayer, recited by Jews on [[Yom Kippur]], and the whole of the legislation regarding the oath was characteristic of the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|attitude of medieval states toward their Jewish subjects]]. The [[Separation of church and state#History|identification of Church and State]] seemed to render it necessary to have a different formula for those outside the state church.

==Historical development==
The [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disability]] imposed on a [[Jew]] engaged in legal contention with a [[Christian]] dates back to [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]], who declared that neither Jews nor [[heresy|heretics]] should be admitted as [[witness]]es against Christians;  [[Secularism|secular]] courts, however, did not recognize this disability. Thus, in the safe conducts issued by the [[Carolingian]] kings in the 9th century, Jews and Christians were treated as equals, and consequently the [[testimony]] of the former, whether given under [[oath]] or not, was as admissible as the latter. This was distinctly stated in the [[charter]] granted by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] to the Jews of [[Speyer]] in 1090. The law of [[Duke]] [[Frederick II of Austria]] (1244), which served as a model for much other [[legislation]] on the Jews, merely required a Jew to [[oath|swear]] "super Rodal" (by the [[Torah]]). Similar laws existed in [[England]], [[Portugal]], and [[Hungary]]; Hungary waived the requirement to swear on the [[Torah]] in trivial cases.

There were, however, some older laws that prescribed certain practices intended to mock Jews in court. These examples illustrated the kinds of humiliating rituals that accompanied the taking of the oath:
*[[Byzantine Empire]], 10th century: the Jew would wear a [[Crown of thorns|girdle of thorns]] around his loins, stand in water, and swear by "Barase Baraa" ([[Book of Genesis|Bereshit Bara]]), so that if he spoke untruth, he would be swallowed by the earth just like [[Dathan]] and [[Abiram]] in [[Book_of_Numbers#Chapter_15-17|Numbers 16:1–27]].
*[[Arles]] (c. 1150): a wreath of thorns would be hung on the swearer's neck, others would grovel at his knees, and a thorn branch five [[ell]]s in length would be pulled "between his loins" while he swore and called down upon himself all the [[Curse#Curses in the Bible|curses]] of the Torah.
*[[Swabia]] (13th century): the Jew would stand on the hide of a [[Unclean animals|sow]] or a [[Lamb of God|bloody lamb]].
*[[Silesia]] (1422): the Jew would stand on a three-legged stool and have to pay a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] each time he fell, finally losing his [[legal case|case]] if he fell four times.
*[[Dortmund]]: the Jew would be fined each time he halted in repeating the oath.
*[[Vrbové]], Hungary (1517): the Jew would stand barefooted and swear with his face turned to the east, holding the [[Pentateuch]] in his hand.
*[[Breslau]] (c. 1455): the Jew would stand [[Yarmulke#Purpose|bareheaded]] and pronounce the name of [[Yahweh]].

==An example: Frankfurt oath==
[[File:Oathmorejudaico.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A 17th century drawing of a German Jew taking a Jewish oath.]]
The following formula, originally in Middle High German, was used in Frankfurt on the Main about 1392:[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1392-jews-frankfort.html]
:''The Jew shall stand on a sow's skin and the five books of Master Moses shall lie before him, and his right hand up to the wrist shall lie on the book and he shall repeat after him who administers the oath of the Jews:''

:''Regarding such property of which the man accuses you, you know nothing of it, nor do you have it. You never had it in your possession, you do not have it in any of your chests, you have not buried it in the earth, nor locked it with locks, so help you God who created heaven and earth, valley and hill, woods, trees, and grass, and so help you the law which God himself created and wrote with His own hand and gave Moses on Sinai's mount. And so help you the five books of Moses that you may nevermore enjoy a bite without soiling yourself all over as did the King of Babylon.''

:''And may that sulphur and pitch flow down upon your neck that flowed over Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same pitch that flowed over Babylon flow over you, but two hundred times more, and may the earth envelop and swallow you up as it did Dathan and Abiram. And may your dust never join other dust, and your earth never join other earth in the bosom of Master Abraham if what you say is not true and right.'' [This refers either to a decent burial or to resurrection.] ''And so help you Adonai, you have sworn the truth.''

:''If not, may you become as leprous as Naaman and Gehazi, and may the calamity strike you that the Israelite people escaped as they journeyed forth from Egypt's land. And may a bleeding and a flowing come forth from you and never cease, as your people wished upon themselves when they condemned God, Jesus Christ, among themselves, and tortured Him and said: {{bibleref|Matthew|27:25}} "His blood be upon us and our children." It is true, so help you God who appeared to Moses in a burning bush which yet remained unconsumed. It is true by the oath that you have sworn, by the soul which you bring on the Day of Judgment before the Court, [before the God of] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is true, so help you God and the oath you have sworn. [Amen].''

==The oath as a Jewish disability==
A decidedly aggressive change took place when, in 1555, the [[Germany|German]] imperial court procedure (''Reichskammergerichtsordnung'') prescribed a form of oath that, with some alterations, formed a model to subsequent legislation. Horrible were the terms in which the swearer called down upon himself all the curses of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]], the [[ten plagues]] of [[Egypt]], the [[leprosy]] of [[Naaman]] and [[Gehazi]] (see 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 5), the fate of Dathan and Abiram, etc.

According to a recount in his "Gesammelte Schriften," the great German-Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] persuaded the [[Prussia]]n government to moderate the terms of the oath during the 18th century. The small German states gradually surrendered the most objectionable features of the oath: [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), in 1828; [[Oldenburg]], 1829; [[Württemberg]], 1832; [[Saxony]], 1839 (on which occasion [[Zecharias Frankel]] published his famous "Die Eidesleistung"); [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] and [[Anhalt]]-[[Bernburg]], 1842; and [[Hesse-Homburg]], 1865. 

Prussia retained the obnoxious formula until March 15, 1869; the [[Netherlands]] modified the oath in 1818, and [[Russia]] in 1838 and 1860. The Jewish [[advocate]] [[Isaac Adolphe Crémieux]] won great fame by effecting the abolition of the oath through a case brought before the court of [[Nîmes]] in 1827. [[Lazard Isidor]], as [[rabbi]] of [[Pfalzburg]], refused in 1839 to open the [[synagogue]] for such an oath; prosecuted for [[contempt of court]], he was defended by Crémieux and acquitted. The French Supreme Court finally declared the oath [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]] on March 3, 1846. However, as late as 1902, a court in [[Romania]] upheld that country's version of the oath.

The '''Peripatetic axiom''' is: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses"  (Latin: "''Nihil est in intellectu quod non sit prius in sensu''"). It is found in [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''De veritate, q. 2 a. 3 arg. 19''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas |title=Quaestiones disputatae de veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas adopted this principle from the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] school of [[Greek philosophy]], established by [[Aristotle]]. Aquinas argued that the existence of God could be proved by reasoning from sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Leftow, Brian (ed., 2006), Aquinas: Summa Theologiae, Questions on God, pp. vii et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a variation on the Aristotelian notion of the "[[active intellect]]" ("intellectus agens")&lt;ref&gt;Z. Kuksewicz, “The Potential and the Agent Intellect,” in: N. Kretzmann, e.a., ''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 595-601&lt;/ref&gt; which he interpreted as the ability to abstract universal meanings from particular empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Thomas Aquinas", subsection on "Theory of Knowledge", vol. 8, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pig Latin''' is a [[language game]] or [[argot]] in which words in [[English language|English]] are altered, usually by adding a fabricated [[suffix]] or by moving the [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] or initial [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]] of a word to the end of the word and adding a [[vocalic]] [[syllable]] to create such a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/pig-latin/|title=What exactly is Pig Latin, is it a language? And how is it a mystery? - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2010-10-05|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.&lt;br&gt;
'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | Love's Labour's Lost, William Shakespeare}}

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA638&amp;lpg=PA638&amp;dq=%22He+adds+as+many+new+letters+as+the+boys+in+their+%22hog+latin,%22%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=llFXqy226B&amp;sig=s89ZY3kpFsimFFr2f3F-gbN5KdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjegITDjtrJAhWNoYMKHfmGACIQ6AEIGzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20adds%20as%20many%20new%20letters%20as%20the%20boys%20in%20their%20%22hog%20latin%2C%22%22&amp;f=false|work=The Galaxy: A Magazine of Entertaining Reading, Volume 1|page=638|title=Sound and Sense|date=1886|author=Wakeman, George|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is similar to [[Língua do Pê]].

Another early mention of the name was in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'' in May 1869 "I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing," although the jargon is dog Latin.

''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".&lt;ref&gt;'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?]&lt;br/&gt;The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root among the general public yet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, "What a aybybay", where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding "ay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19470128&amp;id=d44tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SJ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4502,48597&amp;hl=en|work=Reading Eagle|page=12|title=Answers to Questions - The Haskins' Service|date=28 January 1947|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are "{{lang|en|[[wikt:ixnay|ixnay]]}}" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "{{lang|en|[[wikt:nix#English|nix]]}}" (itself a borrowing of [[German language|German]] ''nichts''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127424 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;), which is used as a general [[Negative (language)|negative]]; and "{{lang|en|[[wikt:amscray|amscray]]}}", Pig Latin for "{{lang|en|[[wikt:scram#English|scram]]}}", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Barry J.|title=Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAhYqpnC2H8C&amp;pg=PR48-IA149&amp;dq=ixnay+pig+latin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiputrKgrnUAhUJOz4KHTRJBlUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ixnay%20pig%20latin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicogenesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

==Rules==
For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/piglatin.htm|title=Useful phrases in Pig Latin (IgpaAtinlay)|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"pig" = "igpay"
*"latin" = "atinlay"
*"banana" = "ananabay"  
*"happy" = "appyhay"
*"duck" = "uckday"
*"me" = "emay"
*"too" = "ootay"
*"will" = "illway"
*"real" = "ealray"
*"simple" = "implesay"
*"say" = "aysay"
*"bagel" = "agelbay"
*"fail" = "ailfay"
*"poo" = "oopay"
*"party" = "artypay"
*"lonely" = "onelylay"
*"friends" = "iendsfray"
*"Lauren"" = "aurenlay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin|title=How to Speak Pig Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"smile" = "ilesmay"
*"string" = "ingstray"
*"stupid" = "upidstay"
*"glove" = "oveglay"
*"trash" = "ashtray"
*"floor"= "oorflay"
*"store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:
*"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
*"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
*"are" = "areway" or "areay"
*"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
*"explain" = "explainway"
*"always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
*"ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
*"honest" = "honestway"
*"I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*"every" = "eryevay"
*"another" = "otheranay"
*"under" = "erunday"
*"island" = "andislay"
*"elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.&lt;!--emma  = emmway
Please do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra). Do not add examples of language games that generate words through different patterns (such as, for example, adding nonsense syllables in between vowels or after words, shuffling the order of syllables, or systematically replacing certain phonemes with others. The preceding list is not exhaustive). Such examples should instead be added to the [[Language game]] article.--&gt;

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used in fun.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isay eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==In other languages==

--&gt;
In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include [[Kedelkloppersprook]], which originated around [[Hamburg]] harbour, and [[Mattenenglisch]] that was used in the ''Matte'', the traditional [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood of [[Bern]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by [[voluntary association]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by ''i'', in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ''ee''.

The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket ("Fig language" – see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game § List of common language games]]).

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word kontti "container", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,"wikipedia" --&gt; "wikipedia kontti" --&gt; "kokipedia wintti". So converting the sentence "I love you" ("Minä rakastan sinua") would result in "konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti".

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or "[[Šatrovački]]" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for [[marijuana]] (trava - meaning "grass") turns to "vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [[cocaine]] (belo - meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [[pistol]] (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, [[brother|bro]] (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.

[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louchébem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louchébem'', or ''largonji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : Définition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larlépem largomuche du louchébem. Parler l'argot du boucher''|author=Françoise Robert l'Argenton|publisher=Parlures argotiques|pages=113–125|language=fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|volume=90 n° 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''loucherbem'', the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an ''L'', and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-''oche'', -''em'', -''oque'', etc., depending on the word). Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienquès''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louchébem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en loucedé''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;u=umpqua&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA90553064&amp;asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

}} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "reconquest") is a name used in English to describe the period in the history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of about 780 years between the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in 711 and the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada]] to the expanding [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms]] in 1491. The completed [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] was the context of the Spanish voyages of discovery and conquest (Columbus got royal support in Granada in 1492, months after its conquest), and the [[Americas]]—the "[[New World]]"—ushered in the era of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonial empires.

Traditional historiography has marked the beginning of the ''{{lang|es|Reconquista}}'' with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] (718 or 722), the first known victory in Iberia by Christian military forces since the 711 military intervention in Iberia of combined Arab-Berber forces. In that small battle, a group led by the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] defeated a Muslim patrol in the mountains of northern Iberia and established the independent Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. It ended with the conquest of the [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim state in the peninsula, in 1491.

After 1491, the entire peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. The conquest was followed by the [[Alhambra Decree]] (1492) which expelled Jews who would not convert to Christianity from Castile and Aragon, and a series of edicts (1499–1526) which [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|forced the conversions of the Muslims in Spain]]. Since the mid-19th century, the idea of a 'reconquest' took hold in Spain associated with its rising [[nationalism]] and [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Concept and duration==
Traditional [[historiography]] has stressed since the 19th century the existence of the ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Fitz|first1=Francisco|date=2009|title=La Reconquista: un estado de la cuestión|url=http://www.durango-udala.net/portalDurango/RecursosWeb/DOCUMENTOS/1/1_1945_3.pdf|journal=Clío &amp; Crímen: Revista del Centro de Historia del Crimen de Durango |language=es|volume=|issue=6|pages=142–215|doi=|issn=1698-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |year= 2003 |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0812236965|page= 19|accessdate=February 15, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4gVIt5u0U5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Cambridge Medieval. History 1|last=McKitterick |first=Rosamond |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |author2=Collins, R. |year= 1990 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=|isbn= 9780521362924|page= 289|accessdate=July 26, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZEaSdNBL0sgC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=the+basques+roger+collins#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20basques%20roger%20collins&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark was set by the Christian ''[[Chronica Prophetica]]'' (883–884), a document stressing the Christian and Muslim cultural and religious divide in Iberia and the necessity to drive the Muslims out.

[[File:Almohad1200.png|thumb|The [[Islami]]c [[Almohad dynasty]] and surrounding states, including the Christian Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and the [[Crown of Aragon]], c. 1200.]]

Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval/&gt; Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;María Rosa Menocal, ''The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain'', Back Bay Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0316168718}}, and see [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]], which started late in the 11–12th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest, confronted at that time with a similarly staunch Muslim [[Jihad]] ideology in [[Al-Andalus]] by the [[Almoravids]], and to an even greater degree by the [[Almohads]]. In fact, previous documents from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of "reconquest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fPSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=October 23, 2017|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0306-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', a fictitious 11th-century French version of the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] dealing with the Iberian ''[[Saracen]]s'' (''Moors''), and taught as historical fact in the French educational system since 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Pagans are wrong and Christians are right': Alterity, Gender, and Nation in the ''Chanson de Roland''|last=Kinoshita|first=Sharon|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|volume=31|issue=1|date=Winter 2001|pages=79–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiVanna |first1=Isabel N. |year=2010 |title=Politicizing national literature: the scholarly debate around La Chanson de Roland in the nineteenth century |journal=Historical Research |volume=84 |issue=223 |pages=109–134 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00540.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern idea of the earlier concept of ''Reconquista'' is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of [[Spanish nationalism]] in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[National-Catholicism|National-Catholic]] dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a "liberation war" of ''reconquest'' against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the [[Spanish Civil War]] who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt; Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church's unity, where Franco stood for both [[Pelagius of Asturias]] and [[El Cid]].&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt;

Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the [[Moors]] in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being 'rebuilt'.&lt;ref name="Purkis"&gt;{{cite book |title= Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Perspectives on State Building in the Iberian Peninsula |last=Purkis |first=William J. |year= 2010 |publisher= University of Birmingham |pages= 57–58|accessdate=October 15, 2017|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2010-05_W._J._Purkis,_Eleventh-_and_Twelfth-Century_Perspectives_on_State_Building_in_the_Iberian_Peninsula.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of ''Reconquista'' as a concept created ''a posteriori'' in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Eugènia de Pagès, "''La 'Reconquista', allò que mai no va existir''", ''La Lamentable'', July 11, 2014, [http://lamentable.org/la-reconquista-allo-que-mai-no-va-existir/ lamentable.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín M. Ríos Saloma, "''La Reconquista. Génesis de un mito historiográfico''", ''Historia y Grafía'', 30, 2008, pp. 191–216, [http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/589/58922939009.pdf redalyc.org], Retrieved October 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first Spanish intellectuals to question the idea of a "reconquest" that lasted for eight centuries was [[José Ortega y Gasset]], writing in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"''Yo no entiendo cómo se puede llamar reconquista a una cosa que dura ocho siglos''" ("I don't understand how something that lasted eight centuries can be called a reconquest"), in ''España invertebrada''. Quoted by De Pagès, E. July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is still widely in use.

== Background ==
{{Further|Islam in Spain}}

===Islamic conquest of Christian Iberia===
{{Further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Battle of Guadalete}}

In 711, Muslim [[Moors]], mainly North African [[Berber people|Berber]] soldiers with some [[Arab]]s, crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began their conquest of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania]]. After their conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom's Iberian territories, the Muslims crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and took control of [[Septimania]] in 719, the last province of the Visigothic Kingdom to be occupied. From their stronghold of [[Narbonne]], they launched raids into the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].

The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=Los Angeles: University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24840-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These armies established an Islamic rule known as [[Al-Andalus]] that would last 300 years in much of the Iberian Peninsula and 770 years in [[Granada]].

===Islamic rule===
{{Main article|Berbers and Islam|Berber Revolt|}}

After the establishment of a local [[Emirate]], [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]], ruler of the [[Umayyad|Umayyad caliphate]], removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the first governor of the newly conquered province of Al-Andalus, was recalled to [[Damascus]] and replaced with Musa bin Nusair, who had been his former superior. Musa's son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married [[Egilona]], [[Roderic]]'s widow, and established his regional government in [[Seville]]. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz's assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa bin Nusair, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa's cousin, [[Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi]] became the [[emir]] of ''Al-Andalus''.

The conquering generals were necessarily acting independently, due to the methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a distant province would gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were likely watched by certain circles of the distant government with a degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the formerly successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal to the government in Damascus.

A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Lowney]], ''A Vanished World: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain'', (Oxford University Press, 2005), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain'', (St.Martin's Press, 1995), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This latent internal conflict jeopardized Muslim unity.

After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] and was halted for a while on its way north. [[Odo of Aquitaine]] had married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (and, perhaps, contemporary Catalonia), in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] in 732.

A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

==Reconquista==
=== Beginning of the ''Reconquista'' ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
[[File:Escudo de Alcanadre-La Rioja.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Alcanadre]]. [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain. Depicting [[Maure|heads of slain Moors]]]]
The first victory in resistance to Muslim rule occurred in [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] in 722. A drastic increase of taxes by the emir [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]] provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by [[Pelagius of Asturias]] (Pelayo in Spanish, Pelayu in Asturian). Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius' [[Battle of Covadonga|victory at Covadonga]] as the beginning of the ''Reconquista''. No Muslim source mentions the battle at Covadonga, in contrast with the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721, with a death toll of perhaps tens of thousands, which was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. For Pelagius, however, the Christian victory secured his independent rule, while the precise date and circumstances of the battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelagius' rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were focusing in [[Septimania]] and Toulouse (721).

Two northern realms, the Basque Navarre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a ''cul-de-sac'' on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alphonse I centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=156, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias]] was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayo's dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors, the ''Banu Alfons'' from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II (from 791–842). A king's expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Great]] were declared to have been found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.

===Franks and Al-Andalus===
{{Main article|Islamic invasion of Gaul|Marca Hispanica}}

After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of [[Septimania]], starting in 719 with the conquest of [[Narbonne]] through 725 when [[Carcassone]] and [[Nîmes]] were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer [[Aquitaine]] but suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"&gt;{{cite book |title= 
The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20–33|accessdate=October 28, 2017|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after halting their advance north, [[Odo of Aquitaine]] married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (perhaps all of contemporary Catalonia as well), in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

==== Pepin the Younger and Charlemagne ====
After expelling the Muslims [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|from Narbonne in 759]] and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Pepin the Short conquered Aquitaine]] in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal [[William of Gellone]], making [[Toulouse]] his base for expeditions against Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt; Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the [[Carolingian Empire]] against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] was crowned king of [[Aquitaine]], under the supervision of Charlemagne's trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient [[Spanish March]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of Al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman]], autonomous governor (''[[wāli]]'') or king (''malik'') of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], Husayn, and [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]] at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huesca]] were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of [[Zaragoza]] Charlemagne received the homage of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]]. However the city, under the leadership of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], closed its gates and refused to submit.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"/&gt; Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[The Song of Roland]], a highly romanticized account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous [[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]] of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]]. In 792 Hisham proclaimed a [[jihad]], advancing in 793 against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and Carolingian [[Septimania|Septimania (Gothia)]]. They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but [[William of Gellone|William]] led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees. [[Barcelona]], a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for two years until it finally capitulated in 801.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 37-49"&gt;{{cite book |title=

The main passes in the Pyrenees were [[Roncesvalles]], [[Somport]] and [[La Jonquera]]. Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of [[Pamplona]], [[Aragon]], and [[Catalonia]] respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of [[Catalan counties|small counties]], including [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[Girona (province)|Girona]], and [[Urgell]]; it was called the ''Marca Hispanica'' by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplona's first king was [[Iñigo Arista]], who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the [[Banu Qasi]] and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Carolingian expedition in 824]] that led to the setup of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. Aragon, founded in 809 by [[Aznar Galíndez]], grew around [[Jaca]] and the high valleys of the [[Aragon River]], protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the ''Reconquista''.

In the late 9th century under [[Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona|Count Wilfred]], Barcelona became the ''de facto'' capital of the region. It controlled the other counties' policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borrel II]], who declared that the new dynasty in France (the [[Capet]]s) were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.

===Expansion into the Crusades and military orders===
[[File:Cantigas battle.jpg|thumb|A battle of the ''Reconquista'' from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'']]
In the [[High Middle Ages]], the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula became linked to the fight of the whole of [[Christendom]]. The ''Reconquista'' was originally a mere war of conquest. It only later underwent a significant shift in meaning toward a religiously justified war of liberation (see the Augustinian concept of a [[Just War]]). The [[papacy]] and the influential [[Abbey of Cluny]] in Burgundy not only justified the acts of war but actively encouraged Christian knights to seek armed confrontation with Moorish "infidels" instead of with each other.

From the 11th century onwards [[indulgences]] were granted: In 1064 [[Pope Alexander II]] promised the participants of [[War of Barbastro|an expedition against Barbastro]] (''Tagr al-Andalus'', Aragon) a collective indulgence 30 years before [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]]. Papal interest in Christian-Muslim relations in the peninsula was not without precedent&amp;nbsp;– Popes Leo IV (847–855), John VIII (872–882) and John XIX (1024–33) are all known to have displayed substantial interest in the region. Not until 1095 and the [[Council of Clermont]] did the ''Reconquista'' amalgamate the conflicting concepts of a peaceful pilgrimage and armed knight-errantry. But the papacy left no doubt about the heavenly reward for knights fighting for Christ (''militia Christi''): in a letter, Urban II tried to persuade the ''reconquistadores'' fighting at [[Tarragona]] to stay in the Peninsula rather than joining the armed pilgrimage to conquer Jerusalem, saying that their contribution for Christianity was equally important. The pope promised them the same indulgences that he had promised to those who chose to join the First Crusade.

Later [[Military order (society)|military orders]] such as the [[Order of Santiago]], [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]], [[Order of Calatrava]], and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded or called to fight in Iberia. The Popes called the knights of Europe to join the effort to destroy the Muslim states of the peninsula. After the so-called [[Battle of Alarcos|Disaster of Alarcos]], French, Navarrese, Castilian, Portuguese and Aragonese armies united against the Muslim forces in the massive ''[[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]'' (1212). The large territories awarded to military orders and nobles were the origin of the [[latifundia]] in today's [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] in Spain, and [[Alentejo]] in Portugal.

==Military culture in medieval Iberia==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. Small, lightly equipped armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times, allowing a quick return home after sacking a target. Battles were mainly waged between clans, expelling intruder armies or sacking expeditions.

In the context of the relative isolation of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, and the contact with Moorish culture, geographical and cultural differences necessitated the use of military strategies, tactics, and equipment that were markedly different from those found in the rest of western Europe during this period.

Medieval Iberian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry (mostly nobles, but including commoner knights from the 10th century on) and the infantry, or ''peones'' (peasants). Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent.

=== Cavalry and infantry ===
Iberian [[cavalry tactics]] involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing [[javelin]]s, then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting [[spear]]s ([[lance]]s did not arrive in Hispania until the 11th century). There were three types of knights (''caballeros''): royal knights, noble knights (''caballeros [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]]''), and commoner knights (''caballeros villanos'', or "mounted soldier from a [[Villa#Post-Roman era|villa]]"). Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.

Royal knights were equipped in the same manner as their [[Goths|Gothic]] predecessors: mail [[hauberk]], kite shield, a long [[sword]] (designed to fight from the horse), javelins, spears and a [[francisca|Visigothic axe]]. Noble knights came from the ranks of the ''infanzones'' or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] because of ''[[fueros]]'' (charters) with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shields (influenced by Moorish shields), as well as a sword.

The ''peones'' were [[peasants]] who went to battle in service of their [[feudal]] lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The [[longbow]], the [[composite bow]], and the [[crossbow]] were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.

Armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales; full coats of [[chain mail]] were extremely rare and horse [[barding]] completely unknown. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector (influenced by the designs used by [[Viking]]s, who attacked during the 8th and 9th centuries) and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.

Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30&amp;nbsp;cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

Finally, mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available. [[Norsemen]], [[Flemings|Flemish]] spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers, and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.

=== Technological changes ===
This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.

Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family's coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, ''a la jineta'' (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey's seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, ''a la brida'', a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.

==Northern Christian realms==
The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds (see above). However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century (Leon, Najera). The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova (1031) heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre (1035). A myriad of autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.

===Kingdom of Asturias (718–924)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
{{See also|Kingdom of Galicia}}
{{See also|Duchy of Cantabria}}
The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] (''Pelayo''), a [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] noble who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, laying the foundations for the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz De La Peña. La monarquia asturiana 718–910, p. 27. Cangas de Onís, 2000. {{ISBN|9788460630364}} / Fernández Conde. Estudios Sobre La Monarquía Asturiana, pp. 35–76. Estudios Históricos La Olmeda, 2015. {{ISBN|9788497048057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in [[Cangas de Onís]], and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings (particularly [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]) emphasized the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in [[Visigothic Kingdom|Toledo]] and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Casariego, J.E.: Crónicas de los reinos de Asturias y León. Biblioteca Universitaria Everest, León 1985, p. 68. {{ASIN|B00I78R3S4}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius' daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alfonso's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque from [[Álava]], after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], while Alfonso I's daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

Alfonso's military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of [[Vardulia]]. With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], and [[Coimbra]]. Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|[[James, son of Zebedee#Spain|St James the Great]], depicted as [[Saint James Matamoros|Santiago Matamoros]] (Santiago the Moor-slayer)]]

During the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to [[Oviedo]]. The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of [[Pamplona]] and the [[Carolingian]]s, thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the [[Pope]] and [[Charlemagne]].

The [[relic|bones]] of St. [[James the Great]] were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia (present day [[Padrón]]) in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally "the star field"), possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to León, to become the [[Kingdom of León]] or Galicia-León. Santiago's were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Iberia. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later [[Way of Saint James]] (11–12th century) that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental [[Christian Europe]] for centuries.

Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], famed for the highly legendary [[Battle of Clavijo]], the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Galicia, and [[León (province)|León]] were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the [[Kingdom of León]], when León became the seat of the royal court (it didn't bear any official name).

===Kingdom of León (910–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of León|Kingdom of Galicia|County of Portugal}}
[[Alfonso III of Asturias]] repopulated the strategically important city [[León, Spain|León]] and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the [[Douro]] river. He reorganized his territories into the major duchies ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal) and major counties ([[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]] and Castile), and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the [[Kingdom of León]]. From this power base, his heir [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]] was able to organize attacks against [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and even [[Seville]].

The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] was gaining power, and began to attack León. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were [[battle of Valdejunquera|defeated in Valdejunquera]] in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.

The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for León was the reign of [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]]. King Ramiro, in alliance with [[Fernán González of Castile]] and his retinue of ''caballeros villanos'', [[battle of Simancas|defeated the Caliph in Simancas]] in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until [[Almanzor]] began his campaigns. [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]] finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.

The conquest of León did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after (by Ferdinand, son of Sancho the Great, around 1038). However, this brief period of independence meant that Galicia remained a kingdom and fief of Leon, which is the reason it is part of Spain and not Portugal. Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and León, instead of merely king of León as the two were united personally and not in union.

===Kingdom of Castile (1037–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Castile}}
[[File:Alfonso VI reconquista Toledo.JPG|thumb|Ceramic of the conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]]]]
[[Ferdinand I of León]] was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered [[Coimbra]] and attacked the [[taifa]] kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as [[parias]]. Ferdinand's strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous ''fueros''. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son [[Sancho II of Castile]] wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as [[El Cid Campeador]]. Sancho was killed in the siege of [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]] by the traitor Bellido Dolfos (also known as Vellido Adolfo) in 1072. His brother [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] took over León, Castile and Galicia.

Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the ''fueros'' and repopulated [[Segovia]], [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]] and [[Salamanca]]. Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful [[Taifa of Toledo|Taifa kingdom of Toledo]] in 1085. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this "conquest" was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. It was not until after sporadic and consistent population resettlements had taken place that Toledo was decisively conquered.

Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ("Emperor of all [[Hispania]]", referring to all the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, and not just the modern country of Spain). Alfonso's more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African [[Almoravid]]s for help.

=== Kingdom of Navarre (824–1620) ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Navarre}}
The [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona (traditionally in 824), establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the [[muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] of Tudela.

Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho the Great]] (1004–1035). The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the Principality of Catalonia. This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over [[Gascony]].

In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]] declared himself [[Kingdom of Navarre|king of Navarre]]. Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.

===Kingdom of Aragon (1035–1706)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon}}
[[File:Jaume I, Cantigas de Santa Maria, s.XIII.jpg|thumb|The Moors request permission from [[James I of Aragon]]]]

The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when [[Sancho III of Navarre]] decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of [[Alfonso the Battler]] in 1135.

In 1137 the heiress of the kingdom married the [[count of Barcelona]], and their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in what modern historians call the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the [[kingdom of Valencia]] and the [[kingdom of Mallorca]]. [[James I of Aragon]], also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], which released him from the nominal suzerainty of the King of France.

Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless [[Sancho VII of Navarre]]. But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose [[Theobald IV of Champagne]] in his stead.

Later on, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], married [[Isabella of Castile]], leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern [[Spain]], after the conquest of Upper [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (Navarre south of the Pyrenees) and the [[kingdom of Granada]].

===Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1910)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Portugal}}
[[File:GeraldoGeraldesSemPavor.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of [[Gerald the Fearless]]. A Portuguese folk hero with the head of a Moor]]

In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]] against the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Afonso Henriques]] was proclaimed the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Afonso's great deeds, whereby he would establish the first [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]] and be crowned by the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Archbishop of Braga]]. In the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143, [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.

In 1147, Portugal [[Conquest of Santarém|captured Santarém]], and seven months later the city of [[Lisbon]] was also brought under Portuguese control after the [[Siege of Lisbon]]. By the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]], [[Pope Alexander III]] recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.

With [[Portugal]] finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbours, [[Afonso Henriques]] and his successors, aided by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and the military monastic orders the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Order of Aviz]] or the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Saint James]], pushed the [[Moors]] to the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the ''Reconquista'' came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of [[Afonso III of Portugal]], religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.

[[File:OrderOfCristCross.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]]]

After the completion of the ''Reconquista'', the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless, [[Denis of Portugal]] carried out a short war with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] for possession of the towns of [[Serpa]] and [[Moura Municipality|Moura]]. After this, Denis avoided war; he signed the Treaty of Alcanizes with [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in 1297, establishing the present-day borders.

During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over [[Europe]], under the influence of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]] requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of [[Tomar]] as the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in 1319. Denis believed that the Order's assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars' contribution to the ''Reconquista'' and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.

The experience gained during the battles of the ''Reconquista'' was fundamental to [[Conquest of Ceuta]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} the first step to the establishment of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Likewise, the contact with [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim's navigation techniques and sciences]] enabled the creation of [[Portuguese Renaissance|Portuguese nautical innovations]] such as the [[caravel]] – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=John M.|title=The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521547246|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C&amp;pg=PA141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Minor Christian realms were the [[Kingdom of Viguera]] (970–1005), and the [[:es:Señorío de Valencia|Principality of Valencia]] (1094–1102).

==Christian infighting==
Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers.  Some Christian champions, like [[El Cid]], were contracted by [[taifa]] kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed, [[El Cid]]'s first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the [[Battle of Graus]] in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir|al-Muqtadir]], Muslim [[sultan]] of [[Zaragoza]], against the forces of [[Ramiro I of Aragon]]. There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Iberia.&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan"&gt;Joseph O'Callaghan (2003). ''Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain'', Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disastrous defeat of [[Alfonso VIII]], King of Castile, at [[Battle of Alarcos|Alarcos]], Kings [[Alfonso IX]] of León and [[Sancho VII]] of Navarre entered an alliance with the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], King of Portugal, Pope [[Celestine III]] declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that "the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see."&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan" /&gt; Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] invaded León. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.

In the late years of ''Al-Andalus'', Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of [[Granada]], but the kings preferred to claim the tribute of the Muslim ''[[parias]]''. The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered [[medieval Europe]].

==Christian repopulation of Iberian Peninsula==
{{Further|Medieval demography|Repoblación}}
The ''Reconquista'' was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of [[colonization|repopulation]]. Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the [[Douro]] Basin (the northern plateau), the high [[Ebro]] valley ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) and central [[Catalonia]]. The repopulation of the [[Douro]] Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the "pressure" (or ''presura'') system was employed. South of the [[Douro]], in the 10th and 11th centuries, the ''presura'' led to the "charters" (''[[foral|forais]]'' or ''[[fueros]]''). ''Fueros'' were used even south of the Central Range.

The ''presura'' referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as [[León (province)|León]] and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many [[wikt:freeman|free]] peasants. ''Presuras'' also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of [[Vic]].

During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing. ''[[Fuero]]s'' were [[charter]]s documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The ''fueros'' provided a means of escape from the [[feudal system]], as ''fueros'' were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide ''auxilium'' – aid or troops – for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the ''caballeros villanos''. The first ''fuero'' was given by count [[Fernán González]] to the inhabitants of [[Castrojeriz]] in the 940's. The most important towns of medieval Iberia had ''fueros'', or ''forais''. In Navarre, ''fueros'' were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the ''fuero'' of [[Teruel]], which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.

From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. ''Fueros'' remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. ''Fueros'' had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the ''fueros'' in Navarre would be one of the causes of the [[Carlist Wars]]. In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I ([[Castilian War of the Communities]]).

==Muslim decline and defeat==

===Fall of the Caliphate===
[[File:Batalla del Puig por Marzal de Sas (1410-20).jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Puig]] at [[El Puig|El Puig de Santa Maria]] in 1237]]

During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the [[Emir of Córdoba]] ([[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself [[Caliph]], independent from the [[Abbasid]]s in [[Baghdad]]. He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.

After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. Abd-ar-Rahman's grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great [[Vizier]] [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir|Almanzor]] (''al-Mansur'', "the victorious"). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking [[Burgos]], León, [[Pamplona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Santiago de Compostela]] before his death in 1002.

Between Almanzor's death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the [[Taifa|Taifa kingdoms]]. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.

The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] conquered [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], leader of the Almoravids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Almoravids===
{{Main article|Almoravid dynasty}}
[[File:Mapa reconquista almohades-en.svg|thumb|Extent of the ''Reconquista'' into Almohad territory as of 1157.]]
[[File:Capture de Séville par Ferdinand III.jpg|thumb|Capture of Seville by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] (painted by [[Francisco Pacheco]])]]
The [[Almoravid]]s were a Muslim militia primarily composed of Berber and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] Moors, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1094, due to the actions of [[El Cid]].

Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]], for he lost Rioja to [[Sancho II of Castile]], and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king [[Sancho Ramírez]], King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering ''Wasqa&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Huesca]] deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25&amp;nbsp;km from ''Saraqusta&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Zaragoza]].

Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and [[Taifa of Lérida|Lérida]], as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties.  But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

===Almohads===
{{Main article|Almohad dynasty}}
[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|''The Surrender of Granada'' by [[Francisco Pradilla Ortiz]]]]
After a brief period of disintegration (the second [[Taifa]] period), the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of ''Al-Andalus''. However they were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of ''Al-Andalus'' in the following decades. By 1252 only the [[Kingdom of Granada]] remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.

===Granada War and the end of Muslim rule in Iberia===
{{Main article|Granada War|Treaty of Granada (1491)}}
[[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] completed the ''Reconquista'' with a war against the [[Emirate of Granada]] that started in 1482 and ended with Granada's surrender on January 2, 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered "half a million within the realm." By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada's former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the [[Alpujarras]] mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to [[Tlemcen]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry. "Spain 1469 – 1714 A Society of Conflict." Third edition. pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1497 Spanish forces took [[Melilla]], west of Oran, and the island of [[Djerba]], south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|seizure of Oran in 1509]], and the capture of [[Bougie]] and [[Spanish conquest of Tripoli (1510)|Tripoli in 1510]]. The Spanish capture of [[Tripoli]] cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Great Muslim Empires|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in the east and were pushed back.

==Conversions and expulsions==
{{Main article|Treaty of Granada (1491)|Alhambra decree|Expulsion of the Moriscos|Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain}}
[[File:Higueruela.jpg|thumb|Forces of [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Sultan of [[Granada]], at the [[Battle of La Higueruela]], 1431]]

As elsewhere in the Muslim world, Christians and Jews were allowed to retain their religions, with their own legal systems and courts, by paying a tax, the ''[[jizya]]''. The penalty for not paying it was imprisonment.

The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)]] only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On July 30, 1492, all the Jewish community – some 200,000 people – were forcibly expelled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/expulsion.html "Modern Jewish History: The Spanish Expulsion (1492)"], ''The Jewish Virtual Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the [[Alhambra decree]] ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared conversion to Catholicism compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] did the same to Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing conversions of its Muslim population during the [[Revolt of the Germanies]].&lt;ref name = "Tofiño"&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ciberletras/v06/tofino.html Censorship and Book Production in Spain During the Age of the Incunabula], Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada. Graduate Center, CUNY.&lt;/ref&gt; Many local officials took advantage of the situation to seize property.

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
{{Main article|Spanish Inquisition}}

Most of the descendants of those Muslims who submitted to conversion to Christianity – rather than exile – during the early periods of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, the Moriscos, were later [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled from Spain]] after serious social upheaval, when the Inquisition was at its height. The expulsions were carried out more severely in eastern Spain (Valencia and Aragon) due to local animosity towards Muslims and Moriscos where they were seen as economic rivals by local workers who saw them as cheap labor undermining their bargaining position with the landlords. Exactions imposed on the Moriscos paved the way to a major [[Morisco revolt]] happening in 1568, with the final [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] from [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] taking place in 1609; they were driven from [[Aragon]] at about the same time.

Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as ''[[Morisco]]s'', ''[[Marrano]]s'', and ''[[Converso]]s'', who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some – the numbers are debated – continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nevertheless, all those deemed to be "New Christians" were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions various [[treason|crimes against the Spanish state]] including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Classifications and later consequences==
[[File:Pedro Berruguete Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe 1495.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Dominic]] presiding over an ''auto-da-fé'', by [[Pedro Berruguete]] (around 1495)&lt;ref name="Prado"&gt;* [http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/saint-dominic-presides-over-an-auto-da-fe/] at [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The many advances and retreats created several social types:
*The ''[[Muladi]]'': Christians under Islamic rule who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Berbers.
*The ''[[Mozarab]]s'': Christians in Muslim-held lands. Some of them migrated to the north of the peninsula in times of persecution bringing elements of the styles, food and agricultural practices learned from the Andalusians, while they continued practicing their Christianity with older forms of Catholic worship and their own versions of the [[Latin]] language.
*"[[New Christians]]", Jews converting to Christianity called ''[[conversos]]'', or pejoratively ''[[Marrano]]s''. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were [[Crypto-Jews]] who continued practicing [[Judaism]] secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews, known as ''Conversos'' (''the converted''), were subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of ''conversos'' in [[auto-da-fé]]s ("acts of faith"), often public executions by burning the victim alive.
*The ''[[Mudéjar]]'' : Muslims in Christian-held lands.
* ''[[Morisco]]s'': Muslim ''[[converso]]s''. Muslims who were forced to convert to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the [[Alhambra Decree]] the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]].

==Legacy==
{{See also|History of Spain|History of Portugal|Portugal in the period of discoveries}}

Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the ''Reconquista'' are the subject of much of medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Spanish literature|Spanish]], and [[Catalan literature]] such as the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

Some noble [[genealogy|genealogies]] show the close relations (although not very numerous) between Muslims and Christians. For example, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]], whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish ''Al-Andalus'' Iberia, married Abda, daughter of [[Sancho II of Navarra|Sancho Garcés II]] of [[Navarra]], who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in pejorative sense as [[Sanchuelo]] (''Little Sancho''; in Arabic: ''Shanjoul'').

After his father's death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], considered among the greatest of the Medieval Spanish kings, designated as his heir his son (also a Sancho) by the refugee [[Muslim]] princess [[Zaida of Seville]].

The ''Reconquista'' was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.

===Festivals in modern Spain===
Currently, festivals called ''[[moros y cristianos]]'' (Castilian), ''moros i cristians'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''mouros e cristãos'' (Portuguese) and ''mouros e cristiáns'' (Galician), which all mean "Moors and Christians", recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and lots of fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the [[Land of Valencia]], like [[Alcoi]], [[Ontinyent]] or [[Villena]].

=== Persistent effects ===
A 2016 study found that the manner of the Reconquest has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oto-Peralías|first=Daniel|last2=Romero-Ávila|first2=Diego|date=May 13, 2016|title=The economic consequences of the Spanish Reconquest: the long-term effects of Medieval conquest and colonization|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=409–464|doi=10.1007/s10887-016-9132-9|issn=1381-4338|hdl=10023/10769}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show how territory quickly re-taken during the Reconquest was given to nobility, whereas territory slowly re-taken was more equally distributed and settled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lands dominated by nobility have worse long-term development outcomes and greater inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Reverberations===

On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didn't stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas. The Spanish under the Hapsburg dynasty soon became the champions of Roman Catholicism in Europe and the Mediterranean against the encroaching threat of the [[Ottoman-Hapsburg Wars|Ottoman Caliphate]]. In a similar vein, the Portuguese also extended the Reconquista, this time against Muslim states overseas. The [[conquest of Ceuta]] marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion into Muslim Africa. Soon, the Portuguese also [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts|went into conflict with the Ottoman Caliphate]] in the [[Portuguese expedition to Otranto|Mediterranean]]&lt;ref&gt;proficiscitur Hydruntum classis quam ex Portugallia accersivimus. . .

'''Schmiede Hallein''' is a media and art festival taking place since 2003 during September in [[Hallein]], [[Austria]]. During a period of ten days international participants work on projects in a former industrial building. It focuses on music productions, film, photography and performances.

== Participation ==
Schmiede receives over 200 applications from more than 20 countries every year, of which 80% are accepted and an additional 30 guests are invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schmiede.ca/info/|title=Schmiede website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are called ''Smiths'' and form a community beyond the festival. Participation has been free of charge in earlier years but in 2010 a  €50  participation fee was introduced.

== Location ==
Schmiede Hallein takes place in a former salt refinery, a building that also hosts other cultural events in Hallein and the Salzburg Summeracadamy. The somewhat isolated location allows participants to focus on their projects without distraction.

== Sponsorship ==
The festival is supported by a range of companies and institutions ranging from the city of Hallein to federal ministries:
Kulturland [[Salzburg]], city of [[Hallein]],BM:UKK, WIBERG, [[FM4]], [[Red Bull Music Academy]], Kunstraum Pro Arte in Hallein, [[Carhartt]] Europe, MusicImport: CAD, Mackie und Aphex, Tourismusverband Hallein

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite web | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite web | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = | year = | pages = | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Social protection''', as defined by the [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development]], is concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s [[well being]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating [[Poverty]] and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce [[poverty]] and vulnerability by promoting efficient [[labour market]]s, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks, such as [[unemployment]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]], sickness, [[disability]] and old age.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2001. Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper: From Safety Net to Springboard. Washington DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of social protection:

*'''Labor market interventions''' are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets and the protection of workers.
*'''[[Social insurance]]''' mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance.
*'''[[Social safety net|Social assistance]]''' is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged.

==History of social protection==
Traditionally, social protection has been used in the [[European welfare state]] and other parts of the developed world to maintain a certain living standard, and address transient poverty.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combati
ng Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first examples of state-provided social protection can be tracked to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], who expanded a program for free grain to include more poor citizens of the empire. In addition, he instituted public funds to support poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Mason.  “Trajan”. Encyclopædia Britannica.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Organized [[welfare]] was not common until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It was during this period that in both Germany and Great Britain, welfare systems were established to target the working classes (see [[National Insurance]]).&lt;ref&gt;“The Liberal reforms 1906-1914”.  BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed several years later, during the [[Great Depression]], with emergency relief for those struck the hardest.  However, modern social protection has grown to envelop a much broader range of issues and purposes; it is now being used as a policy approach in developing nations, to address issues of persistent poverty and target structural causes.  Moreover, it is designed to lift recipients out of poverty, rather than exclusively providing passive protection against contingencies .&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; social protection has rapidly been used in trying to reduce and ultimately eliminate poverty and suffering in developing countries (mostly in Africa), so to enhance and promote economic and social growth.

==Types of social protection==

===Labor market Interventions===
Labor market interventions, consisting of both active and passive policies, provide protection for the poor who are capable of gaining employment. Passive programs, such as unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labor legislation, allieviate the financial needs of the unemployed but are not designed to improve their employability.&lt;ref&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social-protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; A European Union-funded research as part of the DRIVERS project revealed a linear
relationship between investments in national active labour market policies (specifically those directed towards integrating vulnerable groups into employment) and quality of work. It found that European countries with more active labour market policies seem to have healthier, less stressed workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health-gradient.eu/lower-education-leads-to-a-more-stressful-working-life-labour-market-policies-can-mitigate-this/|title=Health Gradient - EuroHealthNet|website=health-gradient.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, active programs focus on directly increasing the access of unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. Labor. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]   (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/labor.asp)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Active labour market policies]] (ALMPs) are used to reduce the risk of unemployment and to increase the earnings capacity of workers.  ALMPs have two basic objectives: (1) economic, by increasing the ability of the unemployed to find jobs, and increase productivity and earnings; and (2) social, by improving the inclusion and participation of productive employment. These programs have the ability to increase employment opportunities and address the social problems that often accompany high unemployment.  Active policies are a way of reversing the negative effects of industrial restructuring in transition economies and to help integrate vulnerable people furthest from the labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/
EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html)&lt;/ref&gt;  ALMPs are often targeted to the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. These programs have important social, as well as economic, objectives.  Active labor market programs include a wide range of activities to stimulate employment and productivity such as:
*'''Employment services.''' These services include counseling, placement assistance, job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services to improve the functioning of the labor market.
*'''Job Training'''. This includes training/retraining for the unemployed, workers in mass layoffs and youth to increase the quantity of work supply.
*'''Direct employment generation''' The promotion of small and medium enterprises (e.g., public works projects, subsidies) to increase labor demand.&lt;ref&gt;Betcherman, G., Olivas, K. and Dar, A., 2004, ‘Impacts of Active Labor Market Programs: New Evidence from Evaluations with Particular Attention to Developing and Transition Countries’, Social Protection Discussion Paper Series no. 0402, World Bank, Washington&lt;/ref&gt;
A common issue in implementing successful labor market interventions is how to incorporate the informal economy, which comprises a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; Informal employment comprises between half and three quarters of non-agricultural employment in the majority of these countries. The proportion of informal employment increases when agriculture is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/secsoc/areas/policy/informal.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most informal workers are not covered by social security schemes, occupational safety and health measures, working conditions regulations and have limited access to health services and work-related measures of social protection.  Labor market interventions work to integrate the different strategies to prevent and compensate occupational and social risks in the informal economy.  The strategies that include measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, F., 2009, ‘Social Protection and the Informal Economy: Linkages and Good Practices for Poverty Reduction and Empowerment’, in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ‘Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Social Protection’, OECD, Paris, pp.69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, public expenditure on labor market policy (LMP) interventions falls within three main categories:
*'''Labor Market Services (1)''' 
*'''Total LMP Measures (2-7)'''
training (2),
job rotation &amp; job sharing (3),
employment incentives (4),
supported employment &amp; rehabilitation (5),
direct job creation (6),
start-up incentives (7),

*'''Total LMP supports (8-9)'''
out-of-work income maintenance and support (8),
early retirement (9)

===Social insurance===
{{Main|Social insurance}}
Social insurance schemes are contributory programs that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums.   Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk in the event of shock.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance.  Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance.   Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable.  In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, M., 2002, ‘Reduction of Catastrophic Health Care Expenditures by a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme in Gujarat, India: Current Experiences and Challenges’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 80, no. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social assistance===
[[Social assistance]] schemes comprise programs designed to help the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable individuals]] ( i.e., those with no other means of support such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor), households and communities to meet a [[Social floor]] and improve living standards.  These programs consist of all forms of public action, government and non-government, that are designed to transfer resources, either cash or in-kind (e.g. food transfers), to eligible vulnerable and deprived persons.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, F., 2001, 'Social Assistance - Theoretical Background', in 'Social Protection in the Asia and Pacific', ed. I. Ortiz, Asian Development Bank, Manila, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Social assistance interventions may include:
*'''[[Welfare]] and social services''' to highly vulnerable groups such as the physically or mentally disabled, orphans, or substance abusers.
*'''Cash or in-kind transfers''' such as [[Ration stamp|food stamps]] and family allowances.
*'''Temporary subsidies''' such as life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Asian Development Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/default.asp)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Policy issues==

===Universalism vs. Targeting===
There are two main schools of thought concerning scope of social protection.  Universalism argues that each person, by merit of simply being a citizen should be entitled to benefits from social protection programs.  Such a policy would avoid [[means-testing]] and any conditionalities such as work requirements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;   One of the greatest benefits to this policy perspective is social solidarity, since everyone contributes collaboratively to a system that everyone also benefits from.  [[Social security]] is one such example.  Moreover, economists have argued that universalism is an investment in human capital that aids the development of a nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mares, I. 2007. “The economic consequences of the welfare state”.  International Social Security Review, Vol. 60, No. 2/3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers social protection from this perspective, describing existing schemes around the world and presenting simulation data on the potential costs.
Opponents would argue that universalism is cost-ineffective and unfairly distorts individual efforts. Such an argument points toward targeting as a better solution.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a case, the question arises of who should be the target population that receives benefits from social programs.

===Targeting income vs. capabilities===
Net income is the simplest method of determining a needy population.  Some states use a [[Guaranteed Minimum Income]] system, in which all members of a state receive sufficient income to live on, so long as they meet certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;“History of Basic Income”.  Basic Income Earth Network. http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html#history {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |date=2008-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the [[capabilities approach]] argue that income is easier to misrepresent, and moreover, fails to target the root causal factors of poverty.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Hence, they recommend targeting a minimum level of basic capabilities that will impact [[quality of life]], such as institutional improvements like health and education. Policy examples might include a [[social floor]].&lt;ref&gt;ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202 (2012) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:3065524 ILO Recommendation No. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of provision===
Social protection is an expensive and difficult endeavor, by any means; the question remains how best to implement programs that effectively aid the people who need it the most.  Currently, there are a number of mechanisms that provide social protection in various nations. These policies and instruments vary according to country context. In some nations, governments are strongly involved in the provision of social protection, following a [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.  There are also nations which are characterized by dualism, in which there is state-provided protection for those who work in the formal sector, but little to no protection for those who work in the [[informal sector]].  Finally, there are nations in which the economy is largely agrarian, and a great majority of the population works in the informal economy.  In those countries that have only residual social protection coverage and weak state capacity,social protection is mainly provided by non-governmental means such as kin, [[NGO]]s, and individual philanthropic donations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==National programs==

===Developmentalism===
In [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the government provides extensive support for public programs, following the [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, Huck-Ju. 2009. “The reform of the developmental welfare state in East Asia”. International Journal of Social Welfare.  Volume 18, pages S12–S21, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualism===
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[South Africa]], there is a dualist structure of protected formal sector workers and marginalized informal sector workers.,&lt;ref&gt;Lo Vuolo, Barbeito. 1998. Models of stratification via pension policy. The case of Argentina. LASA Conference, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, José Antonio. 2008. “The Latin American Economic Boom”Revista de Ciencia Política, Volume 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian-Informal===
In nations such as [[India]] and [[Tanzania]], governments struggle to provide adequate social protection, and citizens must instead depend on non-state actors and informal provisioning.

==Donor approaches==
International donors and organizations have influenced social protection approaches both at the level of policy discourse and program design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brunori and O'Reilly (2011) for a review(http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29495/)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though The World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) are the major donors and the lead organizations in the field, other organizations are also concerned with social protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton(http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/a-global-review-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The World Bank]] is a source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries. In order to identify social risks and potential responses, The World Bank developed a tool called “[[Social Risk Management]]” (SRM).  The SRM framework includes interventions that focus on managing risks before shocks occur.  It is based on two assessments: (1) the poor are most exposed to diverse risks, and (2) the poor have the fewest tools to deal with these risks.  The main elements of the SRM framework are:
*''Risk reduction'' measures that focus on reducing risks in the labor market.
*''Risk mitigation'' measures to deal with anticipated shock.
*''Risk coping'' mechanisms to relieve the impact of risk after its occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) brings 30 democratic countries together to seek answers to common problems and coordinate domestic and international policies.  The [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the OECD is responsible for the Poverty Network (POVNET) that has become very influential on policy development.  The DAC-POVNET focuses on the following areas:
*Poverty reduction
*[http://www.oecd.org/document/1/0,3746,en_2649_34621_36573761_1_1_1_1,00.html Pro-poor growth]
*People centered development
*[[Decent work]] &lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic and Co-Operation and Development. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.oecd.org/pages/0,3417,en_36734052_36734103_1_1_1_1_1,00.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Labour Organization]], which covers both issues of social security and labor protection, has been the [[United Nations]] agency responsible for setting norms and standards at work.  Currently the ILO focuses, amongst others, on the following strategies: 
*Extending social protection to all
*Promoting decent working conditions
*Providing programs for informal and migrant workers &lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">The '''subjective character of experience''' is a term in psychology and the [[philosophy of mind]] denoting that all [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[phenomena]] are associated with a single [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] ("[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]"). The term was coined and illuminated by [[Thomas Nagel]] in his famous paper "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]"&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas (1974) '''What is It Like to Be a Bat?''' ''The Philosophical Review'' LXXXIII, 4 (October): 435–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagel argues that, because bats are apparently [[conscious]] [[mammals]] with a way of perceiving their environment entirely different from that of [[human beings]], it is impossible to speak of "what is it like to ''be'' a bat ''for'' the bat" or, while the example of the bat is particularly illustrative, any conscious species, as each organism has a unique point of view from which no other organism can gather [[experience]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} To Nagel, the subjective character of experience implies the [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitive closure]] of the human [[mind]] to some facts, specifically the [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s that [[Human body|physical states]] create.

==Subjective reality==
{{Section OR|date=May 2014}}
Subjective character of experience implies that the perception of all things, concepts, and "truths" in the universe differs between individuals: we all live in different worlds, each of which may have things in common, because of our unique perspectives on our worlds. The only thing to which one can hold oneself is something one has experienced or perceived. Until someone has had an experience of something the object or concept within itself is not "real." Someone in Africa is aware of the existence of fire and sees it but for an Inuit who has never seen fire before the fire does not exist in the same way. The idea of the subjectivity of one's "reality" also hints at an aspect of [[moral relativism]], that each person's opinions are the only things they can hold themselves to.

==Dual-subjective reality==
{{Section OR|date=May 2014}}
A dual-subjective reality arises when an individual's mind interprets information and, instead of creating only one interpretation that the conscious mind can make sense of, creates several. These differing "realities" then cause conflict in that individual who may confuse what is actually happening around them with alternative realities formulated in their mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12353">'''Task analysis''' is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task.&lt;ref name=Kirwan&gt;{{cite book |author=Kirwan, B. and Ainsworth, L. (Eds.) |year=1992 |title=A guide to task analysis |publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Information from a task analysis can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design,&lt;ref name=Hackos&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hackos, JoAnn T.  |author2=Redish, Janice C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=User and Task Analysis for Interface Design |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s, or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]]. Though distinct, task analysis is related to [[user analysis]].

==Applications==
The term "task" is often used interchangeably with [[wikt:activity|activity]] or [[wikt:process|process]]. Task analysis often results in a hierarchical representation of what steps it takes to perform a task for which there is a goal and for which there is some lowest-level "action" or interaction among humans and/or machines: this is known as '''hierarchical task analysis'''. Tasks may be identified and defined at multiple levels of abstraction as required to support the purpose of the analysis.  A '''critical task analysis''', for example, is an analysis of human performance requirements which, if not accomplished in accordance with system requirements, will likely have adverse effects on cost, system reliability, efficiency, effectiveness, or safety.&lt;ref name="data item description"&gt;{{cite book |title=DOD Data Item Description (DID) DI-HFAC-81399B: Critical Task Analysis Report|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Task analysis is often performed by [[human factors and ergonomics]] professionals.

Task analysis may be of manual tasks, such as bricklaying, and be analyzed as [[time and motion studies]] using concepts from [[industrial engineering]]. Cognitive task analysis is applied to modern work environments such as [[supervisory control]] where little physical work occurs, but the tasks are more related to [[situational awareness|situation assessment]], [[decision making]], and response planning and execution.&lt;ref name=Crandall&gt;{{cite book |author=Crandall, B., Klein, G., and Hoffman, R. |year=2006 |title=Working minds: A practitioner's guide to cognitive task analysis |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Task analysis is also used in [[education]]. It is a model that is applied to classroom tasks to discover which [[curriculum]] components are well matched to the capabilities of students with [[learning disabilities]] and which task modification might be necessary. It discovers which tasks a person hasn't mastered, and the information processing demands of tasks that are easy or problematic. In behavior modification, it is a breakdown of a complex behavioral sequence into steps. This often serves as the basis for [[chaining]].

The results of task analysis are often represented in task models, which clearly indicate the relations among the various tasks, An example notation used to specify task models is [[ConcurTaskTrees]] (by [[Fabio Paternò]]), which is also supported by tools that are freely available.&lt;ref name=Paterno&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Fabio Paternò]] |year=2002 |title=CTTE: Support for Developing and Analysing Task Models for Interactive System Design |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus work domain analysis==
If task analysis is likened to a set of instructions on how to navigate from Point A to Point B, then [[Work domain analysis]] (WDA) is like having a map of the terrain that includes Point A and Point B. WDA is broader and focuses on the environmental constraints and opportunities for behavior, as in [[James J. Gibson|Gibsonian]] [[ecological psychology]] and [[ecological interface design]] (Vicente, 1999; Bennett &amp; Flach, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;61)

==Documentation==
Since the 1980s, a major change in technical documentation has been to emphasize the tasks performed with a system rather than documenting the system itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hackos and Redish, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software documentation]] particularly, long printed technical manuals that exhaustively describe every function of the software are being replaced by online help organized into tasks. This is part of the new emphasis on [[usability]] and [[user-centered design]] rather than system/software/product design.&lt;ref name=Brockmann&gt;{{cite book |author=Brockmann, R. John |year=1986 |title=Writing Better Computer User Documentation – From Paper to Online |publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This task orientation in technical documentation began with publishing guidelines issued by IBM in the late 1980s. Later IBM studies led to [[John M. Carroll (information scientist)|John Carroll]]'s theory of [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalism]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, John M. |year=1990 |title=The Nurnberg Funnel – Designing Minimalist Instruction for Practical Computer Skill |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[XML]] as a [[markup language]] suitable for both print and online documentation (replacing [[SGML]] with its focus on print), IBM developed the [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] XML standard in 2000. Now an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard, DITA has a strong emphasis on task analysis. Its three basic information types are Task, Concept, and Reference. Tasks are analyzed into steps, with a main goal of identifying steps that are [[Reuse#Reuse of information|reusable]] in multiple tasks.

==Hierarchical task analysis==
'''Hierarchical task analysis''' (HTA) is a task description method and a variant of task analysis. Task description is a necessary precursor for other analysis techniques, including [[critical path analysis]] (CPA). HTA is used to produce an exhaustive description of tasks in a hierarchical structure of goals, sub-goals, operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=N.A.|title=Human factors methods: a practical guide for engineering and design|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|author2=Salmon, P.M. |author3=Walker, G.H. |author4=Baber, C. |author5= Jenkins, D.P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In HTA, tasks are broken down into progressively smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=M|title=Towards a framework to select techniques for error prediction: supporting novice users in the healthcare sector|journal=Applied Ergonomics|year=2010|volume=40|issue=3|pages=379–395|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2008.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations and plans===
Operations are the actions performed by people interacting with a system or by the system itself,&lt;ref name="Stanton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=N.A.|title=Hierarchical task analysis: developments, applications, and extensions|journal=Applied Ergonomics|year=2006|volume=37|issue=1|pages=55–79|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2005.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans explain the conditions necessary for these operations.&lt;ref name="Kirwan" /&gt; Operations describe the smallest individual task steps in the HTA, i.e. those which cannot be broken down into plans and further operations. They are the individual actions, such as 'visually locate control' or 'move hand to control', which the user must perform in a particular combination to achieve the goal of task completion.

===Applying===
The following steps should be followed when conducting a HTA:
:# Define the task under investigation and identify the purpose of the task analysis. The analyst should have some further evaluation methods in mind for which the HTA will be useful and should have reason for needing this type of analysis to be performed.
:# Data collection – In order to carry out the HTA it is necessary to obtain data on how the task is performed. This could be collected via observation of the task in question or from a detailed specification of the device under analysis. Alternatively, [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|interviews or questionnaires]] with people that have first-hand experience of performing that task could be conducted to gather the necessary detail.
:# Define the overall task goal, which will be presented as the top level in the HTA. An example might be "increase fan speed by two steps". This describes what is being achieved by performing the task; however, at this stage there is no indication of how the task will be performed.
:# Determine the next level of sub-goals by breaking down the overall goal. A sub-goal for the above example might be "open the climate menu". This provides more information about how to accomplish the task; however, it can still be broken down into smaller units, which will describe the individual operations (performed via the visual, manual or cognitive modes) that need to be performed.
:# Continue breaking down the sub-goals until all operations are identified. Operations in the "reduce fan speed task" will include "move finger to climate menu button" and "touch climate menu button". 
:# Define plans to describe how to perform the operations in each sub-goal level of the hierarchy. In the fan speed example, the two operations will have to be performed in series, one after the other. The plan will instruct the user to "perform 1, then 2". Operations can also be performed in parallel, and in this case the plan would instruct the user to "perform 1 and 2 together". Numbers should be assigned to the different levels in the hierarchy.

====Organising the hierarchy====
Each level in the HTA should be numbered according to its hierarchical level: The overall goal is the highest hierarchical level and should be numbered 0. The first sub-goal in the hierarchy will be 1, also with plan 1. Further levels just extend this system - third hierarchical level: 1.1, fourth hierarchical level: 1.1.1, and so on. A HTA can be represented in list or diagram form. In list form lines should be indented to denote the different hierarchical levels. In diagram form each operation should be placed within a box and links should be made between them: a lower hierarchical level should branch from underneath a higher level operation. Plans should be written next to the branches to describe the way in which the branched operations should be carried out.

===Applications and limitations===
HTA is a task description method which is most commonly used as a starting point for further analyses such as multimodal CPA and SHERPA.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; On its own, HTA does not provide results for usability evaluation; however, you should be able to study the HTA in order to learn about the structure of different tasks. It may also allow you to highlight unnecessary task steps or potential errors that might occur in task performance. HTA is a fairly time-consuming method to carry out as each individual operation in a task needs to be analysed; however, creating a comprehensive HTA can considerably reduce the time required for other modelling methods.

The Uyghur script was used in Mongolia until its independence from [[Qing dynasty]] China, at the beginning of the 20th century and few years before Russia introduced [[Cyrillic]]. It is still used mainly in [[Inner-Mongolia]]. In current day Mongolia, Cyrillic is the official script for the Mongolian language, and the traditional script is referred to as the ''Old Mongol script'' ({{lang-mn|Хуучин монгол бичиг}}). Today, an estimated 6 million Mongolians from China can still read the traditional Mongolian script but only 3 million from Mongolia.

The [[Manchu alphabet]] was derived since the very end of the 16th century from this Mongolian script.

[[Image:Ambient-temperature-augsburg.png|310px|thumb|Temperature in [[Augsburg]]]]
A '''Temporal Raster Plot''' is a graphic representation of occurrences in a certain temporal relation. Temporal Raster Plots are also sometimes referred to as [[carpet plot]]s.

Each occurrence is registered in a Cartesian coordinate system, in which both axes show time, have different time resolutions: one axis shows slices of data, the other some sensible interval. A common example would be that one axis shows hours in a day, the other days in a year.

In a 2D plot, the value to be plotted is coded with an intensity or a color. In the 3D variant of the plot, it is often coded as a height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poet.lbl.gov/phase2/BPlots.htm#plot1|title='Whole building electrical power over time'|accessdate=17 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513010842/http://poet.lbl.gov/phase2/BPlots.htm#plot1|archivedate=13 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When visualized, particularly the color-coded variant of the plot may easily show a [[carpet]]-like pattern.

Temporal Raster Plots make it easy to show time-based relations within a large sets of time-interval data and often make it easy to recognize [[Maxima and minima|local maxima and minima]]. Assuming the chosen time division is related to the events, it is also easy to recognize global and local patterns, such as recurrent events.

In the following example, the data is one year's worth of measurements of the outdoor temperatures in [[Augsburg]], with four samples taken per hour. In the according carpet diagram, each column represents a day in the year and contains the values for that day (from 0:00 until 23:45).
Despite the high number of measure points (about 35000) it is easy to distinguish local and global patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">An '''umbrella effect''' is the protection extended by the presence of an [[umbrella species]] to other [[species]] in the same [[habitat]].  

The umbrella species is often either a [[flagship species]] whose [[Conservation biology|conservation]] benefits other species&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, 2002, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[keystone species]] which may be targeted for conservation due to its impact on an [[ecosystem]].  
&lt;br /&gt;More generally, an umbrella species determines the area over which conservation occurs.  
They are often representative of other species in their habitat, being an easily observable and known species.

==Example==
A good example of an umbrella species and its impact is summed up by Kimberly Andrews, a University of Georgia doctoral student at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Protecting a species like the [[Canebrake Rattlesnake|canebrake]] has practical applications, as protection measures would have broad [[natural environment|environmental]] value because of an umbrella effect. That is, protecting the [[rattlesnakes]] would ensure protection of other [[wildlife]] species that use the same habitats but are less sensitive to [[overdevelopment|development]] or require fewer [[resources]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Uses this concept==
The concept of an umbrella species is further utilized to create [[wildlife corridor]]s with what are termed [[EDGE species#Focal species|focal species]]. These focal species are chosen for a number of reasons and fall into several types, generally measured by their potential for an umbrella effect. By carefully choosing species based on this criterion, a linked or networked habitat can be created from single-species corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Arizona University (Majka, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are determined with the assistance of [[geographic information system]]s on the larger scale. Regardless of the location or scale of conservation, the umbrella effect is a measurement of a species' impact on others and is an important part of determining an approach.

[[File:Leafyseadragon2276ppx PLW edit.JPG|thumb|237px|[[Leafy sea dragon]] avoids recognition by predators, with alga-like coloration, protuberances and behaviour]]

'''Underwater camouflage''' is the set of methods of achieving [[crypsis]]—avoidance of observation—that allows otherwise visible aquatic [[organism]]s to remain unnoticed by other organisms such as [[predator]]s or [[prey]].

[[Camouflage]] in large bodies of water differs markedly from camouflage on land. The environment is essentially the same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background{{efn|The zoologist [[Peter Herring]] notes that even the word "background" is land-based.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}} But the sea surface is continually changing.}} to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and [[counter-illumination]]. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.

Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by [[decorator crab]]s; [[mimesis]] by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]]; [[countershading]] by many fish including [[shark]]s; distraction with [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] by many fish; [[active camouflage]] through ability to change colour rapidly in [[fish]] such as the flounder, and [[cephalopod]]s including [[octopus]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[squid]].

== Context ==
{{main article|Camouflage}}

The ability to camouflage oneself provides a survival advantage in the constant struggle between [[predator]]s and [[prey]]. [[Natural selection]] has produced a wide variety of methods of survival in the oceans.&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aquarium Fish: Physical Crypsis: Mimicry and Camouflage |author=Sewell, Aaron |date=March 2010 |url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2010/3/fish2 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] commented on the color-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for signalling, of [[cephalopod]]s including the [[octopus]], in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]. ''[[Historia Animalium]]''. IX, 622a: 2-10. About 400 BC. Cited in Luciana Borrelli, [[Francesca Gherardi]], Graziano Fiorito. ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''.

:The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed.

{{further information|List of camouflage methods}}

Three main camouflage methods predominate in the oceans: transparency,&lt;ref name=Johnsen&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1543609 | title=Hidden in Plain Sight: The Ecology and Physiology of Organismal Transparency | author=Johnsen, Sönke | journal=[[Biological Bulletin]] |date=December 2001 | volume=201 | issue=3 | pages=301–318 | doi=10.2307/1543609 | pmid=11751243}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflection, and counterillumination.&lt;ref name=McFall&gt;{{cite journal | title=Crypsis in the Pelagic Environment | author=McFall-Ngai, Margaret J | journal=[[American Zoologist]] | year=1990 | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=175–188 | doi=10.1093/icb/30.1.175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}} Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.&lt;ref name=McFall/&gt; Most animals of the open sea use at least one of these methods to camouflage themselves.&lt;ref name=McFall/&gt; Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.

===Transparency===
[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

Transparency is common, even dominant, in animals of the open sea, especially those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in [[plankton]] of many species, as well as larger animals such as [[jellyfish]], [[salps]] (floating [[tunicates]]), and [[comb jellies]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}}
Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], giving them almost perfect camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick mesogloea is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 per cent transparent. A transparency of 50 per cent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 per cent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, transparency is most effective in deeper waters.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}

[[File:2 - Aphia minuta 03-11-06 DSCF4095.jpg|thumb|The [[transparent goby]]]]

Some tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. Familiar examples of transparent body parts are the lens and [[cornea]] of the vertebrate [[eye]]. The lens is made of the protein [[crystallin]]; the [[cornea]] is made of the protein [[collagen]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function. The [[camera]]-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) of the transparent [[siphonophore]] ''[[Agalma okenii]]'' resemble small [[copepod]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of [[larva]]e, including [[coelenterates]], siphonophores, salps, [[gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], [[polychaete]] worms, many shrimplike [[crustaceans]], and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} Adult comb jellies and jellyfish are mainly transparent, like their watery background.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} The small [[Amazon river]] fish ''[[Microphilypnus amazonicus]]'' and the shrimps it associates with, ''[[Pseudopalaemon gouldingi]]'', are so transparent as to be "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-62252006000200008&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=The almost invisible league: crypsis and association between minute fishes and shrimps as a possible defence against visually hunting predators |author1=Carvalho, Lucélia Nobre |author2=Zuanon, Jansen |author3=Sazima, Ivan | journal=[[Neotropical Ichthyology]] |date=April–June 2006 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1590/S1679-62252006000200008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection===
[[File:Herringadultkils2.jpg|thumb|left|The adult herring,''[[Clupea harengus]]'', is a typical silvered fish of medium depths.]]
[[File:Herring Silvering.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|The herring's reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side.]]

Many fish are covered with highly reflective scales, giving the appearance of [[silver]]ed [[mirror]] glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those that live in the top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as [[sardine]] and [[herring]] are camouflaged by silvering.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

The [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}} Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

===Counter-illumination===
[[File:Squid Counterillumination.png|thumb|Principle of squid [[counter-illumination]]]]
{{main article|Counter-illumination}}
Counter-illumination through [[bioluminescence]] on the underside (ventral region) of the body is found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of [[active camouflage]]. It is notably used by some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Abralia veranyi|midwater squid]], ''Abralia veranyi''. These have light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=[[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] | accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 | title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions | author=Young, Richard Edward | journal=[[Bulletin of Marine Science]] |date=October 1983 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=829–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to detect prey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Long-wave sensitivity in deep-sea stomiid dragonfish with far-red bioluminescence: evidence for a dietary origin of the chlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer of Malacosteus niger |author1=Douglas, RH |author2=Mullineaux, CW |author3=Partridge, JC | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |date=September 2000 | volume=355 | issue=1401 | pages=1269–1272 | pmc=1692851 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0681 | pmid=11079412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for signalling.

===Countershading===
[[File:Adelie Penguin2.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguin]]s, ''Pygoscelis adeliae'', are white below and dark above.]]
{{main article|Countershading}}

Top/bottom countershading is common in fish including [[shark]]s, [[marlin]], and [[mackerel]], and animals in other groups such as dolphins, turtles and penguins. These animals have dark upper sides to match the ocean depths, and light undersides to avoid appearing dark against the bright sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rowland | first=Hannah M.  | jstor=40485817 | title=Abbott Thayer to the present day: what have we learned about the function of countershading?| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | year=2009 | volume=364 | pages=519–527 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0261 | pmid=19000972 | pmc=2674085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ruxton, Graeme D |author2=Speed, Michael P |author3=Kelly, David J | title=What, if anything, is the adaptive function of countershading?|journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | year=2004 | volume=68 | pages=445–451 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.009| url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/COUNTERSHADINGCLASS10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimesis===
&lt;!--[[File:Leaf Scorpionfish in Kona.jpg|thumb|Leaf scorpionfish mimics vegetation swaying in a current.]]--&gt;
[[File:Juvenile rockmover in Kona.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile rockmover, ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', mimics algae]]
{{main article|Mimicry}}

Mimesis is practised by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]], ''Phycodurus eques'', and the [[Taenianotus triacanthus|leaf scorpionfish]], ''Taenianotus triacanthus'', which resemble parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=341–342}}&lt;ref name="Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/photos/undersea-camouflage/#camouflage07-leaf-scorpionfish_13513_600x450.jpg |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://www.daveharasti.com/articles/speciesspotlight/leafscorpionfish.htm |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fish species ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of [[sea weed]]. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves in a way that perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving back and forth in the surge, as if it was inanimate.&lt;ref name="Rockmover Wrasse"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dragon Wrasse: The Good, The Bad, and The Beautiful |url=http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/april-2011/dragon-wrasse.aspx |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-decoration===
[[File:Sea urchin decorated with shells.jpg|thumb|Self-decorated [[sea urchin]]]]

Self-decoration is employed by animals in different groups, including [[decorator crab]]s, which attach materials from their environment, as well as living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus constans]]'', has the hydroid ''[[Hydractinia sodalis]]'' growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus cuanensis]]'', has the [[aposematic]] orange sponge ''[[Suberites domuncula]]'' which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=361–362}}

Similarly, [[sea urchin]]s use their tube feet to pick up debris from the bottom and attach it to their upper surfaces. They use shells, rocks, algae and sometimes [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="Echinoderms"&gt;{{cite web | title=Echinoderms | url=http://www.starfish.ch/reef/echinoderms.html | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Four-Eye Butterflyfish.jpg|thumb|Four-Eye Butterflyfish, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', showing its concealed eye and false eyespot near the tail]]

Many fish have eyespots near their tails, a form of [[automimicry]], to distract attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'' has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving the impression that the head is at the tail end of the body.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=372–374}}

===Disruption of outlines===
{{main article|Disruptive coloration}}

Fish such as ''[[Dascyllus aruanus]]'' have bold disruptive patterns on their sides, breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like ''[[Heniochus macrolepidotus]]'' have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting far from the body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=73}}

Some fish which mimic seaweeds such as the [[frogfish]]es ''[[Antennarius marmoratus]]'' and ''[[Pterophryne tumida]]'' have elaborate projections and spines which are combined with complex disruptive coloration. These have the effect of destroying the signature "fish" outline of these animals, as well as helping them to appear as pieces of algae.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=341}}

===Adaptive coloration===
[[File:Octopus cyaneain Kona.jpg|thumb|The big blue octopus hunts by day, changing its colours and pattern to be cryptic or for signalling]]
{{further information|Active camouflage}}

A variety of marine animals possess [[active camouflage]] through their ability to change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling.&lt;ref name="Cephalopod dynamic camouflage"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanlon, Roger |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=11 |title=Cephalopod dynamic camouflage |url=http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011091531/http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-10-11 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[big blue octopus]], ''Octopus cyanea'', hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.&lt;ref name="DayOctopus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Day Octopuses, Octopus cyanea|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=553|publisher=MarineBio|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg |thumb |left |Four frames of a [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart]]

Like all flounders, [[Peacock flounder]]s, ''Bothus mancus'', have excellent adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration to avoid being detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and [[hormone]]s. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.&lt;ref name="Camouflage under water"&gt;{{cite web | title=Camouflage under water | url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/indepth/camouflage.htm | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The fisherman's ocean"&gt;{{cite book | title=The fisherman's ocean |author = Ross, David A | page=136 |year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hz9AWzpJydoC&amp;pg=PA136 |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania |isbn=9780811727716 |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]] | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peacock Flounder"&gt;{{cite web |title=Peacock Flounder |url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/discover/species-profiles/bothus-lunatus |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Universal manhood suffrage''' is a form of [[voting rights]] in which all [[adult]] males within a political system are allowed to vote, regardless of income, property, religion, race, or any other qualification. It is sometimes summarized by the slogan, "one man, one vote."
==History==
[[File:Suffrage universel 1848.jpg|thumb|300px|The establishment of universal male suffrage in France in 1848 was an important milestone in the history of democracy.]]
{{details|topic=dates by when countries granted universal manhood suffrage|Universal suffrage#Dates by country}}

In 1789, [[Revolutionary France]] adopted the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and, although short-lived, the [[National Convention]] was elected by all men in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |title=The French Revolution II |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213104/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revoked by the [[French Directory|Directory]] in 1795. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the [[French Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1848.asp|title=1848 " Désormais le bulletin de vote doit remplacer le fusil "|author=French National Assembly|accessdate=2009-09-26|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]] from the 1820s to 1850s led to a close approximation of universal manhood suffrage among whites being adopted in all states by 1856.&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L. Engerman, University of Rochester and NBER|author2=Kenneth L. Sokoloff, University of California, Los Angeles and NBER|title=The Evolution of Suffrage Institutions in the New World|date=February 2005|url=http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Economic-History/sokoloff-050406.pdf|pages=16, 35-36|quote=By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer white male citizens gained representation; however, tax-paying requirements remained in five states until 1860 and in two states until the 20th century.&lt;ref name=NBER2005/&gt; The expansion of suffrage was largely peaceful, excepting the Rhode Island [[Dorr Rebellion]]. Most African-American males remained excluded; though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1870, upheld their voting rights, they were denied the right to vote in many places for another century until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] through [[United States Congress|Congress]].

As women also began to win the right to vote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the goal of universal manhood suffrage was replaced by [[universal suffrage]].

The magazine set out to recognize the millions of people who anonymously contribute [[user-generated content]] to [[wikis]] and other websites such as [[Wikipedia]], [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Web 2.0|the multitudes of other websites featuring user contribution]].&lt;ref name="moty2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lev Grossman|title=Time's Person of the Year: You| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html|work=Time|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

While the status had been given before to inanimate objects, with the [[personal computer]] being the "Machine of the Year" for 1982,&lt;ref name=machine/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; as well as collections of people or an abstract representative of a movement, the choice of "You" attracted criticism from commentators in publications such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' for being too much of a [[pop culture]] [[gimmick]].&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; A ''[[New York Daily News]]'' article named the 2006 award as one of the ten most controversial "Person of the Year" moments in the history of ''Time''.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/time-magazine-10-controversial-people-year-article-1.2040428 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Time Magazine's 10 most controversial People of the Year | date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[news-magazine]] experienced generally successful sales.

==Background==
While most earlier choices for "Person of the Year" have been historically important individuals, many of them [[:wikt:infamous|infamous]] rather than internationally popular ([[Adolf Hitler]] was 1938's "Man of the Year", and [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] won in 1979),&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;&lt;ref name=photo/&gt; a few were inanimate. The [[personal computer]] was the "Machine of the Year" for 1982,&lt;ref name=machine&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19830103,00.html | work=Time | title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Computer, Machine of the Year - Jan. 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "[[Earth|Endangered Earth]]" was the "Planet of the Year" for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19890102,00.html | work=Time | title=TIME Magazine Cover: Endangered Earth, Planet of the Year - Jan. 2, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Collections of people as well as a symbolic representative of multiple individuals had also won the award before; for example, "U.S. Scientists" were named "Men of the Year" in 1960.&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019752,00.html|publisher=''Time''|title=Person of the Year: A Photo History|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar media awards had already recognized the growing significance of online community and user-generated content: "You!" were ranked first in ''[[Business 2.0]]''{{'s}} list of "50&amp;nbsp;people who matter now" in July 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/peoplewhomatter/ |title=50 people who matter now |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[ABC News]] had listed [[blog]]gers as "People of the Year" for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=372266&amp;page=1 |title=People of the Year: Bloggers |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
In accordance with ''Time''{{'s}} annual  process, different [[news bureau|bureaus]] suggested different candidates.&lt;ref name="Koepp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/dec2006/19/behind_time_maga |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406010101/http://www.newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/dec2006/19/behind_time_maga|title=Behind Time Magazine's Choice for Person of the Year -- An Interview with Stephen Koepp |last=Cohn |first=David |date=December 19, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You", or "the [[YouTube]] guys", was floated in November as a possible winner.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/nov2006/15/time_magazine_ha Time Magazine Has an Award For "You"] by David Cohn on November 15, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; Readers' opinions were canvassed online.&lt;ref name="Koepp"/&gt; The final decision was made by [[managing editor]] [[Richard Stengel]].

The decision was announced in ''Time''{{'s}} December 13, 2006 issue.&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt;  The cover of the magazine featured an [[iMac]] computer monitor with a [[reflection (physics)|reflective]] [[BoPET|mylar]] pane appearing as the window of a [[YouTube]]-like video player, intended to reflect as online content the visage of whoever picks up the magazine.&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt;
The time remaining indicator in the image indicates a total duration of "20:06," a visual pun connecting this ubiquitous bit of interface design to the year in which it gained ascendancy in ''Time''{{'s}} view. Stories on the new user-driven media dynamic were provided by [[NBC]] editor [[Brian Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Time'' magazine editors [[Lev Grossman]]&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt; and [[Richard Stengel]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570743,00.html Now It's Your Turn], Richard Stengel, Dec. 16, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;  As Grossman describes, "It's about the many wrestling power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes."

==Criticism==
The choice was criticized for being a short-sighted gimmick which ignored the existence of many prominent individuals that had shaped the events of the past year. Pundit [[Paul Kedrosky]] called it an "incredible cop-out", and he also speculated that the selection marked "some sort of near-term market top for user-generated content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Kedrosky | title=I Call "Market Top" on "You" | url=http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | work=Infectious Greed | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=2008-02-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207013442/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | archive-date=7 February 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator Kevin Friedl noted that the award and cover design recalled the [[mirror]] viewed by the protagonist, the Dude, of ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', via which the viewer's reflection was framed as ''Time''{{'s}} "Man of the Year".&lt;ref name="friedl"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, journalist David A. Graham wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that he thought ''Time'' had shown "a pattern of lackluster choices" and the overall promotional nature of the process shouldn't be treated as news, rather simply viewed as [[marketing]]. He remarked, "Is anyone out there ''not'' sick of people ironically listing 'Time Person of the Year, 2006' in Twitter bios, a reference to the gimmicky selection of 'You' that year?"&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/everyone-should-ignore-times-person-of-the-year/266462/ |title=Everyone Should Ignore Time's Person of the Year |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the decision raised some criticism as it was described as ideological and even hypocritically political. Some weeks before the announcement, ''Time'' decided to ask the users in a poll, "Who Should Be Person of the Year?"  After several weeks, the poll winner by a wide margin was [[Hugo Chávez]], the leader of [[Venezuela]], with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], came in second. ''Time'' decided to ignore those results and did not mention them in the announcement of their "Person of the Year". Its critics underlined that ''Time'' ignores its [[digital democracy]] among its readers. ''Time'' supporters argue that an online poll is not representative as it has no scientific value. The [[Universal Resource Locator|hyperlink]] to the online poll results has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chavez wins "Person of the Year" poll ... Time magazine ignores result | url=http://www.handsoffvenezuela.org/time-hugo-chavez-award.htm | work=Hands Off Venezuela | date=18 December 2006 | accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 ''[[New York Daily News]]'' article, which named the "You" naming as one of the ten most controversial "Person of the Year" moments in the history of ''Time'', also remarked that "2006 had its fair share of newsmakers" while highlighting both "Venezuela President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad".&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;
