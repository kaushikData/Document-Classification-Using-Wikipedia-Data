'''Aminoallyl nucleotide''' is a nucleotide with a modified base containing an [[allylamine]]. They are used in post-labeling of [[nucleic acid]]s by [[fluorescence]] detection in [[microarray]]. They are reactive with [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide]] ester group which helps attach a [[Fluorophore|fluorescent dye]] to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-amino[[allyl]])-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the [[pyrimidine]] ring of [[uracil]] or [[cytosine]]. The primary [[amine]] group in the aminoallyl moiety is [[aliphatic]] and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings ([[aromatic]]) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated with or without the lowercase "d" indicating [[deoxyribose]] if included or [[ribose]] if not. Finally the [[nitrogenous base]] and number of [[phosphates]] are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine [[triphosphate]]).

==History==
[[File:Heatmap using aminoallyl nucleotide.png|thumb|Hierarchically clustered heat map using aa-dUTPs&lt;ref name=microarraypic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Daniel J.|author2=Riordan, Daniel P. |author3=Gerber, André P. |author4=Herschlag, Daniel |author5= Brown, Patrick O. |title=Diverse RNA-Binding Proteins Interact with Functionally Related Sets of RNAs, Suggesting an Extensive Regulatory System|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e255|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060255|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060255|accessdate=29 April 2014 |pmid=18959479 |pmc=2573929}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The goal of combining fluorescence and nucleic acids has been to provide a non-[[Isotopic labeling|isotopic]] tag that is detectable to study [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. This type of labeling allows scientists to study DNA or RNA in their structure, function, or formation with other nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kricka|first=LJ|author2=Fortina, P|title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids.|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=Apr 2009|volume=55|issue=4|pages=670–83|pmid=19233914|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.116152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first base modification for fluorescent labeling occurred in 1971 with a [[4-thiouridine]] and [[4-thiouracil]].&lt;ref name=Thio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Secrist III|first=John A.|author2=Jorge R.

As instrumentation and technologies become more advanced in the field of [[DNA microarray]], better reagents and techniques will be needed to further scientific studies. Fluorescent labeling with [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|Cy3]] was shown to be more insufficient and skew results; the method of aminoallyl nucleotide incorporation was opted instead. Using aminoallyl nucleotides as indirect fluorescent labeling seemed to nullify the sensitivity issues seen in [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|cyanine-labeling]].&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Robert|title=RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization|page=597|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2XubAE2BEC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;lpg=PA597&amp;dq=aminoallyl+nucleotides+beginning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7KfNkMaKj&amp;sig=TfBMiZdE63UrHriKuBJ-r4q0OgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9CFFU5zbO6amygHcqIFA&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aminoallyl%20nucleotides%20beginning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image above, on the left is a modified nucleoside with an [[iodine]] (the iodine is added via [[electrophilic halogenation]]) in the fifth carbon in the pyrimidine ring. Its formation can be associated with a reaction with an allylamine and various reagents via heck coupling are able to remove the [[halogen]] group from the base and add the allylamine to become the aminoallyl nucleoside shown on the right.&lt;ref name=Synthesis /&gt; The product on the right is then used to in [[molecular biology]] in RNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dUTP product information" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog" /&gt;

== Reaction ==
The primary amine on the aminoallyl nucleotide reacts with amino-reactive dyes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeRisi|first=Joseph|title=Amino-allyl Dye Coupling Protocol|url=http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/data/pdfs/amino-allyl-protocol.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[cyanine]] and patented dyes&lt;ref name=hiyte&gt;{{cite web|last=AnaSpec, Inc|title=Hiyte Fluor Brochure|url=http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142441/http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Tech - multi"&gt;{{cite web|last=life technologies|title=Aminoallyl dUTP|url=http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook/nucleic-acid-detection-and-genomics-technology/labeling-oligonucleotides-and-nucleic-acids.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contain a reactive leaving group, such as a succinimidyl ester ([[N-Hydroxysuccinimide|NHS]]).The amine groups directly attached to the ring of the base are not affected.

[[File:Tagging modified uridine.jpg|Tagging modified uridine]]

==Uses==
Aminoallyl NTPs are used for indirect DNA labeling in [[PCR]], [[nick translation]], [[primer extension]]s and [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] synthesis.&lt;ref name="Trilink biotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=DNA labeling|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cart/scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs where they do not have the capacity to handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=Modified Nucleotides|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/work/ntps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA [[polymerase]], 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.
aa-NTPs incorporated into DNA/RNA in combination with a secondary dye coupling reagents can probe for an array analysis.&lt;ref name="dUTP product information"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biosystems|first=Applied|title=Modified Nucleotide 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP|url=http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/sp_8436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cDNA relies on aminoallyl labeling for detection purposes. Although direct labeling of dNTP is the quickest and cheapest method of fluorescent labeling, it is disadvantageous as the sequence allows for only one modified nucleotide for use. Another disadvantage of direct labeling is the bulky nucleotides, however this can be overcome by indirect labeling using aminoallyl modified nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibriel|first=Abdullah|title=Options available for labeling nucleic acid samples in DNA micro-array-based detection methods|journal=BRIEFINGS IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS|date=17 April 2012|volume=II|issue=4|pages=311–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy way to check for labeling success is the color;Good labeling will result in visible blue (Cy5) or red (Cy3) color in the final material.&lt;ref name="A laboratory Manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Molecular Cloning-A Laboratory Manual|url=http://www.molecularcloning.com/index.php?prt=112|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Process of preparing amino allyl-labelled cDNA.jpg|thumb|Process of preparing amino-allyl labeled cDNA]]

Another process which uses aminoallyl labeling is [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]] ( Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), a highly sensitive technique for amplifying RNA. In this specific case, the aaUTP modified RNAs were tagged with fluorescent market Cy3. NASBA combined with aminoallyl-UTP labeling is very useful for many different areas of microbial diagnostics including environmental monitoring, bio threat detection, industrial process monitoring and clinical microbiology.&lt;ref name=NASBA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=Scheler,|author2=Barry Glynn|title=Fluorescent labeling of NASBA amplified tmRNA molecules for microarray applications|journal=BMC Biotechnology|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA microarray is another method which utilizes specifically AA-NTP's making DNA microarray testing quicker and cheaply.&lt;ref name=Microarray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang|first=CC|author2=Kozhich, OA|author3=Chen, M|author4=Inman, JM|author5=Phan, QN|author6=Chen, Y|author7= Brownstein, MJ|title=Amine-modified random primers to label probes for DNA microarrays.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 2002|volume=20|issue=7|pages=738–42|pmid=12089562|doi=10.1038/nb0702-738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-synthesis labeling avoids the problems found in direct enzymatic incorporation of Cy-labeled dNTPs by generating probes with equal labeling effectiveness. With indirect labeling, amine-modified NTPs are incorporated during [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]], RNA amplification, or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. Amino allyl-NTPs are incorporated with similar efficiency as unmodified NTPs during polymerization.&lt;ref name="cRNA Better"&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hoen|first=PA|last2=de Kort |first2=F |last3=van Ommen |first3=GJ |last4=den Dunnen |first4=JT|title=Fluorescent labelling of cRNA for microarray applications.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Mar 1, 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=e20|pmid=12595569|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/nar/gng020|pmc=149842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaposi-Novak|first=P|author2=Lee, JS|author3= Mikaelyan, A|author4= Patel, V|author5= Thorgeirsson, SS|title=Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA targets from linear RNA amplification.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Oct 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=580, 582–6, 588|pmid=15517970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with labeling:
The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is reactive with dyes such as the cyanine series, or other patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with [[buffering agents]] which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer can be used to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name="concerns with labeling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soundy|first=P|first2=C. |last2=Wheeler |first3=H. |last3=Latham |title=Preparing highly fluorescent, evenly labelled probes for microarray hybridization using the amino allyl method with CyScribe Post-Labelling Kit|journal=Life Science News|volume=9|pages=17–19|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anegundi''' previously called  Kishkindha is a village in the [[Gangavathi|Gangavathi taluk]], [[Koppal district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]] , &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/22/stories/2006032201370200.htm The Hindu - Anegundi bracing itself to charm tourists]&lt;/ref&gt; It is older than [[Hampi]] situated on the northern bank of [[Tungabhadra River]], Huchappayana matha temple (with black-stone pillars and dance sculptures), [[Pampa Sarovar]], Aramane (a ruined palace), Ranganatha temple, Kamal Mahal, and [[Nava Brindavana]] are the major attractions Nimvapuram, a nearby village, has a mount of ash believed to be the cremated remains of monkey king Vaali.
Anegundi is best visited along with [[Hampi]], it is part of the '''[[world Heritage Site]], [[Hampi]]''', being developed into a world class tourism spot by engaging the locals to sensitise them to their cultural wealth and provide them a means of livelihood. Existing tanks in the village have been redesigned to store clean drinking water and proper drainage facilities developed to keep the surroundings clean and hygienic. The ''Kishkinda Trust'' is working on tourism development in Anegundi.

==Mythology==

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Vali and Sugriva Fighting Folio from the Dispersed 'Shangri Ramayana'.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brooklyn Museum - ''Vali and Sugriva Fighting Folio'' from the Dispersed ''Shangri Ramayana'']]
Anegundi, believed to be the ''monkey kingdom'' of [[Kishkindha]] (''Kishkinta'' means in local language ''a forest where the monkeys lived'') in the epic of [[Ramayana]], is at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from the historical site of Hampi. Anjanadri hill, the birthplace of monkey-god [[Hanuman]], and the mountain Rishimuka are the other places near Anegundi associated with Ramayana. It is said to have one of the oldest plateaus on the planet, estimated to be 3,000 million years old. So, only local story-tellers refer to Anegundi as the maternal home of Bhoodevi (Mother Earth).

The village, located on the northern side bank of River Tungabhadra, was said to be the legendary Kishkindha, a kingdom of the monkey Prince Sugriva and the cradle place of the historic Krishnadevaraya dynasty of the glorious Vijayanagar empire and falls in the core zone of Hampi.

==History==
{{main article|Vijayanagara Empire| Battle of Talikota}}
[[File:Pampa Sarover.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Pampa Sarovar]] at Anegundi]]

===Pre-historic===
Neolithic history is represented in this region by ''Mourya Mane'', a several-thousand-year-old ''Stone Age Colony''. Several Neolithic dwellings still bear paintings that are clear and intact even to this day at 'Onke Kindi'. This is the rare human settlement where we will find traces of Microlithic, Megalithic and Neolithic age of human life at one same spot. Anegundi area is older than the Vijayanagar empire, and as is old as the planet. As per geologists the Anegundi area is about four billion years old. Till date, this village is a living heritage site in its true sense. The nearest Pre-historic sites are [[Hirebenkal|HireBenekal]], Chikkarampur, Mallapur, Venkatapur and Anjanahalli.
''Pre-historic rock shelters and paintings'' are found in [[Tungabhadra river]] valley.

====Rock art====
At Anegundi there is prehistoric settlement called ''Onake Kindi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first capital of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and capital of several other dynasties. In 1334, Deva Raya the Chief Minister of Anegundi became ruler of Anegundi. When [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] invaded [[Warangal]], ''Harihara and Bukka'' escaped and came to Anegundi, later founded the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] at [[Hampi]]. The Tallarighatta gate(Talwar Ghatta) (erstwhile toll gate) is the entrance to Anegundi from Hampi side, the collapsed modern day bridge under construction between Hampi and Anegundi across the [[Tungabhadra river]]. Crossing the river in a coracle (boat) which is circular basket shaped made of cane, bamboo and wrapped in a plastic sheet. "Coracle was used to ferry people in the Vijayanagar time also", it is mentioned by ''Dominoes Paes'' the Portuguese traveller in the 16th century, there is mention of carrying "about twenty persons and horses and oxen to cross the river."

During 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Anegundi was ruled by Bijapur Sultans, Moghuls, Marathas and Tipu Sultan. According to ''1824 treaty with the British and Hyderabad Nizam'', the king of Vijayanagar who was ruled from Hampi lost his kingdom, provided a monthly pension of Rs 300, forced to leave Hampi and make Anegundi as official residence, ''Rani Lalkumari Bai'' last descendant who received monthly pension.

===Rural tourism scheme===
Realising that to appreciate and be involved in conserving ancient lineage and historic surroundings, the villagers of Anegundi must be self-sufficient with sustainable economic support, the Union government under its ''rural tourism'' scheme, formed a trust named Kishkindha to build capacity in the villagers to maintain business incubators.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

The main activities taken up engaging the locals, were improving the village surroundings through landscaping, developing parks and gardens, putting up fences and constructing compound walls, laying roads within the panchayat limits, fixing street lights, managing solid waste and sewerage, procuring equipment required for water sports and adventure sports, introducing eco-friendly modes of transport for moving within the tourism zone and setting up reception centres.

To meet contemporary needs of tourists, traditional houses in the village were converted into guest houses without disturbing their ancient looks. The villagers are earning a handsome amount by renting out these houses to the tourists.

They have also set up a craft shop offering a range of items made locally using banana fibre, an Internet cafe to help visitors keep in touch with the outer world and a restaurant to treat their taste buds. Local art forms have also been revived to entertain the visitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5233">[[File:Prince_Ankhaf_at_MFAB.jpg|thumb|Bust of Prince [[Ankhhaf]], at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]The [[polychromy|painted]] [[limestone]] '''[[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Ankhhaf]]''' is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian sculpture dating from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. It is considered the work "of a master" of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian art]], and can be seen at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its catalog number is Museum Expedition 27.442.   
==Description==
It depicts a mature man and was therefore likely made during the reign of [[Khafre]] (circa 2520-2494 BC).  One of the earliest - and even after four and a half thousand years, still among the finest - true sculptured portraits, it is an almost unprecedented depiction of the unidealised features of an actual man.  Sculptures portraying true likenesses of people (rather than highly stylized portrayals) are rare in Ancient Egyptian art, both before and after the creation of Ankhhaf's bust.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plaster]] covers a limestone core, which has been painted red, a colour commonly given to males in both sculpture and in [[relief]]s (figures of women were typically painted yellow). The face is stern, with a slightly uneven mouth which makes him appear as though he is smirking from one side, and aloof and impersonal from the other. There is a slight droop to the eyelids, whose eyes were once painted white with brown pupils. The figure once had a beard and ears, which were broken away in antiquity along with part of the figure's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site of discovery==
The bust was discovered in his tomb, installed within a small chapel oriented to the east and facing the chapel's doorway. His arms may have been sculpted on the small [[pedestal]] on which it sat, though these have been lost. It was evident that it had once been the focus of a funerary cult, as the bust had crushed several small pottery vessels of the type used for offerings when it fell in antiquity from its pedestal.&lt;ref&gt;Roehrig, Catherine H. "The Reserve Heads of the Old Kingdom: A Theory", &lt;cite&gt;Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids&lt;/cite&gt;. Yale University Press. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1999. p.234 {{ISBN|0-87099-907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Method of discovery==
The bust was discovered by a museum expedition funded jointly by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and [[Harvard University]], and under the contract of the time, such a fine piece would normally have found a home at the [[Cairo Museum]]. However, this piece was awarded as thanks for the extensive work done by this expedition and the discovery of the intact royal tomb of Queen [[Hetepheres I|Hetepheres]], who was Ankhhaf's aunt, a sister of his father. More recently, [[Zahi Hawass]], the chief of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, has asked that this piece be [[art repatriation|repatriated]] to Egypt, as one of five key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also includes the iconic bust of [[Nefertiti]] in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]], a statue of the Great Pyramid architect [[Hemon|Hemiunu]] in the [[Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum]] in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]], and the [[Dendera Temple complex#Dendera zodiac|Dendara Temple Zodiac]] in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquities wish list" Al-ahram Weekly Online 14 - 20 July 2005 {{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916194918/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |archivedate=2010-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues==
There are scholars and theologians who consider only the original autographs of Scripture as infallible and as final authority, while others hold more to what is called the "Ecclesiastical Text" view, that [[Bible Canon|Scripture canon]] is also authoritative in various renderings in later copies or [[Bible manuscript#Textual criticism|manuscript traditions]], or established "apo-grapha" (meaning "copied-writings"), and not just the [[Biblical manuscript|original autographs]] alone. The reason being that the "original autographs" no longer actually exist, in tangible extant form, so later verified copies of copies, or "apographa", are the only real tangible or present "canon" that we have, and providentially preserved for current knowledge.  And that the "apographa" or "Ecclesiastical Text" is all that is really available and should be mainly considered realistically, from established and accepted confessions, church traditions, revivals, productivity, understandings, and interpretations, and should be all that is accepted reasonably, efficiently, or sufficiently, for study or edification.&lt;ref&gt; Dr. Jeffrey Khoo - [http://www.deanburgonsociety.org/Preservation/sola.htm SOLA AUTOGRAPHA OR SOLA APOGRAPHA?

Other theologians and scholars hold to what's called the "Critical Text" position,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html  Question: "What is the Critical Text?"] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; such as put forth by [[Westcott and Hort]], that seeks to find out and put forth what the original Apostles and Prophets actually wrote, regardless of later tradition or confessional history, or "majority text" views.&lt;ref name="gotquestions critical text"&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/verbal-plenary-preservation.html What is Verbal Plenary Preservation?] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Westcott and Hort's work, according to Bible scholar and translator [[Bruce M.

'''''Aramis, or the Love of Technology''''', was written by French [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]]. ''Aramis'' was originally published in French in 1993; the English translation by Catherine Porter, copyrighted in 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04323-7}}, is now in its fourth edition (2002). Latour describes his text as "scientifiction," which he describes as "a hybrid genre... for a hybrid task" (p. ix). The genre includes voices of a young engineer discussing his "sociotechnological initiation," his professor's commentary which introduces [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), field documents - including real-life interviews, and the voice of Aramis—a failed technology (&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (1996). Aramis, or the Love of Technology. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p. x).

The book is a quasi-mystery, which attempts to discover who killed [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)]]. Aramis was supposed to be implemented as a [[Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) system in Paris. Simultaneously, while investigating Aramis's demise, Latour delineates the tenets of Actor-network theory. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation.

'''Audio forensics''' is the field of [[forensic science]] relating to the acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of [[sound recording]]s that may ultimately be presented as admissible evidence in a court of law or some other official venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan10/articles/forensics.htm|title=An Introduction To Forensic Audio|author=Phil Manchester|date=January 2010|publisher=Sound on Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maherieee2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Audio forensic examination: authenticity, enhancement, and interpretation|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine|volume=26|pages=84–94|date=March 2009|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4806208|doi=10.1109/msp.2008.931080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gelfandwired2007&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |title=Audio Forensics Experts Reveal (Some) Secrets |date=10 October 2007 |author=Alexander Gelfand |publisher=Wired Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408153708/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio forensic evidence may come from a criminal investigation by law enforcement or as part of an official inquiry into an accident, fraud, accusation of slander, or some other civil incident.&lt;ref name=maherasa2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Lending an ear in the courtroom:  forensic acoustics|journal=Acoustics Today|volume=11|pages=22–29|date=Summer 2015|url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lending-an-Ear-in-the-Courtroom-Forensic-Acoustics-Forensic-acoustics-deals-with-acquisition-analysis-and-evaluation-of-audio-recordings-to-be-used-as-evidence-in-an-official-legal-inquiry..pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary aspects of audio forensics are establishing the ''authenticity'' of audio evidence, performing [[Forensic audio enhancement|''enhancement'' of audio recordings]] to improve speech intelligibility and the audibility of low-level sounds, and ''interpreting and documenting'' sonic evidence, such as identifying talkers, transcribing dialog, and reconstructing crime or accident scenes and timelines.&lt;ref name=maherieee2009/&gt;

Modern audio forensics makes extensive use of [[digital signal processing]], with the former use of analog filters now being obsolete. Techniques such as [[adaptive filtering]] and [[discrete Fourier transform]]s are used extensively.&lt;ref name="gelfandwired2007" /&gt;

Recent advances in audio forensics techniques include [[voice biometrics]] and [[electrical network frequency analysis]].

'''Black drink''' is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Traditional ceremonial people of the [[Yuchi people|Yuchi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|page=59|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caddo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=70–71 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chickasaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=61–62 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] and some other [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]] use the black drink in purification ceremonies.  It was occasionally known as ''white drink'' because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=2, 131 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of ''[[Ilex vomitoria]]'' (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the [[Atlantic]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]s. Black drink also usually contains [[emetic]] herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gibbons |first= E|date=  1964|title= Stalking the Blue-eyed Scallop|url= |location= |publisher=  David McKay Company, Inc |page= |isbn=  0-911469-05-2|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Makingblackdrink.png|thumb|''Preparing Black Drink'', engraving by [[Joseph-François Lafitau]], 1723]]
[[File:Ilex vomitoria fws.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Yaupon holly]]

According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason [[coffee]] beans are roasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merck Index |edition=12th |editor=Susan Budavari |publisher=Merck &amp; Co., Inc. |place=Whitehouse Station, NJ |year=1996 |page=1674}}&lt;/ref&gt; After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | page = 226 | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent &lt;ref&gt;Owen, Daiel, 2006. Coffee and Cafeine FAQ: How much caffeine there is in X coffee? Access at http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/23&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''Ilex vomitoria'' leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Adam, 2002.

(Yaupon holly): A model of intraspecific alkaloid variation."] ''Society for Economic Botany'' Julia F. Morton Award.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.

While the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous [[Liatris aspera|button snakeroot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | pages = 4, 59, 62, 138, 140–141, | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Mac|title=Landscaping in Florida|date=1990|publisher=Pineapple Press|isbn=978-1561640577|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOcueAUoOuwC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=yaupon%20toxic&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q=yaupon%20toxic&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was [[theobromine]], an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Adam L. | last2 = Bennett | first2 = Bradley C. | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of Methylxanthine Content in Ilex cassine L. and Ilex vomitoria Ait.: Assessing Sources of the North American Stimulant Cassina | url = | journal = Economic Botany | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 275–285 | doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2005)059[0275:domcii]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological accounts==
[[File:Black Drink map HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the geographical extent of black drink use by [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]], prior to 19th century [[Indian Removal]] ]]
Archaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to [[Archaic period in the Americas|Late Archaic times]]. During the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell period]], the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell Interaction Sphere]].&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|title =Black Drink: A Native American Tea|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|year=1979|pages=83–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of shell cups can be used as a virtual marker for the advent of Hopewell Culture in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Griffin, James B.  |  title =Culture Periods in Eastern United States Archaeology| publisher = University of Chicago Press|year =1952 | page = 360|authorlink = James Bennett Griffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mississippian culture]] period, the presence of items associated with the black drink ceremony had spread over most of the south, with many hundreds of examples from [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]], [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]], [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and Hiwassee Island.

===Black drink at Cahokia===
[[File:Woodhenge motif black drink beaker HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ceramic beaker from Cahokia with [[Cahokia Woodhenge|woodhenge]] motif]]
Archaeologists working at [[Cahokia]], the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain [[theobromine]], caffeine and [[ursolic acid]] in the right proportions to have come from the ''Ilex vomitoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia L.|last2= Emerson|first2= Thomas E.|last3= Gu|first3= Jiyan|last4=Hurst |first4= W.

The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/12/0806Cahokia_ThomasEmerson.html|title=Researchers find evidence of ritual use of 'black drink' at Cahokia|date=2012-08-06|author= Diana Yates|publisher=[[University of Illinois]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-black-drink-cahokia-20120806,0,4734623.story?track=rss |author=Thomas H.

===Shell cups===
[[File:Spiro s.e.c.c. tattooed figure HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Engraved conch shell cup from [[Spiro Mounds]]]]
In historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, [[lightning whelk]], emperor helmet, and the [[Pleuroploca gigantea|horse conch]]. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual.  The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, [[earspool]]s, and necklace beads(all of which are motifs identified with the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player]]'' mythological figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 86–96 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as [[Wisconsin]] and as far west as [[Oklahoma]]. Several examples of cups from [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|S.E.C.C.]] imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings.&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK/&gt;{{Clear}}

===Archaeological evidence for use in pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest===
Pottery samples recovered from sites in modern [[Southwestern United States]] and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of [[Xanthine|methylxanthines]] associated with those produced by ''Ilex vomitoria''. The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with ''[[Theobroma cacao]]''. Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from ''Ilex vomitoria''. Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from [[Pueblo Bonito]], which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of ''Ilex vomitoria'' from the east. There are also some stands of ''Ilex vomitoria'' in [[Mesoamerica]], so the exact origins of the ''Ilex vomitoria'' used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia|last2= |first2= |date= 2015|title= Ritual drinks in the pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest|url= http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11436.full|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher= HighWire Press|volume= 112|issue= 37|pages= 11436–11442|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1511799112 |access-date=22 March 2016 |pmid=26372965 |pmc=4577151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
A number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. [[Muscogee Creeks]], [[Cherokee]]s, [[Choctaw]]s, [[Ais people|Ais]], [[Guale]], [[Chickasaw]]s, [[Chitimacha]], [[Timucua]] and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of ''Ilex vomitoria'' has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans.

===Ais===
In 1696, [[Jonathan Dickinson]] witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the [[Yaupon Holly]] among the [[Ais (tribe)|Ais]] of [[Florida]]. Dickinson later learned that the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] called the plant ''casseena''. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a [[gourd]] that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 45–46|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherokee===
[[Cherokee]] black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with [[emetics]], the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. ''Ilex vomitoria'' was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted.

===Muscogean peoples===
Among the [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] the black drink is called ''ássi''.  In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest-status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung ''Yahola''. Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men.&lt;ref name=HUDSONDRINK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|title =Black Drink: A Native American Tea|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|year=1979|pages=126–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual name ''Asi Yahola'' or ''Black Drink Singer'' is corrupted into [[English language|English]] as ''[[Osceola]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.npg.si.edu/col/native/osceola.htm | title =Native Americans | access-date =September 17, 2008 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081001173942/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/native/osceola.htm | archivedate =October 1, 2008 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timucua===
[[File:Black drink.jpg|thumb|right|300px|16th-century engraving by [[Jacques le Moyne]] of a [[Timucua]] ceremony involving the black drink]]
Among the [[Timucua]], a type of black drink was called ''cacina'' by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the ''cacina''. In 1678 a bedridden ''cacica'' (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume ''cacina'' in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=A History of the Timucua Indians and Missions|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1424-7|pages=2, 26, 90–91, 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cassina or yaupon tea==
After European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in [[Spanish Florida]] is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called ''cacina'' or ''té del indio''. The use of ''Ilex vomitoria'' by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a [[diuretic]]. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with ''[[Camellia sinensis]]''. In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in [[French Louisiana]] is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 6–7, 150–155|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use by on [[Knotts Island, North Carolina]]. During the [[Interwar period]] the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429071993/heres-the-buzz-on-americas-forgotten-native-tea-plant | title= Here's The Buzz On America's Forgotten Native 'Tea' Plant| author = Murray Carpenter | date = 4 August 2015 | newspaper = The Salt |  accessdate=  31 May 2018  |publisher= National Public Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bleep censor''' is the replacement of a [[profanity]] or [[classified information]] with a [[beep (sound)|beep sound]] (usually a {{Audio|1000Hz.ogg|1000 Hz tone}}) in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bleep |title=bleep – definition of bleep by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Bleep visual censor.gif|frame|right|Censor boxes, such as the one above, may be used along with the bleeps so that the audience would not [[lip reading|lip read]] the swearer's words. Above, the cartoon says "Oh-", followed by the censor.]]
Bleeping has been used for many years as a means of [[Censorship|censoring]] TV programs to remove content not deemed suitable for "family" or "daytime" viewing and personal information for privacy. The bleep censor is a software module, manually operated by a broadcast [[technician]]. A bleep is sometimes accompanied by a digital blur or box over the speaker's mouth in cases where the removed speech may still be easily understood by [[lip reading]].

On [[closed captioning|closed caption subtitling]], bleeped words are usually represented by the phrase "(''bleep'')", sometimes the phrase "[expletive]" or "[censored]", occasionally [[hyphen]]s (e.g. ''f—k'' ''f---''&lt;!-- sic --&gt;), and sometimes [[asterisk]]s (e.g. ****, f***, f**k, f*ck, f#@k or f#@%), remaining faithful to the audio track. Where open captions are used (generally in instances where the speaker is not easily understood), a blank is used where the word is bleeped. Occasionally, bleeping is not reflected in the captions, allowing the unedited dialogue to be seen. Sometimes, a "[[Censor bars|black bar]]" can be seen for closed caption bleep.

Bleeping is normally only used in unscripted programs – [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[radio documentary|radio features]], [[panel game]]s etc. – since scripted [[drama (genre)|drama]] and [[comedy]] are designed to suit the time of broadcast. In the case of comedies, most bleeping may be for humorous purposes, and other sound effects may be substituted for the bleep tone for comical effect, examples of which include a [[slide whistle]], an infant's cooing, dolphin noises, or a [[Coil spring|spring]] "boing".

Other uses of bleep censoring may include [[reality television]] and daytime [[talk show]]s, where identifying information such as ages, [[surname]]s, addresses/hometowns, phone numbers and attempts to advertise a personal business without advanced or appropriate notice will be silenced or bleeped to maintain the subject's privacy (such as seen for subjects arrested in episodes of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'').

When [[film]]s are edited for daytime TV, broadcasters usually prefer not to bleep swearing, but cut out the segment containing it, replace the speech with different words, or cover it with silence or a [[sound effect]]. In the first example, the film may (unintentionally) become nonsensical or confusing if the removed portion contains an element important to the plot. The bleep is sometimes used for privacy reasons, concealing [[confidential information]] such as names and addresses.
Bleep censors have seen a rare use in cinema film, for example during Johanna Mason's interview in ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'', or during Tony Stark's meeting with Senator Stern in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

Bleeping is commonly used in [[English language|English]]-language and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-language broadcasting, but is sometimes/rarely used in some other languages (such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]), displaying the varying attitudes between countries; some are more liberal towards swearing, less inclined to use strong profanities in front of a camera in the first place, or unwilling to censor. In the Philippines and Ecuador, undubbed movies on television have profanity muted instead of bleeped.

== Regulations ==
{{globalize|section|date=March 2013}}

=== Advertising in the United Kingdom ===
[[Television advertisements|Television]] and [[radio commercial]]s are not allowed to use bleeps to obscure swearing under [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC/CAP]] guidelines. However, this does not apply to program trailers or cinema advertisements and "f**k" is beeped out of two cinema advertisements for [[Johnny Vaughan]]'s [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] show and the cinema advertisement for the ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 5 DVD. An advert for [[esure]] insurance released in October 2007 uses the censor bleep, as well as a black star placed over the speaker's mouth, to conceal the name of a competitor company the speaker said she used to use. The Comedy Central advert for ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' had a version of "Kyle's Mom's a B**ch" where vulgarities were bleeped out, though the movie itself did not have censorship, and was given a 15 rating, despite a high amount of foul language.

A [[Barnardo's]] ad, released in summer 2007, has two versions: one where a boy can be heard saying "f**k off"&lt;!--This should be left uncensored, Wikipedia is not censored (see WP:NOTCENSORED)--&gt; four times which is restricted to "18" rated cinema screenings, and one where a censor bleep sound obscures the profanity which is still restricted to "15" and "18" rated films.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/05/advertising.asa "Probe into Barnardo's F-word ads"], ''The Guardian'', 5 July 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is permitted on UK television.

Trailers for programs containing swearing are usually bleeped until well after the [[Watershed (television)|watershed]], and it is very rare for any trailer to use the most severe swearwords uncensored.

The UK version of the Adventureland Red Band trailer (the version shown in cinemas) which showed before ''Funny People'' and ''Drag Me to Hell'' when it was out in UK cinemas had the profanities bleeped out in order to have a 15 certificate.

=== United States ===

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has the right to regulate indecent broadcasts. However, the FCC does not actively monitor television broadcasts for indecency violations, nor does it keep a record of television broadcasts. Reports must be documented exclusively by the public and submitted in written form, whether by traditional letter or [[electronic mail|e-mail]].

The FCC is allowed to enforce indecency laws during 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. – 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity |publisher=FCC.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for network broadcasts, offensive material seen during [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] in one time zone may be subject to fines and prosecution for stations in earlier time zones: for instance, a program with offensive content broadcast at 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] may fall out of watershed at 9 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]. To compensate, a channel may only air uncensored material after 1 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] so that the broadcast is out of watershed in the contiguous United States.

Cable and satellite channels are subject to regulations on what the FCC considers "obscenity," but are exempt from the FCC's "indecency" and "profanity" regulations, though many police themselves, mainly to appeal to advertisers who would be averse to placing their ads on their programs.

== History ==

30 years ago the Bonne Bay Marine Station was a small field station of [[Memorial University]]. The original station was a 2-storey house. The top floor had a small kitchen, a living room and three small bedrooms. The main floor had two larger rooms that were converted into labs and a small bathroom that was converted into a chemical lab where radioactive work and the chemical work was performed. It had a full basement, and there was an old fish store as a second building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/documents/Newsletter_Western_Shorefast-Issue_3_for_Email.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Hooper first visited the Bonne Bay area then and was taken with its breathtaking beauty, amazing marine biodiversity, and potential as a prime location for teaching and research. He helped convert this outport house with a fishing store into a marine teaching and research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer teaching activities began in 1979 with a single two week program. By 2001 seven, two week academic programs were running from mid April to September. The student demand for courses, and high level of research interest, often exceeded the available space. In addition, local visitors and summer tourists were frequently "dropping in" to view the aquarium, and learn about the latest research ventures. The existing station could no longer accommodate the needs for the facility. A new teaching and research facility plan was developed.

The official opening of the new Bonne Bay Marine Station occurred September 6, 2002. Built on the site of the old station this $3.2 million facility was funded by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; the Gros Morne Co-operating Association; the Department of Industry, Trade and Rural Development, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Memorial University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CURRA ==

The Community-University Research for Recovery Alliance (CURRA) is a 5-year research program centered at Bonne Bay Marine Station. This program of innovative, interdisciplinary research projects is helping communities and organizations along Newfoundland's west coast develop strategies for the recovery of fish stocks and fishery communities.

The CURRA brings together researchers from the social and natural sciences and fine arts at Memorial University in St. John's and [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]] in working partnerships with numerous stakeholders and community organizations.

The long-term objectives of the CURRA include promoting community engagement with the Station, promoting and diversifying the research community affiliated with the Station and training researchers in collaborative, community-based research approaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/about_us.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afleet.JPG|thumb|A horse cribbing on a wooden fence, note anti-cribbing collar intended to reduce this behavior and tension in neck muscles]]
Stereotypies are repetitive, unwavering behaviours that cease to obtain a goal and lack function.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wickens|first=Carissa L.|last2=Heleski|first2=Camie R.|date=2010|title=Crib-biting behavior in horses: A review|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.07.002|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=128|issue=1-4|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2010.07.002|issn=0168-1591|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most common stereotypies in horses is '''equine oral stereotypic behaviour''', otherwise known as '''cribbing''', wind sucking or crib-biting. '''Cribbing''' or '''crib biting''' involves a [[horse]] grasping a solid object such as the stall door or fence rail with its [[incisor]] teeth, then arching its neck, and contracting the lower neck muscles to retract the [[larynx]]. This coincides with an in-rush of air into the [[oesophagus]] producing the characteristic cribbing grunt. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the [[pharynx]]. Wind-sucking is a related behavior whereby the horse arches its neck and sucks air into the windpipe but does so without grasping an object.&lt;ref name="Mills2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mills, D.S.  |author2=Macleod, C.A.|year=2002|title=The response of crib-biting and wind-sucking in horses to dietary supplementation with an antacid mixture.|journal=Ippologia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wind-sucking is thought to form part of the mechanism of cribbing, rather than being defined as an entirely separate behavior.&lt;ref name=Malamed/&gt;

Cribbing is considered to be an [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal]], [[compulsive behavior]] or [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypy]] seen in some horses, and is often labelled a [[stable vices|stable vice]]. The major factors that cause cribbing include stress, stable management, genetic and gastrointestinal irritability &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmann|first=Karin|last2=Raekallio|first2=Marja|last3=Kanerva|first3=Kira|last4=Hänninen|first4=Laura|last5=Pastell|first5=Matti|last6=Palviainen|first6=Mari|last7=Vainio|first7=Outi|date=2012|title=Circadian variation in ghrelin and certain stress hormones in crib-biting horses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.09.027|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=193|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.09.027|issn=1090-0233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Cribbing was mentioned in the literature as early as 1578 and occurs in 2.4-8.3% of horses depending on breed and management.&lt;ref name="Lebelt"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lebelt, D., Zanella, A.J. and Unshelm, J.|year=1998|title=Physiological correlates associated with cribbing behaviour in horses: changes in thermal threshold, heart rate, plasma β‐endorphin and serotonin|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=30|pages=21–27|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb05140.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malamed&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malamed |first1=R. |last2=Berger |first2=J. |last3=Bain |first3=M.

A similar but unrelated behavior, '''wood-chewing''' or [[lignophagia]], is another undesirable habit observed in horses, but it does not involve sucking in air; the horse simply gnaws on wood rails or boards as if they were food.

==Description==
Cribbing, or crib biting, involves a horse grasping a solid object such as the stall door or fence rail with its incisor teeth, arching its neck, and contracting the lower neck muscles to retract the larynx caudally&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This movement is coincided with an in-rush of air through the crico-pharynx into the oesophagus producing the characteristic cribbing sound or grunt&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the pharynx.  It is considered to be an abnormal, compulsive behavior or stereotypy, and often labelled as a stable vice.

Wind-sucking is a related behavior whereby the horse arches its neck and sucks air into the windpipe but does so without grasping an object.  Wind-sucking is thought to form part of the mechanism of cribbing, rather than being defined as an entirely separate behavior.

===Wood-chewing===
{{main|Lignophagia#In horses}}
A similar, but unrelated behavior, wood-chewing ([[lignophagia]]), is another undesirable behavior sometimes observed in horses.  The horse gnaws on wood rails or boards as if they were food, but it does not involve sucking in air.&lt;ref name=Litva&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Litva |first1=A. |last2=Robinson |first2=C.

==Prevalence and incidence==
It is reported that 2.4–8.3% of horses in Europe and Canada are cribbers and occupies 15-65% of an individual horse's daily time budget.&lt;ref name="Baia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baia, P., Burba, D.J., Riggs, L.M. and Beaufrere, H.|year=2015|title=Long term outcome after laser assisted modified Forssell's in cribbing horses|journal=Veterinary Surgery|volume=44|issue=2|pages=156–161|doi=10.1111/j.1532-950x.2014.12125.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whisher"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whisher, L., Raum, M., Pina, L., Pérez, L., Erb, H., Houpt, C., &amp; Houpt, K.|year=2011|title=Effects of environmental factors on cribbing activity by horses|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=135|issue=1|pages=63–69|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A postal survey in 2009 found that an average of 4.4% horses in the US are cribbers, but 13.3% of Thoroughbreds perform the behavior.&lt;ref name="Albright2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Albright, J.D., Mohammed, H.O., Heleski, C.R., Wickens, C.L. and Houpt, K.A.|url=http://animalscience2.ucdavis.edu/ang105/References/Behavior/crib-biting%20breed%20diff.pdf|year=2009|title=Crib‐biting in US horses: breed predispositions and owner perceptions of aetiology|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=41|issue=5|pages=455–458|doi=10.2746/042516409x372584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Thoroughbred and part-Thoroughbred horses fed concentrated food after weaning are four times more likely to become cribbers than foals not fed concentrate.

Wind-sucking occurs in 3.8% of non-racing horses in the US.&lt;ref name="Wickens"&gt;{{cite book|title=Equine Neurology|editor=Martin Furr and Stephen Reed|author1=Wickens, C.L.  |author2=Houpt, K.A.|year=2015|chapter=Chapter 37: Stereotypic and behavior disorders|pages=472–483|edition=2|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study shows that stereotypes in general, including cribbing, are more prevalent in [[dressage]] horses compared to several other uses.&lt;ref name="Hausberger"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hausberger, M., Gautier, E., Biquand, V., Lunel, C. and Jego, P.|year=2009|title=Could work be a source of behavioural disorders?

[[Gelding]]s and [[stallions]] are more likely to exhibit cribbing than [[mares]]&lt;ref name="Wickens" /&gt; and the behavior has been reported as occurring in horses on pasture.&lt;ref name="Berg"&gt;{{cite journal|author=van den Berg, M., Brown, W.Y., Lee, C. and Hinch, G.N.|year=2015|title=Browse-related behaviors of pastured horses in Australia: A survey|work=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research|volume=10|issue=1|pages=48–53|doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2014.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

There is evidence that stomach ulcers may lead to a horse becoming a cribber,&lt;ref name="Nixon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nixon, S.|title=Oral stereotypic behaviour in an adult horse|year=2013|work=Proceedings Veterinary Behaviour Chapter: Science Week 2013|pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt; and that cribbing may be a coping mechanism in response to stress.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt;

A 1998 study found that cribbing increased [[endorphins]] and found no evidence that cribbing generally impairs the health of affected horses,&lt;ref name="Lebelt" /&gt; but later studies reported that cribbing and wind-sucking were related to a history of [[horse colic|colic]] or the subsequent development of colic.&lt;ref name=Malamed/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=D. C.|last2=Pinchbeck|first2=G. L.|last3=French|first3=N. P.|last4=Proudman|first4=C. J.|year=2008|title=Risk factors for epiploic foramen entrapment colic in a UK horse population: A prospective case-control study|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=405–10|doi=10.2746/042516408X312149|pmid=18487105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study found that horses would perform the cribbing behaviour in attempt to decrease the cortisol levels that can be brought on by stressful situations.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt;  According to this study, the long-term release of stress hormones can be harmful and can cause cardiovascular diseases, depression and immunosuppression.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt;

==Causes==
Boredom, stress, habit and addiction are all possible causes of cribbing and wind-sucking.&lt;ref name=Litva/&gt; It was proposed in a 2002 study that the link between intestinal conditions such as gastric inflammation or colic and abnormal oral behavior was attributable to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicol |first1=C. J. |last2=Davidson |first2=H. P. D. |last3=Harris |first3=P. A. |last4=Waters |first4=A. J. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. D. |title=Study of crib-biting and gastric inflammation and ulceration in young horses |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=151 |issue=22 |pages=658–62 |year=2002 |pmid=12498408 |doi=10.1136/vr.151.22.658}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that stomach ulcers may be correlated to a horse becoming a cribber.&lt;ref name="Nixon2013"/&gt;

Stress is induced when environmental demands produce a physiological response, if that response has a long duration period, it exceeds the normal, natural regulatory ability of the organism.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt; Stress has been found to be a major contributing factor to horses developing this oral stereotypic behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study suggested that the animal uses cribbing as a coping method when it cannot escape a fearful or stressful situation, or when it has been socially isolated or confined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Researchers now generally agree that cribbing and wind-sucking occur most often in stabled horses, although once established in an individual horse, the horse may exhibit these behaviors in other places.&lt;ref name="Litva" /&gt; Recent studies indicate cribbing occurs more frequently in horses that were stable-weaned as [[foal]]s than in those that were pasture-weaned. In the same study, feeding concentrates after weaning was associated with a fourfold increase in the rate of development of cribbing.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waters |first1=A. J. |last2=Nicol |first2=C. J. |last3=French |first3=N. P. |title=Factors influencing the development of stereotypic and redirected behaviours in young horses: findings of a four year prospective epidemiological study |journal=Equine Veterinary Journal |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=572–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12357996 |doi=10.2746/042516402776180241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular cases of crib-biting come from racetracks, and it is believed to have derived from husbandry systems at the racetracks. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue with these systems is that the social tendencies of the herd animal have been disrupted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, they are lacking social interaction and stimulation.

Because Thoroughbreds are so consistently the most prevalent cribbers, this suggests there may be a genetic component, however, this may be confounded by different uses and management of different horse breeds. It was found that Thoroughbreds are three times more likely to develop this stereotypy than any other breed, supporting that this may be a genetic component.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another study suggesting that cribbing may be genetic found that Warmbloods were also more likely to perform this behaviour when compared to other breeds. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bachmann|first=I.|last2=Bernasconi|first2=P.|last3=Herrmann|first3=R.|last4=Weishaupt|first4=M.A.|last5=Stauffacher|first5=M.|date=2003|title=Behavioural and physiological responses to an acute stressor in crib-biting and control horses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0168-1591(03)00086-8|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=82|issue=4|pages=297–311|doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(03)00086-8|issn=0168-1591|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that he descendants of a crib-biter were more likely to perform the behaviour due to a genetic component.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galizzi Vecchiotti|first=Giuliana|last2=Galanti|first2=Roberto|date=1986|title=Evidence of heredity of cribbing, weaving and stall-walking in thoroughbred horses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0301-6226(86)90098-9|journal=Livestock Production Science|volume=14|issue=1|pages=91–95|doi=10.1016/0301-6226(86)90098-9|issn=0301-6226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gastrointestinal environment and feeding routines were also a crucial topic, hinting that perhaps grain concentrations, grain ratios and forages were the main cause of ulcers, causing the animal to perform the oral stereotypy as a method of comfort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Horses that were unable to partake in a feeding behaviour that it wants to partake in would influence cribbing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the animal is unable to easily digest large quantities of starch, it was found that a high-grain, low forage diet could cause cribbing. A low-forage, high-grain diet was found to increase the risk of the stereotypy because the behaviour aided with relieving stomach acidity. &lt;ref name="pmid19303558" /&gt; 

It has been anecdotally claimed that horses can learn to copy these behaviors from other horses, although this has not been substantiated by scientific study.&lt;ref name=pmid19303558&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hothersall|first1=B.|last2=Nicol|first2=C.J.|title=Role of diet and feeding in normal and stereotypic behaviors in horses|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Equine Practice|volume=25|issue=1|pages=167–81, viii|year=2009|pmid=19303558|doi=10.1016/j.cveq.2009.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in 2009 found that 48.8% of US horse owners believed that cribbing could be learned by observation, but research demonstrated that only 1.0% of horses developed cribbing after being housed in sight of an affected horse.&lt;ref name="Albright2009" /&gt;

==Functions==
Stereotypies are sometimes considered to be a coping mechanism for animals experiencing stress.  A physiological stress response can be induced by injecting an animal with [[ACTH]] and the animal's ability to cope with this stress can be monitored by measuring salivary [[cortisol]].  In a 2015 study, after ACTH injection, cribbers had higher cortisol levels than non-cribbers.  Furthermore, cribbers which did not perform the stereotypy during the 3-hrs of testing had higher cortisol levels than non-cribbers, whereas those performing the stereotypy did not.  The researchers concluded that cribbing is a coping mechanism to stressful situations and that because of this, it should not be prevented.&lt;ref name="Freymond"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freymond, S.B., Bardou, D., Briefer, E.F.|year=2015|title=The physiological consequences of crib-biting in horses in response to an ACTH challenge test|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=151|pages=121–128|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cribbing and wind-sucking may cause a sensation of pleasure by releasing [[endorphin]]s in the horse's brain.&lt;ref name=Malamed/&gt; It has also been suggested that the increase in saliva produced during wind-sucking could be a mechanism for neutralizing stomach conditions in stable-kept, grain-fed horses.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;  Stereotypies have been defined as "repetitive, invariant behaviour patterns with no obvious goal or function",&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = G.J. | year = 1991 | title = Stereotypies: a critical review | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205806402 | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1015–1037 | doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, if cribbing and wind-sucking have one of the above possible functions, it may be inappropriate to label them as a stereotypy.  However, as the causes and resulting reinforcement for these behaviors are probably multifactorial and they remain abnormal behaviors, this indicates that [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] changes are needed for animals that exhibit cribbing or wind-sucking.

A study suggested was that ghrelin levels were higher in a crib-biting horse than in those who did not perform the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cribbing also increased salivary secretion. &lt;ref name="pmid19303558" /&gt; However, a different study found that there was no relation between salivary secretion and reducing gastric acidity. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houpt|first=Katherine A.|date=2012|title=A preliminary answer to the question of whether cribbing causes salivary secretion|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2011.12.010|journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior|volume=7|issue=5|pages=322–324|doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2011.12.010|issn=1558-7878|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that cribbing did not provide comfort for ulcers, rather that it stimulated/caused this issue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;!--probably should try to cite this too--&gt;

==Treatment==

Several methods have been devised to prevent cribbing once the behavior has started. However, some [[Ethology|ethologists]] have argued that prevention of the behavior without addressing the causes is not a cure and may result in cribbing being expressed in a modified form, or may interfere with an animal’s attempt to adapt to its environment.&lt;ref name="Cooper1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cooper, J.J.  |author2=Mason G.J.|year=1998|title=The identification of abnormal behaviour and behavioural problems in stabled horses and their relationship to horse welfare: a comparative review|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=30|pages=Supplementary 27, 5–9|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb05136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary and management===
It has been shown that feeding cribbing horses an [[antacid]] diet can significantly reduce the frequency of the behavior.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt; Current research indicates that the prevention of cribbing and related behavior is based upon management conditions which allow daily free movement and [[equine nutrition|feeding practices]] that provide higher amounts of roughage and limited amounts of concentrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bachmann |first1=I. |last2=Audigé |first2=L. |last3=Stauffacher |first3=M. |title=Risk factors associated with behavioural disorders of crib-biting, weaving and box-walking in Swiss horses |journal=Equine Veterinary Journal |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=158–63 |year=2003 |pmid=12638792 |doi=10.2746/042516403776114216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing body of work suggests that fat and fiber-based diets may also result in calmer patterns of behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid19303558" /&gt;

One study investigated the effects of providing a feeder that delivered small amounts of concentrate feed when activated by the animal.  The feeder increased the &lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt;feeding time of both cribbers and non-cribbers, however, although the feeder decreased cribbing, it increased again once the feeder was removed.&lt;ref name="Mazzola"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mazzola, S., Palestrini, C., Cannas, S., Fè, E., Bagnato, G. L., Vigo, D. and Minero, M.|year=2016|title=Efficacy of a feed dispenser for horses in decreasing cribbing behaviour|journal=Veterinary Medicine International|volume=2016|pages=1–6|doi=10.1155/2016/4698602}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Physical devices===
There are a number of traditional devices used to minimize or prevent cribbing and wind-sucking. However, the effectiveness of these methods is arguable since they do not address the underlying causal factors.&lt;ref name=McGreevy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGreevy |first1=P. D. |last2=Nicol |first2=C. J. |title=Prevention of crib-biting: a review |journal=Equine Veterinary Journal |volume=30 |issue=27 |pages=35–8 |year=1998 |pmid=10485002 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb05143.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the behaviour is stress related, the use of a cribbing collar may be counterproductive because it would not allow the animal to release the stress hormones by performing the behaviour and that cribbing may be beneficial in reducing stress.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt; One method involves the horse wearing a collar-like device that stops a horse from arching and swelling its neck to suck in air. However, one of the only studies of the equipment showed that although wearing such a collar for 24 hours reduced cribbing in six of eight horses, once the collar was removed, cribbing returned to greater levels than before.  The authors concluded cribbing has a function and that preventing this by using anti-cribbing collars may compromise the horse's welfare.&lt;ref name="McGreevy1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McGreevy, P.D.  |author2=Nicol, C.J.|year=1998|title=The effect of short term prevention on the subsequent rate of crib‐biting in Thoroughbred horses|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=30|pages=Supplementary issue 27, 30–34|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb05142.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering exposed edges with metal or wire or painting surfaces with bitter substances such as [[carbolineum]] or a commercial "chew stop" product may reduce chewing-related damage to surfaces, though this does not prevent edges from being gripped by the teeth.

===Surgical and others===
Other methods to prevent cribbing have included surgery, acupuncture, use of pharmaceuticals, operant feeding, and environmental enrichment.&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;However, a study found that the use of pharmaceuticals was expensive, less popular and less effective.&lt;ref name="Freymond" /&gt;

One surgical technique is the modified Forssell's procedure in which muscles and nerves in the ventral neck region are cut as well as some muscle tissue being removed. This makes it more difficult for a horse to contract the larynx and exhibit cribbing. An adaptation of this technique using a laser has proved successful in preventing some cribbers from exhibiting the behavior, although this was less successful in horses which had been cribbers for more than three years prior to the surgery.&lt;ref name="Baia" /&gt; It has been found that this method was successful in 84.4% of cases.&lt;ref name="Baia" /&gt; For those that the surgery was not found to be effective, relapse time occurred within six months to two years after the surgery had taken place.&lt;ref name="Baia" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==
Each and every individual horse who cribs is doing so for a different reason. Before deciding how the problem may have arose, or how you are going to treat the animal, make sure to consult your vet. Consulting your vet first can make the process easier and the problem causing the horse to crib can be properly addressed. By doing so, the wellbeing of your horse will be a top priority and no unnecessary changes will be made to the horses routine.

A '''developing country''' (or a '''low and middle income country''' ('''LMIC'''), '''less developed country''', '''less economically developed country''' ('''LEDC'''), or '''underdeveloped country''') is a country with a less developed [[industrial base]] and a low [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) relative to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)|first2=Steven M.|last2=Sheffrin | name-list-format = vanc |title=Economics: Principles in Action|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2003|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|page=471| isbn = 0-13-063085-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition is not universally agreed upon.

The term "developing" describes a currently observed situation and not a changing dynamic or expected direction of progress.

Therefore, the least developed countries are the poorest of the developing countries.

Developing countries tend to have some characteristics in common. For example, with regards to health risks, they commonly have: low levels of access to safe [[drinking water]], [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]]; [[energy poverty]]; high levels of [[pollution]] (e.g. [[air pollution]], [[Indoor air pollution in developing nations|indoor air pollution]], [[water pollution]]); high proportion of people with tropical and infectious diseases ([[neglected tropical diseases]]); high number of [[Traffic collision|road traffic accidents]]. Often, there is also widespread [[poverty]], low [[education]] levels, inadequate access to [[family planning]] services, [[corruption]] at all government levels and a lack of so-called [[good governance]]. [[Effects of global warming]] ([[climate change]]) are expected to impact developing countries more than wealthier countries, as most of them have a high "[[Climate change adaptation|climate vulnerability]]".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Althor G, Watson JE, Fuller RA|date=February 2016|title=Global mismatch between greenhouse gas emissions and the burden of climate change|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep20281|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=20281|doi=10.1038/srep20281|pmc=4742864|pmid=26848052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]], by the [[United Nations]], were set up to help overcome many of these problems. [[Development aid]] or development cooperation is financial [[aid]] given by governments and other agencies to support the economic, environmental, social and political [[International development|development]] of developing countries.

The UN acknowledges that it has "no established convention for the designation of "[[Developed country|developed]]" and "developing" countries or areas".&lt;ref name="unstated.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Millennium Development Indicators: World and regional groupings |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |date=2003 |at=Note b |access-date=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210031555/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |archive-date=10 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; According to its so-called M49 standards, published in 1999:&lt;blockquote&gt;The designations "developed" and "developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.&lt;ref name="unstats.un.org"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49): Developed Regions |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |access-date=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711220015/https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |archive-date=11 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm|title=United Nations Statistics Division- Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)|publisher=Unstats.un.org|access-date=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The UN implies that developing countries are those not on a tightly defined list of developed countries:
{{quote|There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered "developed" regions or areas. In international trade statistics, the [[Southern African Customs Union]] is also treated as a developed region and Israel as a developed country; countries emerging from the former Yugoslavia are treated as developing countries; and countries of eastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of Independent States [the former Soviet Union] in Europe are not included under either developed or developing regions.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;}}

However, under other criteria, some countries are at an intermediate stage of development, or, as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) put it, following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], "countries in transition": all those of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (including Central European countries that still belonged to the "Eastern Europe Group" in the UN institutions); the former [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) countries in Central Asia ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]); and [[Mongolia]]. By 2009, the IMF's [[World Economic Outlook]] classified countries as advanced, emerging, or developing, depending on "(1) per capita income level, (2) export diversification—so oil exporters that have high per capita GDP would not make the advanced classification because around 70% of its exports are oil, and (3) degree of integration into the global financial system"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm#q4b | title = Q. How does the WEO categorize advanced versus emerging and developing economies? | work = [[International Monetary Fund]] | access-date = 20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the current level of development, countries can also be classified by how much their level of development has changed over a specific period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ldc2012_en.pdf|title=Least Developed Countries Report 2012 - Unctad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 edition of its [[World Development Indicators]], the [[World Bank]] made a decision to no longer distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries in the presentation of its data, considering the two-category distinction outdated.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/2016-edition-world-development-indicators-out-three-features-you-won-t-want-miss|title=The 2016 edition of World Development Indicators is out: three features you won’t want to miss|last1=Fantom|first1=Neil|last2=Khokhar|first2=Tariq|date=15 April 2016|work=The Data Blog|publisher=The World Bank|access-date=October 22, 2016|last3=Purdie|first3=Edie|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the World Bank classifies countries into four groups, based on [[Gross National Income]] per capita, re-set each year on July 1.  In 2016, the four categories in US dollars were:&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

* Low income countries: $1,025 or less.
* Lower middle income countries: $1,026 to $4,035.
* Upper middle income countries: $4,036 to $12,236.
* [[High income countries]]:  $12,237 and above

[[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary General of the United Nations]], defined a developed country as "one that allows all its citizens to enjoy a free and healthy life in a safe environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 12 February 2000 | title = Press Release No. G/05/2000 | url = http://www.unescap.org/unis/press/G_05_00.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808082724/http://www.unescap.org/unis/press/G_05_00.htm | archive-date=2009-08-08 | dead-url = yes | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development can be measured by economic or human factors. Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

The concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations — for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].

Another important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].

=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===

There are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development.  Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging.  Use of the term "market" instead of "country" usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries' [[capital market]]s as opposed to the overall economy.

* [[Developed country|Developed countries]] and [[developed market]]s
* Developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market:

** [[Emerging markets]]
** [[Frontier markets]]
** [[Least developed country|Least developed countries]]

Developing countries can also be categorized by geography:
* [[Small Island Developing States]]
* [[Landlocked developing countries|Landlocked Developing Countries]]

Other classifications include:
* [[Heavily indebted poor countries]], a definition by a program of the IMF and World Bank
* [[Transition economy]], moving from a centrally planned to market-driven economy
* Multi-dimensional clustering system: with the understanding that different countries have different development priorities and levels of access to resources and institutional capacities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Svea | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-06-01|title=From Poverty Reduction to Mutual Interests?

=== Criticisms and other terms ===
There is criticism for using the term "developing country". The term could imply inferiority of this kind of country compared with a [[developed country]]. It could assume a desire to develop along the traditional Western model of [[economic development]] which a few countries, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Bhutan]], choose not to follow.&lt;ref name="Karma Ura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/305/pdf/mono_1en_bt_dev_stry.pdf|title=The Bhutanese development story|last=Ura|first=Karma|access-date=17 September 2012|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative measurements such as [[gross national happiness]] have been suggested as important indicators.

The classification of countries as "developing" implies that other [[developed countries|countries are developed]]. This bipartite division is contentious.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

To moderate the [[euphemistic]] aspect of the word "developing", [[international organization]]s have started to use the term [[Least developed country|less economically developed country]] for the poorest nations—which can, in no sense, be regarded as developing. This highlights that the standard of living across the entire developing world varies greatly. Other terms sometimes used are less developed countries, underdeveloped nations, and non-industrialized nations. Conversely, [[developed countries]], [[most economically developed countries]], industrialized nations are the opposite end of the spectrum.

==== Third World ====
{{Main|Third World}}
Over the past few decades since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the [[end of the Cold War]], the term ''[[Third World]]'' has been used interchangeably with developing countries, but the concept has become outdated in recent years as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world. The [[three-world model]] arose during the [[Cold War]] to define countries aligned with [[NATO]] (the [[First World]]), the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]] (the [[Second World]], although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, "Third World" was a political, rather than an economic, grouping.

====Global South====
{{Main|Global South}}
The term "[[Global South]]" began to be used more widely since about 2004.&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7917466/The_Use_of_the_Concept_Global_South_in_Social_Science_and_Humanities/|title=The Use of the Concept 'Global South' in Social Science &amp; Humanities|last2=Ranke|first2=Karen|date=11 July 2014|publisher=[[Humboldt University of Berlin]]|access-date=2016-10-06|last3=Hempel|first3=Fabian|last4=Köhler|first4=Jonas|first1=Heikie|last1=Pagel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYdeNdKrp8sC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Urban Poverty in the Global South: Scale and Nature |last=Mitlin |first=Diana |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415624664|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also include poorer "southern" regions of wealthy "northern" countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3s7a39GHIEC&amp;pg=PA11 |title=The Foreign Policies of the Global South: Rethinking Conceptual Frameworks |last=Braveboy-Wagner |first=Jacqueline Anne |date=2003 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn=9781588261755 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global South refers to these countries' "interconnected histories of [[colonialism]], [[neo-imperialism]], and differential economic and social change through which large inequalities in living standards, life expectancy, and access to resources are maintained".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dados|first=Nour|last2=Connell|first2=Raewyn | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-01-01|title=the global south|jstor=41960738|journal=Contexts|volume=11|issue=1|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common challenges==

{{Development economics sidebar}}

Most developing countries have these criteria in common:&lt;ref name=UN2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldc-criteria.html |title=Criteria For Identification Of LDCs |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division|access-date = 2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Criteria"&gt;UN-OHRLLS [http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/criteria-for-ldcs/ Criteria for Identification and Graduation of LDCs].&lt;/ref&gt;
* High levels of [[poverty]] – measured based on [[Gross national income|GNI]] per capita averaged over three years. For example, if the GNI per capita is less than [[United States dollar|US $]]1,025 (as of 2018) the country is regarded as a [[least developed country]].&lt;ref name="Criteria" /&gt;
*[[Human resources|Human resource]] weakness (based on indicators of [[nutrition]], [[health]], [[education]] and adult [[literacy]]; for example low literacy levels). 
*[[Economic Vulnerability Index|Economic vulnerability]] (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by [[natural disasters]]).

===Urban slums===
{{Main|Slum}}
According to [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]], around 33% of the urban population in the developing world in 2012, or about 863 million people, lived in slums.&lt;ref name="UNHABITATswcr1213"&gt;{{cite web|title=State of the World's Cities Report 2012/2013: Prosperity of Cities|publisher=UNHABITAT| url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/745habitat.pdf|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the proportion of urban population living in slums was highest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (62%), followed by [[South Asia]] (35%), [[Southeast Asia]] (31%) and [[East Asia]] (28%).&lt;ref name="UNHABITATswcr1213" /&gt;{{rp|127}}

The UN-Habitat reports that 43% of urban population in developing countries and 78% of those in the [[least developed countries]] are slum dwellers.&lt;ref name=grhs2003&gt;[http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/grhs.2003.key.pdf The challenge of slums – Global report on Human Settlements] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055009/http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/grhs.2003.key.pdf |date=21 September 2013 }}, United Nations Habitat (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Slums form and grow in different parts of the world for many different reasons. Causes include rapid rural-to-urban migration, [[economic stagnation]] and depression, high [[unemployment]], poverty, [[Informal sector|informal economy]], forced or manipulated ghettoization, poor planning, politics, [[natural disaster]]s and [[social conflict]]s.&lt;ref name=whyslums&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/4625_51419_GC%2021%20What%20are%20slums.pdf | title =What are slums and why do they exist? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110206143558/http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/4625_51419_GC%2021%20What%20are%20slums.pdf | archive-date = 2011-02-06 | publisher = UN-Habitat | location = Kenya | date = April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Patton | first1 = Carl V. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Spontaneous Shelter: International Perspectives and Prospects | date=1988 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-507-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grhs2011&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS.2003.2.pdf | title = Assessing Slums in the Development Context | publisher = United Nations Habitat Group | year = 2011 | access-date = 16 September 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140105025237/http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS.2003.2.pdf | archive-date = 5 January 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as populations expand in poorer countries, rural people are moving to cities in an extensive [[Urbanization|urban migration]] that is resulting in the creation of [[slum]]s.&lt;ref name="Westra"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Westra | first = Richard | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2011 | title = Renewing Socialist Development in the Third World | journal = [[Journal of Contemporary Asia]] | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 519–543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, especially in countries in [[Southern Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan]], slums are not just marginalized neighborhoods holding a small population; slums are widespread, and are home to a large part of urban population. These are sometimes called "slum cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slum Cities and Cities with Slums" States of the World’s Cities 2008/2009|publisher=UN-Habitat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against women===
{{Main|Violence against women}}

Several forms of [[violence against women]] are more prevalent in developing countries than in other parts of the world. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Cambodia]]. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Papua New Guinea: police cite bride price major factor in marital violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150218182845/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | archive-date = 18 February 2015 |url= http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | work = Island Business |via=Violence is not our Culture |date=21 November 2011 |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An exploratory study of bride price and domestic violence in Bundibugyo District, Uganda | url= http://www.mrc.ac.za/gender/Bridepricedomesticviolence.pdf | publisher = Centre for Human Rights Advancement (CEHURA) and [[South African Medical Research Council]] | date =April 2012 | access-date =6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female genital mutilation]] is another form of violence against women which is still occurring in many developing countries. It is found mostly in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. Developing countries with the highest rate of women who have been cut are Somalia (with 98 per cent of women affected), Guinea (96 per cent), Djibouti (93 per cent), Egypt (91 per cent), Eritrea (89 per cent), Mali (89 per cent), Sierra Leone (88 per cent), Sudan (88 per cent), Gambia (76 per cent), Burkina Faso (76 per cent), and Ethiopia (74 per cent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF | title = Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = 22 July 2013 | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[globalization]] and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa and Middle East, to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha  | name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = Judging other cultures: the case of genital mutilation |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=43U8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120  | editor-last = Nussbaum | editor-first = Martha | editor-link = Martha Nussbaum| title = Sex &amp; social justice |pages=120–121 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 0195110323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | date = 12 April 2011 | access-date = 8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, FGM has been legally banned in many African countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

=== Public health   ===
People in developing countries usually have a lower [[life expectancy]] than people in developed countries.

[[Malnutrition|Undernutrition]] is more common in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4CGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|title=World Hunger Routledge Introductions to Development| first = Liz | last = Young  | name-list-format = vanc |date=2002|isbn=9781134774944|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain groups have higher rates of undernutrition, including women—in particular while pregnant or [[breastfeeding]]—[[malnutrition in children|children]] under five years of age, and the elderly.

===Water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH)===

{{Main|WASH}}
{{Further|Water issues in developing countries|Water supply and women in developing countries}}

Access to water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) services is at very low levels in many developing countries. In 2015 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that "1 in 3 people, or 2.4 billion, are still without sanitation facilities" while 663 million people still lack access to safe and clean drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp-2015-key-facts/en/|title=Key facts from JMP 2015 report|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/jmp-report/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Lack of sanitation for 2.4 billion people is undermining health improvements|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate in 2017 by [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]] states that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; The majority of these people live in developing countries.

About 892 million people, or 12 per cent of the global population, practiced [[open defecation]] instead of using [[toilets]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-six per cent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world live in just seven countries. [[India]] is the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; Further countries with a high number of people openly defecating are Nigeria (47 million), followed by Indonesia (31 million), Ethiopia (27 million), Pakistan (23 million),&lt;ref name="PAK"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/pakistan/media_9678.html|title=UNICEF: Without toilets, childhood is even riskier due to malnutrition|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|access-date=22 August 2017|quote=The fact remains that in Pakistan, 25 million people (or 13 per cent of the population) practice open defecation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niger (14 million) and [[Sudan]] (11 million).&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMP17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene - 2017 |url=https://washwatch.org/en/countries/compare/?country=eritrea&amp;country=ethiopia&amp;country=india&amp;country=indonesia&amp;country=niger&amp;country=nigeria&amp;country=pakistan&amp;update=Compare|website=www.washdata.org|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF)|access-date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable Development Goal 6]] is one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. This is particularly relevant for people in developing countries.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy poverty|Renewable energy in developing countries}}
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung ([[dry animal dung fuel]]) for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sovacool BK | title = Energy. Deploying off-grid technology to eradicate energy poverty | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6103 | pages = 47–8 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23042871 | doi = 10.1126/science.1222307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renewable energy in developing countries|Renewable energy]] can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===

==== Indoor air pollution ====
[[Indoor air pollution in developing nations]] is a major health hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruce N, Perez-Padilla R, Albalak R | title = Indoor air pollution in developing countries: a major environmental and public health challenge | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 78 | issue = 9 | pages = 1078–92 | date = 2000 | pmid = 11019457 | pmc = 2560841 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of indoor air pollution in [[developing countries]] is the burning of [[biomass]]. Three billion people in developing countries across the globe rely on biomass in the form of [[wood]], [[charcoal]], [[Manure|dung]], and [[crop residue]], as their domestic cooking fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Duflo E, Greenstone M, Hanna R|year=2008|title=Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html|journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S|volume=1|issue=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because much of the cooking is carried out indoors in environments that lack proper ventilation, millions of people, primarily poor women and children face serious health risks.

Globally, 4.3 million deaths were attributed to exposure to IAP in developing countries in 2012, almost all in low and middle income countries.  The South East Asian and Western Pacific regions bear most of the burden with 1.69 and 1.62 million deaths, respectively. Almost 600,000 deaths occur in Africa.&lt;ref name="WHO1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burden of disease from Indoor Air Pollution for 2012|url=http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/FINAL_HAP_AAP_BoD_24March2014.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|access-date=2014-03-28|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier estimate from 2000 but the death toll between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths.&lt;ref name="Ezzati"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ezzati M, Kammen DM | title = The health impacts of exposure to indoor air pollution from solid fuels in developing countries: knowledge, gaps, and data needs | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 11 | pages = 1057–68 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12417475 | pmc = 1241060 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.021101057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding an affordable solution to address the many effects of indoor air pollution is complex. Strategies include improving combustion, reducing smoke exposure, improving safety and reducing labor, reducing fuel costs, and addressing sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duflo E, Greenstone M, Hanna R |title=Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2008 |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water pollution====

[[Water pollution]] is a major problem in many developing countries. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of [[water resource policy]] at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 | last = Pink | first = Daniel H. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Yahoo |title=Investing in Tomorrow's Liquid Gold |date=April 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423172532/https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |archive-date=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/a/waterdayqa.htm | last = West | first = Larry | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=About.com |title=World Water Day: A Billion People Worldwide Lack Safe Drinking Water |date=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt;

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in [[India]] die of water pollution related illness (including [[waterborne diseases]]) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |title=An overview of diarrhea, symptoms,  diagnosis and the costs of morbidity |year=2010 |work=CHNRI |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231350/http://www.inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |archive-date=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 per cent of the [[Water resources of China|water in the cities of China]] is polluted.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/07/content_449451.htm China says water pollution so severe that cities could lack safe supplies]".

===Global warming===
{{Further|Regional effects of global warming|Climate change adaptation}}

The [[effects of global warming]] such as [[Extreme weather|extreme weather events]], [[drought]]s, [[floods]], [[biodiversity loss]], [[disease]] and [[sea level rise]] are dangerous for humans and the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Developing countries are the least able to [[Climate change adaptation|adapt to climate change]] (and are therefore called "highly climate vulnerable") due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] or [[Small Island Developing States]]. Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/australia-the-us-and-europe-are-climate-free-riders-its-time-to-step-up-53953|title=Australia, the US and Europe are climate ‘free-riders’: it’s time to step up|work=The Conversation (Australia edition)|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragile state]]s or [[failed state]]s like [[Afghanistan]], [[Haiti]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Somalia]] are among the worst affected.

[[Climate change adaptation|Climate vulnerability]] has been quantified in the [[Climate Vulnerability Monitor]] reports of 2010 and 2012. Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, [[habitat loss]], and economic stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to [[hunger]] and [[Infection|communicable diseases]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name="CVM report 2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828337356|title=Climate vulnerability monitor : a guide to the cold calculus of a hot planet|date=2012|publisher=DARA|others=DARA, Climate Vulnerable Forum|isbn=9788461605675|edition= 2nd|location=[Madrid]|oclc=828337356}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|17}} These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.

A changing climate also results in economic burdens. The economies in [[Least Developed Countries]] have lost an average of 7% of their [[gross domestic product]] for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced [[Workforce productivity|labor productivity]].&lt;ref name="CVM report 2012" /&gt;{{Rp|14}} Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the [[least developed countries]] in 2010 – 4% in the [[Pacific]]  – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the [[world economy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=17016|title=Climate vulnerability monitor 2010: the state of the climate crisis - Documents &amp; Publications - Professional Resources|date=|publisher=PreventionWeb.net|access-date=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the impact on [[Fishery|fisheries]]: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]] on fisheries. Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.&lt;ref name="CVM report 2012" /&gt;{{Rp|279}}

In many cases, developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Such countries include [[Comoros]], [[The Gambia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]] - they have been called "forced riders" as opposed to the "free riders".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Internationally there is recognition of this issue, which is known under the term "[[climate justice]]". It has been a key topic at the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conferences]] (COP).

During the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Cancún COP16 in 2010]], [[List of development aid country donors|donor countries]] promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the [[Green Climate Fund]] for developing countries to adapt to climate change. However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220605/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042541/http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220605/index.en.shtml|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="International_Adaptation_Finance"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eed.de/fix/files/doc/2008_BMueller_int_adapatation_finance.pdf|title=International Adaptation Finance: The Need for an Innovative and Strategic Approach 4 (Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Working Paper)|last1=Müller|first1=Benito|date=2008|publisher=Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|isbn=978-1-901795-76-9|location=Oxford|name-list-format=vanc|access-date=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229175020/http://www.eed.de/fix/files/doc/2008_BMueller_int_adapatation_finance.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmanuel Macron]] ([[President of France]]) said at the [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Bonn (COP 23): "Climate change adds further injustice to an already unfair world".&lt;ref name="Carrington-2017.11.15"&gt;Damian Carrington, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/climate-change-will-determine-humanitys-destiny-says-angela-merkel "Climate change will determine humanity's destiny, says Angela Merkel"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 November 2017 (page visited on 15 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate stress is likely to add to existing [[Human migration|migration]] patterns in developing countries and beyond but is not expected to generate entirely new flows of people.&lt;ref name="wdr migration"&gt;{{citation|title=Managing social risks: Empower communities to protect themselves|author=The World Bank|chapter=Part One: Chapter 2: Reducing Human Vulnerability: Helping People Help Themselves|chapter-url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2010/Resources/5287678-1226014527953/Chapter-2.pdf}}, p. 109, {{harvnb|WDR|2010}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|110|date=November 2012}} A report by [[World Bank]] in 2018 estimated that around 143 million people in three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and [[Latin America]]) could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change.

===Population growth===
Over the last few decades, global population growth has largely been driven by developing countries, which often have higher [[birth rate]]s (higher [[fertility]] rate) than developed countries. According to the United Nations, [[family planning]] can help to slow population growth and decrease poverty in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Earth &amp; Sky''''', also known as '''''EarthSky''''' (the still-active website), was a daily radio series that presented information about [[science]] and [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.EarthSky.org EarthSky.]'' [http://earthsky.org/earthsky-a-clear-voice-for-science Earthsky: A clear voice for science] Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It began broadcasting in 1991. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was the creation of producers [[Deborah Byrd]] and Joel Block, who were also the hosts.  They previously hosted the program [[StarDate (radio program)|Star Date]] that began broadcasting in the US in 1977.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' presented 60- and 90-second radio spots (called "modules") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial [[radio]] as well as [[satellite radio]] and [[internet radio]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.Podfeed.net Podfeed.net].''  http://www.podfeed.net/podcast/Earth++Sky+radio+show/2730  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and other [[public radio]] stations, 80 affiliate stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EarthSky.org ''EarthSky''.] http://earthsky.org/partners/offerings  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, the programming iwas heard on American Forces Radio, [[Voice of America]] Radio, [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]], and others.

The information on ''Earth &amp; Sky'' came directly from scientists. The [[journalist]]s who produced the ''Earth &amp; Sky'' radio program and continue to produce the Website speak to several scientists each day, dozens each week and hundreds each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 scientists had joined ''Earth &amp; Sky'' as volunteer advisers. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' science advisers suggested content, gave feedback, recommended other experts, and reviewed scripts for accuracy before they were recorded for broadcast.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' featured many fields of science. In 2006, it focused was on [[nanotechnology]], [[women in science]], [[List of Earth observation satellites|observing the Earth]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Space science|space]], and the human world.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode of ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was broadcast on June 2, 2013. President and co-founder Deborah Byrd said that although funding options existed to continue the radio program, a decision was made to stop producing the radio show in order to concentrate on the Website and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Brandon|title=Silent Nignt: EarthSky says goodbye to radio|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2013-03-04/silent-night/|accessdate=16 July 2014|work=The Austin Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnocinema''', from [[Jean Rouch]]’s ''cine-ethnography'' and ''ethno-fictions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rouch, Jean. 2003. ''Cine-Ethnography''. Translated and edited by Steven Feld. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging practice of [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] filmmaking being defined and extended by [[Melbourne, Australia]]-based writer and arts educator, [[Anne Harris (educator)|Anne Harris]], and others. Originally derived from the discipline of [[anthropology]], ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy" in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century.

Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] who has asserted that “all ethnographic representations are partial truths”.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "preserving", "empowering" or "giving voice" to [[Marginalization|marginalised]] cultures, [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]], communities or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "‘You Could Do With A Little More Gucci’: Ethnographic Documentary Talks Back" in ''Creative Approaches to Research'', Vol 2:1, July 2009. Melbourne: RMIT Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; According to theorists, such voices already have [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers. Ethnocinematic films primarily document "relationships"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne and Nyuon, Nyadol: "Working It Both Ways: Intercultural Collaboration and the Performativity of Identity" ''The Australasian Review of African Studies'', Vol 31:1, June 2010. Pp 62-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216144841/http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; between filmmakers from different cultures, or subcultures, who now share common space of a [[Politics|political]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Geography|geographical]] or [[Virtual world|virtual]] nature.
 
Ethno-cinematographers include [[Jean Rouch]], [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and, indigenous filmmakers such as Australian [[Essie Coffey]] who collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works.

== History ==

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation&lt;ref&gt;Tobing Rony, Fatimah. 1996. ''The Third Eye: Race, Cinema and Ethnographic Spectacle''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt; including “ethnographic inscription” (Regnault), “taxidermic mode” (Flaherty’s ''Nanook''), and “self-reflexive” (Rouch’s films of the 1950s){{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Of these, Rouch’s films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American [[Bill Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 1994. ''Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema is typical{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and others.  More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as [[Essie Coffey]] (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the [[observational cinema]] tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha’s observation that “Everywhere we go, we become someone’s private zoo”,&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, T. (1996) "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist literary theory: a reader''. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pg 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Anne | year = | title = Someone's Private Zoo: Ethnocinema and the Other | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 "ethnocinematic experiment" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in "American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control",&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. "American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control". in ''Eyes Across the Water'', edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which seven co-participants of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‘Indian’; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched [[dichotomy]]. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of “native authenticity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = Sam | year = 2000 | title = Indigenous media then and now: Situating the Navajo film project | doi = 10.1080/10509200009361497 | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 273–286 [274] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century’s ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar [[Jay Ruby]] asserts; what he calls ''Ethnographic Cinema'' must, he claims “be the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, J. ''Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation''  (n.d.)   {{cite web |url=http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195720/http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}. (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By Ruby’s reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn’t qualify.

Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a “celebration of a relationship” between filmmaker and imaged, in which the “rapport and participation”&lt;ref&gt;Rouch 2003, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos’s{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} claim (like Ruby’s) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between "authentic" ethnography and general [[documentary]] seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of “distant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe”&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl G. 2006. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly outmoded in a culture of [[YouTube]] and [[social networking]] sites screaming for video content.{{Why|date=July 2012}}

=== Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions ===
The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online [[blog]] characterises a Burmese festival as “a surrealist anti-documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much ''official ethno cinema''”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. 2006. "Burmese Daze". Originally published in ''The Strange Attractor Journal'', No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt. (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of [[Andean cattle]] in [[Peru]] refers to the paper as an “ethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film” the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as “observation instruments”,&lt;ref&gt;Reyna, Carlos. 2005. ''Cinema e Antropologia: Novos diálogos metodológicos na interpretação de um ritual andino''. Biblioteca online de ciências da comunicação. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema-antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt; none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work.

Several recent European [[film festival]]s list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ''ethnographic'' and ''ethnocinematic'' interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, ''Notes From the Underground'', [[Goran Gocić]]’s insider look at the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ''ethno-cinema'' and then just "''ethno''". A ''[[Modern Language Association Review]]'' article opined, "The appeal of Kusturica's films … is that of "ethno" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in "Western" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gocić, an empowerment of the marginal."&lt;ref&gt;Haymes, Peter. 2004. "Review of ''Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica''". ''The Modern Language Review'', January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

and from a far less favourable online book review:
he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in [[exoticism]] and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. "Capturing Kusturica: On Gocić’s ''The Cinema of Kusturica''", ''Film Philosophy'', vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gocić himself says that, “inside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, Goran. 2001. ''The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground''. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition.  Gocić identifies "ethno" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the “local”, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of "ethno cinema" “in the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gocić does attempt to characterise and define his version of ''ethno cinema'' with the following: “nostalgia,” (as a search for the “‘lost ‘authenticity’ of primitivism”), “intertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‘double coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of "women/natives/others"&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader'', edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. [[Laura Marks]] identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: “the rise of multiculturalism … availability of funding … and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested”.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Laura U. 2000. ''The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses''. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and – as Rouch has repeatedly shown us – "the other cannot be denied" as his/her image and means of production transforms.

In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways.  One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary [[voyeurism]] is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. [[Gwendolyn A. Foster|Foster’s]] contention that controlling the means of production is "foregrounding subjectivity",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. ''Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is limited.  It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast.  It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture.   This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception.  We have moved well beyond [[orientalism]] and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that "they must therefore be represented by others",&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. 2000. ''Reflections on exile and other essays''. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206.&lt;/ref&gt; but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically "authentic" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations.  Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed ''together'' in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and [[popular culture]] characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing.  It does not seek to "document" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging.

=== Ethnocinema: new directions ===

In ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology'', Ruby calls for places where “critical standards are debated and canons develop”,&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2000. ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pg 23. Original edition, 1975 article.&lt;/ref&gt; and the need for ethnographic filmmakers to generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby’s definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby’s so-called “marketplace considerations”&lt;ref&gt;Ruby 2000, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt; need not pollute the product which is made. Ruby proposed in 2008 that “anthropologists should simply relinquish the term ethnographic to professional documentary filmmakers and seek another term to characterize their efforts”;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2008.

(Retrieved on 10 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; while Harris proposes that ethnographic is being superseded by ''ethnocinematic'' filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne.

'''European Culture and Economy''', shortened as '''ECUE''', is an interdisciplinary postgraduate program that is distinct from [[European studies|European Studies]]. Both focus on European politics and developments. After receiving the academic degree [[Master of Arts]], graduates of ECUE may engage in various business fields, however, especially [[European Union|EU]]-related professions are targeted.

==History==
The [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany is currently the only university to offer European Culture and Economy as a path of study.&lt;ref&gt;http://studieren.de/hochschule.0.html?&amp;tx_assearchengine_pi2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small branch, approximately 30 students are accepted each year. It was first introduced in the winter term of 1999/2000 and has since become an established [[Master's degree|Masters]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;programme. Initially, ECUE was a way of giving arts scholars a fundamental understanding of economics, politics and intercultural competences. In its early stages, the program was supported financially by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) as well as [[German Rectors' Conference]] (HRK).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordrheinwestfalendirekt.de/broschuerenservice/download/173/auslandserfahrung.pdf p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, its level of quality was confirmed by ACQUIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&amp;titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&amp;standort=&amp;hochschule=&amp;sonstiger_hochschulname=&amp;fachausschuesse=&lt;/ref&gt; a German Quality Assurance Institute. Students of ECUE are intended to qualify as ''specialized generalist'' and be prepared for careers in international companies and institutions. The expected duration of study is four terms.

==Curriculum==
The curriculum puts an emphasis on examining the European area from an economic, cultural, political and sociological perspective. During Colloquia and an obligatory excursion (to Brussels), the interrelations of the disciplines are linked and investigated. Additionally, the students' intercultural competences and research methods are trained.

Seminars of the following disciplines are included in the program:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecue/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Law]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[History]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]]

The interdisciplinary and intercultural approach teaches students to analyze European topics from a cultural, economical and political angle. Next to interdisciplinary, ECUE stresses international relations. Many of the available places are assigned to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch Europa in NRW (p. 59,60)&lt;/ref&gt; So far, students of 30 different nations (Africa, U.S.A., Asia, many European countries) were able to successfully complete the program.

==Admission==
To be granted admission to the program, a very good to excellent [[Bachelor's degree]] is required. Furthermore, students must possess a good proficiency in the teaching languages, English and German.
Further, a term abroad or an internship are possible ways to organize the program.

{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}
In [[physics]] or [[engineering]] [[education]], a '''Fermi problem''', '''Fermi quiz''', '''Fermi question''', '''Fermi estimate''', or '''order estimation''' is an [[Estimation theory|estimation]] problem designed to teach [[dimensional analysis]] or [[approximation]], and such a problem is usually a [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]. The estimation technique is named after physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] as he was known for his ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their [[variance]] or lower and upper bounds.

== Historical background ==
An example is [[Enrico Fermi]]'s estimate of the strength of the [[atomic bomb]] that detonated at the [[Trinity test]], based on the distance traveled by pieces of paper he dropped from his hand during the blast.&lt;ref name=weapons-2-2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyewitnesses to Trinity|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/11nwj2-05.pdf|work=Nuclear Weapons Journal, Issue 2 2005|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=18 February 2014|page=45|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's estimate of 10 kilotons of [[TNT]] was remarkably close to the now-accepted value of around 20 kilotons.

==Examples==
An example problem, of a type generally attributed to Fermi,&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as a Fermi problem in Lufkin, Dan. [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1396#more-1396 "Comment on 'Generalization and truth'"]. ''[[Language Log]]''{{reliable source|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "How many [[piano tuner]]s are there in [[Chicago]]?" A typical solution to this problem involves multiplying a series of estimates that yield the correct answer if the estimates are correct.  For example, we might make the following assumptions:

# There are approximately 9,000,000 people living in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].
# On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.
# Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.
# Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.
# It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.
# Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.

From these assumptions, we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is

:(9,000,000 persons in Chicago) ÷ (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.

We can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs

:(50 weeks/year) × (5 days/week) × (8 hours/day) ÷ (2 hours to tune a piano) = 1000 piano tunings per year.

Dividing gives

:(225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago) ÷ (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 225 piano tuners in Chicago.

In 2009, the actual number of piano tuners in Chicago was about 290.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?t=crmtb01&amp;f=ob&amp;i=how%20many%20piano%20tuners%20are%20in%20chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous example of a Fermi-problem-like estimate is the [[Drake equation]], which seeks to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy.  The basic question of why, if there were a significant number of such civilizations, ours has never encountered any others is called the [[Fermi paradox]].

==Advantages and scope==
Scientists often look for Fermi estimates of the answer to a problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to be the answer, giving context to the results.

As long as the initial assumptions in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case. For example, if the estimate tells you there should be a hundred or so tuners but the precise answer tells you there are many thousands then you know you need to find out why there is this divergence from the expected result. First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.

Fermi estimates are also useful in approaching problems where the optimal choice of calculation method depends on the expected size of the answer. For instance, a Fermi estimate might indicate whether the internal stresses of a structure are low enough that it can be accurately described by [[linear elasticity]]; or if the estimate already bears significant relationship in [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] relative to some other value, for example, if a structure will be over-engineered to withstand loads several times greater than the estimate.

Although Fermi calculations are often not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does tell us what to look for to get a better answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago.  It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme ''reasonable'' values that could appear in each of our assumptions).

== Explanation ==
Fermi estimates generally work because the estimations of the individual terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, if there is no consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will ''probably'' be more accurate than might be first supposed.

In detail, multiplying estimates corresponds to adding their logarithms; thus one obtains a sort of [[Wiener process]] or [[random walk]] on the [[logarithmic scale]], which diffuses as {{sqrt|''n''}} (in number of terms ''n''). In discrete terms, the number of overestimates minus underestimates will have a [[binomial distribution]]. In continuous terms, if one makes a Fermi estimate of ''n'' steps, with [[standard deviation]] ''σ'' units on the log scale from the actual value, then the overall estimate will have standard deviation ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt;, since the standard deviation of a sum scales as {{sqrt|''n''}} in the number of summands.

For instance, if one makes a 9-step Fermi estimate, at each step overestimating or underestimating the correct number by a factor of 2 (or with a standard deviation 2), then after 9 steps the standard error will have grown by a logarithmic factor of {{sqrt|9}} = 3, so 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8. Thus one will expect to be within {{frac|8}} to 8 times the correct value – within an [[order of magnitude]], and much less than the worst case of erring by a factor of 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 512 (about 2.71 orders of magnitude). If one has a shorter chain or estimates more accurately, the overall estimate will be correspondingly better.

'''Functional specialization''' suggests that different areas in the brain are specialized for different functions.&lt;ref name=flourens&gt;Flourens, M. J. P. (1824) Recherces experimentales sur les propretes et les fonctions du systeme nerveux dans les animaux vertebres. Paris: J.B. Balliere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lashley&gt;Lashley, K. S. (1929) Brain mechanisms and intelligence. Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical origins ==
{{See also|History of neuroscience}}
[[File:Phrenology-journal.jpg|thumb|1848 edition of American Phrenological Journal published by Fowlers &amp; Wells, New York City]]

[[Phrenology]], created by [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776–1832) and best known for the idea that one's personality could be determined by the variation of bumps on their skull, proposed that different regions in one's brain have different functions and may very well be associated with different behaviours.&lt;ref name=flourens /&gt;&lt;ref name=lashley /&gt; Gall and Spurzheim were the first to observe the crossing of pyramidal tracts, thus explaining why lesions in one hemisphere are manifested in the opposite side of the body. However, Gall and Spurzheim did not attempt to justify phrenology on anatomical grounds. It has been argued that phrenology was fundamentally a science of race. Gall considered the most compelling argument in favor of phrenology the differences in skull shape found in sub-Saharan Africans and the anecdotal evidence (due to scientific travelers and colonists) of their intellectual inferiority and emotional volatility. In Italy, [[Luigi Rolando]] carried out lesion experiments and performed electrical stimulation of the brain, including the [[primary motor cortex|Rolandic area]].

[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A|Phineas Gage's accident]]
[[Phineas Gage]] became one of the first ''lesion case studies'' in 1848 when an explosion drove a large iron rod completely through his head, destroying his left [[frontal lobe]]. He recovered with no apparent sensory, motor, or gross cognitive deficits, but with behaviour so altered that friends described him as "no longer being Gage," suggesting that the damaged areas are involved in "higher functions" such as personality.&lt;ref&gt;Blair., R. (2004) The roles of orbital frontal cortex in the modulation of antisocial behaviour Brain and Cognition 55 pp. 198–208&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gage's mental changes are usually grossly exaggerated in modern presentations.

Subsequent cases (such as [[Broca's area|Broca's patient Tan]]) gave further support to the doctrine of specialization.

== Major theories of the brain ==
Currently, there are two major theories of the brain's cognitive function. The first is the theory of modularity. Stemming from phrenology, this theory supports functional specialization, suggesting the brain has different modules that are domain specific in function. The second theory, distributive processing, proposes that the brain is more interactive and its regions are functionally interconnected rather than specialized. Each orientation  plays a role within certain aims and tend to complement each other (see below section `Collaboration´).

=== Modularity ===
The theory of modularity suggests that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain that are domain specific for different cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=caramazza&gt;Caramazza, A., Coltheart, M. Cognitive Neuropsychology twenty years on. Cognitive Neuropsychology. Psychology Press. 23(1), 3–12. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]] expanded the initial notion of phrenology by creating his Modularity of the Mind theory. The Modularity of the Mind theory indicates that distinct neurological regions called [[modules]] are defined by their functional roles in cognition. He also rooted many of his concepts on modularity back to philosophers like Descartes, who wrote about the mind being composed of "organs" or "psychological faculties". An example of Fodor's concept of modules is seen in cognitive processes such as vision, which have many separate mechanisms for colour, shape and spatial perception.&lt;ref name=fodor&gt;Fodor, J. A. (1983). The Modularity of the Mind. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (pg 2–47)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fundamental beliefs of domain specificity and the theory of modularity suggests that it is a consequence of [[natural selection]] and is a feature of our cognitive architecture. Researchers Hirschfeld and Gelman propose that because the human mind has evolved by natural selection, it implies that enhanced functionality would develop if it produced an increase in "fit" behaviour. Research on this evolutionary perspective suggests that domain specificity is involved in the development of cognition because it allows one to pinpoint adaptive problems.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, L. A., Gelman, S. A. (1994) Mapping the Mind: Domain specificity in cognition and culture. Cambridge University Press pg 37–169&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue for the modular theory of cognitive neuroscience is that there are cortical anatomical differences from person to person. Although many studies of modularity are undertaken from very specific lesion case studies, the idea is to create a neurological function map that applies to people in general. To extrapolate from lesion studies and other case studies this requires adherence to the ''universality assumption'', that there is no difference, in a qualitative sense, between subjects who are intact neurologically. For example, two subjects would fundamentally be the same neurologically before their lesions, and after have distinctly different cognitive deficits. Subject 1 with a lesion in the "A" region of the brain may show impaired functioning in cognitive ability "X" but not "Y", while subject 2 with a lesion in area "B" demonstrates reduced "Y" ability but "X" is unaffected; results like these allow inferences to be made about brain specialization and localization, also known as using a [[double dissociation]].&lt;ref name=caramazza /&gt;

The difficulty with this theory is that in typical non-lesioned subjects, locations within the brain anatomy are similar but not completely identical. There is a strong defense for this inherent deficit in our ability to generalize when using functional localizing techniques (fMRI, PET etc.). To account for this problem, the coordinate-based ''[[Talairach#Talairach_coordinates|Talairach]] and Tournoux stereotaxic system'' is widely used to compare subjects' results to a standard brain using an algorithm. Another solution using coordinates involves comparing brains using [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcal]] reference points. A slightly newer technique is to use functional [[landmark point|landmarks]], which combines sulcal and gyral landmarks (the groves and folds of the cortex) and then finding an area well known for its modularity such as the [[fusiform face area]]. This landmark area then serves to orient the researcher to the neighboring cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Saxe, R., Brett, M., Kanwisher, N. Divide and conquer: A defense of functional localizers. Neuroimage. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Future developments for modular theories of neuropsychology may lie in "modular psychiatry". The concept is that a modular understanding of the brain and advanced neuro-imaging techniques will allow for a more empirical diagnosis of mental and emotional disorders. There has been some work done towards this extension of the modularity theory with regards to the physical neurological differences in subjects with depression and schizophrenia, for example. Zielasek and Gaeble have set out a list of requirements in the field of neuropsychology in order to move towards neuropsychiatry:

# To assemble a complete overview of putative modules of the human mind
# To establish module-specific diagnostic tests (specificity, sensitivity, reliability)
# To assess how far individual modules, sets of modules or their connections are affected in certain psychopathological situations
# To probe novel module-specific therapies like the facial affect recognition training or to retrain access to context information in the case of delusions and hallucinations, in which "hyper-modularity" may play a role &lt;ref&gt;Zielasek, J., Gaeble W. (2008) Modern modularity and the road towards modular psychiatry. Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 258, 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the study of brain function can also be applied to [[cognitive behaviour therapy]]. As therapy becomes increasingly refined, it is important to differentiate cognitive processes in order to discover their relevance towards different patient treatments. An example comes specifically from studies on lateral specialization between the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The functional specialization of these hemispheres are offering insight on different forms of cognitive behaviour therapy methods, one focusing on verbal cognition (the main function of the left hemisphere) and the other emphasizing imagery or spatial cognition (the main function of the right hemisphere).&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;Tucker, D.M., Shearer, S.L., and Murray, J.D. (1977). Hemispheric Specialization and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Cognitive Therapy and Research, VoL 1, pp. 263–273&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of therapies that involve imagery, requiring right hemisphere activity in the brain, include [[systematic desensitization]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldfried, M. R. Systematic desensitization as training in self-control. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 1971, 37, 228–234.&lt;/ref&gt; and anxiety management training.&lt;ref&gt;Suinn, R. M., &amp; Richardson, F. Anxiety management training: A nonspecific behavior therapy program for anxiety control. Behavior Therapy, 1971, 2, 498–510&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these therapy techniques rely on the patient's ability to use visual imagery to cope with or replace patients symptoms, such as anxiety. Examples of cognitive behaviour therapies that involve verbal cognition, requiring left hemisphere activity in the brain, include self-instructional training&lt;ref name=tucker /&gt; and stress inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;Novaco, R. W. (1977). Stress inoculation: A cognitive therapy for anger and its application to a case of depression. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Vol 45(4), 600–608.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these therapy techniques focus on patients' internal self-statements, requiring them to use vocal cognition. When deciding which cognitive therapy to employ, it is important to consider the primary cognitive style of the patient. Many individuals have a tendency to prefer visual imagery over verbalization and vice versa. One way of figuring out which hemisphere a patient favours is by observing their lateral eye movements. Studies suggest that eye gaze reflects the activation of cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the direction. Thus, when asking questions that require spatial thinking, individuals tend to move their eyes to the left, whereas when asked questions that require verbal thinking, individuals usually move their eyes to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Kocel, K., Galin, D., Ornstein, R., &amp; Merrin, E. L. Lateral eye movements and cognitive mode. Psychonomic Science, 1972, 27, 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, this information allows one to choose the optimal cognitive behaviour therapeutic technique, thereby enhancing the treatment of many patients.

==== Areas representing modularity in the brain ====

=====Fusiform face area=====
One of the most well known examples of functional specialization is the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA). [[Justine Sergent]] was one of the first researchers that brought forth evidence towards the functional neuroanatomy of face processing. Using positron emission tomography (PET), Sergent found that there were different patterns of activation in response to the two different required tasks, face processing verses object processing.&lt;ref name=sergent&gt;Sergent, J., Signoret, J.L. (1992) Functional and anatomical decomposition of face processing: evidence from prosopagnosia and PET study of normal subject. The Royal Society. 335, 55–62&lt;/ref&gt; These results can be linked with her studies of brain-damaged patients with lesions in the occipital and temporal lobes. Patients revealed that there was an impairment of face processing but no difficulty recognizing everyday objects, a disorder also known as prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name=sergent /&gt; Later research by [[Nancy Kanwisher]] using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), found specifically that the region of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior_and_inferior|inferior]] temporal cortex, known as the [[fusiform gyrus]], was significantly more active when subjects viewed, recognized and categorized faces in comparison to other regions of the brain. Lesion studies also supported this finding where patients were able to recognize objects but unable to recognize faces. This provided evidence towards [[domain specificity]] in the visual system, as Kanwisher acknowledges the Fusiform Face Area as a module in the brain, specifically the [[extrastriate cortex]], that is specialized for face perception.&lt;ref&gt;Kanwisher, N., McDermott, J., Chun, M. (1997). The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception. The Journal of Neuroscience, 17(11):4302–4311&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Visual area V4 and V5=====
While looking at the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using PET, researcher [[Semir Zeki]] directly demonstrated functional specialization within the visual cortex known as [[visual modularity]]. He localized regions involved specifically in the perception of colour and vision motion. For colour, [[visual area V4]] was located when subjects were shown two identical displays, one being multicoloured and the other shades of grey.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, S., et al. (1991). A direct demonstration of functional specialization in human visual cortex. United Kingdom, London. Journal of Neuroscience, Vol 11, 641–649&lt;/ref&gt; This was further supported from lesion studies where individuals were unable to see colours after damage, a disorder known as [[achromatopsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman AL, Birch J, Meadows JC (1979) Cerebral color blindness: an acquired defect in hue discrimination. Ann Neurol 5:253–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Combining PET and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), subjects viewing a moving checker board pattern verses a stationary checker board pattern located visual area V5, which is now considered to be specialized for vision motion. (Watson et al., 1993) This area of functional specialization was also supported by lesion study patients who's damage caused cerebral [[motion blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;Zihl J, von Cramon D, Mai N (1983) Selective disturbance of movement vision after bilateral brain damage. Brain 106:3 13–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Frontal lobes=====
Studies have found the [[frontal lobes]] to be involved in the [[executive functions]] of the brain, which are higher level cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;Duncan, J., &amp; Owen, A. (2000). Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands. Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This control process is involved in the coordination, planning and organizing of actions towards an individual's goals. It contributes to such things as one's behaviour, language and reasoning. More specifically, it was found to be the function of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref&gt;Fuster, J. (2008). The Prefrontal Cortex. Elsevier. (pg 178–353)&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence suggest that these executive functions control processes such as planning and decision making, error correction and assisting overcoming habitual responses. Miller and Cummings used PET and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) to further support functional specialization of the frontal cortex. They found lateralization of verbal working memory in the left frontal cortex and visuospatial working memory in the right frontal cortex. Lesion studies support these findings where left frontal lobe patients exhibited problems in controlling executive functions such as creating strategies.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, B., Cummings, J. (2007) The Human Frontal Lobes: Functions and Disorders. The Guilford Press, New York and London.(pg 68–77)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dorsolateral]], [[ventrolateral]] and [[anterior cingulate]] regions within the prefrontal cortex are proposed to work together in different cognitive tasks, which is related to interaction theories. However, there has also been evidence suggesting strong individual specializations within this network.&lt;ref name=duncan /&gt; For instance, Miller and Cummings found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in the manipulation and monitoring of sensorimotor information within working memory.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

=====Right and left hemispheres=====
During the 1960s, [[Roger Sperry]] conducted a natural experiment on epileptic patients who had previously had their corpora callosa cut. The corpus callosum is the area of the brain dedicated to linking both the right and left hemisphere together. Sperry et al.'s experiment was based on flashing images in the right and left visual fields of his participants. Because the participant's corpus callosum was cut, the information processed by each visual field could not be transmitted to the other hemisphere. In one experiment, Sperry flashed images in the right visual field (RVF), which would subsequently be transmitted to the left hemisphere (LH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were fully capable of remembering the image flashed. However, when the participants were then asked to draw what they had seen, they were unable to. When Sperry et al. flashed images in the left visual field (LVF), the information processed would be sent to the right hemisphere (RH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were unable to recall the image flashed, but were very successful in drawing the image. Therefore, Sperry concluded that the left hemisphere of the brain was dedicated to language as the participants could clearly speak the image flashed. On the other hand, Sperry concluded that the right hemisphere of the brain was involved in more creative activities such as drawing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Split Brain Experiments". Nobelprize.org. 4 Oct 2011 http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parahippocampal place area=====
Located in the [[parahippocampal gyrus]], the parahippocampal place area (PPA) was coined by Nancy Kanwisher and Russell Epstein after an fMRI study showed that the PPA responds optimally to scenes presented containing a spatial layout, minimally to single objects and not at all to faces.&lt;ref name=epstien&gt;Epstien, R., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1998). A cortical representation of the local visual environment. Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted in this experiment that activity remains the same in the PPA when viewing a scene with an empty room or a room filled with meaningful objects. Kanwisher and Epstein proposed "that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment".&lt;ref name=epstien /&gt; In addition, Soojin Park and Marvin Chun posited that activation in the PPA is viewpoint specific, and so responds to changes in the angle of the scene. In contrast, another special mapping area, the [[retrosplenial cortex]] (RSC), is viewpoint invariant or does not change response levels when views change.&lt;ref&gt;Park, S., Chun, M. (2009) Different roles of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)in panoramic scene perception. NeuroImage 47, 1747–1756.&lt;/ref&gt; This perhaps indicates a complementary arrangement of functionally and anatomically separate visual processing brain areas.

=====Extrastriate body area=====
Located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex, fMRI studies have shown the extrastriate body area (EBA) to have selective responding when subjects see human bodies or body parts, implying that it has functional specialization. The EBA does not optimally respond to objects or parts of objects but to human bodies and body parts, a hand for example. In fMRI experiments conducted by Downing et al. participants were asked to look at a series of pictures. These stimuli includes objects, parts of objects (for example just the head of a hammer), figures of the human body in all sorts of positions and types of detail (including line drawings or stick men), and body parts (hands or feet) without any body attached. There was significantly more blood flow (and thus activation) to human bodies, no matter how detailed, and body parts than to objects or object parts.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, P., Jiang, Y., Shuman, M., Kanwisher, N. (2001) A cortical area selective for visual processing of the human body. Science, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributive processing ===
The cognitive theory of distributed processing suggests that brain areas are highly interconnected and process information in a distributed manner. 

A remarkable precedent of this orientation is the research of [[Justo Gonzalo]] on brain dynamics &lt;ref name=Dinamica&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1945, 1950, 1952, 2010).

From the gradation he observed between different syndromes in patients with different cortical lesions, this author proposed in 1952 a functional gradients model,&lt;ref name=Grdients&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1952). "Las funciones cerebrales humanas según nuevos datos y bases fisiológicas. Una introducción a los estudios de Dinámica Cerebral". [http://aleph.csic.es/F/4KEBKRYX27PBPSNBJBB5AFPQ8THHNR4941PP69A8C6CMG54DBX-15037?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=000501143 ''Trabajos del Inst. Cajal de Investigaciones Biológicas''] '''XLIV''': pp.&amp;nbsp;95–157. [http://eprints.ucm.es/30931/ Complete English translation, Open Access].&lt;/ref&gt; which permits an ordering and an interpretation of multiple phenomena  and syndromes. The functional gradients are continuous functions through the cortex describing a distributed specificity, so that, for a given sensory system, the specific gradient, of contralateral character, is maximum in the corresponding projection area and decreases in gradation  towards more "central" zone and beyond so that the final decline reaches other primary areas.
As a consequence of the crossing and overlapping of the specific gradients, in the central zone where the overlap is greater, there would be an action of mutual integration, rather nonspecific (or  [[:en:Multisensory integration|multisensory]]) with bilateral character due to the [[corpus callosum]].  This action would be maximum in the central zone and minimal towards the projection areas. As the author stated (p. 20 of the English translation&lt;ref name=Grdients&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) "a functional continuity with regional variation is then offered, each point of the cortex acquiring different properties but with certain unity with the rest of the cortex. It is a dynamic conception of ''quantitative'' localizations".
A very similar gradients scheme was proposed by Elkhonon Goldberg in 1989 &lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;Goldberg, E. (1989). "Gradiental approach to neocortical functional organization". ''J. Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology'' '''11'''  489-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers who provide evidence to support the theory of distributive processing include Anthony McIntosh and William Uttal, who question and debate localization and modality specialization within the brain.
McIntosh's research suggests that human cognition involves interactions between the brain regions responsible for processes sensory information, such as vision, audition, and other mediating areas like the prefrontal cortex. McIntosh explains that modularity is mainly observed in sensory and motor systems, however, beyond these very receptors, modularity becomes "fuzzier" and you see the cross connections between systems increase.&lt;ref name=mcintosh&gt;McIntosh, A. R. (1999). Mapping Cognition to the Brain Through Neural Interactions. University of Toronto, Canada. Psychology Press, 523–548&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrates that there is an overlapping of functional characteristics between the sensory and motor systems, where these regions are close to one another. These different neural interactions influence each other, where activity changes in one area influence other connected areas. With this, McIntosh suggest that if you only focus on activity in one area, you may miss the changes in other integrative areas.&lt;ref name=mcintosh /&gt; Neural interactions can be measured using [[analysis of covariance]] in [[neuroimaging]]. McIntosh used this analysis to convey a clear example of the interaction theory of distributive processing. In this study, subjects learned that an auditory stimulus signalled a visual event. McIntosh found activation (an increase blood flow), in an area of the [[occipital cortex]], a region of the brain involved in visual processing,&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, S. (1993). A vision of the brain. Cambridge, MA, US: Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Correlations between the occipital cortex and different areas of the brain such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[premotor cortex]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|superior]] [[temporal cortex]] showed a pattern of co-variation and functional connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, A. R., Cabeza, R. E., and Lobaugh, N., J. (1998). Analysis of Neural Interactions Explains the Activation of Occipital Cortex by an Auditory Stimulus. The Journal of Neurophysiology Vol. 80 No. 5, pp. 2790–2796&lt;/ref&gt;

Uttal focusses on the limits of localizing cognitive processes in the brain. One of his main arguments is that since the late 90's, research in [[cognitive neuroscience]] has forgotten about conventional [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] studies based on behavioural observation. He believes that current research focusses on the technological advances of brain imaging techniques such as [[MRI]] and [[PET scans]]. Thus, he further suggest that this research is dependent on the assumptions of localization and hypothetical cognitive modules that use such imaging techniques to pursuit these assumptions. Uttal's major concern incorporates many controversies with the validly, over-assumptions and strong inferences some of these images are trying to illustrate. For instance, there is concern over the proper utilization of control images in an experiment. Most of the [[cerebrum]] is active during cognitive activity, therefore the amount of increased activity in a region must be greater when compared to a controlled area. In general, this may produce false or exaggerated findings and may increase potential tendency to ignore regions of diminished activity which may be crucial to the particular cognitive process being studied.&lt;ref name=uttal&gt;Uttal, W. R. (2002). Précis of The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain. Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Uttal believes that localization researchers tend to ignore the complexity of the nervous system. Many regions in the brain are physically interconnected in a nonlinear system, hence, Uttal believes that behaviour is produced by a variety of system organizations.&lt;ref name=uttal /&gt;

===Collaboration===
The two theories, modularity and distributive processing, can also be combined. By operating simultaneously, these principles may interact with each other in a collaborative effort to characterize the functioning of the brain. Fodor himself, one of the major contributors to the modularity theory, appears to have this sentiment. He noted that modularity is a matter of degrees, and that the brain is modular to the extent that it warrants studying it in regards to its functional specialization.&lt;ref name=fodor /&gt; Although there are areas in the brain that are more specialized for cognitive processes than others, the nervous system also integrates and connects the information produced in these regions.  In fact, the proposed distributive scheme of the functional cortical  gradientes by [[Justo Gonzalo|J. Gonzalo]]&lt;ref name=Grdients/&gt; already tries to join both concepts modular and distributive: regional heterogeneity should be a definitive acquisition (maximum specificity in the projection paths and primary areas), but  the rigid separation between projection and association areas would be erased through the continuous functions of gradient.

The collaboration between the two theories not only would provide a more unified perception and understanding of the world but also make available the ability to learn from it.

[[Australian rules football]] is a sport played in many countries around the world at amateur level only.  In 2016, about 106,000 people played in structured competitions outside of Australia and at least 20 leagues that are recognised by the game's governing body, exist outside Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/GameDevelopment/International/tabid/285/Default.aspx AFL International Development] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305000000/http://www.afl.com.au/GameDevelopment/International/tabid/285/Default.aspx |date=5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 there was a total of 34,845 players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf AFL International Census 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524130530/http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, there are over 800,000 players in Australia where the game is at its strongest; overseas players make up less than 2% of the total players worldwide.

Australian rules football is played professionally by men and women in Australia and is a major spectator sport in Australia and [[Nauru]].

== Players of Australian rules football ==
There have been several [[List of overseas-born AFL players|players in the VFL/AFL who were born outside Australia]] and since 1982, an increasing number of players have been recruited from outside Australia through initiatives such as the [[Irish experiment]] and more recently, international scholarship programs.  Despite the amateur competitions outside of Australia, no player from these competitions has yet debuted in the AFL Premiership Season.  Some have, however, featured in semi-professional competitions in Australia as well as in AFL pre-season practice matches. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The international growth of Australian rules in the 19th century and early 20th century was rapid, but it went into rapid decline following World War I.  After World War II, the sport experienced a small amount of growth in the Pacific region, particularly in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].

Australian Football emerged as an international sport much later than other forms of football, such as soccer or rugby, but has grown substantially as an amateur sport in some countries since the 1980s.  Initially, the sport grew with the [[Australian diaspora]], [[List of overseas-born AFL players|aided by multiculturalism]] and assisted by [[Australian football exhibition matches|exhibition matches]] and [[Players who have converted from one football code to another|players who have converted to and from other football codes]].  In Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States, there are many thousands of players.  Canada, Japan, Denmark, and Sweden have also shown strong potential in the sport in the lead up to the [[2008 Australian Football International Cup]].

The AFL became the de facto international governing body for the sport when created the ''AFL International Development Committee'' and the IAFC was dissolved between 2002 and 2006.

Australian Football is played professionally by men, in Australia, and is the dominant spectator sport, with the exception of [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition games]] staged in other countries.

The game is played in many countries, the [[Australian Football League]] and has more than 13 affiliated international governing bodies, [[AFL Canada]], [[Danish Australian Football League]], [[BARFL]], [[AFL Japan]], [[ARFLI]], [[Nauru Australian Football Association]], [[New Zealand AFL]], [[USAFL]], [[AFL South Africa]], [[AFL PNG]], [[AFL Samoa]], [[Tonga Australian Football Association]] and [[AFL Germany]]. The league also has working relationships with bodies in additional countries, who have sent, or may in future send, teams to the International Cup. In 2010, a European association of 18 Countries was founded which later re-branded as [http://www.afleurope.org AFL Europe]. This association is affiliated to the Australian Football League, which funds the retention of a regional manager in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==History of Australian rules football within Australia==
{{see also|Barassi Line}}
{{see also|History of Australian rules football}}
Australian rules football traditionally has seen its greatest support in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]].

Prior to the establishment of the AFL in 1990, leagues were generally state-specific, with the [[Victorian Football League]] slowly beginning to expand prior to this point.

Since becoming a national league, the AFL has continued its attempt to grow in the rest of Australia, with the success of teams in those areas helping to fuel interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglass|first1=Mark|title=GWS Giants' AFL success being felt at all levels of Aussie Rules in Western Sydney|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-18/giant-tide-rising-in-sydneys-west/8720542|publisher=ABC.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Australian rules outside Australia==

===Early beginnings===
Almost as soon as the game was becoming established in Australia, it had spread to [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]], initially because of the [[Otago Gold Rush]] and [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]].  The game was further fuelled in South Africa by Australian soldiers in the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s.

There were reports of early competitions in England, Scotland, and [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]], started by expatriate Australians and servicemen.

===The First World Governing Body and international competition===
In New Zealand, where proximity to Australia saw a formidable league, the sport quickly grew to a sizeable 115 clubs by the turn of the 20th century.  As the game spread, it became known as ''Australasian Football'', with delegates from New Zealand added to the newly formed Australasian Football Council.

In 1908, New Zealand defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the '''Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival''', an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football.

===Decline and hiatus===
World War I saw the game being played by Australian servicemen around the world, particularly in Egypt, and in Europe in France, Belgium, and England.

Following the war, the game went into a sharp decline outside of Australia, with all international domestic competitions dying out. National teams and international competition in the sport became non-existent for three quarters of the 20th century. The return of many Australian expatriates from overseas gold fields and tours of duty, combined with Australia's low profile on the world stage, offered few opportunities for the game to grow during this time. With the withdrawal of its New Zealand delegates, the sport returned to the title of ''Australian Football'', governed by the Australian Football Council. Concerned primarily with the growth of their own domestic competitions, the Australian leagues and governing bodies made little effort to develop or promote the game until the 1950s, and the council's role was mainly to oversee the growing importance of [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|interstate test matches]].

Nevertheless, the longest running fixture outside of Australia, the annual Varsity match between [[Oxford University Australian Rules Football Club]] and [[Cambridge University]] in England, has been held since 1921, and has emerged into a fierce rivalry, worthy of [[University Sporting Blue|half-blue status]] at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2005wk7/Sport/triumphant_oxford_are_rucking_great |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820202818/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2005wk7/Sport/triumphant_oxford_are_rucking_great |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Triumphant Oxford are rucking great from oxfordstudent.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from this match, however the game was rarely played in England.

===Return of Oceania football===
[[Image:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Action from an Aussie Rules game in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]] at the [[Linkbelt Oval]]]]
Australian Football has been continuously played in the former Australian [[League of Nations mandate|trustee mandate]] of [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], which began both senior and junior local competitions in the 1930s.  Australian Football was also introduced to the [[Territory of New Guinea]] in 1944 and the [[Territory of Papua]] in 1948.

[[World War II]] saw some servicemen play the game overseas, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Algeria.  During the [[Vietnam War]], matches were even played by servicemen against the local Vietnamese.

In the 1960s, Australian leagues began to show some interest in expansion of the game outside of Australia.  1963 saw the first [[Australian rules football exhibition matches]] played in the United States.  Australian state leagues began occasionally promoting themselves in this way over the following decades.

In 1967, it was reported in the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] Record's "Footy Facts" column that Australian football clubs existed in [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Cape Town]] and that the VFL was optimistic about the future of the game in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;AFL Record.  Round 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of how or when these clubs had formed or what later became of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Since 1967, there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules. In 1984, the first official representative matches of [[International rules football]] were played, and these games have continued to be played annually each October, now attracting considerable public interest, drawing sizable crowds, and receiving regular television coverage. New Zealand resumed a local competition in 1974.

By 1975, Papua New Guinea had gained independence and test matches began to be played against teams from Australia.  The first ever full international match involving Australia was played in 1977 at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea in Adelaide, with Australia taking the honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1977-1980 | work=Full Points Footy | url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/1977_to_1980.htm | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, Australia have been peerless in the sport and seldom compete at international level.

Despite these advancements and others to the international aspects of the game, progress overseas is rarely covered in the [[Media of Australia|Australian media]].

===1980s and '90s===
In the late 1980s, successful VFL exhibition matches attracted large crowds and spawned fledgling local competitions in both Japan and Canada.  The Australian media showed only a token interest in the matches in London and Japan involving VFL clubs.  It was during this decade that the sport was first televised in North America and the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some nationalities respond well to less formal means,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, and many trends in sporting activities are achieved outside formally organized programs.  For instance, although Australian football was not formally established in Tonga until 2003 however informal matches had been introduced to schools as early as 1985.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Game spreads===
The largest barriers to growth of Australian Football internationally have traditionally been distance, field availability, and player numbers.  With a total of 36 players normally required for a game, and a cricket sized oval, organising games can be difficult in countries where space is a premium and devotees are spread widely.  While these factors have not been a problem in Papua New Guinea or New Zealand, they did pose large problems to leagues in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.  This disadvantage has been turned into an advantage with some organisers accepting modified versions of the game, such as [[Variations of Australian rules football#9-a-side|nine-a-side]], requiring fewer players and less space.

In the late 1980s, as organisers adapted, amateur leagues were established in [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]] (1987), [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Australian rules football in Denmark|Denmark]], and [[Australian rules football in Canada|Canada]] (1989).  In the case of Japan and Canada, these were directly sparked by VFL exhibition matches.

In the 1990s, the Australian diaspora had spread and amateur competition had grown in countries such as [[Australian rules football in Sweden|Sweden]] (1993), [[Australian rules football in Germany|Germany]] (1995), the [[Australian rules football in the United States|USA]] (1996), [[Australian rules football in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Australian rules football in Spain|Spain]],  [[Australian rules football in Samoa|Samoa]] (1997), and [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] (1998), as well as a number of mainly expatriate teams, mainly based in [[South East Asia]].

During this time, the VFL expanded to become the AFL and began to command a greater national and international audience.  Word of the sport grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television followings, and Internet communication.  [[North America]]n fans formed an organisation, [[AFANA]], specifically to work for improved media coverage of Australian Football.

The traditionalists in the governing bodies of Australia (which became the AFL) were reluctant to sanction any games which were not played exactly according to the Laws of the Game, and the AFL initially did not recognise leagues that played the game on fields that did not closely match the proper dimensions, or had less than 16 players per side. Since the 1990s, these attitudes have changed somewhat, and the AFL and other development bodies have directly contributed to the development of the game overseas.

===Formation of a world governing body===
The [[International Australian Football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after football first featured at the [[Arafura Games]] in 1995. Since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several junior teams from other countries.

Since 2000, fledgling competitions have been established in countries such as [[Australian rules football in Ireland|Ireland]] (2000), [[Australian rules football in Tonga|Tonga]] (2002), [[Australian rules football in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Australian rules football in France|France]], and [[Australian rules football in China|China]] (2005). Television and the internet have since helped to increase the awareness of the game outside of Australia.

Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the IAFC and the AFL.  The first International Cup also marked the beginnings of a very small media interest in the international aspects of the game in Australia.

At the 2002 International Cup, meetings held between the AFL, IAFC, and international teams saw a unanimous vote amongst member countries that the AFL become the ''de facto'' world governing body for the sport, with the leagues linked to the teams affiliating with the AFL.  The IAFC's public relations officer, Brian Clarke, disputed this move and continued the organisation in name.  This organisation was finally dissolved in 2005, dropping all public claims to being the world governing body for the sport and being replaced by the development organisation Aussie Rules International.

===21st century===
In recent years, the game has grown particularly strongly in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.  In  percentage terms, their increases are high in comparison to the growth of the sport in Australia, and their total player numbers are at least 100,000, making senior competition involving Australia at open level unlikely for some time.

In 2004, a volunteer group known as World Footy News&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com World Footy News]&lt;/ref&gt; began documenting the growth of Australian football internationally through their website, becoming a major source of international football news, and for the first time providing a source of detailed coverage for the International Cups (2005 and 2008).  Its website states that it "was created to foster awareness of Australian Football around the globe and to aid communication between clubs, leagues and individuals playing and supporting Aussie Rules".  At various times between 2004 and 2007, other regularly updated sources included OziRulzGlobal, Fourth Quarter, and with slowly improving quantity, an International Leagues section of the AFL website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au AFL website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after eight years of growing domestic competition, the South African government declared Australian Football to be the sport for "the new South Africa", injecting government funding into the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1296562.htm South Africa embraces Australian Rules football]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Australian rules football in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Australian rules football in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Australian rules football in Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Australian rules football in Croatia|Croatia]], Norway, [[Australian rules football in Bermuda|Bermuda]] and [[Australian rules football in East Timor|East Timor]] joined the list of playing nations.

On 3 July 2006, the AFL announced that it had formed an International Development Committee to support overseas leagues. The AFL hopes to develop the game in other countries to the point where Australian football is played at an international level by top-quality sides from around the world. The AFL plans to host the International Cup regularly every three or four years, beginning in 2008, the 150th anniversary of the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFL International Development plans | work=World Footy News | url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=2006063006252654 | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the AFL's interest in the internationalisation of the game, coverage in the Australian media grew substantially.

On 14 April 2007, the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] Under 17 squad competed against the [[South African national Australian rules football team]] in the first international match between the two countries at [[North West Cricket Stadium]] in [[Potchefstroom]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20070418011543665 Aussie talent all class on African footy's big day] from worldfootynews.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians won  by a score of 162-12.  In the same month, a massive junior program called "FootyWILD", similar to Auskick, was launched in the country.

On 25 April 2013, the first premiership match outside of Australia was held at [[Westpac Stadium]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, between the Sydney Swans and the St Kilda Saints, and attracted a crowd of over 22,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8598398/AFL-boys-put-on-show-for-new-Wellington-fans Fairfax NZ News - AFL boys put on show for new Wellington fans]&lt;/ref&gt; In the two subsequent years crowds at this event dwindled, and the matches in New Zealand were scrapped after 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-27/no-new-zealand-games-in-2016-as-saints-kiwi-push-teeters-on-the-brink&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competition==
{{See also|List of International Australian rules football Tournaments}}
The first truly international competitor in Australian Football was New Zealand.  In 1908, the Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australian rules football.  New Zealand (then representing a total of 115 clubs) defeated both New South Wales and Queensland in the carnival, but lost to Victoria and Tasmania.

The 1995 [[Arafura Games]], held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]], Australia became the first international sporting event to have Australian football as a competition sport, rather than a [[demonstration sport]]. [[Papua New Guinea]] won the [[gold medal]] and retained it in subsequent games.  Other teams that have competed at Australian Rules in the games include Japan, [[Nauru]], and a Northern Territory indigenous team.  The [[International Australian football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after the 1995 Games.&lt;ref name="Cup"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;docID=SAG020811FMO5D5J30JN|title=World Game Steps Up To The Mark|first=Peter |last=Hanlon|date=11 August 2002|work=The Sunday Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was [[2002 Australian Football International Cup|held in Melbourne in 2002]], as the last act of the IAFC, and held in conjunction with the AFL. The 2002 cup was contested by eleven teams from around the world, made up exclusively of non-Australians.&lt;ref name="Cup"/&gt;  Ireland won, defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final.

In the interim years, Japan and New Zealand played an annual game as a curtain raiser to the AFL games. The New Zealand national team were victorious by 100 points in 2003, and so, in 2004, a club side from [[Auckland]] played the game, which Japan lost by two points.  The amateur [[Australian Convicts]] also toured, playing several matches against sides from developing nations.

The second Australian Football International Cup [[2005 Australian Football International Cup|was held in Melbourne in 2005]], again under the guidance and funding of the AFL, with New Zealand defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final. Third place went to the [[United States of America]].

In 2001 The United States, Great Britain, Denmark and Ireland competed in the Atalantic Alliance Cup. This was fore runner to other European competitions starting with the EU Cup which became the Euro Cup and also the Central European Australian Football league Championships .

In 2006, Denmark, Sweden and Germany competed in a tri-nations series, which was planned to be repeated annually.

The third [[2008 Australian Football International Cup|Australian Football International Cup]] was held in 2008 by the AFL in Melbourne, with a record 16 teams competing. Papua New Guinea won their first title, defeating New Zealand, and South Africa controversially defeated Ireland by 1 point to finish third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20080906151723980 Controversial finish as South Africa defeat Ireland after the siren]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth [[2011 Australian Football International Cup|Australian Football International Cup]] was held in 2011 by the AFL in Melbourne and Sydney, with a record 18 teams competing. Ireland won their second title by defeating Papua New Guinea who have appeared in every AFL International Cup grand final.

Other international competitions that included some  Australian expatriates are also held, including the [[EU Cup]], which [[2005 EU Cup Australian rules football|was first held in 2005 in London]], featuring ten teams. In 2007 the Cup [[2007 EU Cup Australian rules football|was held in Hamburg]], with twelve teams.

In 2013 the East Asia Australian Football League was formed  with Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Jakarta and Laos competing. 
Also the South China Australian Football League consists of three teams from Hong Kong, Macau, Landau and Gangzhou.

===World rankings===
{{main article|Australian Football International Cup#Overall tournament results}}

Although the AFL is regarded as the world governing body, it does not publish statistics for matches that it does not specifically sanction. By 2009, the only attempt to consolidate all world rankings was created by the [http://www.worldfootynews.com World Footy News website], which for 2008 listed 22 countries, from Australia (1st) through to India (22nd). Detailed criteria were given as to whether a country qualified for consideration, though ultimately the rankings were listed as unofficial, and are only noteworthy because of the lack of any other system. [http://www.worldfootynews.com/staticpages/index.php/World_Rankings_2008 The unofficial 2008 Australian Football World Rankings].

=== International rules Australia vs Ireland ===

A series of hybrid [[International rules]] matches between the [[Australian Football League]]'s best professional players and a representative [[Gaelic football]] team from Ireland's [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] amateur players is staged annually.  The rules are a compromise between the two codes, using a round ball and a rectangular field.  The fierce [[tackle (football move)|tackling]] of the Australian code is allowed, although this has caused controversy with the Irish players. The series have remained evenly matched with the Irish using speed and athleticism, and the Australians strength and power — both inherent skills in their respective codes.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== International promotion, funding &amp; governance ==
The [[International Australian football Council]] (IAFC) was formed in 1995 by a subset of playing countries to promote and develop Australian football internationally, before unanimously dissolving in favour of the AFL in 2002.

Australian football is not yet considered large enough internationally for a [[FIFA]] style governing body, so the [[Australian Football League]] is primarily responsible for funding and governance.  In the mid-2000s, it provided around $30 million for development of the game in Australia and around [[Australian dollar|A$]]500,000 annually for international development, with the following breakdown in 2005:

*New Zealand $150,000
*South Africa $100,000
*United States of America $90,000
*Papua New Guinea $45,000
*Other $115,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2005/08/13/1123353542237.html Union in Aussie rules] by Caroline Wilson from the Age 14 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Including AFL exhibition and NAB Cup matches, indigenous and AIS youth tours, International Cup funding and staff funding, this will have risen to around [[Australian dollar|A$]]2,000,000 annually by 2008.  Additional support for countries such as South Africa is leveraged through contacts with industry, and is increasingly adding to the total investment.

Much of the additional international promotion of the game is fuelled by exhibition matches, expatriate Australians, local leagues, and various [[AusAID]] projects.  The internet is seen as a key tool in keeping diverse Australian football communities in contact.

===High profile advocates===
Although international football has a low profile within Australia, the issue is getting increased media exposure as several high-profile Australians have become advocates for international football.  Former players and coaches that are involved in, have expressed interest in or are passionate about international footy at some stage include [[Ron Barassi]], [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]], [[Jim Stynes]], [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]], [[Robert DiPierdomenico]], [[Michael Long (footballer)|Michael Long]], [[Garry Lyon]], [[Peter Schwab]], [[Guy McKenna]], [[Glenn Archer]], [[Jason McCartney (footballer)|Jason McCartney]], [[Wayne Schwass]], and [[Mal Michael]].  Current players who have expressed views or interest on the topic include [[David Rodan]], [[Alipate Carlile]], [[Jimmy Bartel]], [[Jason Akermanis]], [[Aaron Edwards]], and [[Brad Moran (footballer)|Brad Moran]].  Former AFL players [[Mark Zanotti]] and [[John Ironmonger]] have been directly involved in living and establishing clubs overseas. Other non-players such as [[John So]], [[Eddie McGuire]], and [[Tiffany Cherry]] have also expressed interest in the media about the game being played or watched overseas.

==Women's competitions==
[[Image:Women's marking contest mark.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Women's Australian rules football]]
Australia has had many women's leagues at both state and local level for decades. The first semi-professional women's Australian football league, the [[AFL Women's|AFLW]] was founded in late 2016, after the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] had conducted [[AFL Women's#Women's exhibition games (2013–2016)|several exhibition matches]] over the previous few years. The inaugural season, held in [[2017 AFL Women's season|2017]] was considered a huge success by the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] and the league intends to expand from eight teams to 14 by the 2020 season.

Internationally, women's Australian football is played at amateur level in several countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, North America and parts of Europe and Asia. and a dozen teams have represented their nations at one or more [[Australian Football International Cup]] since [[2011 Australian Football International Cup#Women's Fixtures|2011]]. Ireland and Canada have dominated thus far, being the only teams to contest the women's grand final in the competition. Ireland's team, nicknamed the Banshees, are the most recent winners, defeating Canada by just four points in the grand final of the [[2017 Australian Football International Cup#Women's Tournament|2017 tournament]].

== Junior competitions==
Several countries now have youth Australian rules programs in place. These countries include [[Papua New Guinea]], New Zealand, [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], [[Nauru]], Denmark, [[South Africa]], England, [[Indonesia]], the United States, and Canada. The number of participants is quite high in PNG, RSA and NZ generally dependent on the level of AFL funding but some "private" endeavours in Canada and the UK have produced significant results.

Since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the Australian Football League as part of its International Policy, has hosted several of these nation's representative youth teams.

The first fully representative junior international Australian football outside of Australia was played between England and Denmark in Farum, Denmark, in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFL Roller Coaster Ride for Danes on the International Front | work=World Footy News | url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20060919061738283 | accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jakarta Bulldogs Australian Football Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianrulesfootball.com.au/pages/aflindonesiaas#JAKARTA%20BULLDOGS]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2006 by Alf Eddy, was an Australian Football Club made up of Under 18-year-old expatriate and local students in Jakarta. The team played against local teams such as the Pancawati Eagles, Depok Garudas, and the Jakarta Bintangs, and also travelled to Singapore and Malaysia in 2008 and 2009, respectively, for the Asian Australian Football Championships. The Bulldogs won the competition in both years.
Currently there is an increasing number of junior international Australian Football notably, North America, Scandinavia and the Pacific.

==Specific development projects==

===South African AusAID project===
An [[AusAID]] funded project is South African junior development began in 2003, which is assisted by aid agency [[Australian Volunteers International]] in partnership with programs such as AFL [[Auskick]], and sponsored by [[Tattersalls (gambling organisation)|Tattersalls]] as well as the South African North West Academy of Sport.

====Aussie Rules Schools (England)====
Another funded junior project is Aussie Rules Schools UK, which is funded by [[Sport England]] and co-ordinated by AFL England and AFL Europe.  This project has seen up to ten English schools adopt Aussie Rules as part of the school curriculum to combat obesity.

====China AusAID project====
In February 2006, a joint project between the AFL, [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Melbourne City Council]], and AusAID to post an Australian Youth Ambassador in [[Tianjin]], a city of 10 million, about {{convert|120|km}} southeast of [[Beijing]] in an effort to kickstart Australian Football in China was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/footy/common/story_page/0,8033,18039362%5E20322,00.html Melbourne's China experiment a reality] by Brett Northey for World Footy News. 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific AusAID projects====
There have been full-time development officers in [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]], as part of [[AusAid]] projects, since 2005.

==International drafts and converts==

===International players===
[[Michito Sakaki]] from Japan became the first international player to play at AFL level when selected to play for the [[Essendon Football Club]] against the [[Sydney Swans]] at an exhibition match at [[North Sydney Oval]] in February 2006. [[Mike Pyke]], a former Canadian rugby player, was drafted to the [[Sydney Swans]] in 2009, and played his first game in Round 7 of 2009 against Geelong, becoming the first non-Irish international player to play an official league game.

===Converts===
{{See also|List of Football Code Converts}}

====Gaelic converts to Australian football====
Australia has recruited several Irish Gaelic footballers to play Aussie Rules.  As Gaelic football is primarily an amateur competition and the AFL competition is professional, there is a strong financial lure.  In the 1980s, the [[Melbourne Football Club]] recruited [[Jim Stynes]], who would turn out to be the most successful Irish player in the history of the VFL/AFL, winning the [[Brownlow medal]].  At around the same time, the club recruited the Scot [[Sean Wight]].  In more recent years, the [[Sydney Swans]] recruited Irishman [[Tadhg Kennelly]], who played in a premiership with the club and has also represented Ireland against Australia.  [[Carlton Football Club]] experimented with brothers [[Setanta Ó hAilpín]] and [[Aisake Ó hAilpín]].  The [[Collingwood Football Club]] has recruited Martin Clarke, and the [[Brisbane Lions]] recruited [[Colm Begley]] and [[Brendan Quigley]] to their international rookie list.  Due to increasing concern from the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], in 2006 the AFL made a deal with the GAA to limit the number of junior Gaelic drafts.

====Australian football converts to American football (Gridiron)====
{{See also|Australian sportsmen linked to professional American Football}}
Australia has exported players to the [[NFL]].  Since the 1980s, many AFL players have tried out as American football [[Punter (football)|punters]]. The [[Special teams#Special teams|special teams]] position requires the long range kicking skills often used by Australian football players, particularly those playing [[centre half-forward]] and [[full-forward]].  Although the punter position is one of the least valuable on an NFL team, punters and kickers have an average salary of around US$860,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0807/nfl.average.salaries.by.position/content.10.html NFL's Average Salaries By Position: Punter/Kicker $868,005], ''Sports Illustrated''&lt;/ref&gt; which surpasses the wages of AFL players, who average A$221,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=90746 Average player salary tops $221,000], ''AFL.com'', 19 March 2010. Retrieved 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As the position is less physically demanding, it has also become attractive for players heading into retirement.

A glossary of terms relating to [[Cost estimate|construction cost estimating]].

__NOTOC__
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

== A ==
* '''Allocation''' of costs is the transfer of costs from one cost item to one or more other cost items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Allowance (money)|Allowance]]''' - a value in an estimate to cover the cost of known but not yet fully defined work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''As-sold estimate''' - the estimate which matches the agreed items and price for the project scope.

== B ==
* '''Basis of estimate (BOE)''' - a document which describes the scope basis, pricing basis, methods, qualifications, assumptions, inclusions, and exclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition Americal Society of Professional Estimators|year=2004|publisher=BNI Building News|isbn=1-55701-481-7|pages=121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bill of materials]] (BOM)''' - a list of materials required for the construction of a project or part of a project, which may include quantities.
* '''[[Bill of quantities]] (BOQ)''' - a document used in tendering in the construction industry in which materials, parts, and labor (and their costs) are itemized. It also (ideally) details the terms and conditions of the construction or repair contract and itemises all work to enable a contractor to price the work for which he or she is bidding.
* '''Bond''' - usually refers to a [[Performance Bond|performance bond]], which is a [[surety bond]] issued by an insurance company or a bank to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a contractor.  Other types of guarantees, such as a [[bid bond]] or a materials bond, are sometimes also required by a project owner.

== C ==
* '''[[Chart of accounts]] (Code of accounts) (COA)''' - a created list of the accounts used by a business entity to define each class of items for which money or the equivalent is spent or received. It is used to organize the finances of the entity and to segregate expenditures, revenue, assets and liabilities in order to give interested parties a better understanding of the financial health of the entity.
* '''City cost index''' - see: Location cost index. RSMeans publishes a city cost index table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waier|first=Philip|title=Building Construction Cost Data|year=2013|edition=71st annual |publisher=RSMeans|isbn=978-1-936335-56-5|pages=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Construction]]''' is a process that consists of the creation, modification, or demolition of facilities, buildings, civil and monumental works, and infrastructure.
* '''Construction cost''' - the total cost to construct a project. This value usually does not include the preplanning, site or right of way acquisition, or design costs, and may not include start-up and commissioning costs. This total or subtotal is usually identified as such in an estimate report. Also known as Total Estimated Contract Cost (TECC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition Americal Society of Professional Estimators|year=2004|publisher=BNI Building News|isbn=1-55701-481-7|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Consumables]]''' are goods that, according to the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary, are capable of being consumed; that may be destroyed, dissipated, wasted, or spent (also known as consumable goods, nondurable goods, or soft goods). In construction, these may include such materials as weld rod, fasteners, tape, glue, etc.
* '''[[Cost contingency|Contingency]]''' - When estimating the cost for a project, product or other item or investment, there is always uncertainty as to the precise content of all items in the estimate, how work will be performed, what work conditions will be like when the project is executed and so on. These uncertainties are risks to the project. Some refer to these risks as "known-unknowns" because the estimator is aware of them, and based on past experience, can even estimate their probable costs. The estimated costs of the known-unknowns is referred to by cost estimators as cost contingency.
* '''[[Cost]]''' - the value of currency required to obtain a product or service, to expend labor and use equipment and tools, or to operate a business.
* '''Cost index (or factor)''' - a value used to adjust the cost of from one time to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jelen &amp; Black|title=Cost and Optimization Engineering Second Edition|year=1983|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|isbn=0-07-032331-3|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various published cost indexes, listed by year, quarter, or month. RSMeans publishes a historical cost index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waier|first=Philip|title=Building Construction Cost Data|year=2013|edition=71st annual |publisher=RSMeans|isbn=978-1-936335-56-5|pages=729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Costing''' - the process of applying appropriate costs to the line items after the take off. RSMeans refers to this as, "Price the quantities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Philip R. Waier, PE|title=Building Construction Cost Data|year=2012|edition=70th annual |publisher=RSMeans|isbn=978-1-936335-29-9|page= vii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; May also be called pricing.
* '''[[Crew]]''' – a group of people ([[Construction worker|workers]]) who execute a construction activity. The crew may also include [[Heavy equipment (construction)|construction equipment]] required to execute the work.
* '''Crew hour (ch)''' – one crew’s effort for one hour of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Deliverable]]''' is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external).
* '''[[Indirect costs|Direct costs]]''' are directly attributable to the cost object. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs.
* '''Distributables''' – a classification of project costs which are not associated with any specific direct account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Field Supervision (or field non-manual)''' - supervisory personnel and all other non-manual staff at the construction site.
* '''[[Construction foreman|Foreman]]''' - the worker or tradesman who is in charge of a construction crew. The foreman may be a hands-on worker who contributes to the work completion or a non-working foreman. A general foreman may be in charge of all or some crews.
* '''[[Employee benefits|Fringe Benefits]]''' - labor cost elements which are provided to pay for benefits received by workers, such as health insurance, pension, training, etc.

== G ==
* '''[[Soft Costs|General &amp; Administrative Costs (G&amp;A)]]''' - the costs of operating a construction business. These costs include such things as office space, office staff, operating facilities, etc. They are not associated with any specific project, but may be allocated across projects in a cost estimate. See also Overhead, Indirect cost.
* '''[[General contractor]]''' is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of a construction site, management of vendors and trades, and communication of information to involved parties throughout the course of a building project.
* '''General requirements''' - costs for general requirements (Division 1) of the project execution which are actually part of the deliverable. Examples: project management &amp; coordination 47, temporary facilities &amp; controls, cleaning &amp; waste management, commissioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=MasterFormat 2010 Update Master List of Numbers and Titles for the Construction Industry|year=2010|publisher=The construction Specifications Institute, Construction Specifications Canada|isbn=978-0-9845357-0-5|pages=43–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== I ==
* '''[[Indirect costs]]''' are costs that are not directly accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). See also, Overhead, General &amp; Administrative Cost, Distributable.

== L ==
* '''[[Manual labour|Labor]]''' – a category of cost which is incurred to employ people (workers, crafts, trades, etc.) in the execution of construction work activity.
* '''Labor benefits''' are additional costs (such as [[paid time off|holiday pay]] or [[health insurance]]) which the employer pays directly to the employee or into a fund on behalf of the employee.
* '''Labor burden''' is the cost of [[payroll taxes]] and insurances (such as [[workers' compensation]]) which the employer must pay to employ workers.
* '''Labor rate''' (sometimes price) – the amount of currency per unit of time which is required to employ people (workers, crafts, trades, etc.) in the execution of construction work activity. The rate may represent the wage rate only, or may include various benefits and labor burdens.
* '''Line item''' - one element of cost in an estimate which is listed in the estimate spreadsheet.
* '''Location cost index (or factor)''' - the ratio of the cost in one location to that in another location. These may include or exclude currency exchange rates. Example: 223 in Boston / 187 in Austin = 1.19. The location cost factor is used to adjust the cost from one location to another. To adjust a known cost in Austin to that in Boston, multiply the Austin cost by 1.19. See also City cost index.
* '''Lump sum''' – "the complete in-place cost of a system, a subsystem, a particular item, or an entire project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== M ==
* '''[[Man-hour]] (mh)''' – one person’s (worker, craftsman, tradesman, etc.) effort for one hour of time. Note: some attempt to make this gender neutral by renaming this as work hour or job hour or person hour, or something similar.
* '''Man-hour norms''' - a set of standard man-hour rates for work tasks, given normal working conditions.
* '''Man-hour rate''' – the amount of man-hours which are consumed executing one unit of work activity.	Man-hour rate = man-hours required for work / completed work quantity. Example: Excavation 0.125 mh/cy. The man-hour rate is related to the inverse of the production rate times the number of workers in the crew performing the work. Example: Excavation at 8 cy/day (8 hour day) with 2-man crew = 2 x 8 / 8 = 2 man-hours/cy. See also Production rate. Note: some sources call this Productivity, an unnecessary confusion.
* '''[[Mark-up (business)|Mark-up]]''' is the difference between the cost of a good or service and its selling price. A markup is added on to the total cost incurred by the producer of a good or service in order to create a profit.
* '''[[Manual labour|Manual labor]]''' is physical work done by people involved in construction the project. All of the various trade workers are included in manual labor, including foremen.
* '''Means &amp; methods''' - the means and methods used in executing the work.

== N ==
* '''Non-manual labor''' - work done by people who are not classified as manual labor.
* '''Non-productive time''' - work time which is paid but does not contribute to the production of work. Examples: safety meeting, travel time, clean up time, wash up time, etc.

== O ==
* '''[[Open shop]]''' is a place of employment at which one is not required to join or financially support a union (closed shop) as a condition of hiring or continued employment. Open shop is also known as a merit shop.
* '''[[Overhead (business)|Overhead]]''' - In business, overhead or overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business; it is also known as an "operating expense." See also General &amp; Administrative Cost, Indirect Cost.
* '''[[Overtime]]''' is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours.

== P ==
* '''[[Per diem]]''' - a daily allowance for expenses, a specific amount of money that an organization gives an individual per day to cover living and traveling expenses (allowance) in connection with work done away from home or on tour. (Latin for "per day" or "for each day")
* '''Plug number''' - a value inserted in an estimate as a place holder and an approximation of the cost for a scope element which has not been detailed yet. See also Allowance.
* '''Premium pay''' - the extra portion of wages paid when a worker works overtime. Example: Wage rate is 10.00/hour, overtime is paid at time and a half, or 15.00/hour, the premium pay is 5.00/hour.
* '''[[Price]]''' is the quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for goods or services.
* '''Pricing''' is the function of determining the amount of money asked in consideration for undertaking the project. Depending on the market and profit considerations, etc., the price may be more or less than the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Production (economics)|Production]] rate''' – the quantity of work which is completed in one unit of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production rate = completed work quantity / duration. Example: Excavation 8 cy/day = .5 cy/hour (in an 8 hour day). RSMeans lists this as Daily Output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waier|first=Philip|title=Building Construction Cost Data|year=2013|edition=71st annual |publisher=RSMeans|isbn=978-1-936335-56-5|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also Man-hour rate. Note: some sources use the term productivity for the production rate or man-hour rate, an unnecessary confusion.
* '''[[Productivity]]''' is the term which relates one rate to another rate, given two differing sets of conditions for the same work. A production rate greater than the reference production rate indicates a higher productivity. A production rate less than the reference production rate indicates a lower productivity. A man-hour rate greater than the reference man-hour rate indicates a lower productivity. A man-hour rate less than the reference man-hour rate indicates a higher productivity. (The economic concept of productivity is an average measure of the efficiency of production. Productivity is a ratio of production output to what is required to produce it (inputs).)
* '''Productivity factor''' – the ratio of a selected production rate to a reference production rate. Example: selected rate = 102, reference rate = 80, productivity factor = 102/80 = 1.28. Alternatively – the ratio of a reference man-hour rate to a selected man-hour rate. Example: selected rate = 0.104, reference rate = 0.125, productivity factor = 0.125/0.104 = 1.20. A productivity factor is often used to adjust a set of standard or normal (norm) production or man-hour rates to a set of rates for a specific project, location, or set of working conditions (see Labor Productivity Factor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10s-90 Cost Engineering Terminology|year=2010|publisher=AACE International|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example: Specific type of excavation – standard = 150 cy/day. For specific project, location, or conditions the productivity factor is 0.80. The resulting production rate for that is 150 x 0.8 = 120 cy/day. The actual productivity factor for a project or subset of production rates (or man-hour rates) is the ratio of the actual production rate to the estimated production rate.
* '''[[Gross profit|Profit]]''' - in accounting, is the difference between revenue and cost. In estimates, it is an allowance to provide for anticipated profit upon completion of the project.
* '''[[Profit margin]]''' refers to a measure of profitability. It is calculated by finding the net profit as a percentage of the revenue.
* '''[[Project]]''' - A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Project Management Institute |date=2004 |title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge: PMBOK Guide |edition=3rd |location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania |publisher=Project Management Institute |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Q ==
* '''[[Quality (business)|Quality]]''' can mean a high degree of excellence (“a quality product”) or a degree of excellence or the lack of it (“work of average quality”).
* '''Quantify''' - see: Take off
* '''[[Quantity]]''' is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. For example 1200&amp;nbsp;mm or 10 each.
* '''[[Quantity surveyor]] (QS)''' is a professional working within the construction industry concerned with building costs, in the U.K. and some other areas. A QS employs standard methods of measurement to develop a bill of quantities.

== R ==
* '''[[Resource (project management)|Resources]]''' are what is required to carry out a project's tasks. They can be people, equipment, facilities, materials, tools, supplies, or anything else capable of definition required for the completion of a project activity.

== S ==
* '''[[Schedule of values]]''' is a detailed statement furnished by a construction contractor, builder or others outlining the portions of the contract sum. It allocates values for the various parts of the work and is also used as the basis for submitting and reviewing progress payments.
* '''[[Scope (project management)|Scope]]''' of a project in project management is the sum total of all of its products and their requirements or features.
* '''[[Specification (technical standard)|Specification]]''' - an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.
* '''[[Subcontractor]]''' is an individual or in many cases a business that signs a contract to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.
* '''[[Distribution (business)|Supplier]]''' - A distributor or other company which supplies materials, parts, equipment, etc.

== T ==
* '''Take off''' -The process of reviewing and understanding the design package and using the project scope drawings and documents to itemize the scope into line items with measured quantities. RSMeans refers to this as, "Scope out the project," and, "Quantify."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Philip R. Waier, PE|title=Building Construction Cost Data|year=2012|edition=70th annual |publisher=RSMeans|isbn=978-1-936335-29-9|page= vii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Task''' - a distinct piece of work performed.
* '''[[Tool]]''' - any physical item that can be used to achieve a goal, especially if the item is not consumed in the process.

== U ==
* '''Unit Cost''' - the cost for one measured unit of completed work activity.

== V ==
* '''[[Virtual Design and Construction]]''' (VDC) is the use of integrated multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects, including the Product (i.e., facilities), Work Processes and Organization of the design - construction - operation team in order to support explicit and public business objectives. In VDC (BIM is one method) the modeling consists of the usual three dimensions, plus the time dimension and the cost dimension.

== W ==
* '''[[Work (project management)|Work]]''' (1) is the amount of effort applied to produce a deliverable or to accomplish a task, (2) is everything required or supplied to complete a construction project.
* '''[[Work breakdown structure]] (WBS)''' - a deliverable oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components. It defines and groups a project's discrete work elements in a way that helps organize and define the total work scope of the project.
* '''[[Worker]]''' - a person engaged in the accomplishment of work. In cost estimating, the hands-on [[Construction worker|workers]] contribute to the production and are counted in calculations of the production rate. Other workers supervise or support the hands-on work in some way.
* '''[[Wage]] rate''' - The agreed monetary compensation per hour for a person to accomplish work. This is the pay provided to the worker, excluding any fringe benefits or other labor burdens. Labor unions typically have negotiated agreements which define the wage rates for workers, as well as the rates for fringe benefits.

[[File:SDG Latex Hands.jpg|thumb|Black latex gloves]]
[[File:Disposable gloves 09.JPG|thumb|Latex]]
'''Glove fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetishism]] where an individual is [[sexually stimulated]], often to the point of obsession, by another person or oneself wearing [[glove]]s on their hands. In some cases, the fetish is enhanced by the material of the glove (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[leather]], [[cotton]], [[latex]], [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[satin]] or [[nylon]]). Often, the actions of a gloved hand are as arousing as the glove itself, because the glove provides a second skin, or in other words a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. [[Medical gloves]] and [[rubber gloves]] provide not only a safer sex environment, but also give a latex glove fetishist great pleasure. Subtle movements by the gloved fingers or the hand as a whole can provide the individual with a great visual stimulus and ultimately [[sexual arousal]]. The act of putting gloves on, or slipping them off the hands, can also be a source of glove fetish fantasy. Smell is also a factor when it comes to latex, rubber, and leather gloves. 

Medical glove fetishism involves thin latex gloves, which come in many different types. Personal preference ranges from color, smell, size, textured, smooth, powdered, or un-powdered. Fetishists are proud of their collection of medical gloves, as well as rubber gloves. Household rubber gloves tend to be more thick, longer, and are mostly used for cleaning purposes. 

Some glove fetishists prefer certain lengths, for example the [[Evening glove|long opera-style]] or short cuff length. Some also like them as a part of an outfit, such as a [[nurse]], [[police officer|policewoman]] or [[French maid]] uniform.  Some who are of a sexually submissive nature are stimulated by their dominant partner's wearing and use of gloves.  Dominant partners may likewise prefer that their submissives wear gloves.  As with all fetishes however, there need not be a BDSM connection to an affinity for gloves.

Apart from their appearance, some individuals prefer to use them on oneself or others as a form of sexual stimulation. The ones most commonly used for this are made of leather, latex (such as those doctors or nurses use for examination), while others prefer the household rubber glove. The appeal behind the household glove may be due to the colours they come in but also offering what the latex examination gloves cannot; household gloves are thicker, some more than others depending on what their use is. Many enjoy [[erotic spanking]] with gloves donned. It offers a different feeling and sound to the "spankee", which can be a large part of the fetish.

A '''gospel harmony''' is an attempt to compile the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; This may take the form either of a single, merged [[narrative]], or a tabular format with one column for each gospel, technically known as a '''synopsis''', although the word ''harmony'' is often used for both.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;

Harmonies are constructed for a variety of purposes: to provide a straightforward devotional text for parishioners, to create a readable and accessible piece of literature for the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a scholarly [[Chronology of Jesus|chronology of events]] in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]] as depicted in the canonical gospels, or to better understand how the accounts relate to each other.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;

Among academics, the construction of harmonies has always been favoured by more conservative scholars.{{who?|date=August 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Students of [[higher criticism]] see the divergences between the gospel accounts as reflecting the construction of traditions by the [[Early centers of Christianity|early Christian communities]].&lt;ref name=Cox1&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven L | last = Cox | year = 2007 | title = Harmony of the Gospels | publisher = B&amp;H | ISBN = 0-8054-9444-8 | pages = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern academics, attempts to construct a single story have largely been abandoned in favour of laying out the accounts in [[Parallel passage|parallel columns for comparison]], to allow critical study of the differences between them.&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | volume = 4 | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 2005 | page = 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A gospel harmony is an attempt to collate the Christian canonical gospels into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Harmonies are constructed by some writers in order to make the gospel story available to a wider audience, both religious and secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies can be studied by scholars to establish a coherent chronology of the events depicted in the four canonical gospels in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]], to better understand how the accounts relate to each other, and to critically evaluate their differences.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"/&gt;

The terms ''harmony'' and ''synopsis'' have been used to refer to several different approaches to consolidating the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;  Technically, a "harmony" weaves together sections of scripture into a single narrative, merging the four gospels. There are four main types of harmony: ''radical'', ''synthetic'', ''sequential'' and ''parallel''.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; By contrast, a "synopsis", much like a parallel harmony, justaposes similar texts or accounts in parallel format, synchronized by time, while preserving their individual identity, usually in columns.&lt;ref name=Cox3&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies may also take a visual form and be undertaken to create narratives for artistic purposes, as in the creation of picture compositions depicting the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;

The oldest approach to harmonizing consists of merging the stories into a single narrative, producing a text longer than any individual gospel.&lt;ref name=Cox18&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the most straightforward and detailed account, and one that is likely to be most accessible to non-academic users, such as lay churchgoers or people who are reading the gospels as a work of literature or philosophy.

There are, however, difficulties in the creation of a consolidated narrative. As [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] points out, it is impossible to construct a single account from the four gospels without changing at least some parts of the individual accounts.&lt;ref name="John Barton 2013 page 59"&gt;John Barton, ''The Old Testament: Canon Literature and Theology Collected Essays of John Barton'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2013) page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One challenge with any form of harmonizing is that events are sometimes described in a different order in different accounts – the [[Synoptic Gospels]], for instance, describe Jesus overturning tables in the Temple at Jerusalem in the last week of his life, whereas the Gospel of John records a counterpart event only towards the beginning of Jesus's ministry. Harmonists must either choose which time they think is correct, or conclude that separate events are described. Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]], for instance, proposed in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) that Jesus must have been crowned with thorns twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) page 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, commentators have long noted that the individual gospels are not written in a rigorously chronological format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Christological  Catechism (quoting Augustine)|last=Fitzmyer|first=Joseph A.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Introduction to Matthew," in The Expositor's Bible Commentary vol. VIII|last=Carson|first=D,A.|publisher=Zondervan|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that an event can be described as falling at two different times and still be the same event, so that the substantive details can be properly brought together in a harmony, although the harmonist will still have the task of deciding which of the two times is more probable.

A less common but more serious difficulty arises if the gospels diverge in their substantive description of an event.  An example is the incident involving the centurion whose servant is healed at a distance. In the Gospel of Matthew the centurion comes to Jesus in person;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|8:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Luke version he sends Jewish elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|7:6–8|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these accounts are clearly describing the same event, the harmonist must decide which is the more accurate description or else devise a composite account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Allan Powell]], ''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), page 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregg |last=Zegarelli |title=ONE: The Unified Gospel of Jesus |publisher=OUG Press |year=2006|isbn=978-0978990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern academic view, based on the broadly accepted principle that Matthew and Luke were written using Mark as a source, seeks to explain the differences between the texts in terms of this process of composition. For example, Mark describes John the Baptist as preaching the forgiveness of sins, a detail which is dropped by Matthew, perhaps in the belief that the forgiveness of sins was exclusive to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], "Must the Gospels Agree?" in Stuart G. Hall, ''Jesus Christ Today: Studies of Christology in Various Contexts'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2009) page 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern popularizing view, on the other hand, while acknowledging these difficulties, deemphasizes their importance. This view suggests that the divergences in the gospels are a relatively small part of the whole, and that the accounts show a great deal of overall similarity.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; The divergences can therefore be sufficiently discussed in footnote in the course of a consolidated narrative, and need not stand in the way of conveying a better overall view of the life of Jesus&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; or of making this material more accessible to a wider readership.

To illustrate the concept of parallel harmony, a simple example of a "synopsis fragment" is shown here, consisting of just four episodes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive parallel harmony appears in a section below.

==Early Church and Middle Ages==
[[Image:LondonCanonTables.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|A 6–7th-century use of the [[Eusebian Canons]] to organize the contents of the gospels in the [[London Canon Tables]].]]
[[Tatian]]'s influential ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which dates to about AD 160, was perhaps the very first harmony.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature'' by David Edward Aune (Nov 30, 2003) {{ISBN|0664219179}} pages 127 and 211&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Diatessaron'' reduced the number of verses in the four gospels from 3,780 to 2,769 without missing any event of teaching in the life of Jesus from any of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Some scholars believe Tatian may have drawn on one or more noncanonical gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Zlatko Plese, ''The Apocryphal Gospels: Texts and Translations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) page 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], composed about the same time, is believed to have been a gospel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Cameron, ''The Other Gospels: Non-canonical Gospel Texts'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1982) page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages, e.g. Codex Sangallensis (based on the 6th century [[Codex Fuldensis]]) dates to 830 and has a Latin column based on the [[Vulgate]] and an [[Old High German]] column that often resembles the ''Diatessaron'', although errors frequently appear within it.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The Liege harmony in the [[Limburgish language|Limburg dialect]] (Liege University library item 437) is a key [[Western Church|Western]] source of the ''Diatessaron'' and dates to 1280, although published much later.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt; The two extant recensions of the Diatessaron in Medieval Italian are the single manuscript Venetian from the 13th or 14th century and the 26 manuscript Tuscan from the 14–15th century.&lt;ref name=RobS28&gt;''Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures'' by Robert F. Shedinger (Jan 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042910429}} pages 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188&gt;''Patristic and Text-Critical Studies'' by Jan Krans and Joseph Verheyden (Dec 31, 2011) {{ISBN|9004192891}} pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] developed the forerunner of modern synopsis (perhaps based on the ''Diatessaron'') as the [[Ammonian Sections]] in which he started with the text of Matthew and copied along parallel events.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41&gt;''Encyclopedia Christianity: v. 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch (1 Jul 2004) {{ISBN|0802824161}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; There are no extant copies of the harmony of Ammonius and it is only known from a single reference in the letter of [[Eusebius]] to Carpianus.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; In the letter Eusebius also discusses his own approach, i.e. the [[Eusebian Canons]] in which the texts of the gospels are shown in parallel to help comparison among the four gospels.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote extensively on the subject in his book ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]''.&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C. Cavadini 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine viewed the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.&lt;ref name=Tuckett38 &gt;''Christology, Controversy and Community'' by David G. Horell and Christopher M. Tuckett (8 Aug 2000) {{ISBN|9004116796}} pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Llanthony]]'s ''[[Unum ex Quatuor]]'' (''One from Four'') was considered an improvement on previous canons at the time,{{sfnp|Smalley|1981|p=250}} although modern scholars sometimes opine that no major advances beyond Augustine emerged on the topic until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] harmonies based on the principles of the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear, e.g. the Liege harmony by Plooij in [[Middle Dutch]], and the Pepysian harmony in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; The Pepysian harmony (Magdalene college, Cambridge, item Pepys 2498) dates to about 1400 and its name derives from having been owned by [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;

==15th–20th centuries==
[[File:Branteghem Gospel harmony Antwerp 1537.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|The cover of Branteghem's 1537 visual gospel harmony, [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt;]]
In the 15th and the 16th centuries some new approaches to harmony began to appear, e.g. [[Jean Gerson]] produced a harmony which gave priority to the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;. [[Cornelius Jansen (Bishop of Ghent)]] also published his harmony (1549), focusing on the four gospels and even referring to the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;François, W. (2012). Augustine and the Golden Age of Biblical Scholarship in Louvain (1550-1650). In: Gordon B., McLean M. (Eds.), bookseries: Library of the Written Word, vol: 20, Shaping the Bible in the Reformation: Books, Scholars and Their Readers in the Sixteenth Century. Leiden: Brill, 235-289, on  252.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand [[John Calvin]]'s approach focused on the three synoptic Gospels, and excluded the Gospel of John.
&lt;ref&gt;''John Calvin And the Printed Book'' by Jean François Gilmont (Nov 30, 2005) {{ISBN|1931112568}} page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Harmony of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' by John Calvin, David W. Torrance,(Jul 17, 1995) {{ISBN|0802808026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time visual representations had also started appearing, for instance, the 15th-century artist [[Lieven de Witte]] produced a set of about 200 woodcut images that depicted the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony" which then appeared in Willem van Branteghem's harmony published in [[Antwerp]] in 1537.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8vYRVoqzf4C&amp;pg=PA398#v=snippet&amp;q=gospel%20harmony&amp;f=false Seeing Beyond the Word: Visual Arts and the Calvinist Tradition]'' by Paul Corby Finney 1999 {{ISBN|080283860X}} page 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt; The importance of imagery is reflected in the title of Branteghem's well known work: ''The Life of Jesus Christ Skillfully Portrayed in Elegant Pictures Drawn from the Narratives of the Four Evangelists''&lt;ref name=Celeste2&gt;''The Authority of the Word: Reflecting on Image and Text in Northern Europe, 1400–1700'' by Celeste Brusati, Karl A. E. Enenkel and Walter S. Melion (Nov 2011) {{ISBN|9004215158}} pages 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies. In this period the ''parallel column structure'' became widespread, partly in response to the rise of [[biblical criticism]].&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; This new format was used to emphasize the trustworthiness of the gospels. It is not clear who produced the very first parallel harmony, but [[Gerhard Mercator]]'s 1569 system is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35&gt;''What Have They Done to the Bible?: A History of Modern Biblical Interpretation'' by John Sandys-Wunsch (20 Aug 2005) {{ISBN|0814650287}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content and quality, [[Johann Jacob Griesbach]]'s 1776 synopsis was a notable case.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35/&gt;

At the same time, the rise of modern biblical criticism was instrumental in the decline of the traditional apologetic gospel harmony. The Enlightenment writer, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], observed:

{{quote|Oh that most excellent Harmony, which can only reconcile two contradictory reports, both stemming from the evangelists, by inventing a third report, not a syllable of which is to be found in any individual evangelist!&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing Werke, 8.51-52, cited in [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

W. G. Rushbrooke's 1880 ''Synopticon'' is at times considered a turning point in the history of the synopsis, as it was based on [[Markan priority]], i.e. the assumption that the Gospel of Mark was the first to be written.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Thirteen years later, [[John Broadus]] used historical accounts to assign priorities in his harmony, while previous approaches had used feasts as the major milestones for dividing the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, after extensive travels and study in the Middle East, [[James Tissot]] produced a set of [[commons:Life of Jesus|350 watercolors which depicted]] the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]] as a visual gospel harmony.&lt;ref name=Dolkart70/&gt; Tissot synthesized the four gospels into a singular narrative with five chapters: "the Holy Childhood, the Ministry, Holy Week, the Passion, and the Resurrection". He also made portraits of each of the [[four evangelists]] to honor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/brooklynmuseum-o4548-saint-luke-saint-luc |title=James Tissot: Saint Luke (Saint Luc) (1886) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |format= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' by [[Kurt Aland]]&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland, 1982 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' United Bible Societies {{ISBN|0-8267-0500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be seen by some as "perhaps the standard for an in-depth study of the Gospels."&lt;ref name=Cox6&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of Aland's work is the incorporation of the full text of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; [[John Bernard Orchard]]'s synopsis (which has the same title)&lt;ref&gt;John Bernard Orchard, 1983 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' T&amp;T Clark Publishers {{ISBN|0-567-09331-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; was of note in that it took the unusual approach of abandoning [[Markan priority]] and assuming the synopics were written in this order: Matthew, Luke, Mark.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

The following table is an example of a parallel harmony, based on the [[list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels]]. The order of events, especially during the ministry period, has been the subject of speculation and scholarly debate. While this harmony compares the work of several scholars, other harmonies may differ substantially on the placement of some events. The episode structure within the table is based on Edward Robinson's ''A Harmony of the Gospels in Greek''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=William Newcome |editor=Edward Robinson |title=A harmony of the Gospels in Greek, in the general order of Le Clere &amp; Newcome, with Newcome's notes: Printed from the text and with the various readings of Knapp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_harmony_of_the_Gospels_in_Greek_in_the.html?id=04bNAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Gould and Newman |year=1834}}

'''Helsinki Challenge''' is a science-based competition and idea accelerator which brings together the academic community and society at large to solve the world’s grand challenges in cooperation. The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected |title=Prepare for the unexpected - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |title=How to participate? - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626135757/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015. In 2017, the competition is organised by the [[University of Helsinki]] in collaboration with [[Aalto University]], [[Hanken School of Economics]], [[University of Eastern Finland]], [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[University of Oulu]], [[University of the Arts Helsinki]], [[University of Turku]], [[University of Vaasa]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2014–2015==

The first ever Helsinki Challenge was organised by the University of Helsinki and celebrated the University’s 375th anniversary in 2015. The first Helsinki Challenge competition themes were: environmental change, health and wellbeing, future learning, global Helsinki and new world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |title=About - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134954/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifinal 2014–2015===
Out of 80 proposals, a list of 20 semifinalists were announced in December 2014. Teams’ competition ideas ranged from developing tools to analyze [[big data]] on the Finnish discussion forum [[Suomi24]] to studying our expectations of robot morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1417410726435 |title=Tiederyhmä selvittää syyllisyyttä robottien tekemissä virheissä - Tiede - Kotimaa - Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mika Pantzar |url=http://wau.fi/artikkelit/big-dataa-riittaa-mutta-riittaako-suomessa-kykya-hyodyntaa-sita |title=Big dataa riittää, mutta riittääkö Suomessa kykyä hyödyntää sitä? |publisher=Wau.fi |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2016–2017==

The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016. The winner will be announced in conjunction with the centennial of [[Finland]]'s independence in 2017. The new Helsinki Challenge themes: Sustainable Plant, Urban Future and People in Change are linked to the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The intention is to create solutions for future wellbeing through cooperation with a range of different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12440">In [[recursion theory]], '''hyperarithmetic theory''' is a generalization of [[Computable function|Turing computability]].  It has close connections with definability in [[second-order arithmetic]] and with weak systems of [[set theory]] such as [[Kripke–Platek set theory]].  It is an important tool in [[effective descriptive set theory]].

The central focus of hyperarithmetic theory is the sets of [[natural number]]s known as '''hyperarithmetic sets'''.  There are three equivalent ways of defining this class of sets; the study of the relationships between these different definitions is one motivation for the study of hyperarithmetical theory.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and definability ==

The first definition of the hyperarithmetic sets uses the [[analytical hierarchy]]. 
A set of natural numbers is classified at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of this hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of [[second-order arithmetic]] with only existential set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is classified at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of the analytical hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only universal set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; if it is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; sets.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and iterated Turing jumps: the hyperarithmetical hierarchy==

The definition of hyperarithmetical sets as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; does not directly depend on computability results.  A second, equivalent, definition shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be defined using infinitely iterated [[Turing jump]]s.  This second definition also shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be classified into a hierarchy extending the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]; the hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the sets that are assigned a rank in this hierarchy.

Each level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy corresponds to a countable [[ordinal number]] (ordinal), but not all countable ordinals correspond to a level of the hierarchy. The ordinals used by the hierarchy are those with an '''[[ordinal notation]]''', which is a concrete, effective description of the ordinal.

An ordinal notation is an effective description of a countable ordinal by a natural number. A system of ordinal notations is required in order to define the hyperarithmetic hierarchy. The fundamental property an ordinal notation must have is that it describes the ordinal in terms of small ordinals in an effective way. The following inductive definition is typical; it uses a [[pairing function]] &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
* The number 0 is a notation for the ordinal 0.
* If ''n'' is a notation for an ordinal &amp;lambda; then &lt;math&gt;\langle 1, n \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a notation for &amp;lambda; + 1;
* Suppose that &amp;delta; is a limit ordinal. A notation for &amp;delta; is a number of the form &lt;math&gt;\langle 2, e\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''e'' is the index of a total computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a notation for an ordinal &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; less than &amp;delta; and &amp;delta; is the [[supremum|sup]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

There are only countably many ordinal notations, since each notation is a natural number; thus there is a countable ordinal which is the supremum of all ordinals that have a notation. This ordinal is known as the [[Large countable ordinal#The Church–Kleene ordinal|Church-Kleene ordinal]] and is denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this ordinal is still countable, the symbol being only an analogy with the first uncountable ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all natural numbers that are ordinal notations is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;''.

Ordinal notations are used to define iterated Turing jumps. These are sets of natural numbers denoted &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &amp;delta; has notation ''e''. The set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is defined using ''e'' as follows.
* If &amp;delta; = 0 then &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}= 0&lt;/math&gt; is the empty set. 
* If &amp;delta; = &amp;lambda; + 1 then &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is the Turing jump of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;. The notations &lt;math&gt;0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0''&lt;/math&gt; are commonly used for &lt;math&gt;0^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. 
* If &amp;delta; is a limit ordinal, let &lt;math&gt;\langle \lambda_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be the sequence of ordinals less than &amp;delta; given by the notation ''e''. The set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the rule &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)} = \{ \langle n,i\rangle \mid i \in 0^{(\lambda_n)}\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the [[effective join]] of the sets &lt;math&gt;0^{(\lambda_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the construction of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; depends on having a fixed notation for &amp;delta;, and each infinite ordinal has many notations, a theorem of Spector shows that the [[Turing degree]] of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &amp;delta;, not on the particular notation used, and thus &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is well defined up to Turing degree.

The hyperarithmetical hierarchy is defined from these iterated Turing jumps. A set ''X'' of natural numbers is classified at level &amp;delta; of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, for &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;, if ''X'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;. There will always be a least such &amp;delta; if there is any; it is this least &amp;delta; that measures the level of uncomputability of ''X''.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and recursion in higher types ==

A third characterization of the hyperarithmetical sets, due to Kleene, uses [[type theory|higher-type]] computable functionals. The type-2 functional &lt;math&gt;{}^2E\colon \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following rules:
:&lt;math&gt;{}^2E(f) = 1 \quad&lt;/math&gt; if there is an ''i'' such that ''f''(''i'') &gt; 0,
:&lt;math&gt;{}^2E(f) = 0 \quad&lt;/math&gt; if there is no ''i'' such that ''f''(''i'') &gt; 0.
Using a precise definition of computability relative to a type-2 functional, Kleene showed that a set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetical if and only if it is computable relative to &lt;math&gt;{}^2E&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example: the truth set of arithmetic ==

Every [[arithmetical set]] is hyperarithmetical, but there are many other hyperarithmetical sets. One example of a hyperarithmetical, nonarithmetical set is the set ''T'' of Gödel numbers of formulas of [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] that are true in the standard natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The set ''T'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing equivalent]] to the set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;, and so is not high in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, although it is not arithmetically definable by [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]].

== Fundamental results ==

The fundamental results of hyperarithmetic theory show that the three definitions above define the same collection of sets of natural numbers. These equivalences are due to Kleene.

Completeness results are also fundamental to the theory. A set of natural numbers is '''&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete''' if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of the [[analytical hierarchy]] and every &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set of natural numbers is [[many-one reduction|many-one reducible]] to it. The definition of a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete subset of Baire space (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) is similar.   Several sets associated with hyperarithmetic theory are &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete:
* Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of natural numbers that are notations for ordinal numbers
* The set of natural numbers ''e'' such that the computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; computes the characteristic function of a well ordering of the natural numbers. These are the indices of [[recursive ordinal]]s.
* The set of elements of Baire space that are the characteristic functions of a well ordering of the natural numbers (using an effective isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}})&lt;/math&gt;.

Results known as '''&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; bounding''' follow from these completeness results.  For any &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set ''S'' of ordinal notations, there is an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; such that every element of ''S'' is a notation for an ordinal less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  For any subset ''T'' of Baire space consisting only of characteristic functions of well orderings, there is an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; such that each ordinal represented in ''T'' is less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relativized hyperarithmeticity and hyperdegrees ==

The definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; can be relativized to a set ''X'' of natural numbers: in the definition of an ordinal notation, the clause for limit ordinals is changed so that the computable enumeration of a sequence of ordinal notations is allowed to use ''X'' as an oracle. The set of numbers that are ordinal notations relative to ''X'' is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt;. The supremum of ordinals represented in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega^{X}_1&lt;/math&gt;; this is a countable ordinal no smaller than &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; can also be relativized to an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers. The only change in the definition is that &lt;math&gt;X^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be ''X'' rather than the empty set, so that &lt;math&gt;X^{(1)} = X'&lt;/math&gt; is the Turing jump of ''X'', and so on.  Rather than terminating at &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; the hierarchy relative to ''X'' runs through all ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\omega^{X}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The relativized hyperarithmetical hierarchy is used to define '''hyperarithmetical reducibility'''. Given sets ''X'' and ''Y'', we say &lt;math&gt; X \leq_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^Y_1&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is Turing reducible to &lt;math&gt;Y^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; X \leq_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y \leq_{HYP} X&lt;/math&gt; then the notation &lt;math&gt; X \equiv_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate ''X'' and ''Y'' are '''hyperarithmetically equivalent'''.  This is a coarser equivalence relation than [[Turing reduction|Turing equivalence]]; for example, every set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetically equivalent to its [[Turing jump]] but not Turing equivalent to its Turing jump.  The equivalence classes of hyperarithmetical equivalence are known as '''hyperdegrees'''.

The function that takes a set ''X'' to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''hyperjump''' by analogy with the Turing jump. Many properties of the hyperjump and hyperdegrees have been established.  In particular, it is known that [[Turing degree#Post.27s problem and the priority method|Post's problem]] for hyperdegrees has a positive answer: for every set ''X''  of natural numbers there is a set ''Y'' of natural numbers such that &lt;math&gt;X &lt;_{HYP} Y &lt;_{HYP} \mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generalizations ==

Hyperarithmetical theory is generalized by [[Alpha recursion theory|&amp;alpha;-recursion theory]], which is the study of definable subsets of [[admissible ordinal]]s. Hyperarithmetical theory is the special case in which &amp;alpha; is &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Industry funding of academic research in the United States''' is one of the two major sources of funding in academia along with government support. Currently, private funding of research accounts for the majority of all research and development funding in the United States as of 2007 overall.&lt;ref name=CBO2007&gt;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/82xx/doc8221/06-18-research.pdf{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Federal and Industrial sources contribute similar amounts to research, while industry funds the vast majority of development work.&lt;ref name="CBO2007" /&gt; 

While the majority of industry research is performed in-house, a major portion of this private research funding is directed to research in non-profit academic centers.&lt;ref name=NBK215472&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=McGeary |editor2-first=Kathi E. |editor2-last=Hanna |year=2004 |chapter=Sources of Funding for Biomedical Research |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215472/ |title=Strategies to Leverage Research Funding |isbn=0-309-09277-9 |pages=37–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, industrial sources accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion of academic research funding in the US.&lt;ref name=NBK215472/&gt; However, there is little governmental oversight or tracking of industry funding on academic science and figures of the scale of industry research are often estimated by self-reporting and surveys which can be somewhat unreliable.

Much of this industry funding of academic research is directed toward applied research. However, by some accounts, industry may even fund up to 40% of basic research in the United States, with Federal funding of basic research falling below 50%, although this figure does not consider where this research is conducted.&lt;ref name="science.aal0890"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aal0890 |title=Data check: U.S. Government share of basic research funding falls below 50% |journal=Science |year=2017 |last1=Mervis |first1=Jeffrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role for funding of academic research from industrial sources has received much attention both in a historical and contemporary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.1.113 |pmid=12837722 |title=Industry Funding of Clinical Trials: Benefit or Bias? |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=113–4 |year=2003 |last1=Chopra |first1=S. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has received both extensive political praise and scholarly criticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==History==
Research in the US prior to World War II, heavily relied on funding from private sources without major organized federal research programs or either the scientists’ or associates’ personal funds. During World Wa&lt;s&gt;r&lt;/s&gt; II, governmental investment in research was widely regarded as a major contributor to military success and support for research was politically favorable.&lt;ref name=NBK235736&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235736/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following WW2, federal research funding in both Europe and the US increased in terms of relative percent of funding for research and absolute amount.&lt;ref name=NBK235736/&gt; Overall, the growth of industrial research funding has greatly outpaced public research funding growth, with US governmental research funding increasing by an average of 3.4% annually, while industrial research funding increased by an average of 5.4% annually from 1950 to 2004.&lt;ref name=CBO2007/&gt; 

Since WW2, industry funding of science has consistently represented the second largest source of funding for academic science.&lt;ref name=Jahnke&gt;{{cite web |first=Art |last=Jahnke |date=April 6, 2015 |title=Who Picks Up the Tab for Science? |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/ |work=BU Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry funding of academic science did expand during the 1980s and 1990s following the passing of the Bayh-Dohl Act and a variety of both State and Federal proposals to increase funding for joint industry academic partnerships.&lt;ref name=Cohen1994&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wesley |last1=Cohen |first2=Richard |last2=Florida |first3=W Richard |last3=Goe |title=University-Industry Research Centers in the United States: Final Report to the Ford Foundation |publisher=H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Center for Economic Development |year=1994 |oclc=249390310 }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there has been a small retraction of industry funding for academic science while overall industry R&amp;D funding has expanded.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt; ). However, industry funding may be broadening its scope as industry funding of basic science increasing dramatically over that same period, but much of this funding remains in-house.&lt;ref name=science.aal0890/&gt;

Culturally, attitudes towards the industrial funding of academic research have changed over time. Within universities, commercial activities and industry funding were often spurned in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/652016 |pmid=20380344 |title=The Professional and the Scientist in Nineteenth-Century America |journal=Isis |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=699–732 |year=2009 |last1=Lucier |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, commercializing scientific activity is viewed more favorably with extensive political and university support of translating scientific discovery into economic output. However, within the research community and the public, industrial funding of research remains controversial. The universality of this tangled industry, academic, and governmental exchange of funding and research adventures has led researchers to term this model of R&amp;D the Triple Helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00055-4 |title=The dynamics of innovation: From National Systems and 'Mode 2' to a Triple Helix of university–industry–government relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=109–23 |year=2000 |last1=Etzkowitz |first1=Henry |last2=Leydesdorff |first2=Loet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of industrially funded academic research ==
University-industry partnerships can take on a variety of forms. On the smallest scale, individual research labs or researchers can partner with industry sources for funding. The details of such partnerships can differ substantially with any number of motives ranging from the academic lab testing of previously developed products, to performing early stage basic research related to industry research objectives, or even to individual researchers supporting their salary by consulting on related research problems in industry.&lt;ref name=Lucier2008&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3500{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many such partnerships exist, due to their informal nature and resulting lack of record, it is difficult to track how extensive and impactful such relationships are, with most relying on surveys and other self-reporting measures. By closest approximation, according to the Research Value Mapping Survey, 17% of academics at major US research universities report receive grants from industry sources supporting their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.007 |title=Impacts of grants and contracts on academic researchers' interactions with industry |journal=Research Policy |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=694–707 |year=2007 |last1=Bozeman |first1=Barry |last2=Gaughan |first2=Monica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more extensively, in many fields and countries, a narrow majority of academic scientists report having some soft industry relationships, primarily through consulting.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.007 |title=Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university–industry relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=423–42 |year=2013 |last1=Perkmann |first1=Markus |last2=Tartari |first2=Valentina |last3=McKelvey |first3=Maureen |last4=Autio |first4=Erkko |last5=Broström |first5=Anders |last6=d'Este |first6=Pablo |last7=Fini |first7=Riccardo |last8=Geuna |first8=Aldo |last9=Grimaldi |first9=Rosa |last10=Hughes |first10=Alan |last11=Krabel |first11=Stefan |last12=Kitson |first12=Michael |last13=Llerena |first13=Patrick |last14=Lissoni |first14=Franceso |last15=Salter |first15=Ammon |last16=Sobrero |first16=Maurizio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1814 |pmid=19887423 |pmc=3767010 |title=Participation of Academic Scientists in Relationships with Industry |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1814–25 |year=2009 |last1=Zinner |first1=D. E |last2=Bolcic-Jankovic |first2=D |last3=Clarridge |first3=B |last4=Blumenthal |first4=D |last5=Campbell |first5=E. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such informal industry academic relationships have a long-standing tradition as they served as a major source of funding for individual labs prior to WW2. In many cases, it was expected that researchers would pursue such relationships as this was expected to be a major source of funding for researcher’s salaries.&lt;ref name="Lucier2008" /&gt; Despite greatly expanded post-WW2 federal support for research, so called soft money salary support from industry remains a large and growing aspect of academic research salaries.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt;

=== University Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) ===
On a larger scale, there have been numerous attempts to create collaborative University-Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) to jointly host academic and industry researchers to address industry problems with direct, large scale collaborative centers. Early forms of UIRCS started in the 1950s and 1960s with the formation of research parks with industry sponsors. In the 1970s, there were multiple proposals at the federal level in the US to help fund and expand early UIRCs. However, funding fell through at multiple points.&lt;ref name="Berman2012"&gt;https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9619.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first UIRCs experienced difficulties in bridging the differences between academic and industrial culture. One such attempt occurred at Cal Tech where Cal Tech researchers partnered with Xerox and IBM through the Silicon Structures Project.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/capsca_000202
{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both industry and academic partners were concerned about the cultures of the other and found the structure ineffective.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt; With such frustrations, it was difficult to secure partners to continue expanding UIRCs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1970s, RPI created two three new UIRCs: 1) the Center for Integrated Computer Graphics, which received both NSF and industry support 2) the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology Transfer, which was funded entirely by industry support and 3) the Center for Integrated Electronics, which received unprecedented industry support.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; These centers were generally regarded as highly successful and made expansion of governmental support for joint industry and academic ventures more favorable. In the early 1980s, states began contributing funding to UIRCs and other industry-academic partnerships to encourage local economic growth from innovation. By the mid-1980s, the federal government expanded financial support for UIRCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016224399602100303 |jstor=689710 |title=The Emergence of a Competitiveness Research and Development Policy Coalition and the Commercialization of Academic Science and Technology |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=303–39 |year=2016 |last1=Slaughter |first1=Sheila |last2=Rhoades |first2=Gary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With mixed governmental and industry support, the UIRCs were more likely to be successful. Over time successful governmentally funded UIRCs could become independent from government support once having demonstrable successes that could continue to incentivize industry to contribute funding more aggressively.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; UIRCs, coupled to early seeding from both state and federal government, continued to greatly expand during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually receiving nearly 70% of industry funding of academic research and incentivizing a tripling of industry funding of academic research during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1994" /&gt;

=== Contract Research Organizations (CROs) ===
Contract research has also drawn increasing industry funding, particularly to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) from Biotech and Pharmaceutical corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00136504 |jstor=3446795 |title=Contract research, the university, and the academic |journal=Higher Education |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=665–82 |year=1985 |last1=Crawshaw |first1=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract research is a popular form of outsourcing research in industry as industry has more influence over how the study is conducted than in either UIRCs or traditional academic grants. CROs, which are specifically designed for this function have drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away from academia and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23424323 |pmc=3571008 |year=2005 |author1=Carroll |first1=J |title=CRO Crowing About Their Growth |journal=Biotechnology healthcare |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=46–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticisms==
Much discussion has been placed on the effects of industrial research funding on the behavior of academic research scientists. Concerns center on whether researchers can remain impartial when they are being funded by a for-profit and potentially motivated industrial source, if this funding gives private sources an oversized impact on which research directions are pursued, and the potential negative effects of industrial funding on the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00112-2 |title=Unintended consequences of cooperative research: Impact of industry sponsorship on climate for academic freedom and other graduate student outcome |journal=Research Policy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=179–99 |year=2001 |last1=Behrens |first1=Teresa R |last2=Gray |first2=Denis O }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A multitude of studies have found that pharmaceutical studies funded by industry organizations are significantly more likely to publish results in favor of the product being supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.010 |title=How pharmaceutical industry funding affects trial outcomes: Causal structures and responses |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1909–14 |year=2008 |last1=Sismondo |first1=Sergio }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, in part, be due to the fact that usually when an academic accepts industry funding, particularly when working on an existing product, researchers have to sign non-disclosure agreements which often prevent the publication of negative results and inhibit the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public-universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could serve to significantly bias scientific results and diminish public trust of science.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are additionally many scholars who have considered advantages of industrially funded academic research. Generally, increased industry funding may increase academic and industry interaction, prompting greater efficiency in translating and commercializing of science research. This increased commercialization activity from academics could serve as an economic and societal boost as the economy could be bolstered by new products hitting the market, while society could benefit directly from having increased access to the fruits of scientific production. Supporting this, academic science funded by industry sources does result in more patents per dollar, increased licensing of these patents, and even more citations per published paper than research supported by other sources, including federal at the University of California Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507297a |pmid=24654278 |title=Technology transfer: Industry-funded academic inventions boost innovation |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7492 |pages=297–9 |year=2014 |last1=Wright |first1=Brian D |last2=Drivas |first2=Kyriakos |last3=Lei |first3=Zhen |last4=Merrill |first4=Stephen A }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Germany, it also appears that applied research funded by industry sources results in a significant increase in patent citations, which could correspond to a serious increase in translation of applied research.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00519.x |title=Industry Funding of University Research and Scientific Productivity |journal=Kyklos |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=534–55 |year=2011 |last1=Hottenrott |first1=Hanna |last2=Thorwarth |first2=Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such increase in commercialization and translation of research could provide social and economic benefits.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011/&gt; However, it is difficult to determine whether this increase in apparent impact is due to the industry funding itself or is just a read out that industry funds target work that tends to produce more citations per publication as well as more patents.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt;

The '''''Inscriptiones Graecae''''' ('''IG'''), [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Greek inscriptions'', is an academic project originally begun by the [[Prussian Academy of Science]], and today continued by its successor organisation, the ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. Its aim is to collect and publish all known [[ancient]] [[inscriptions]] from the mainland and islands of [[Greece]].

The project was designed as a continuation of the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (''Corpus of Greek Inscriptions'', abbreviated CIG) published by [[August Böckh]] between 1825 and 1860, and as a parallel to the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' (''Corpus of Latin Inscriptions'') founded by [[Theodor Mommsen]] in 1847. From 1860 to 1902, it was directed by [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]. From 1902 to 1931, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was in control of the project; he reorganised and re-energised the IG, turning it into one of the most important series for the publication of source material in [[Classical studies]].

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the project suffered from a lack of financial and motivational support. It came to a temporary halt in 1972, but was revived by the newly reformed Berlin-Brandenburg Academy in 1994.

So far, 49 [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s have been published, some of them in several editions. The preparation of individual volumes is partially entrusted to external scholars, in which case the Berlin Academy retains the final [[editing]]. The Academy also maintains a collection of [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeezes"]] (paper copies) of Greek inscriptions. The project is currently directed by [[Peter Funke]]. Editors of previous volumes include [[Wilhelm Dittenberger]], [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], [[Johannes Kirchner]] and [[Günther Klaffenbach]].

All editorial texts are published in [[Latin language|Latin]], a fact that is occasionally criticised in view of the decreasing use of that language and the extra effort required from editors. The inscriptions were published without translation, but [[German language|German]] translations for all volumes since 2012 are available on the IG website.

The '''International Association for Plant Taxonomy''' ('''IAPT''') promotes an understanding of [[plant]] [[biodiversity]], facilitates international communication of research between [[botany|botanists]], and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names. The IAPT was founded on July 18, 1950 at the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT|IAPT web site]].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the IAPT headquarters is located in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. Its current president, since 2017, is [[Patrick S. Herendeen]] of the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]]; vice-president is [[Gonzalo Nieto Feliner]] of the [[Real Jardín Botánico]], Madrid; and secretary-general is [[Karol Marhold]] of the Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.

Both the taxonomic journal '''''Taxon''''' and the series '''''Regnum Vegetabile''''' are published by the IAPT.  The latter series includes the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', the ''Index Nominum Genericorum'', and ''Index Herbariorum''.

==Purpose==
The IAPT's primary purpose is the promotion and understanding of biodiversity—the discovery, naming, [[taxonomic classification|classification]], and [[systematics]] of plants—for both living and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. Additionally, it promotes the study and [[conservation biology|conservation]] of plant biodiversity, and works to raise awareness of the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]], and [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]]. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.

{{cquote | IAPT was founded in 1950 as a not-for-profit organisation for the purposes of publication of a periodical (''Taxon'') dealing with activities of the association and with objects of general importance for plant taxonomy, the publication of books and indices of utility for plant taxonomists (''Regnum Vegetabile''), the establishment and maintenance of committees for specific taxonomic and nomenclatural purposes, and the organization of international symposia on problems of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The IAPT also seeks to achieve uniformity and stability in [[Botanical name|plant names]].  It accomplishes this through the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', previously known as the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and through the oversight of the International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature.

==Publications and online resources==
===''Taxon''===
&lt;!-- [[Taxon (journal)]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Taxon''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0040-0262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the bi-monthly journal of the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. ''Taxon'' also contains matters related to [[botanical nomenclature]], and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals to amend the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN). Publication of such matters in ''Taxon'' satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news in the world of plant systematics.  Although the journal is "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idTAXON|TAXON - Journal of the IAPT]].&lt;/ref&gt; it has been in the past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDavis1973|Davis &amp; Heywood 1973]], pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regnum Vegetabile''===
&lt;!-- [[Regnum Vegetabile]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Regnum Vegetabile''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0080-0694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a published series of books on topics of interest to plant taxonomists. Many of the volumes are literature surveys or monographs in the area of plant systematics. There are several volumes of general use:
*''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (Vol. 159, 2018) The ''ICN'' is a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal names that are given to plants. The current edition is known as the "Shenzhen Code", as it was drafted in 2017 at the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China.
*''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', 8th edition (Vol. 151, 2010) Companion to the ''ICN'', this volume sets forth rules regarding the names of plant [[cultivar]]s.
*''Index Nominum Genericorum'' (Vols. 100-102 &amp; 113) An index of all published [[Genus|generic]] names covered by the ''ICN'', including the place of publication and information about the type species. The index is prepared in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. An electronic version is available [http://botany.si.edu/ing/ online].
*''Index Herbariorum'', the first six editions (Vol. 15, 31, 86, 92, 93, 106, 109, 114, 117, 120) A directory and guide to the [[Herbarium|herbaria]] of the world, including contact information, abbreviation codes, and important collections located in each herbarium. ''Index Herbariorum'' is now an online database, managed by The New York Botanical Garden, and available for [http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/IndexHerbariorum.asp on-line searching].
*''International Directory of Botanical Gardens'' (Updated as Vol. 95, 1977) A directory to [[botanical garden]]s and [[Arboretum|arboreta]] around the world.

The series includes many additional volumes of interest to specialists in specific subdisciplines of botany, in addition to the ones listed above.

===Databases===
In addition to electronic versions of its print publications, the IAPT maintains the following:
* "Names in Current Use"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/ncu/default.htm Names in Current Use (NCU)]&lt;/ref&gt; - A database of scientific names of extant botanical genera.

== Awards ==

The IAPT established two Engler Medals in honour of [[Adolf Engler]] in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded every six years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for monographic or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant systematics and/or plant evolution. The medals honor [[Adolf Engler]] (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), [[Frans Antonie Stafleu]] (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and [[George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr.]] (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).{{sfn|IAPT|2017}}

'''JFLAP''' (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package) is interactive educational software written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 
for experimenting with topics in the [[computer science]] 
area of [[formal languages]] and [[automata theory]], primarily intended for use at the undergraduate level or as an advanced
topic for high school.  JFLAP allows one to create and simulate structures, such as programming a finite state machine, and 
experiment with proofs, such as converting a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to a 
deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

JFLAP is developed and maintained at [[Duke University]], with support from the  [[National Science Foundation]] since 1993. It is [[freeware]] and the source code of the most recent version is available, but under some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/jflap/jflaptmp/aug28-09/license.html|accessdate=2 October 2016|title=JFLAP 7.0 LICENSE|author=Susan H. Rodger}}&lt;/ref&gt; JFLAP runs as a Java application.

==History==

Before JFLAP, there were several software tools related to automata theory developed by [[Susan H. Rodger]] and her students starting around 1990 
in the Computer Science Department at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]. In 1992, the first published paper at a DIMACS 2012 workshop described a related tool called NPDA 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=D. Caugherty |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1992
 |title =NPDA: A Tool for Visualizing and Simulating Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata
 |journal =DIMACS Workshop March 12–14, 1992
 |pages = 365–377
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the paper was published later in 1994 in a DIMACS series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author =Nathaniel Dean and Gregory E. Shannon, Editors
 |title = DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science: Computational Support for Discrete Mathematics, DIMACS Workshop, March 12-14, 1992
 |year = 1994
 |publisher =American Mathematical Society
 |volume = 15
 |location = United States of America
 |isbn =0821866052
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NPDA then evolved into FLAP, including also finite state machines and Turing machines.
In 1993, a paper on Formal Languages and Automata Package
(FLAP) was published
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. LoSacco |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1993
 |title = FLAP: A Tool for Drawing and Simulating Automata
 |journal =EDMEDIA '93, World Conference on Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia
 |pages = 310–317
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the tool was written in C++ and [[X Window System|X Window]]. Around 1994, Rodger moved to 
[[Duke University]] and continued tool development. Around 1996, FLAP was converted to 
Java and the first paper mentioned JFLAP was published in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. Procopiuc, O. Procopiuc |author2=S. Rodger,
 |year =1996
 |title =Visualization and Interaction in the Computer Science Formal Languages Course with JFLAP
 |journal =1996 Frontiers in Education Conference
 |pages = 121–125
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along the way, other tools were developed as stand alone tools and then later integrated into JFLAP. 
For example, a  paper in 1999 described how JFLAP now allowed one to experiment with construction
type proofs, such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a mininal state DFA, and as another example, 
converting NPDA to CFG and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=E. Gramond  |author2=S. H. Rodger,
 |year =1999
 |title =Using JFLAP to Interact with Theorems in Automata Theory
 |journal =Thirtieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 336–340
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 JFLAP was converted to Swing. In 2005-2007 a study was run with fourteen institutions using 
JFLAP. A paper on this study in 2009 showed that students using JFLAP thought JFLAP made them feel more engaged in the 
class, and made learning the concepts easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Susan H. Rodger |author2=Eric Wiebe |author3=Kyung Min Lee |author4=Chris Morgan |author5=Kareem Omar |author6=Jonathan Su |year =2009
 |title = Increasing Engagement in Automata Theory with JFLAP
 |journal =Fortieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 403–407
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of JFLAP is covered on the jflap.org site, and includes 
over 35 students from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Duke University]] who have worked on 
JFLAP and related tools since 1990.

A paper by Chakraborty, Saxena and Katti entitled "Fifty years of automata simulation: a review" 
in ACM Inroads magazine in December 2011 stated the following about JFLAP:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author1=P. Chakraborty |author2=P.C. Saxena |author3=C. P. Katti |year = 2011
 |title =Fifty years of automata simulation: a review
 |journal =ACM Inroads
 |volume =2
 |issue=4
 |pages = 59–70
 |doi=10.1145/2038876.2038893
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The effort put into developing this tool is unparalleled in the field of simulation of automata. As a result, today it is the most sophisticated tool for simulating automata. It now covers a large number of topics on automata and related fields. The tool is also the best documented among the tools for simulation of automata." and "The tool uses state of the art graphics and is one of the easiest to use. The tool is undoubtedly the most widely used tool for simulation of automata developed to date. Thousands of students have used it at numerous universities in more than a hundred countries."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Lavizan-Shian''' was an alleged undeclared nuclear site north-eastern [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. The site was under investigation by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] as a potential undeclared nuclear site. According to Reuters, claims by the US that topsoil has been removed and the site had been sanitized could not be verified by IAEA investigators who visited Lavizan. In Paragraph 39 of the IAEA's November 2005 report on Iran, the IAEA stated "The information provided by Iran appeared to be coherent and consistent with its explanation of the razing of the Lavisan-Shian area."

In [[astronomy]], '''limiting magnitude''' is the faintest [[apparent magnitude]] of a [[celestial body]] that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.unh.edu/observatory/faqs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203124747/http://www.physics.unh.edu/observatory/faqs |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }} (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, limiting magnitude refers to the upper threshold of detection. In more formal uses, limiting magnitude is specified along with the strength of the signal (e.g., "10th magnitude at 20 [[Standard deviation|sigma]]"). Sometimes limiting magnitude is qualified by the purpose of the instrument (e.g., "10th magnitude for [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]") This statement recognizes that a photometric detector can detect light far fainter than it can reliably measure.

The [[International Dark-Sky Association]] has been vocal in championing the cause of reducing [[skyglow]] and [[light pollution]].

==Naked eye visibility==
The limiting magnitude for naked eye visibility refers to the faintest stars that can be seen with the unaided eye near the [[zenith]] on clear moonless nights. The quantity is most often used as an overall indicator of [[sky brightness]], in that light polluted and humid areas generally have brighter limiting magnitudes than remote desert or high altitude areas. The limiting magnitude will depend on the observer, and will increase with the eye's dark adaptation. On a relatively clear sky, the limiting visibility will be about 6th magnitude.&lt;ref name= "udel"&gt;http://www.physics.udel.edu/~jlp/classweb2/directory/powerpoint/telescopes.pdf (retrieved January 28 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There is even variation within metropolitan areas. For those who live in the immediate suburbs of [[New York City]], the limiting magnitude might be 4.0. This corresponds to roughly 250 visible stars, or one-tenth the number that can be perceived under perfectly dark skies.  From the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan ([[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[Staten Island]] and the [[Bronx]]), the limiting magnitude might be 3.0, suggesting that at best, only about 50 stars might be seen at any one time. From brightly lit Midtown [[Manhattan]], the limiting magnitude is possibly 2.0, meaning that from the heart of New York City only approximately 15 stars will be visible at any given time.

From relatively dark suburban areas, the limiting magnitude is frequently closer to 5 or somewhat fainter, but from very remote and clear sites, some amateur astronomers can see nearly as faint as 8th magnitude.  Many basic observing references quote a limiting magnitude of 6, as this is the approximate limit of star maps which date from before the invention of the telescope. Ability in this area, which requires the use of [[averted vision]], varies substantially from observer to observer, with both youth and experience being beneficial.

Limiting magnitude is traditionally estimated by searching for faint stars of known magnitude. In 2013 an app was developed based on Google's [[Sky Map]] that allows non-specialists to estimate the limiting magnitude in polluted areas using their phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hanlon|first=Larry|title=Turn Yourself into a Skyglow Meter|newspaper=Discovery News|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur astronomy==

In [[amateur astronomy]], limiting magnitude refers to the faintest objects that can be viewed with a telescope. A two-inch telescope, for example, will gather about 16 times more light than a typical eye, and will allow stars to be seen to about 10th magnitude; a ten-inch (25 cm) telescope will gather about 400 times as much light as the typical eye, and will see stars down to roughly 14th magnitude,&lt;ref name= "udel" /&gt; although these magnitudes are very dependent on the observer and the seeing conditions.

===Calculating limiting magnitude===
Limiting magnitude can be calculated by using a telescope.

As a first approximation, the gain in magnitudes of a telescope is &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot \log_{10}(\frac{D_1}{D_0})&lt;/math&gt;, where D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the diameter of the telescope's primary light gathering component, and D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the diameter of the eye's dark adapted pupil. Both quantities must be measured in the same units.  D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; varies from person to person but is typically 6–7&amp;nbsp;mm (~1/4").

A 10-inch (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 254mm) telescope therefore would provide a gain of about 8 magnitudes beyond what could be observed without it.  Thus, if one is at a site where the naked eye limiting magnitude (NELM) is 5, the telescope will allow one to see stars as faint as about magnitude 13.

In reality a telescope allows one to see much fainter stars because at higher powers the background is darkened and contrast increased. A typical 10-inch scope at high power (250× or more) will easily reach magnitude 15.{{fact|date=June 2016}} A formula including a correction for improved contrast is {{fact|date=June 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt; m_{improved with telescope} =m_{naked eye}-2+2.5 \cdot \log_{10}(D \cdot P \cdot t) &lt;/math&gt;
where&lt;br&gt;
D = objective or main mirror diameter in mm&lt;br&gt;
P = power or magnification&lt;br&gt;
t = transmission factor, usually 0.85–0.9.

==Large observatories==
Telescopes at large observatories are typically located at sites selected for dark skies.  They also increase the limiting magnitude by using long integration times on the detector, and by using image-processing techniques to increase the signal to noise ratio.  The [[Keck Telescope]], for example, 10 meters in diameter, can detect stars at 24 to 26th magnitude using a one-hour integration and [[adaptive optics]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/optics/lgsao/nirc2sens.html (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even higher limiting magnitudes can be achieved for telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], where the sky brightness due to the atmosphere is not relevant.  For orbital telescopes, the background sky brightness is set by the [[zodiacal light]].  The Hubble telescope can detect objects as faint as 31st magnitude,&lt;ref name="maron"&gt;http://www.jaymaron.com/telescopes/telescopes.html (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/10th/vault/allabout.shtml (retrieved Jan 28 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (operating in the [[infrared]] spectrum) is expected to have a magnitude limit of 34th magnitude.&lt;ref name="maron" /&gt;

{{main|Vincent van Gogh}}
The events that befell the early '''paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh''' in the period prior to the posthumous recognition of [[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853 – 1890) as an innovative artist show how the appreciation of his legacy changed [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|his reputation]] in a relatively short time.

A part of the work that remained with his family when he left the Netherlands must be considered '''[[Lost artworks|lost]]''', and the remaining [[early works of Vincent van Gogh]] tell an incomplete story. Van Gogh himself wrote that he had stored some 70 painted studies in the attic of his studio when he left The Hague, but only some 25 of these are now known.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Letter 391" &gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 391: To Theo van Gogh. Hoogeveen, Friday, 28 September 1883|url= http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let391/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= Note 8|quote= I have more than 70 painted studies lying in The Hague ...|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those involved in the early trade have been interviewed by journalists and art researchers, but the literature on Van Gogh relies and focuses largely on his [[List of works by Vincent van Gogh|known existing work]].

== To Breda ==
[[File:WLANL - artanonymous - Stilleven met bijbel.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Bible'', 1885, Nuenen.]]
The father of Vincent van Gogh, the [[Nuenen]] pastor [[Van Gogh's family in his art#Theodorus van Gogh|Theo van Gogh]], died unexpectedly on 26 March 1885. Vincent moved to Antwerp on November 27. In the following months his mother, Anna-Cornelia van Gogh-Carbentus, decided to move to a smaller home for her and her daughter [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]. They found an upper part of a house on the corner of the Nieuwe Ginnekenstraat and Wapenplein (nowadays Van Coothplein 33 A) in [[Breda]] and moved there on 30 March 1886 (coincidentally Vincent's 33rd birthday).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Vincent's mother had a part of the furniture, including Vincent's possessions, stored because the new house had insufficient space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jo van Gogh-Bonger's Memoir of Vincent van Gogh|url=http://www.vggallery.com/misc/archives/jo_memoir.htm|publisher=vggallery.com|quote=When in May his mother also left Nuenen, everything belonging to Vincent was packed in cases, left in the care of a carpenter in Breda and--forgotten! After several years the carpenter finally sold everything to a junk dealer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ended up in a warehouse owned by a carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen, living in the Ginnekenstraat. When the furniture and boxes were later retrieved, Vincent's sister Wil discovered traces of [[woodworm]] in the crates and it was decided to leave it with Schrauwen in the attic.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stockvis|first=Benno J.|title=Letter from Benno J. Stokvis to n/a Breda, 1926|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/15/etc-A13a.htm%20Lost%20works|publisher=WebExhibits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Rubbish" of Vincent ==
In the period from November 1885 until the end of February 1886, Vincent wrote from Antwerp to his brother Theo in Paris various letters about the upcoming move in March 1886 of his mother and sister. He wondered if he had to help with arrangements in Nuenen. Vincent went to Paris at the end of February 1886 and he did not help his family with packing. When the family moved, the things that Vincent had left behind when he went to Antwerp, including wood engravings and books, were stored in a carpenter's attic in Breda. The carpenter's name was Adrianus Schrauwen. In a letter from Arles to his sister Wil from June 1888 Vincent writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh. Arles, between Saturday, 16 and Wednesday, 20 June 1888|at= note 9|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let626/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Speaking of rubbish... It is perhaps worth saving what is good among the rubbish which, as Theo says, is still in an attic somewhere in Breda. I dare not ask, however, and perhaps it is lost, so do not worry about it.

According to specialist researcher [[Jan Hulsker]] in his book ''Van Gogh door Van Gogh'' (1973) the word rubbish refers not to Vincent's own work, but to books and woodcuts, illustrations which he had taken from magazines and such. In a postscript of a letter in early August 1888, Vincent asks Wil to bring him some wood engravings and prints that had remained in Breda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Sunday, 15 July 1888|at= note 12|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let642/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of Schrauwen ==
This could mean that Vincent considered his work in the attic at Schrauwen lost. In any case, in 1888 Theo and Wil knew of belongings that had been left behind in Breda. In a letter from Vincent to Wil (end of October 1889) he says that Wil and her mother would move shortly thereafter to Leiden. The population register in Breda mentions that the move took place on November 2, 1889. On this basis, it is assumed that in the beginning of November 1889 his mother and Wil reclaimed their possessions from Schrauwen, but left Vincent's boxes because of the alleged woodworm.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

Stokvis writes in his ''Research about Vincent van Gogh in Brabant'' (Nasporingen omtrent Vincent van Gogh in Brabant, 1926) on page 27:

:At the request of the old Mrs Van Gogh one of the sisters Begemann (in Nuenen) had a part of what had been left behind in the studio, packed in boxes and sent to carpenter Schrauwen in Breda after the departure of the family.

Years later, Schrauwen considered himself the rightful owner of the boxes because nobody had ever picked them up, he broke them open, took the folders with drawings, sketches and watercolors, and used the wood for various other purposes.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

== Role of Couvreur ==
Seventeen years later, in 1903, Schrauwen invited a market merchant Mr. J.C. Couvreur to sell some belongings, such as a small can, a pot and other kitchen equipment. Couvreur offered 2.50 guilders and Schrauwen accepted on condition that he also take the rubbish which he had stored in his attic for so long. Couvreur agreed and stored the approximately sixty paintings, one hundred and fifty loose canvases, eighty pen drawings and between one hundred and two hundred chalk drawings in the basement of his house in the Stallingstraat in Breda.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peasant and peasant woman planting potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Planting Potatoes'', April 1885, Nuenen.]]
[[File:Basket of Potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Potatoes'', September 1885, Nuenen.]]
He spoke of this in an article in the newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' on 25 April 1938:

:So I had those things in the basement, higgledy-piggledy, my wife looked there every now and then, flipped through the drawings and saw many nude studies. She said to me: That I do not want to have in my house, it must go. I said: you can never know what those things may turn out to be worth, but my wife said: those things go out the door or I go out the door. In such a case, things go out the door. So I went into my basement one day, picked up all drawings that were somewhat offensive, put them in a big bag and when that bag was full, I brought it to the paper factory of Tilburg to be ground to paper; I've had a few dimes for it. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

After clearing his basement of the bags with nude drawings, Couvreur wanted to get rid of the remaining pictures as well and he approached a Rotterdam paintings merchant, called De Winter, who thought it was worthless, according to Couvreur in an article on 18 February 1950 in the Breda newspaper ''De Stem''. Couvreur also delivered some paintings to Frans Meeuwissen, the owner of the café at the corner of Ginnekenstraat and Stallingstraat, who sold them or gave them away to customers. If someone offered Couvreur a beer, he could have a Van Gogh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Van Gogh's for a dime ===
Couvreur was planning on selling the remaining canvases and drawings on the market, he tells in a ''Telegraaf'' newspaper article:

:I have stood on the market with a cart for thirty years. I pinned the drawings and paintings of Van Gogh on the cart and anyone could have one for ten cents. Sometimes I gave them to the children on the street to play with. One of those pieces I had to buy back later for seventy-five guilders. I was now gradually getting rid of the items in the basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to his story one day on his way to the market in the Ginnekenstraat the tailor C. Mouwen approached him to buy some paintings. Couvreur sold him six canvases for ten cents each. Later in the day a maid of Mouwen came and asked if she could have another six for the same price.

:My wife says: now don't be silly, he does not do it for fun, those things are worth more that. You need to ask not one, but two dimes apiece. I said to the girl: thank Mr. Mouwen and tell him he can get six for two dimes apiece. The girl went away, came back and said that Mr. Mouwen would not go higher than 35 cents per piece. I quickly sold them for thirty-five cents per piece.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In a short time the amounts went tenfold, and then again:

:Then one morning comes which I shall never forget. Coincidentally I get a newspaper in my hands and I see that Van Gogh is a [[posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|famous painter]]. Well, I thought, now I understand how that Mr. Mouwen could make me earn 25 cents on a painting! I spoke with him and we agreed that I would try to find the people to whom I had sold paintings for a dime and fifteen cents, and ask them to sell the pictures back. We have been busy with that for a while. For example, there was a farmer who had two pieces of me. I went to the man and said: can I have them back for a two and half guilders? And he gave them for 2.50 guilders. ... It was a strange story. To get them back I had to pay fifty, sixty, seventy guilders to the parents of the children to whom I had sold those paintings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The majority of the retrieved works was bought by C. Mouwen, who loaned some fifty paintings for an exhibition with [[art dealer]] Oldenzeel in Rotterdam in January 1903 and sold 25 paintings at an auction on 3 May 1904, and an unknown number went to his cousin W. van Bakel, lecturer at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Because the names of the buyers have not all been recorded, traces of early works by Van Gogh continued to get lost until the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Breda Museum's ''Lost and Found'' exhibition ==

Breda Museum hosted an exhibition called ''Vincent van Gogh: Lost and Found'' between November 2003 and February 2004. The show-piece of the exhibition was a painting ''Houses near the Hague'',  which the museum claimed had been authenticated by their experts as painted by Vincent on the basis of x-ray analysis. The painting had come from the so-called Marijnissen collection of Barend den Houter, a tax official at Breda. This collection had formerly been examined by experts in 1940 and declared unimportant, consisting of forgeries or work by little known contemporaries. However, Breda Museum said they had uncovered a connection between den Houter and Vincent's mother. The [[Van Gogh Museum]] said they were sceptical about the authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alleged newly discovered van Gogh|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3541333/ns/today-entertainment/t/alleged-newly-discovered-van-gogh/#.T1lRjXmO4rU|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=12 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement in response to questions raised by the exhibition 'Lost and Found' at the Breda's Museum|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=8000&amp;lang=en|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|date=18 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) pp. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">'''Lumicera''' is a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[ceramic]] developed by [[Murata Manufacturing|Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.]] 

[[Murata Manufacturing]] first developed transparent polycrystalline ceramics in February 2001. This [[polycrystalline]] ceramic is a type of [[dielectric resonator]] material commonly used in [[microwave]]s and [[millimeter wave]]s. While offering superior electrical properties, high levels of [[transmittance|transmissivity]], and [[refractive index]], it also has good optical characteristics without [[birefringence]].

Normally, ceramics are opaque because pores are formed at triple points where grains intersect, causing scattering of incident light. [[Murata Manufacturing|Murata]] has optimized the entire development process of making dense and homogenous ceramics to improve their performance.

Under recommendations from [[Casio]], the material itself has been refined for use in digital camera optical lenses by endowing it with improved transmission of short wavelength light and by reducing pores inside ceramics that reduce transparency.

Lumicera has the same light transmitting qualities as optical glass commonly used in today's conventional camera lenses, however it has refractive index (nd = 2.08 at 587 nm[https://web.archive.org/web/20080820100051/http://lvpcug.org/newsletters/down_the_road/2005/March_05.html]) much greater than that of optical glass (nd = 1.5 – 1.85 [http://www.opticiansfriend.com/lenses.html]) and offers superior strength. The Lumicera Z variant is described as [[barium oxide]] based material,[http://www.performance-materials.net/secure/assets/i20060205.651776_43e59e702e6a.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} not containing any environmentally hazardous materials (e.g. [[lead]]). 

Lumicera is transparent up to 10 micrometers, making it useful for instruments operating in mid-[[infrared]] spectrum.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722073533/http://www.ile.osaka-u.ac.jp/zone1/public/publication/apr/2006/pdf/6/6.22.pdf]

Lumicera is a trademark of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

Lumicera is used in some [[Casio Exilim]] cameras, where it allowed 20% reduction of the lens profile.[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04080401casioceramiclens.asp]

In the field of [[control engineering]], a '''map-based controller''' is a controller whose outputs are based on values derived from a pre-defined [[lookup table]]. The inputs to the controller are usually values taken from one or more sensors and are used to index the output values in the lookup table. By effectively placing the [[transfer function]] as discrete entries within a lookup table, engineers free to modify smaller sections or update the whole list of entries as required.

Map-based controllers are frequently used to manage fuel delivery systems in modern [[internal combustion engine]]s.

The '''Marine Biological Laboratory''' ('''MBL''') is an international center for research and education in biological and environmental science. Founded in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. After being independent for most of its history, it became affiliated with the university on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/|title=Affiliation with University of Chicago|website=Affiliation with University of Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-uchicago-faq/|title=MBL – University of Chicago Affiliation FAQ|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collaborates with numerous other institutions.

== Introduction ==
The MBL has approximately 250 year-round employees, about half of which are scientists and scientific support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-facts/|title=About the MBL|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are joined each year by more than 500 visiting scientists, summer staff, and research associates from hundreds of institutions around the world, as well as a large number of faculty and students participating in MBL courses (in 2016, 550 students from  333 institutions and 58 countries).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The MBL's resident research centers are the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, the Ecosystems Center, and the Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution. Visiting scientists are affiliated with the MBL's Whitman Center. Other resources include The Marine Resources Center, an advanced facility for maintaining, culturing, and providing aquatic and marine organisms essential to biological, biomedical, and ecological research; and The National Xenopus Resource, which breeds and maintains Xenopus (frog) genetic stocks; and provides training in Xenopus husbandry, cell biology, imaging, genetics, transgenesis, and genomics.  

Research at the MBL focuses on four themes:

* fundamental biological research, often using marine organisms as novel model systems, encompassing research in regenerative biology, neuroscience, sensory physiology, and comparative evolution and genomics;
* the study of microbiomes and microbial diversity and ecology in a variety of ocean and terrestrial habitats;
* imaging and computation;
* ecosystems science and climate change, and organismal adaptation to changing environments.

The MBL offers a range of courses, workshops, conferences, and internships throughout the year. Central to its programs are more than 20 Advanced Research Training Courses, graduate-level courses in topics ranging from physiology, embryology, neurobiology, and microbiology to imaging and computation integrated with biological research. In addition, the MBL hosts courses for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Chicago and other colleges and universities, as well as workshops and conferences—accommodating more than 2,600 participants in 2016. (MBL Facts).

Among the scientists with a significant affiliation with the MBL (scientists, course faculty and students) are 57 Nobel Prize winners (since 1929); 124 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators, early career scientists, international researchers, and professors (since 1960); 263 Members of the National Academy of Sciences (since 1960); and 219 Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1960). 

The MBL shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences, and houses a growing archival collection, including photograph and videos from the MBL's 120-year history. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects.

In September 2018, Nipam Patel became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/introducing-nipam-patel-director-marine-biological-laboratory/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Neil Shubin, Ph.D., and Melina Hale, Ph.D., were named interim co-directors of the Marine Biological Laboratory, succeeding [[Huntington F. Willard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/uchicago-faculty-members-to-serve-on-marine-biological-laboratory-interim-leadership-team/|title=UChicago Faculty Members to Serve on MBL Interim Leadership Team|author=|date=|website=www.mbl.edu|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Marine Biological Laboratory grew from the vision of several Bostonians and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the United State's first Fish Commissioner (a government official concerned with the use of [[fisheries]]). Baird had set up a [[United States Fish Commission]] research station in Woods Hole in 1882, and had ambitions to expand it into a major laboratory. He invited [[Alpheus Hyatt]] to move his marine biology laboratory and school which he had founded at the [[Norwood-Hyatt House]] in [[Annisquam, Massachusetts]], to Woods Hole. Inspired by Harvard biologist [[Louis Agassiz]]'s short-lived summer school of natural history on Penikese Island, off the coast of Woods Hole, Hyatt accepted the offer. With $10,000 raised by the Woman's Education Association of Boston and the [[Boston Society of Natural History]], land was purchased, a building was erected, and the MBL was incorporated with Hyatt as the first president of the board of trustees. The Fish Commission supplied crucial support, including marine organisms and running sea water.

[[Charles Otis Whitman]], an embryologist, was retained as the first director of the MBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/charles-otis-whitman-1842-1910|title=Charles Otis Whitman (1842-1910) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|website=embryo.asu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman, who believed “other things being equal, the investigator is always the best instructor,” emphasized the need to combine research and education at the new laboratory. The MBL's first summer course provided a six-week introduction to invertebrate zoology; facilities for visiting summer investigators were also offered.

The MBL Library was established in 1889, with scientist and future MBL trustee [[Cornelia Clapp]] serving as librarian. In 1899, the MBL began publishing ''[[The Biological Bulletin]]'', a scientific journal that is still edited at the MBL.

[[Gertrude Stein]], later well known as a novelist and art collector, took part in MBL's Embryology course in the summer of 1897, while her brother Leo took part in the Invertebrates course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comm.archive.mbl.edu/publications/women_stein.html |title=Women of Science, Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Inside the MBL |publisher= |access-date=August 2, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=1897 |title=Embryology Class 1897 |medium=Photograph |url=https://hpsrepository.asu.edu/handle/10776/12859 |access-date= |archive-url= |location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts |publisher=Marine Biological Laboratory Archives |quote=1897 Embryology Class, six women sitting in front row, two rows of men standing behind them, many with hats on, most looking at camera.

The MBL formally affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]] on July 1, 2013. In order to further scientific research and education, the affiliation builds on historical ties with the university, as MBL was led by University of Chicago faculty members in its first four decades.  The president of the university chairs the MBL trustee's board and with their advice appoints its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/2013/11/27/university-of-chicago-president-robert-j-zimmer-to-serve-as-chairman-of-marine-biological-laboratory-board-of-trustees-2/|title=University of Chicago President Robert J.

== Research History ==
=== Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology ===
Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology have been a central part of the MBL's programs since the 1890s. Important discoveries in these fields at the MBL reach back to 1899, when [[Jacques Loeb]] demonstrated artificial parthenogenesis in sea urchin eggs; to 1905, when [[Edwin Grant Conklin]] first identified egg cytoplasmic regions that are programmed to form certain tissues or organs; to 1916, when [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] identified circulating hormones that influence sexual differentiation (Lillie, 1944). In the MBL's first two decades, cytologists [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Nettie Stevens]] and others made connections between the chromosomes and Mendelian heredity, while Wilson's colleague at both the MBL and Columbia University, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], launched the field of experimental genetics (Pauly, 2000:158). [[Keith R. Porter]], considered by many to be a founder of modern cell biology due to his pioneering work on the fine structure of cells, including the discovery of [[microtubules]], carried out research at the MBL starting in 1937 and directed the laboratory from 1975-77 (Barlow et al., 1993: 95-115).

The MBL is also a proving ground for new technologies in [[microscopy]] and imaging. The availability of cutting-edge imaging instrumentation in the MBL's Advanced Research Courses puts faculty and students at the forefront of experimentation. MBL Distinguished Scientist [[Osamu Shimomura]], who joined the MBL in 1983, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) in the early 1960s, which led to the development of revolutionary techniques for imaging live cells and their components. Resident Distinguished Scientist Shinya Inoué's innovations in polarized light microscopy and video imaging since the 1950s have been instrumental in clarifying the cellular events of [[mitosis]], including his discovery of the [[spindle fibers]].

The MBL has long been a center for the world's experts in cell division. In the early 1980s, [[Tim Hunt]], Joan Ruderman and others at the MBL identified the first of a class of proteins that regulate the cycle of cell division ([[cyclin]]). Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001 for this work (Hunt, 2004). In 1984, [[Ron Vale]], Michael Sheetz, and others discovered [[kinesin]], a motor protein involved in mitosis and other cellular processes, during summer MBL research. Vale, Sheetz, and James Spudich received the 2012 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their discoveries related to molecular motors. In 1991 Israeli scientist [[Avram Hershko]] began coming to the MBL to study the role that the protein ubiquitin plays in cell division. In 2004, Hershko won a Nobel Prize for his work to establish the basic mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

A large portion of the leading developmental biologists in the United States, both historically and today, have participated in the MBL's Embryology Course as directors, lecturers or students. One draw is the Woods Hole location and the availability of marine organisms, particularly the [[sea urchin]], that are ideal for embryological analysis because they shed nearly transparent eggs which are fertilized and develop externally. In the first decades after the course was founded in 1893, its faculty pioneered research directions that remain central today, including the study of cytoplasmic localization in eggs; embryonic cell lineage (important in modern [[stem cell]] research); and [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (today called ‘evo devo'). Some distinguished embryologists who have directed the course are [[Charles Otis Whitman]] (1893–1895); [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] (1896–1903); Viktor Hamburger (1942–45); James Ebert (1962–66); [[Eric H. Davidson]] (1972–74; 1988–96); Rudolf Raff (1980–82) (see Davidson, 1993) and  Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and Richard Behringer (2012-2016).

=== Regenerative biology and medicine ===
In 2010, the MBL established the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, where researchers study the ability of marine and other animals to spontaneously regenerate damaged or aging body parts. An understanding of tissue and organ regeneration in lower animals holds promise for translation to treatments for human conditions, including spinal cord injury, diabetes, organ failure, and degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer's.  A cornerstone of the Bell Center is a national resource for research on the frog, Xenopus, which is a major animal model used in U.S. biomedical research. The National Xenopus Resource at the MBL is funded by the National Institutes of Health (MBL Facts).

=== Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology ===
The MBL's contributions to [[neuroscience]] and sensory physiology are significant, fostered today by more than 65 visiting investigators and resident researchers in these fields, as well as five graduate- and post-graduate level Advanced Research Training courses. The MBL has been a magnet for the discipline since L.W. Williams in 1910 discovered, and [[John Zachary Young]] in 1936 rediscovered, the [[squid giant axon]], a nerve fiber that is 20 times larger in diameter than the largest human axon. Young brought this locally abundant, ideal experimental system to the attention of his MBL colleague [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|KS Cole]], who in 1938 used it to record the resistance changes underlying the action potential, which provided evidence that ions flowing across the axonal membrane generate this electrical impulse. In 1938, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] came to the MBL to learn about the squid giant axon from Cole. After World War II, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]], working in Plymouth, England and using the [[voltage clamp]] technique developed by Cole, laid the basis for the modern understanding of electrical activity in the nervous system by measuring quantitatively the flow of ions across the axonal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley received the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction (Barlow et al., 1993: 151-172). Following on Hodgkin and Huxley's work, in the 1960s and 1970s [[Clay Armstrong]] and other MBL researchers described a number of the properties of the [[ion channels]] that allow sodium and potassium ions to carry electric current across the cell membrane and [[Rodolfo Llinas]] described the transmission properties at the squid giant synapse (Llinas 1999). The “scientific career” of the “Woods Hole squid,” ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii|Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii]]'', continues today, with studies on [[axonal transport]], the [[squid giant synapse]], squid genomics, and the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

Other marine organisms draw neuroscientists and neurobiologists to the MBL each summer, where a history of research into sensory physiology and behavior has been established. [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]], an MBL summer investigator in the 1920s and early 1930s, uncovered several basic mechanisms of photoreceptor function through his studies on the horseshoe crab. Hartline shared the 1967 Nobel Prize with summer MBL colleague [[George Wald]], who described the molecular basis of photoreception by showing that the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules consist of a slightly modified form of vitamin A coupled to a protein.  Another long-term summer investigator, [[Stephen W. Kuffler]], is credited with “founding” the science of [[neurobiology]] in the mid-1960s at Harvard Medical School and he also initiated instruction in neurobiology at the MBL (Barlow et al., 1993:175-234; 203-234). [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] (Nobel Laureate in 1937) conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986, most significantly on the biochemical nature of muscular contraction.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Frederik Bang and Jack Levin at the MBL discovered that the blood of the horseshoe crab clotted when exposed to bacterial endotoxins even in vanishingly small amounts. From this basic research, a reagent, Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), was developed that can detect minute amounts of bacterial toxins. The [[LAL test]] has resulted in dramatic improvement in the quality of drugs and biological products for intravenous injection.

=== Ecosystems science ===
Ecosystems research became a year-round commitment at the MBL in 1962 with the founding of the Systematics-Ecology program, under the direction of Melbourne R. Carriker. In 1975, the MBL's Ecosystems Center was established, with George Woodwell as director. The original research focus was on the global [[carbon cycle]], an emphasis maintained today. The Ecosystems Center has a year-round staff of more than 40 scientists who study a variety of ecosystems and their responses to human activities and environmental changes. The center is located in Woods Hole yet has a global reach, with active research sites in the Arctic tundra; in forest, coastal and marine sites in New England, Sweden and Brazil. The Ecosystems Center is home to two of the 26 U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Toolik Lake, Alaska; and Plum Island, Massachusetts. Scientists in the Ecosystems Center study the effects of forest clearance and land-use change on atmospheric chemistry, watershed processes and coastal ecology, the global-scale anthropogenic enrichment of the [[nitrogen cycle]], and ecosystem responses to [[global warming]]. The interim director of the Ecosystems Center is Anne Giblin. Former directors of the Center who are still active on the scientific staff are Jerry Melillo, who studies the [[biogeochemistry]] of terrestrial ecosystems, and John Hobbie, a microbial ecologist. The Ecosystems Center is founded on a vision of collaborative, interdisciplinary science; shared lab facilities and instrumentation; and a long-term, large-scale, systems-wide view of ecosystem processes.

=== Comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and microbial ecology ===
The Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded at the MBL in 1997 and is currently directed by David Mark Welch. By comparing diverse [[genomes]], scientists at the center are elucidating the evolutionary relationships of biological systems, and describing genes and genomes of biomedical and environmental significance. [[Microorganisms]] found in a wide range of ecosystems, including the human [[microbiome]], are studied. [[Mitchell Sogin]], the Bay Paul Center's founder, also founded two courses at the MBL: the Workshop in Molecular Evolution; and Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures. In 2003-2004, Sogin launched the International Census of Marine Microbes, a global effort to describe the [[biodiversity]] of marine micro-organisms. Early results from this census in 2006 revealed some 10 to 100 times more types of marine microbes than expected, and the vast majority are previously unknown, low-abundance microorganisms now called the “rare biosphere.” Other Bay Paul Center projects are focused on microbes that live in extreme environments, from [[hydrothermal vents]] to highly acidic ecosystems, which may lead to a better understanding of life that could exist on other planets. Activities at the Bay Paul Center are supported by advanced DNA sequencing and other genomics equipment at the center's Keck Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Facility.

In [[social anthropology]], '''matrilocal residence''' or '''matrilocality''' (also '''uxorilocal residence''' or '''uxorilocality''') is the [[Society|societal]] system in which  a married couple resides with or near the wife's parents. Thus, the female offspring of a [[mother]] remain living in (or near) the mother's [[house]], thereby forming large [[clan]]-families, typically consisting of three or four [[generation]]s living in the same place.

== Description ==
Frequently, visiting [[marriage]] is being practiced, meaning that [[husband]] and [[wife]] are living apart in their separate families, seeing each other in their spare time. The [[child]]ren of such marriages are raised by the mother's extended [[matrilineal]] clan. The father does not have a significant role in the upbringing of his own children; he does, however, in that of his sisters' children (his [[niece]]s and [[nephews]]). In direct consequence, [[property]] is [[inheritance|inherited]] from generation to generation, and, overall, remains largely undivided.

Matrilocal residence is found most often in [[horticulture|horticultural]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Haviland | first=William A. | title=Anthropology | location=Belmont, CA | date=2003 | edition=10th | publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | isbn=978-0534610203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of matrilocal societies include the people of [[Ngazidja]] in the [[Comoros]], the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] of [[Chaco Canyon]], the [[Nair]] community in [[Kerala]] in [[South India]], the [[Mosuo|Moso]] of [[Yunnan]] and [[Sichuan]] in southwestern [[China]], the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] of [[Taiwan]], and the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of western [[Sumatra]]. Among indigenous people of the [[Amazon basin]] this residence pattern is often associated with the customary practice of [[brideservice]], as seen among the [[Urarina]] of northeastern [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dean | first=Bartholomew | title=Urarina society, cosmology, and history in peruvian amazonia. | location=Gainesville | date=2013 | publisher=University Press of Florida | isbn= 9780813049519}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary [[mainland China]], matrilocal residence has been encouraged by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wolf | first=Margery | title=Revolution Postponed: Women in Contemporary China China | publisher=Stanford University Press| date=1985 | isbn=978-0804713481|pages=196–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to counter the problem of unbalanced male-majority [[sex ratio]]s caused by the [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|abortion, infanticide]] and [[Child abandonment|abandonment]] of girls. Because girls traditionally marry out in [[Patrilocal residence|virilocal marriage]] (living with or near the husband's parents) they have been seen as "mouths from another family" or as a waste of resources to raise. During the [[Song Dynasty]] in medieval China, matrilocal marriage became common for wealthy non-aristocratic families.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In other regions of the world, such as [[Japan]], during the [[Heian period]], a marriage of this type was not a sign of high status, but rather an indication of the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal authority]] of the woman's family (her father or grandfather), who was sufficiently powerful to demand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ramusack | first=Barbara N. |author2=Sievers, Sharon L. | title=Women in Asia: restoring women to history | date=1999 | publisher=Indiana University Press | isbn=9780253212672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another matrilocal society is the [[!Kung San]] of Southern Africa. They practice uxorilocality for the bride service period, which lasts until the couple has produced three children or they have been together for more than ten years. At the end of the bride service period, the couple has a choice of which clan they want to live with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stockard, Janice E.|title=Marriage in Culture|location=Australia|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Technically, uxorilocality differs from matrilocality; uxorilocality means the couple settles with the wife's family, while matrilocality means the couple settles with the wife's lineage. Because the !Kung do not live in lineages, they cannot be matrilocal; they are uxorilocal.)

Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (by, for example, [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], and [[George Peter Murdock]]) connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, for many years cross-cultural tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. On the other hand, [[Korotayev]]'s tests have shown that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general [[polygyny]] factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys matrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple [[Linear regression|regression]] model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Korotayev | first=Andrey | title=Form of Marriage, Sexual Division of Labor, and Postmarital Residence in Cross-Cultural Perspective: A Reconsideration| journal=Journal of Anthropological Research  | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14683590 | volume=59 | issue=1 | pages=69–89 |year=2003|jstor=3631445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Korotayev | first=Andrey | title=Division of Labor by Gender and Postmarital Residence in Cross-Cultural Perspective: A Reconsideration | journal=Cross-Cultural Research | date=2003 | volume= 37 | issue= 4 | pages=335–372 | doi=10.1177/1069397103253685|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220144133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrilocality in the Arikari culture in the 17th–18th centuries was studied anew within [[feminist archaeology]] by Christi Mitchell, in a critique of a previous study,&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://anthro.appstate.edu/sites/anthro.appstate.edu/files/documents/ebooks/gender/ch09.html|author=Mitchell, Christi|chapter=10.

According to Barbara Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century criticized [[feminism|feminist]] [[matriarchy|promatriarchal]] views and said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination. Furthermore, militarism, destruction of the natural environment, and hierarchical social structures can be found in societies in which [[Mother goddess|goddess worship]], matrilocality, or matriliny exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Epstein | first=Barbara Leslie | title=Political protest and cultural revolution: nonviolent direct action in the 1970s and 1980s | location=Berkeley | date=1991 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0520070103 | page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Paleolithic]] Age: prehistoric period marked by the development of the most primitive stone tools}}{{Efn|[[Militarism]]: a belief in a strong military and its aggressive use}}{{Efn|[[Matrilineality|Matriliny]]: a system based on maternal descent}}

In [[sociobiology]], matrilocality refers to [[animal]] societies in which a [[pair bond]] is formed between animals born or hatched in different areas or different social groups, and the pair becomes resident in the female's home area or group.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term '''megadiverse country''' refers to any one of a group of nations that harbor the majority of Earth's species and high numbers of [[endemic species]]. [[Conservation International]] identified 17 megadiverse countries in 1998.&lt;ref name="AUSGOP"&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208141905/http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/26|title=Megadiverse Countries definition- Biodiversity A-Z |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are located in, or partially in, [[tropical]] or [[subtropical]] regions.

Mega diversity means exhibiting great diversity. The main criteria for megadiverse countries is endemism at the level of species, genera and families. A megadiverse country must have at least 5,000 species of endemic plants and must border marine ecosystems.

In 2002, [[Mexico]] formed a separate organisation focusing on Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries, consisting of countries rich in biological diversity and associated traditional knowledge. This organisation does not include all the megadiverse countries as identified by [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211011642/http://www.environment.gov.au/node/21579|title=Biodiversity, Australia State of the Environment Report 2001 (Theme Report): The meaning, significance and implications of biodiversity (Megadiverse countries)|date=2014-12-11|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancún initiative and declaration of like-minded megadiverse countries ==
[[File:Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries.png|thumb|400px|The 20 current like-minded megadiverse countries]]
On 18 February 2002, the Ministers in charge of the Environment and the Delegates of [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Venezuela]] assembled in [[Cancún]], Mexico. These countries declared to set up a '''Group of Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries''' as a mechanism for consultation and cooperation so that their interests and priorities, related to the preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, could be promoted. They also declared that they would call on those countries that had not become Parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], and the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on climate change to become parties to these agreements.

At the same time, they agreed to meet periodically, at the ministerial and expert levels, and decided that upon the conclusion of each annual Ministerial Meeting, the next rotating host country would take on the role of Secretary of the group, to ensure its continuity, the further development of cooperation among these countries, and to reach the various agreements and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/file-storage/download?file_id=11803|title=UNIDO – United Nations Industrial Development Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2010, Guatemala and Iran were also included in the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/planeta/internacional/paises_megadiversos.html|title=Plataforma de monitoreo de las actividades de implementación de la Estratgeia Nacional sobre Especies Invasoras (Previene) – Biodiversidad Mexicana – Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad|first=|last=CONABIO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Milieu intérieur''''' or interior [[:wikt:milieu|milieu]], from the [[French language|French]], ''milieu intérieur'' (the internal environment), is a phrase coined by [[Claude Bernard]] to refer to the [[Extracellular fluid|extra-cellular fluid environment]], more particularly the [[interstitial fluid]], and its [[physiology|physiological]] capacity to ensure protective stability for the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of [[multicellular organism]].

==Origin==

[[Claude Bernard]] used the phrase in several works from 1854 until his death in 1878. He most likely adopted it from the histologist [[Charles-Philippe Robin|Charles Robin]], who had employed the phrase "milieu de l’intérieur" as a synonym for the ancient [[Hippocrates|hippocratic]] idea of [[humors]]. Bernard was initially only concerned with the role of the blood but he later included that of the whole body in ensuring this internal stability.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, C. G. (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf "Claude Bernard and the constancy of the internal environment"] Neuroscientist 4: 380–385 [http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/5/380].&lt;/ref&gt; He summed up his idea as follows:

{{quote|The fixity of the milieu supposes a perfection of the organism such that the external variations are at each instant compensated for and equilibrated.... All of the vital mechanisms, however varied they may be, have always one goal, to maintain the uniformity of the conditions of life in the internal environment.... The stability of the internal environment is the condition for the free and independent life.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, C. (1974) ''Lectures on the phenomena common to animals and plants.'' Trans Hoff HE, Guillemin R, Guillemin L, Springfield (IL): Charles C Thomas {{ISBN|978-0-398-02857-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernard's work regarding the internal environment of regulation was supported by work in Germany at the same time. While Rudolf Virchow placed the focus on the cell, others, such as Carl von Rokitansky (1804–1878) continued to study humoral pathology particularly the matter of microcirculation. Von Rokitansky suggested that illness originated in damage to this vital microcirculation or internal system of communication. Hans Eppinger Jr. (1879–1946), a professor of internal medicine in Vienna, further
developed von Rokitansky's point of view and showed that every
cell requires a suitable environment which he called the [[ground substance]] for 
successful microcirculation. This work of German scientists was continued in the 20th century by Alfred Pischinger (1899–1982) who defined the connections between the ground substance or extracellular matrix and both the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems and saw therein a complex system of regulation for the body as a whole and for cellular functioning, which he termed the ground regulatory system (''das System der Grundregulation'').&lt;ref name=Pischinger&gt;{{cite book|last=Pischinger|first=Alfred|title=The Extracellular Matrix and Ground Regulation|year=2007|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley|isbn=1-55643-688-2|pages=Foreword by Hartmut Heine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reception==

Bernard’s idea was initially ignored in the 19th century. This happened in spite of Bernard being highly honored as the founder of modern physiology (he indeed received the first [[france|French]] state funeral for a scientist). Even the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica]] does not mention it. His ideas about milieu intérieur only became central to the understanding of physiology in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt; It was only with [[Joseph Barcroft]], [[Lawrence J. Henderson]], and particularly [[Walter Cannon]] and his idea of [[homeostasis]], that it received its present recognition and status.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cross | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Albury | first2 = W. R. | year = 1987 | title = Walter B. Cannon, L. J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy | url = | journal = Osiris | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 165–192 [175] | doi = 10.1086/368665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current 15th edition notes it as being Bernard's most important idea.

==Conceptual development==

Bernard created his concept to replace the ancient idea of [[Vitalism|life forces]] with that of a mechanistic process in which the body's physiology was regulated through multiple mechanical equilibrium adjustment feedbacks.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; Walter Cannon's later notion of homeostasis (while also mechanistic) lacked this concern, and was even advocated in the context of such ancient notions as [[vis medicatrix naturae]].&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

Cannon, in contrast to Bernard, saw the self-regulation of the body as a requirement for the evolutionary emergence and exercise of intelligence, and further placed the idea in a political context: "What corresponds in a nation to the internal environment of the body? The closest analogue appears to be the whole intricate system of production and distribution of merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannon | first1 = W. B | year = 1941 | title = The Body Physiologic and the Body Politic | journal = Science | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | jstor=1668231 | doi=10.1126/science.93.2401.1|bibcode = 1941Sci....93....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, as an analogy to the body's own ability to ensure internal stability, that society should preserve itself with a technocratic bureaucracy, "biocracy".&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

The idea of milieu intérieur, it has been noted, led [[Norbert Wiener]] to the notion of [[cybernetics]] and [[negative feedback]] creating self-regulation in the [[nervous system]] and in nonliving machines, and that "today, cybernetics, a formalization of Bernard’s constancy hypothesis, is viewed as one of the critical antecedents of contemporary cognitive science".&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

=== Idea of internal communication ===

In addition to providing the basis for understanding the internal physiology in terms of the interdependence of the cellular and extracellular matrix or ground system, Bernard's fruitful concept of the milieu intérieur has also led to significant research regarding the system of communication that allows for the complex dynamics of homeostasis.

==== Work by Szent-Györgyi ====
Initial work was conducted by Albert Szent-Györgyi who concluded that organic communication could not be explained solely by the random collisions of molecules and studied energy fields as well as the connective tissue. He was aware of earlier work by Moglich and Schon (1938)&lt;ref name=Moglich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moglich,|first=F.|author2=Schon, M.|title=Energy of vibration in crystals and molecular complexes|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan (1938)&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=P.|title=The physical structure of organic giant molecules|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=693–694|bibcode = 1938NW.....26..693J |doi = 10.1007/BF01606595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on non-electrolytic mechanisms of charge transfer in living systems. This was further explored and advanced by Szent-Györgyi in 1941 in a Koranyi Memorical Lecture in Budapest, published in both ''Science'' and ''Nature'', wherein he proposed that proteins are semi-conductors and capable of rapid transfer of free electrons within an organism. This idea was received with skepticism, but it is now generally accepted that most if not all parts of the extracellular matrix have semiconductor properties.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=F.|author2=Postow, E.|title=Semiconduction in proteins and lipids – its possible biological import|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=1969|volume=158|pages=161–190|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb56221.x|bibcode = 1969NYASA.158..161R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutman 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman, F.,|first=Lyons, L.E.|title=Organic Semiconductors|year=1981|publisher=Krieger|location=Malabar, FL|pages=Part A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Koranyi Lecture triggered a growing molecular-electronics industry, using biomolecular semiconductors in nanoelectronic circuits.

In 1988 Szent-Györgyi stated that "Molecules do not have to touch each other to interact. Energy can flow through... the electromagnetic field" which "along with water, forms the matrix of life." This water is related also to the surfaces of proteins, DNA and all living molecules in the matrix. This is a structured water that provides stability for metabolic functioning, and related to collagen as well, the major protein in the extracellular matrix&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=I.L.|title=Verification of simple hydration/dehydration methods to characterize multiple water compartments on Tendon Type 1 Collagen|journal=Cell Biology International|year=2007|volume=31|issue=6|pages=531–539|doi=10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.11.020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in DNA.&lt;ref name=Corongiu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corongiu|first=G.|author2=Clementi, E.|title=Simulations of the solvent structure for macromolecules.

Mitchell (1976) refers to these flow as 'proticity'.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=P.|title=Vectorial chemistry and the molecular mechanics of chemiosmotic coupling: power transmission by proticity|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|year=1976|volume=4|pages=399–430|doi=10.1042/bst0040399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work in Germany ====

Work in Germany over the last half-century has also focused on the internal communication system, in particular as it relates to the ground system. This work has led to their characterization of the ground system or extracellular matrix interaction with the cellular system as a 'ground regulatory system', seeing therein the key to homeostasis, a body-wide communication and support system, vital to all functions.&lt;ref name=Pischinger /&gt;

In 1953 a German doctor and scientist, Reinhold Voll, discovered that points used in acupuncture had different electrical properties from the surrounding skin, namely a lower resistance. Voll further discovered that the measurement of the resistances at the points gave valuable indications as to the state of the internal organs. Further research was done by Dr. Alfred Pischinger, the originator of the concept of the 'system of ground regulation', as well as Drs. Helmut Schimmel, and Hartmut Heine, using Voll's method of electro-dermal screening. This further research revealed that the gene is not so much the controller but the repository of blueprints on how cells and higher systems should operate, and that the actual regulation of biological activities (see [[Epigenetic cellular biology]]) lies in a 'system of ground regulation'. This system is built on the ground substance, a complex connective tissue between all the cells, often also called the extra-cellular matrix. This ground substance is made up of 'amorphous' and 'structural' ground substance. The former is "a transparent, half-fluid gel produced and sustained by the fibroblast cells of the connective tissues" consisting of highly polymerized sugar-protein complexes.&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Robert|title=Applied Kinesiology: A Training Manual and Reference Book of Basic Principles and Practices|year=2002|publisher=North Atlantic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Kinesiology.html?id=Bl0BQvU6EfQC&amp;redir_esc=y}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground substance, according to German research, determines what enters and exits the cell and maintains homeostasis, which requires a rapid communication system to respond to complex signals(see also [[Bruce Lipton]]).

:This is made possible by the diversity of molecular structures of the sugar polymers of the ground substance, the ability to swiftly generate new such substances, and their high interconnectedness. This creates a redundance that makes possible the controlled oscillation of values above and below the dynamic homeostasis present in all living creatures. This is a kind of fast-responding, "short term memory" of the ground substance. Without this labile capacity, the system would quickly move to an energetic equilibrium, which would bring inactivity and death.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

:For its biochemical survival, every organism requires the ability to rapidly construct, destroy and reconstruct the constituents of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Between the molecules that make up the ground substance there are minimal surfaces of potential energy. The charging and discharging of the materials of the ground substance cause 'biofield oscillations' (photon fields). The interference of these fields creates short lived (from 10–9 to up to 10–5 seconds) tunnels through the ground substance. 
:Through these tunnels, shaped like the hole through a donut, large chemicals may traverse from capillaries through the ground substance and into the functional cells of organs and back again. All metabolic processes depend upon this transport mechanism.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Major ordering energy structures in the body are created by the ground substance, such as collagen, which not only conducts energy but generates it, due to its piezoelectric properties.

:Like quartz crystal, collagen in the ground substance and the more stable connective tissues (fascia, tendons, bones, etc.). transforms mechanical energy (pressure, torsion, stretch) into electromagnetic energy, which then resonates through the ground substance (Athenstaedt, 1974). However, if the ground substance is chemically imbalanced, the energy resonating through the body loses coherence.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

This is what occurs in the adaptation response described by [[Hans Selye]]. When the ground regulation is out of balance, the probability of chronic illness increases. Research by Heine indicates that unresolved emotional traumas release a neurotransmitter substance P which causes the collagen to take on a hexagonal structure that is more ordered than their usual structure, putting the ground substance out of balance, what he calls an "emotional scar"providing "an important scientific verification that diseases can have psychological causes."&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt; (see also [[Bruce Lipton]])

==== Work in the U.S. ====
While the initial work on identifying the importance of the ground regulatory system was done in Germany, more recent work examining the implications of inter and intra-cellular communication via the extra-cellular matrix has taken place in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Structural continuity between extracellular, cyst skeletal and nuclear components was discussed by Hay,&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=E.D.|title=Extracellular Matrix|journal=Journal of Cell Biology|year=1981|volume=91|pages=205s–223s|doi=10.1083/jcb.91.3.205s|pmc=2112832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berezny et al.&lt;ref name=Berenzey&gt;{{cite book|last=Berezney|first=R.|title=Nuclear Matrix and DNA Replication in Maul, GG (ed.) The Nuclear Envelope and the Nuclear Matrix|year=1982|publisher=Alan R. Liss|location=New York|pages=183–197|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oschman.&lt;ref name="Oschman 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Structure and properties of ground substances|journal=American Zoologist|volume=24|pages=199–215|doi=10.1093/icb/24.1.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these elements have been referred to as ground substances, and because of their continuity, they act to form a complex, interlaced system that reaches into and contacts every part of the body. Even as early as 1851 it was recognized that the nerve and blood systems do not directly connect to the cell, but are mediated by and through an extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Oschman 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Mitochondria and cellular aging|journal=Preparation for Anti-Aging Medical Therapeutics|year=2008|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent research regarding the electrical charges of the various glycol-protein components of the extracellular matrix shows that because of the high density of negative charges on glycosaminoglycans (provided by sulfate and carboxylate groups of the uronic acid residues) the matrix is an extensive redox system capable of absorbing and donating electrons at any point.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=S.A.|author2=Kidd, M.P.|title=Antioxidant Adaptation: Its Role in Free Radical Pathology|journal=Biocurrent Division, San Leandro, CA|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This electron transfer function reaches into the interiors of cells as the cytoplasmic matrix is also strongly negatively charged.&lt;ref name=Ling&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=G.N.|title=A Physical Theory of the Living State: The Association-Induction Hypothesis|year=1962|publisher=Blaisdell|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire extracellular and cellular matrix functions as a biophysical storage system or accumulator for electrical charge.
 
From thermodynamic, energetic and geometrical considerations, molecules of the ground substance are considered to form minimal physical and electrical surfaces, such that, based on the mathematics of minimal surfaces, minuscule changes can lead to significant changes in distant areas of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Karcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karcher|first=H.|author2=Polthier, K.|title=Die geometrie von Minimalfachen|journal=Spektrum der Wissenschaft|year=1990|volume=10|pages=96–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery is seen as having implications for many physiological and biochemical processes, including membrane transport, antigen–antibody interactions, protein synthesis, oxidation reactions, actin–myosin interactions, sol to gel transformations in polysaccharides.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=S.|title=Minimal surfaces and structures: from inorganic and metal crystals to cell membranes and biopolymers|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=1988|volume=88|pages=221–242|doi=10.1021/cr00083a011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pienta and Coffey (1991) published "Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system" combining the concepts of the living matrix, vibratory and resonant interactions, cellular and tissue continuity, piezoelectricity, solid-state biochemistry, coherence, and tensegrity – all creating a body-wide communication and regulatory system of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Pienta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pienta|first=K.J.|author2=Coffey, D.S.|title=Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=1991|volume=34|pages=88–95|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(91)90072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One description of the charge transfer process in the matrix is, "highly vectoral electron transport along biopolymer pathways".&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=T.J.|title=Electronic processes in biology|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|year=1982|volume=27|issue=3|pages=335–352|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/27/3/001|bibcode = 1982PMB....27..335L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms involve clouds of negative charge created around the proteoglycans in the matrix. There are also soluble and mobile charge transfer complexes in cells and tissues (e.g. Slifkin, 1971;&lt;ref name=Slifkin&gt;{{cite book|last=Slifkin|first=M.A.|title=Charge transfer Interactions of Biomolecules|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutman, 1978;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=V.|title=The Donor-Acceptor Approach to Molecular Interactions|year=1978|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattay, 1994&lt;ref name=Mattay&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattay|first=J. (Ed.)|title=Electron Transfer|year=1994|publisher=I. Springer|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Rudolph A. Marcus of the California Institute of Technology found that when the driving force increases beyond a certain level, electron transfer will begin to slow down instead of speed up (Marcus, 1992)&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=R.A.|title=Electron transfer reactions in chemistry: theory and experiment|journal=Nobel Committee|date=8 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1992 for this contribution to the theory of electron transfer reactions in chemical systems. The implication of the work is that a vectoral electron transport process may be greater the smaller the potential, as in living systems.

'''Nanowood''' is heat-insulating material made from wood that is considered a slightly better insulator than [[Styrofoam]]. Unlike Styrofoam, the material is more environmentally friendly and [[biodegradable]]. It is considered light, strong and created entirely from stripped-down wood fibers.&lt;ref name="phys_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' an invention that could reduce humanity's carbon footprint| author = Khan, Amina| work = phys.org| date = 2018-03-12| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://phys.org/news/2018-03-nanowood-humanity-carbon-footprint.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The material was invented by engineer, Liangbing Hu and his team at [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The material "when exposed to the solar spectrum" reflected approximately 95% of radiation energy absorbing only approximately 2%.

'''Peace journalism''' has been developed from research that indicates that often news about conflict has a value bias toward violence.  It also includes practical methods for correcting this bias by producing journalism in both the mainstream and alternative media, and working with journalists, media professionals, audiences, and organizations in conflict.

{{TOC right|limit=2}}
This concept was proposed by [[Johan Galtung]]&lt;ref&gt;For example see the policy recommendations in the conclusion of: Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms for this broad definition of peace journalism include conflict solution journalism, conflict sensitive journalism,&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"&gt;Howard, R. (n.d.). [http://www.journalismethics.ca/global_journalism_ethics/conflict_sensitivity_in_practice.htm Conflict Sensitive Journalism in Practice.]  Center for Journalism Ethics: School of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Retrieved October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; constructive conflict coverage, and reporting the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reportingtheworld.net/Homepage.html Reporting the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War journalism''' is journalism about conflict that has a value bias towards violence and violent groups.  This usually leads audiences to overvalue violent responses to conflict and ignore non-violent alternatives.  This is understood to be the result of well documented news reporting conventions.  These conventions focus only on physical effects of conflict (for example ignoring psychological impacts) and elite positions (which may or may not represent the actual parties and their goals). It is also biased toward reporting only the differences between parties, (rather than similarities, previous agreements, and progress on common issues) the here and now (ignoring causes and outcomes), and zero sums (assuming that one side's needs can only be met by the other side's compromise or defeat).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan, “On the role of the media in worldwide security and peace,” In Tapio Varis (ed.),'' Peace and Communication,'' pp. 249–266, San Jose, Costa Rica: Universidad para La Paz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace journalism aims to correct for these biases. Its operational definition is "to allow opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves picking up calls for, and articulations of, non-violence policies from whatever quarter, and allowing them into the public sphere.

==Origins==
[[File:Philippines PJ group.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalism workshop in Mindanao, the Philippines]] 
Peace journalism follows a long history of news publication, originating in non-sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early 19th century, which published periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L., "Peace Journalism,"'' The International Encyclopedia of Communication,'' Wolfgang Donsbach (ed), Blackwell Publishing, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the 19th century, as did utopian communities of the period. From the 20th century, a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was [[Dorothy Day]]'s'' [[Catholic Worker]].''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L.,'' American peace writers, editors, and periodicals: A dictionary,'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being an element in the histories of [[pacifism]] and the [[social movement]] press, peace journalism is a set of [[journalism]] practices that emerged in the 1970s. Norwegian sociologist, peace researcher and practitioner [[Johan Galtung]] proposed the idea of peace journalism for journalists to follow to show how a value bias towards violence can be avoided when covering war and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Seow Ting Lee &amp; Crispin C. Maslog, "War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,"'' Journal of Communication 55'' (June 2005): p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian organizations such as The [[World Council of Churches]] and The [[World Association for Christian Communication]] also practice peace journalism.

'''Peace journalism''' aims to shed light on [[social structure|structural]] and [[cultural]] causes of [[violence]], as they impact upon the lives of people in a conflict arena as part of the explanation for violence. It aims to frame conflicts as consisting of many parties and pursuing many goals rather than a simple [[dichotomy]]. An explicit aim of ''peace journalism'' is to promote peace initiatives from whatever quarter and to allow the reader to distinguish between stated positions and real goals.

==Necessity==
Peace journalism came about through research arguing there's something wrong with typical conflict reporting.  Research and practice in peace journalism outlines a number of reasons for the existence and dominance of war journalism in conflict news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peacebuilding in the Age of New Media |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/issue/view/37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Firstly, the notion that media elites always act to preserve their favored status quo, and their own commercial and political interests, is given relatively little weight.  Shared characteristics of the socio-economic class, which heavily influences the production of journalism, are important.  For example, their shared ideological pressures, perceptions, attitudes, and values form the basis of a "dominant reading" of facts that are selected to appear in news.  These can then act to fix and naturalize meaning and hide the actual creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p.197 &amp; p.211; also see McGoldrick, 2008, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even in the presence of powerful elite media interests against war, war journalism often dominates conflict discourse.  Lynch and McGoldrick show examples from Britain, Ireland, Georgia, and Iraq, where ''war journalism'' dominated coverage despite key influential media interests against war.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, pp.198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalistic objectivity===
[[File:Jake cameraman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalist Jake Lynch covering protests against joint US-Australia military exercises in Australia.]] 
Therefore, not only political and economic, but also social and cultural factors have contributed to the dominance of war journalism in conflict reporting.  With the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue.

Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue.  This led to "Journalistic objectivity as an industry standard…a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;  And in modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24 hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories.  It is not possible for reporters to decide "from first principals" every time how they will report each and every story that presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch,J. (2008).  Debates in Peace Journalism. Sydney: Sydney University Press, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that convention governs much of journalism.

The rise of journalistic objectivity was part of a larger movement within western academia to a more empirical "just report the facts” epistemology and research paradigm.  By the 1890s it was focused on the ideal of “objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;Mindich, 2000, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  And although it came into fashion around the same period, Journalistic Objectivity must be distinguished from the [[Scientific Objectivity]].  For example the experimental sciences uses as "best practice":
# Inter-laboratory replication;
# Random assignment of subjects to conditions;
# Efforts to ensure that human subjects and experimenters are ignorant of the expectations (hypotheses)of the research: to avoid the [[Observer-expectancy effect]]
# The [[Subject-expectancy effect]];
# [[Scholarly peer review#Anonymous|Anonymous peer review]], a form of [[peer review]], to promote open and systematic exploration of meaning without subjective, "political" bias;
# Careful analysis to ensure that research subjects are adequately representative of the general population, that is not overly atypical when compared to the average population.
 
While it is arguable whether these experimental science safe guards provide “true objectivity”, in the absence of these safeguards, journalism around conflict relies on three conventions to maintain its own form of "objectivity" ( also see [[journalistic objectivity]]), and is therefore distinct from [[Scientific Objectivity]].

====Conventions====
Firstly, to sell audiences to advertisers, reporting must appeal to as broad an audience as possible and therefore focuses on “facts” that  are the least controversial.  Conflict processes are often controversial, so coverage of them risks alienating potential consumers, who may be sensitive to the exposure of structural or cultural predisposing factors.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a bias in favor of official sources means that, while it may appear uncontroversial, as there is only one official representative for the government on any given issue&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2009).  Day four, Sunday August 30.  Lecture presented in the Conflict Resolving Media course, the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, the University of Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; and since only the official government is usually allowed to wield legal, sanctioned force within its territory&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, Essays in Sociology, ed./trans./intro. H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1946, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; 
coverage will tend to privilege violent responses to conflict over non-violent, social-psychological, context-informed responses.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists Annabel McGoldrick and Jake Lynch argue that non-critical reporting of official sources is often rewarded by those sources. Through "information transactions", these same official sources allow uncritical journalists privileged access to information in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly and lastly, 'dualism' biasses journalistic objectivity towards violence: "A decision to tell a story in that [bipolar] way can slip past, unnoticed, without drawing attention to itself because of its close resemblance, in shape and structure, to so much of the story-telling we already take for granted".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp;  McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gatekeeping===
These conventions also form “gates” by which “gatekeepers” in journalism include or exclude various aspects of reality in final publication.&lt;ref&gt;Barzilai-Nahon, K. (2008).  Toward a Theory of Network Gatekeeping: A Framework for Exploring Information Control.  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59, 1493–1512;  White, D. (1950). The “gate keeper:” A case study in the selection of
news. Journalism Quarterly, 27, 383–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, proponents of ''peace journalism'' argue that in the media meaning occurs according to: “a set of rules and relations established before the reality or the experience under discussion actually occurred”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''war journalism'' the objectivity conventions serve this purpose, but are shadowy and unacknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; “Gatekeeping” is therefore likely to be secretive and haphazard.  This means they distort, and also fix, meaning in conflict coverage and obfuscate the production of meaning{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997).

A recent example demonstrates how peace journalism evaluative criteria might be applied to show how much conventional conflict reporting is biased in favor of violence and violent groups. The example is the coverage leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], and US President [[Barack Obama]].

Reporting was highly reactive and focused on the visible effects of the conflict, such as announcements and public disagreements between official spokespeople that appeared to disrupt peace efforts.&lt;ref&gt;For example see: Benhorin, Y. (2009, July, 22).  [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3750262,00.html Mitchell, Gates, Jones to visit Jerusalem next week.], Ynetnews.com.  Retrieved October 3, 2009; Hardy, R.

Coverage was oriented to elites with little mention of non-official peace efforts by individuals and groups such as the [http://www.handinhand12.org/ Hand in Hand network of schools], the Israeli/Palestinian [http://www.theparentscircle.org/Home.aspx The Parents Circle Families Forum], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040725071613/http://www.peacenow.org.il/Site/en/homepage.asp Peace Now], [http://www.shovrimshtika.org/index_e.asp Breaking the Silence], [http://www.physiciansforhumanrights.org/ Physicians for Human Rights], [http://www.machsomwatch.org/en Machsom Watch], and [http://www.canadazone.com/icw/ Checkpoint Watch], [[Hanan Ashrawi]] ([[non-violent]] activist for [[human rights]], founder of the [http://www.miftah.org/ Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy], and member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/middleeast/27swim.html We Will Not Obey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.justjlm.org/ Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also ignored were programmes that promote cultural exchange, for example (the Israeli-Palestinian Aussie Rules football team [http://www.peaceteam.com.au/ The Peace Team]), [http://www.afl.com.au/Development/InternationalCup/Teams/PeaceTeam/tabid/12099/Default.aspx see here for official 2011 team details]) which played in the 2008 and 2011 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] International Cups.

Events demonstrating non-violent responses to the conflict were also ignored, a new example being the March 12, 2011, [http://www.wluml.org/node/7031 Conference on Civil Disobedience in the West Bank] marking the centenary of [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;For an outline of some of these groups' activities see Lynch, 2008; and Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis]] lists further organizations working for peace in the region, whose activities are generally excluded from news on the Conflict.

Reporting leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Obama focused almost solely on highly divisive issues, such as Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the diplomatic/official status of Jerusalem. Coverage was also oriented towards differences, with a focus on the here and now.  Potential benefits in physical, economic, and social security of peaceful relations were ignored, and “progress” towards peace was portrayed as having to come with one or more parties compromising and surrendering their positions on key issues, which is of course a [[Zero-sum|zero sum]] orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. (2009, June 15).  [http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2599059.htm Israeli PM endorses Palestinian independence.]  ABC (Australia): Lateline.

Retrieved October 1, 2009; Kousoutkis, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Coverage generally ignored the background or context of positions. Positions were presented as unchangeable on any peaceful settlement, rather than the public "face" of unmet needs that often drive violent conflicts. Because of distrust between parties these needs are often not honestly expressed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus a pattern of ''war journalism'' emerges, largely stemming from the objectivity conventions applied to conflict reporting.  Peace journalism argues that this is likely to have important and consistent effects on the way audiences understand a conflict.

In ''war journalism'', violence is typically presented as only its own cause, ignoring the possibility of structural or psychological causes. Since violence is assumed to have no cause or explanation (such as the deprived needs of parties), conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers to conclude that the only “natural” or reasonable response to violence is more violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  That “more violence—‘the only language they understand'—is an appropriate remedy”, and that non-violent responses are irrelevant or 'unrealistic'.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"/&gt;

This focus on only physical violent behavior is an example of what leading Conflict Analyst and Peace Researcher, Johan Galtung identifies as a major flaw in responses to inter-communal conflict: the “Conservative Fallacy”.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2000).  Conflict transformation by peaceful means (the Transcend method): Pariticpants’ manual, trainers’ manual, Geneva: The United Nations,Module III, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bias towards prioritizing violent actors with coverage is then expected by violent groups, through what is called a [[Feedback loop|Feedback Loop]].&lt;ref&gt;First outlined by Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties to a conflict often try to use the media to advance their position, rather than being passive subjects, unaware of being observed, as assumed in sciences where humans are not the subjects. Journalist, and journalism Associate Professor, Jake Lynch notes that "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way ''war journalism'' is an example of the role of power in representation and of the media trying to ''fix meaning'', in this case about violence and its causes, for “it to become naturalized so that is the only meaning it can possibly carry…where you cannot see that anybody ever produced it."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997).  [http://www.mediaed.org/handouts/pdfs/HALL-REPMEDIA.pdf Representation and the media. (Transcript). Media Education Foundation, pp. 19, 21–22].  Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, war journalism is understood as reporting on conflict in a way which imposes an artificially confined closed space, and closed time, with causes and exits existing only in the conflict arena.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, pp. 147, 162&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace journalism can then be understood as journalism that avoids this outside imposition, which more objectively assesses the possibility of conflicts taking place in ''open space'', and ''open time'' with any number of causes and exits.

==Effects==
The [[Salvadoran Civil War]], largely a peasant revolution, took place 1980–92. The USA supported the right-wing government. During the war 75,000 people were killed, 8,000 more went missing and another million exiled. On 17 March 1980, the village of Ingenio Colima was attacked by paramilitaries who murdered all its occupants. At the time, the country’s media gave a biased account of what took place. The intention today – in the face of open hostility from today’s political leaders is to investigate and clarify what happened and to contribute to a national process of truth and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;See www.waccglobal.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effects of ''war journalism'' also make it more difficult for audiences to be aware of this biased presentation of conflict.  ''War journalism'' takes advantage of the emotional “high” humans can get from fear through evolutionary psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp. 291–297; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar way, war journalism appeals to "lower order" needs for security and belonging.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1970).  Motivation and Personality.  New York: Harper &amp; Row, pp. 18–21; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  
The pre-frontal cortex, governing working memory, rational attentive functioning, and complex thought is inhibited by activation of the brain’s fear centre, the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, B. (2003).  [http://calendar.eastbayworks.com/upload/files/000176-000048-Emotional_IntelligencecopyEIbyDanielGoleman.ppt Working with Emotional Intelligence.  Based on a Book by Daniel Goleman]  (Powerpoint slides).  Unpublished manuscript, Rutgers University. New Brunswick, United States.  Retrieved July 7, 2011, slides 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences are thus deprived of cognitive resources with which to recognize the role of fear in encouraging ''war journalism'' consumption.  This cognitive deprivation also further fixes meaning and increases the role of “automatically activated attitudes” which according to cognitive psychology: "guide attention toward attitude-consistent information, provide a template with which to interpret ambiguous information, and…guide behaviour in a relatively spontaneous fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, M. and Fazio, O.  (2006).  Reducing automatically activated racial prejudice through implicit evaluative conditioning.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32, 421–433, see p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Therefore viewers are primed to pay more attention to future information, which is consistent with the automatically activated attitudes formed by ''war journalism''.  Research into the ever present framing{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in the media supports this conclusion: “Certainly people can recall their own facts, forge linkages not made explicitly in the text, or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure that is completely absent from the text. In essence, this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually.  But Zaller (1992), Kahneman and Tversky (1984), and Iyengar (1991), among others, suggest that on most matters of social or political interest, people are not generally so well-informed and cognitively active, and that framing therefore heavily influences their responses to communications”.&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R, (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm’, Journal of Communication, 43, 51–58, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that ''war journalism'' can have negative emotional impacts on audience members. These include feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, compounded by increased anxiety, mood disturbance, sadness and a sense of disconnection with physical and social environments.  Research by Galtung and Ruge (1965) finds negativity bias in foreign news. This has also been confirmed more recently by Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91; Nohrstedt, S. &amp; Ottosen, R. (2008).  War journalism and the Threat Society.  Conflict and Communication Online, 7, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  
This can affect reactions towards the conflict itself, and an audience’s general psychological wellbeing, which biasses their view of the world as excessively chaotic and may cause serious anxiety and emotional difficulties, and a sense of disempowerment and disconnection.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, G. (2004).  [http://www.aspr.ac.at/epu/research/Frohlich.pdf Emotional intelligence in Peace Journalism.],  Master of Arts Thesis.  European University Center for Peace Studies, pp.17, 47.  Retrieved October 12, 2009; McGoldrick, A. (2008).  Psychological effects of War Journalism and Peace Journalism.  Peace &amp; Policy, 13, 86–98, see p. 91; Nohrstedt &amp; Ottosen,  2008, pp. 4–6; Szabo, A. &amp; Hopkinson, K. (2007).  Negative Psychological Effects of Watching the News in the Television: Relaxation or Another Intervention May Be Needed to Buffer Them!  International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 14, 57–62, see p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Vicarious trauma can increase these negative effects, where "even ‘normal’, intelligent, educated individuals can become highly suggestible towards violent acts in formerly unexpected contexts".&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

These negative emotional states may discourage audience members from criticism and challenge of the biassed information presented through war journalism.  These public concerns may appear to be "someone else’s problem" and best left to "experts", who alone have the necessary knowledge, time, and emotional endurance. These negative emotional responses may also discourage creative engagement with the conflict and conflict parties.  This is especially troubling considering the critical role of creativity in conflict resolution and peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. J. (1997).  Interactive Conflict Resolution.

==Feedback loop==
Peace journalism analysis suggests that  typical news on conflict, with its value bias towards violence and violent groups, has important effects on the parties to conflict.  Firstly, peace journalism proponents argue that the bias in favour of publicity for violence and violent actors, "plays into" the interests of violent actors to intimidate and disrupt  the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important example of the Feedback Loop effect: "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"/&gt;  This bias also weakens and punishes, with less publicity, non-violent groups affected by a conflict, for their lack of violence.  Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2002) note:
"if traditional media themselves are unable to transmit alternative perspectives and voice the danger is that those […] that feel marginalised will turn to terror in order to make a difference in the media agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Nohrstedt &amp; Ottosen 2002, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most visible actions of a group, of which one is not a member, are often considered representative of that group’s behaviour (an effect called the “availability heuristic”).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, A. J. &amp; Hardin, C. D. (1997).  Differential use of the availability heuristic in social judgement.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore war journalism's over-selection of violent, as opposed to non-violent, responses to conflict may actually foster a misperception of excessive threat between parties.  This is then generally exaggerated by other inter-group social-cognitive biases within war journalism.  These include biases towards: seeing an outgroup as more homogeneous (with less internal variety) than it really is, ignoring the variety of attitudes towards the conflict;&lt;ref&gt;Boldry, J.

Indeed Dr. Louis Kriesberg, a sociologist at Syracuse University, and expert on conflict resolution points out that: "conventional thinking among partisans in a fight generally attributes destructive persistence in a conflict to the enemy's character, asserting that the enemy is aggressive by nature, has evil leaders, or adheres to a hostile ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, Louis, ‘Waging conflicts constructively’ in Handbook of Conflict Analysis and Resolution (London: Routledge, 2009), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; And Professor of World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Marc Gopin, agrees with the importance of psychological factors in escalating conflict: "being hated normally generates deep injury and corresponding anger in most recipients is what I call a "conflict dance" of action/reaction".&lt;ref&gt;Gopin, Marc, ‘Conflict Resolution as a Religious Experience: Contemporary Mennonite Peacemaking’ in Between Eden and Armageddon: The Future of World Religions, Violence and Peacemaking (Oxford: Oxford U.P., 2000), p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''peace journalism'' perspective also highlights another effect of typical conflict journalism on  the groups engaged in a conflict: ''war journalism's'' common focus on the human drama and tragedy of violence. Hamber and Lewis (1997) note war journalism "often involves painting doomsday scenarios of victims who are irreparably damaged and for whom there appears to be no solution and no future".&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B &amp; Lewis, S. (1997).

And the positive experiences of those who have embarked upon a process of recovery is often ignored in war journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hamber &amp; Lewis, 1997, see section:Is Post-Traumatic Stress…&lt;/ref&gt;  For example in Israel/Palestine, victims of suicide bombing, house demolition, land and house theft, are often portrayed as defenceless, disempowered victims with no prospect of healing or positive response to their predicament.&lt;ref&gt;Kershner, 2009; Koutsoukis, 2009; [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3750255,00.html US: Too soon to discuss Israel sanctions.] (2009, July 22).

Effective non-violent bridge building between communities such as the Hand in Hand Arab/Jewish school network in Israel, are routinely ignored in ''war journalism'' coverage.  Non-violent initiatives illustrate what can be possible through peaceful responses to conflict but this information is artificially "filtered out" through the coverage biases of ''war journalism''.&lt;ref&gt;For example see:Alpher, Y.

Parties are led to believe that that violence is the only way their needs can be met, thereby reinforcing and escalating cycles of dangerous retaliation between groups.  ''Peace journalism'' would also charge that this pattern of conventional conflict reporting submerges the emotional cost of violent conflict and therefore makes the psychological aspects of cycles of revenge subtle, and so more difficult to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. &amp; Maslog, C, &amp; Kim, H.

All of this missed information could represent a crucial movement away from violence, as the only option for threatened groups towards peace. But only if they are not hidden by journalistic assumptions that they are irrelevant, and should not be reported. This is of special concern, given that the [[collective trauma]] suffered by a population, and the fear that this generates, can lead to a reduced capacity for decision making and action.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, J.

==Response==
In response to war journalism’s value bias in favour of violence, peace journalism promises two key benefits: for those concerned with objectivity in journalism, it aims to avoid and counteract the persistent bias of valuing violence and violent parties. Secondly, as all journalism must in some way appeal to the values of their audiences, for those who value the promotion of peace and social justice over violence, it provides a practical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodny-Gumede |first1=Ylva |title=Awareness towards Peace Journalism among Foreign Correspondents in Africa |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.365 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'fixation of meaning'{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in war journalism is often hidden by the “scattered opposition facts” that often occur in its coverage. However these do not actually allow for “challenging a dominant frame” of pro-violence: 'Framing' researcher Entman recommends:
"If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts, and challenging a dominant frame, journalists might be better equipped to construct news that makes equally salient—equally accessible to the average, inattentive, and marginally informed audience—two or more interpretations of problems."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R. (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm, Journal of Communication, 43, 51-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions===
Hence, ''peace journalism'' is anchored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research “to map out solid ground beneath our feet; to declare, in advance, that we intend to use it, to assign meanings and draw distinctions.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decisions, on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report, can be made openly and systematically. Lynch (2008) shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for ''conflict journalism'' in that they employ the academic rigor of the social sciences including: "openness about – and prepared to justify – starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation; and peer review.  Built into social science, moreover, is an allowance for the [[participant-observer effect]] – as soon as you start to observe something, you cannot avoid changing it."&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' considers the effect it has on audiences and parties with regard to it own “objectivity”.  Lynch and Galtung (2010) elaborate on how this operates in ''conflict journalism'': "'It is an important distinction in this context because journalism itself may be part of the extended pattern of conflictual relationships, in which parties and their shared relations find themselves embedded – if only by bringing an audience to the ringside. Tillett comments: 'In some situations, individuals (or groups) will ‘fight to the death’ (even when obviously losing all that they claim to be seeking) to avoid being seen to ‘back down’ or ‘lose face' ' (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;29). In a conflict, he continues, "the presence of an audience generally makes it more likely that the protagonists will want to be seen to win, and that they will be less prepared to resolve than to fight'. Schattschneider goes as far as to argue that spectators are 'an integral part of the situation for, as likely as not, the audience determines the outcome of the fight'(1960, p.2)."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lynch, J. &amp; Galtung, J. (2010).  Reporting conflict: New  directions in peace journalism.  St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-group violence===
Conflict Analysis also provides guidance on mapping the hopes, needs, and fears of all parties to a conflict, including outwardly “impartial” third parties; and acknowledges the potential role of creativity, rather than assuming as ''war journalism'' does, that the positions of elites, power gradients and the struggle for power are the most important determinants of a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D. (2002).  People, peace and power: Conflict transformation in action.  London: Pluto Press, p.128; Lederach, J. P. (1997) Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies.  Washington, DC: US Institute of Peace Press, p.94; Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

These can then be assessed empirically in the conflict, and its potential resolution, rather than being ignored from the outset by journalists, as often is the case in ''war journalism''.  Therefore the importance in ''peace journalism'' of being willing to consider conflict as “open in space and time, with causes and exits anywhere”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;   Lynch and Galtung (2010) present an important example of this in the case of North and South Korea, indicating that journalists should not ignore the grassroots people that endure this conflict, and that comparisons and input from the reunified Germany may be helpful, as could consideration and dialogue with East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and Galtung, 2010, pp.77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim here is not to impose definite “answers”. Conflict Analysis and Peace Research often elicit useful perspectives from those involved in the conflict. Empirical questions can then be put forward, and tested by investigative journalism.

These processes demonstrate that conflict is not static and intractable.  These insights challenge the psychological tendencies of ''war journalism'' noted above to present negative outgroup behaviour as the result of stable group characteristics.  Indeed the non-linear cycle of violence outlined by Elworthy and Rogers (2002), proposes that the key stage to prevent a cycle of revenge, is before the anger becomes bitterness.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"&gt;Elworthy, S. &amp; Rogers, P. (2002).  [http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/waronterrorism.pdf The ‘War on Terrorism’: 12-month audit and future strategy options], Oxford: Oxford Research Group, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  And peace journalism can allow for the consideration that “bitterness can be thought of as anger + memory[…]storing away trauma in a ‘trauma bank’ and, eventually, withdrawing it as ‘glory’ through further violence”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

Through reporting, which does not routinely ignore causes and non-linear cycles of violence, ''peace journalism'' can help expand the cognitive and emotional space for peace initiatives that contribute peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Elworthy and Rogers, 2002, pp.18-24; Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.87; Perez, M. (n.d.).  [http://www.transcend.org/tri/downloads/Peace%20Journalism%20Case%20Study-%20US%20Media%20Coverage%20of%20the%20War%20in%20Iraq.pdf Peace Journalism case study: US media coverage of the war in Iraq.]  Transcend Research Institute.  Retrieved 10 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feedback Loop of cause and effect in the media could then support the creation and continuation of peaceful process-structures .&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1999, pp.33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would involve demonstrating a pattern of coverage that leads present and potential peace actors to predict that their efforts will be reported by journalists to “create opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict”.&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"/&gt;  This in turn could reduce negative inter-group social-psychological tendencies.  This may be particularly important for projects such as the examples in Israel/Palestine of the 'Hand in Hand' network of schools, 'Peace Now', 'Breaking the Silence', 'Physicians for Human Rights', 'Machsom Watch' and 'Checkpoint Watch', which as mainly grassroots initiatives, are generally more fragile than mid level or upper level peace activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As a pedagogical practice, peace journalism training often uses pairs of ''war journalism'' and ''peace journalism'' reports to illustrate how the same story can be reported in either style, and that there is the potential to produce peace journalism within the time and travel constraints of mainstream journalism.

For a peace journalism/war journalism pair on conflict in the Philippines see [http://www2.arts.usyd.edu.au/podcast/podcastepisode_pac.cfm Peace Journalism in the Philippines.] The transcripts of this report pair, along with an outline of a course in peace journalism can be viewed at [http://www.cco.regener-online.de/2007_1/pdf/lynch.pdf A course in peace journalism.]

For a pair of reports covering Israel/Palestine plus a link to practical tips for avoiding journalism that is biased towards violence and violent actors, see [http://www.mediachannel.org/originals/warandpeace.shtml The Middle East—War Journalism and Peace Journalism]  The documentary [http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2979.shtml News from the Holy Land] also contains another pair of reports on the Israel/Palestine conflict.

The free [http://www.reportingtheworld.net/RtW_book_files/rtw_booklet.pdf Reporting the World publication] contains pairs of peace journalism/war journalism news reports on Macedonia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq,and Indonesia.

bridges of understanding between the Arab and Western world through analysis of the
news from these regions. [http://www.iemed.org/publicacions/quaderns/8/q8_081.pdf To Be an Effective Advocate for Peace, Media Distortions Must Be Addressed] analyses situations where conflict reporting has contributed to the actual worsening of conflict.

An example from the Hindustan Times, showing how peace journalism can also operate through awards and commendations publicising and supporting the work of non-violence and cooperative conflict resolution: [http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Europe/Afghan-Palestinian-win-UN-award-in-honour-of-Gandhi/Article1-770319.aspx Afghan, Palestinian win UN award in honour of Gandhi.]

''Peace journalism'' can also take the form of the public dissemination of research on the successful conditions for non-violent conflict resolution and negotiation such as: [http://newmatilda.com/2011/10/05/unequal-partners-cant-negotiate Unequal Partners Can't Negotiate] by Paul Duffill, writing for New Matilda.

The piece does not assume there are only two parties, and doesn't assume parties' goals exactly match reported positions, and explores contradictory goals within a single official party.  It also reports on peaceful responses to conflict.  This report however is generally closed in space and time: with little exploration of the reasons behind the conflict between waring groups (including  considering the conduct of the weak national government), or whether parties other than Al Queda/Al Shabab have used violence, and assumes that causes and sources of solutions are restricted to within Somalia itself.  The report also does not explore non-elite efforts at peace, even though [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/somalis-rally-against-al-qaeda-allies/story-e6frf7jx-1226272294958 Somalis rally against al-Qaeda allies] suggests that there is local support for peace efforts.

The [[feedback loop]] of cause and effect&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful reference point here for conceptualising the various “entry points” for peace journalism in the wider phenomenology of news.  ''Peace journalism'' has been applied in training and dialogue with journalists in a variety of settings.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Lynch, 2008, pp.35-36, p.81, p.84, p.85 &amp; p.87; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.135-136&lt;/ref&gt;  However peace journalism has also been applied in a number of other sectors.

These interventions are extremely varied and, in addition to the examples noted above, include international NGO work with local partners and networks in areas of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; the promotion of communication rights, participatory processes, community-based communication approaches for development, and social change and peacebuilding (for example see [http://www.communicationforsocialchange.org/current-projects Current Projects-Communication for Social Change] &amp;  [http://www.waccglobal.org/en/programmes.html World Association for Christian Communication programmes] and further reading sections below) and work with organisations who may themselves become sources for peace journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick,2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Government and inter-governmental approaches have also facilitated ''peace journalism'' in preventing [[media manipulation]] and promoting people centred media in post-conflict societies and through the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Thompson, M. &amp; Price, M. (2003).   Intervention, media and human rights, Survival, 45, pp.183-202; Krug, P. &amp; Price, M. (2002).

==Criticism==
Peace journalism has aroused a number of debates and criticisms from scholars and journalists.

===Objectivity===
Some opponents characterise ''peace journalism'' as "activist" new writing that, while being socially engaged to promote peace, is unlike mainstream objective, or balanced, news coverage that seeks to remain impartial or above the fray.&lt;ref&gt;for example see Hanitzsch, 2007, pp.367–385.&lt;/ref&gt;

This raises the important question: how objective and impartial is peace journalism?  From a peace journalism perspective the claim “we just report the facts” must include the facts of how and according to what principals these “facts” came to meet the reporter, and how the finished coverage came to meet the facts.  The Press Institute of India’s conflict reporting guidelines point out: "Factual accuracy in a single story is no substitute for the total truth.  A single story, which is factually accurate can nonetheless be misleading".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd &amp; Toit, 1999, cited in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' is generally more objective, with its inclusion of implications for international law, positive developments in both elite peacemaking and capacity building, and non-elite perspectives and peacebuilding initiatives.  This objectivity, unconstrained by Objectivity Conventions, highlights the truth-orientation of peace journalism: to “expose untruths on all sides”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"/&gt;

In doing so ''peace journalism'' aims to de-naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning by highlighting the creation of ''war journalism'' dominated meaning in conflict.  Indeed Hall (1997) recommends that the unfixing of meaning: “is often a struggle to increase the diversity of things which subjects can be of the possibility of identities which people have not seen represented before[…]you have to intervene in exactly that powerful exchange between image and its psychic meaning[…]with which we invest images [and] expose and deconstruct the work of representation which the stereotype is doing”.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, pp.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

And many international negotiation experts and peace practitioners note the importance of non-violent confrontation and the equalisation of power, before effective negotiation and dialogue between parties can take place.&lt;ref&gt;Docherty, J. (2005).  The little book of strategic negotiation: Negotiating during turbulent times.  Intercourse: Good Books, p.22; Francis, 2002, pp.56-57; Keashly, L. &amp; Fisher, R. J.

Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, p.32;  Cortright, D. (2008).  Peace: A history of Movements and Ideas.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through reporting on grassroots and local voices for peace, the power of these voices is increased, as they become "reality checkers" for often contradictory statements from elite representatives involved in violence.  Through this non-violent “ideational confrontation”, audiences and parties to conflict may be more able to negotiate their own meaning, outside of fixed elite narratives.  Thus “mounting anomalies may expose contradictions, and herald a paradigm shift” as local pro-peace perspectives previously consigned to a zone of “deviance” become “legitimate controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

And indeed researchers also note the importance of relationship building for 'vertical and horizontal integration' in peacebuilding&lt;ref&gt;Gopin, M. (2002).

'''Peace journalism''' aims to retain the role of ''observer'' in reporting conflict, rather than functioning like ''war journalism'', which intervenes in conflict to increase the influence of violent actors and violent actions.  Peace journalism, by presenting “anomalous” local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group’s attempts to fix and naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2005, pp.204-205&lt;/ref&gt;  
Indeed, exploration of new types of relationships between Afghan locals and the international community, contradicts assertions made at the time, with the support of war journalism, by insurgents and the US government, that the negative effects of foreign occupation could only be ended with their violent expulsion, or that 40,000 more combat troops were the most critical component for sustainable peace in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of this war journalism see: Dombey, D.

===Explaining violence is justifying it===
This criticism can be represented by [[neo-conservative]] proponent [[Richard Perle]], that one must “decontextualise terror[…]any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it.  It simply needs to be fought and destroyed”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist [[Phillip Zimbardo]] (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a ''Fundamental Attribution Error'': “the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of human needs driving violence and being significantly effected by violence (borrowed from Conflict Analysis and Peace Research)&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.44-47&lt;/ref&gt; and insight into the stratified nature of reality (borrowed from Critical Realism),&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"&gt;Dandermark et al. (2002) Explaining society – Critical Realism in the Social Sciences, London: Routledge, see particularly pp.59-66&lt;/ref&gt; highlights why an ''explanation'' of violence is not the same thing as a justification for it.

Critical Realism understands reality as existing in a number of levels or [[Stratified sampling|strata]]. Each strata deals with larger and more complex phenomena than that ones below it.  These strata might begin from physical mechanisms at the most basic level, followed by chemical mechanisms, then biological, followed by psychological and finally social.  Activity at each lower strata contributes to, but can never fully explain, the new mechanisms that develop in higher strata, in a process called “emergence” from the upper strata.  For example, competing theories of sub-atomic structure (perhaps at the physical level) influence but cannot fully explain the outcome of the reaction 2Na+2HCl = 2NaCl + H2 (at the chemical level).  Likewise the individual psychologies of a landlord and tenant cannot fully explain their relationship in the social strata, which is also influenced by other  things that operate at the social stratum, including laws and culture.&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"/&gt;

Structural and cultural explanations for violence generally deal with the social strata: that is relationships between people and groups. An explanation of this violence is not the same as ignoring the role of individual choice and psychology: the violence that “emerges” at the social level is the result of a complex interaction of influences from lower strata (individual choices and psychology) and structures which exist primarily at the social strata (such as laws and culture).  So to give cultural or structural ''explanations'' of violence is not the same as saying that these social influences override the role the individual choice (which is located in a lower stratum and therefore occurs under different conditions).

Take the case where an individual’s anger (brought on from previous trauma) becomes bitterness, which is followed by their own violent acts, following Elworthy and Rogers (2002) cycle of violence noted above.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"/&gt; An individual has still made a choice to deprive the victim of their violence of their human needs (probably safety and security) even though their own human needs have also been violated earlier.  The point is not that they must be seen as  either a innocent victim or an evil perpetrator.  The practical point is the prevention of violence, and the healing of all those whose needs have been violated.

This approach does not assume that the best solution for stopping individual violence necessarily exists at the level where an individual makes a choice to act violently (which happens at the psychological level).  In some cases punishment or imprisonment may be necessary.  However Conflict Analysis and Peace Research suggest that, given the failure of the psychological, medical and social sciences (including education) to eliminate the persistent rates of psychotic tendencies in human groups (psychologists estimate that on average 3 percent of any population have psychotic tendencies),&lt;ref&gt;Collier, P.  (2007). 
The bottom billion: Why the poorest countries are falling apart and what can be done about it.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; a more promising approach may to look at what social, economic, cultural conditions and what inter-group relations enable individuals such as Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Stalin and Pol Pot, to realise their desire for mass violence.

Conflict Analysis and Peace Research does not primarily focus on understanding the individual psychology of these individuals (at the psychological stratum), but on how these individuals may be prevented from taking up a position in society where they are able to direct inter-communal violence (at the social stratum).

Indeed in ''peace journalism'' the role of individual agency is given a lot of importance.  For example journalists are encouraged, in peace journalism workshops, to work peace journalism into the existing media structures.  And peace journalism urges journalists to investigate the possibility that, even in violent situations, there are always voices for peace, and to search these voices out, when reporting what the Objectivity Conventions might ignore from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.6-31; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.51-63&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise the role of individual choice is not ignored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research, and leading scholar-practitioner, John Paul Lederach notes that:
“I have not experienced any situation in conflict, no matter how protracted or severe, from Central America to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, where there have not been people who had a vision for peace, emerging often from their own experience of pain.  Far too often, however, these same people people are overlooked and disempowered either because they do not represent ‘official’ power, whether on the side of government [or] of the various militias, or because they are written off as biased and too personally affected by the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure versus agency===
Hanitzsche (2007) argues that “the failures of corporate journalism cannot be overcome by an individualistic and voluntaristic conceptualization of news making. To have any impact on the ways news is being made, and the critical discussion thereof, the advocates of peace journalism must address the structural constraints of news production[…]a peaceful culture is the precondition of peace journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsche, 2007, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
Structure is a key concern in peace journalism, along with the influence of structure on ''content pluralism'' in news.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;  And a number of projects that apply ''peace journalism'' (some of which are outlined above) demonstrate that ''peace journalism activism'' is not limited to journalists themselves. Indeed, conflict media content analyses are important educational resources for audiences, NGOs and journalists, to show how deficiencies in content can be used to campaign for more structural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28 ; For examples of content analyses see: Galtung &amp; Lynch, 2010; Lee &amp; Masalog, 2005; Lee, Masalog &amp; Kim, 2006; Baltodano, B.,  Jared Bishop, J., Hmielowski, J., Kang-Graham, J., Morozov, A., White, B., et al. (2007).  Discourses of Blame and Responsibility: U.S./Canadian Media Representations of Palestinian-Israeli Relations.  Conflict and Communication Online, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

These varied approaches demonstrate that inroads have been, and are still being made, in ''peace journalism activism'' in the areas Hackett (2006) identifies as necessary to address challenges of structure and to "make peace journalism possible”: reforming journalism from within, and also creating alternative media organisations, and intervening in the broader fields in which journalism find itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiences===
Hanitszche (2007) criticises peace journalism, noting that media users are often “fragmented and active audiences instead of a passive mass[…]leading to a selective use of supplied products”.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007).  Situating peace journalism in journalism studies: a critical appraisal, Conflict and Communication Online 6, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Devereux (2003) notes that media audiences “may have different expectations of media genres”&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, E. (2003).  Understanding the media.  London: Sage Publications, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Turnbull (2002) argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, S. (2002).  Audiences. In Stuart Cunningham &amp; Graeme Turner (Eds.), The media &amp; communications in Australia (pp. 65-77). Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed Hall (1997) notes that the meaning of media messages changes “as you move from one person to another, one group to another, one part of society to another.”&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  And Lynch (2008) points out, drawing from Hall (1980) that “the meanings of media messages are made, at least partly, at the point of reception, in a process influenced chiefly by the socio-economic position of the reader or viewer.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such Hall (1980) notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner, ''meaning'' often:
"contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules - it operates with exceptions to the rule. It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to 'local conditions'".And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of 'local conditions' that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning. Lynch (2008)argues that “for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them”,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often not the case with international conflict. Indeed Hall’s(1980) own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker, willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike.{{Citation needed|reason=ref was given as (ref name=Hall, 1980, p.516 /), no full ref provided|date=November 2018}}

''Peace journalism'' analysis shows that the facts absent in audiences’ understanding of conflict, can closely mirror those neglected in ''war journalism''. A notable example is Philo and colleagues’ research into media coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict in the UK media.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, G. (2004, July 14). What you get in 20 seconds. Guardian; Philo, G. (2009).  News, audiences and the construction of public knowledge.  In S. Allan (Ed.), The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (pp.407-506). Abingdon:   Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  With mainstream media neglecting the Palestinian narrative that Palestinian refugees lost their land and homes when Israel was established, audiences exhibited consistent ignorance about the basic facts of the conflict (for example where the bulk of refugees came from) and tended to perceive Palestinians as “starting the violence” and therefore Israeli authorities as forced to “respond” violently to prevent or contain this action, which has no possible rationale and therefore no potential non-violent resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2009, p.502&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed five years earlier, when reporting results of the study, Philo (2004) noted that: "This pattern of reporting clearly influenced how some viewers understood the conflict[…]The gaps in public knowledge closely parallel those in the news. The Palestinian perspective, that they have lost their land and are living under occupation, was effectively absent. It is perhaps not surprising that some viewers believed that they were simply being aggressive and trying to take land from the Israelis".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This omission of the Palestinian perspective was so serious that Helen Boaden, Head of News at the BBC, concluded in an internal email: “we fail to give enough context and history to this highly charged story and that we neglect the Palestinian narrative[…]In our response, we’ve tried to come up with practical ways to remedy our weaknesses”.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Lynch, 2008, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has also been the focus of research by Yifat Mor and colleagues, who examined how social media (namely [[Facebook]]) can be a tool to promote dialogue between both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mor |first1=Yifat |last2=Ron |first2=Yiftach |last3=Maoz |first3=Ifat |title=“Likes” for Peace: Can Facebook Promote Dialogue in the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.298 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important illustration of the consistent effect of war journalism across general audiences: “the pattern of misunderstanding almost exactly matching[…]missing elements from the story habitually presented in the mainstream media”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  General media audiences as a group are conceptualised within the Feedback Loop of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;First outlined in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches===
Two peace practitioner scholars, John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung present two quite different models for conflict resolution and peace building. Lederach (1995) presents an “Elictive Model” which is aims “primarily at discovery, creation, and solidification of models that emerge from the resources present in a particular setting and respond to needs in that context” and to not impose third party knowledge from trainer to participant.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1995, p.55 &amp; p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, was applied in a dialogue in 2003 entitled “Reporting the[sic?] Iraq: what went right?  What went wrong?”. Included were Heads of News from the BBC and CNN, the editor of the Guardian, and several senior reporters who had also been reporting the war from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.201; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on “the resources in the room” recommendations for the coverage of conflict included: 
#Do not report a ‘line’ from an official source without obtaining and citing independent evidence as to its reliability.
#Acknowledge that the important job of testing arguments is best done if they are juxtaposed with, and weighed against, alternative, countervailing arguments.
#All newsrooms genuinely interested in offering a service to the public must think long and hard about ‘conduit’ journalism and, in particular, whether their political correspondents are being used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.204-206.&lt;/ref&gt;
#

Galtung’s TRANSCEND approach in contrast, focuses on the role a third party to “unstick” violent conflicts and stimulate creativity. This is done by  probing deeply into the nature of parties’ goals, expanding the spectrum of acceptable solutions, and opening up cognitive space for fresh potentialities not conceived of by conflict parties.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Tschudi, F. (2001). Crafting Peace: On the Psychology of the TRANSCEND Approach.  In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds), Peace, Conflict, and Violence. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, see pp.210-212&lt;/ref&gt;  "In one-on-one conversation-style dialogues, the task is to stimulate creativity, develop new perspectives, and make the conflict parties 'ready for the table'".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch (2008) recounts a notable example of this approach during a ''peace journalism'' forum of Middle Eastern journalists, in Amman, in 1999.  Discussions often devolved into national groups blaming the journalists of the other countries for not confronting their governments’ lack of movement towards peace. Galtung himself challenged the participants to: “imagine a future Middle East they wanted to see, and start to think aloud, in cross-national groups, about how they might play a part in bringing it about”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A Galtungian perspective, as a foundation for much of ''peace journalism'', insists that “the journalist focus on root causes of conflict such as poverty or prior abuse, and not merely focus on events associated with violent political encounters”.&lt;ref&gt;.Falk, R. (2008).  Foreword.  In J. Lynch (Author), Debates in Peace Journalism (pp.v-x).  Sydney: University of Sydney Press, see p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this approach peace journalism could act to “disembed” seemingly immutable official positions from the greater context of a conflict by exploring background to a conflict, challenging propaganda, and making visible official and local initiatives for peaceful conflict resolution.

These two approaches differ not only in the "how" of [[Conflict Resolution]] but the "who".  Lederach generally outlines a "middling out" approach where "the level with the greatest potential for establishing an infrastructure that can sustain the peacebuilding process over the long term appears to be the middle range".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that grassroots approaches are generally the more fragile since their participants are often concerned with day to day issues of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, pp.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper level approaches assume a high level of integration between elites and grassroots: that peace agreements reached there "are relevant to and capable of practical implementation at the local level"&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  Galtung on the other hand argues that upper level leaders often actually feel excluded from facilitated peace processes, with the modern focus on grassroots and civil society initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2010, July 7).  Self-Determination: 50 years on.  Workshop presented at the 2010 biennial conference of the International Peace Research Association, Customs House, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;  The root of conflict is ''incompatible goals'', pursued by parties which result in violent attitudes and behavior. It follows that "people are more able to discuss a root problem when they sense a solution somewhere.  A glimmer of light at the end of a tunnel makes it considerably more easy[sic] to admit that we are in a tunnel".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;  In Galtung's work, the most accessible way to influence these goals had been to work with those who officially defined them and led policy—the upper level leaders.

The importance of accurate and complete [[Conflict Analysis]] for a given conflict highlights how these two approaches can be complementary. Practical [[Conflict Analysis]] is often aimed at identifying the easiest "peace levers" to pull, within a conflict to "unstick" violent inter-group relations. This contrasts with intervening in a conflict with pre-set ideas of how a resolution will be found, and with which specific level or group to begin working.

Therefore [[Conflict Analysis]] may indicate which "entry points" offer the most promising chance to transform the relations between parties. And from this it will follow which approach, or combination of approaches, are likely to work from that entry point (whether it be at the grassroots, mid level or upper level or a combination). This integrative approach is summed up by peace practitioner and researcher Wendy Lambourne: "to rely on only one theoretical approach in peace practice risks being culturally blind".&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication, 27 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar approaches==
Sometimes also called [[conflict solution journalism]], [[conflict sensitive journalism]],&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"/&gt; and [[constructive conflict coverage]].  A similar approach is also found in [[preventive journalism]], which extends the principles to social, economic, environmental or institutional problems. Peace journalism is one of several approaches and movements in journalism history, including [[advocacy journalism]], [[development communication]] journalism, the [[new journalism]], and public or [[civic journalism]], which reject the universal or hegemonic claims to neutrality of professional journalism in the developed West.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hanitzsch, “Deconstructing Journalism Culture: Toward a Universal Theory,”'' Communication Theory 17'' (2007) p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Program Associated Data''' ('''PAD''') or '''Program Service Data''' ('''PSD''') is the data displayed on many [[HD Radio]] and [[satellite radio]] receivers. It can describe the program being transmitted and other information such as the name of the song, the artist and the genre of music.

The HD radio and satellite systems provides a data path for this programming data to be delivered and read by the listener in near real time. HD radio and satellite radio receivers provide PAD decoders and visual screens for displaying the information.

PAD is different from [[Radio Data System]] (RDS).

'''Ridge and furrow''' is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] pattern of ridges (Medieval Latin ''sliones'') and troughs created by a system of [[plough]]ing used in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], typical of the [[open field system]]. It is also known as '''rig''' (or '''rigg''') '''and furrow''', mostly in the North East of England and in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levick|first=Paula|title=Ridge and Furrow|url=https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|work=Archaeology of East Oxford|accessdate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219171656/https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|archivedate=19 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiggSpellingExampleBreamish&gt;{{cite web|title=Breamish Valley Archaeology Project|url=http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/understanding/historyarchaeology/hillfortheritageintroduction/breamishvalleyproject|publisher=Northumberland National Park Authority|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/thesaurus/1/54/RIG%20AND%20FURROW|title=RIG AND FURROW {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples date to the immediate post-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period and the system was used until the 17th century in some areas, as long as the open field system survived. Surviving ridge and furrow topography is found in Great Britain, Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  The surviving ridges are parallel, ranging from {{Convert|3|to|22|yd|m|0}} apart and up to {{Convert|24|in|cm}} tall – they were much taller when in use. Older examples are often curved. 

Ridge and furrow topography was a result of ploughing with non-reversible ploughs on the same strip of land each year.  It is visible on land that was ploughed in the Middle Ages, but which has not been ploughed since then.  No actively ploughed ridge and furrow survives.

The ridges or ''lands'' became units in landholding, in assessing the work of the [[ploughman]] and in reaping in autumn.&lt;ref name=Homans&gt;[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991: "The Skills of Husbandmen" pp44ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Ploughing match from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ploughing with a single-sided plough in a ploughing match, showing furrows heaped towards centre of strip (The different strips will eventually meet). Note that this is not yet ridge and furrow, as the strip has only been ploughed once in this location.]]

Traditional ploughs have the [[Plowshare|ploughshare and mouldboard]] on the right, and so turn the soil over to the right (see [[Plough#Single-sided ploughing|single-sided ploughing]]).  This means that the plough cannot return along the same line for the next furrow.  Instead, ploughing is done in a clockwise direction around a long rectangular strip (a ''land'').  After ploughing one of the long sides of the strip, the plough is removed from the ground at the end of the field, moved across the unploughed ''headland'' (the short end of the strip), then put back in the ground to work back down the other long side of the strip.  The width of the ploughed strip is fairly narrow, to avoid having to drag the plough too far across the headland. This process has the effect of moving the soil in each half of the strip one furrow's-width towards the centre line each time the field is ploughed.

In the Middle Ages each strip was managed by one family, within large open fields held in common (see [[strip cultivation]]), and the locations of the strips were the same each year.  The movement of soil year after year gradually built the centre of each strip up into a ridge, leaving a dip, or "furrow" between each ridge (note that this use of "furrow" is different from that for the small furrow left by each pass of the plough).  The building up of a ridge was called ''filling'' or ''gathering'', and was sometimes done before ploughing began.  The raised ridges offered better drainage in a wet climate: moisture drained into the furrows, and since the ridges were laid down a slope, in a sloping field water would collect in a ditch at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Homans/&gt; Only on some well-drained soils were the fields left flat. In damper soil towards the base of the ridge, pulses ([[pea]]s or [[Vicia faba|bean]]s) or dredge (a mixture of [[oat]]s and [[barley]]) might be sown where [[wheat]] would have become waterlogged, as [[Thomas Tusser]] suggested in the 16th century:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
For wheat till land
Where water doth stand.
Sow pease or dredge
below in that redge.
{{Full|date=August 2018|reason=Need title of poem.}}&lt;/poem&gt;  

The dip often marked the boundary between plots.  Although they varied, strips would traditionally be a [[furlong]] (a "furrow-long") in length, (220 yards, about 200 metres), and from about {{Convert|5|yd|m}} up to a [[chain (unit)|chain]] wide (22 yards, about 20 metres), giving an area of from {{Convert|0.25|to|1|acre|ha|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba33/ba33feat.html David Hall, "Medieval fields in their many forms", ''British Archaeology'', '''33''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverreatrail.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=120 George Demidowicz, ''Ridge and Furrow Survey (King's Norton)'', Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;

In most places ploughing continued over the centuries, and later methods (especially the [[Plough#Reversible_plough|reversible plough]]) removed the ridge and furrow pattern.  However, in some cases the land became grassland, and where this has not been ploughed since, the pattern has often been preserved.  Surviving ridge and furrow may have a height difference of {{Convert|18|to|24|in|m|abbr=on|1}} in places, and gives a strongly rippled effect to the landscape.  When in active use, the height difference was even more, over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in places.&lt;ref name=Eyre&gt;[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/03n2a2.pdf Eyre,  S R.

&lt;/div&gt;

==Curved strips==
In the early Middle Ages ploughing was done with large teams of small [[ox]]en (commonly eight oxen in four pairs), and the plough itself was a large, mainly wooden implement.  The team and plough together were therefore many yards long, and this led to a particular effect in ridge and furrow fields.  When reaching the end of the furrow, the leading oxen met the end first, and were turned left along the headland, while the plough continued as long as possible in the furrow (the strongest oxen were [[yoke]]d at the back, and could draw the plough on their own for this short distance).  By the time the plough eventually reached the end, the oxen were standing lined up facing leftwards along the headland.  Each pair was then turned around to walk rightwards along the headland, crossing the end of the strip, and they then started down the opposite furrow.  By the time the plough itself reached the beginning of the furrow, the oxen were already lined up ready to pull it forwards.

The result of this was to twist the end of each furrow slightly to the left, making these earlier ridge and furrows into a slight reverse-S shape.&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;  This shape survives in some places as curved field boundaries, even where the ridge and furrow pattern itself has vanished.

If the oxen had been turned right at the end of the furrow, they would immediately have had to turn right again down the returning furrow, making the line of oxen cut across the top of the ploughed strip and thus pulling the plough out of the ground before it reached the end of the furrow, as well as having potential difficulty from two adjacent lines of oxen moving in opposite directions.  Alternatively, if lined up rightwards along the headland, some would already be past the beginning of the new furrow, and these would have to be moved awkwardly sideways into the furrow to be ready to plough.  Turning to the left made one turn at a time and avoided a sideways move.

As oxen became larger and ploughs more efficient, smaller teams were needed.  These took less room on the headland, and straight ploughing became easier – and easier still when [[Draft horse|heavy horses]] were introduced.  Late Middle Ages ridge and furrow is therefore straight.

==Surviving locations==
[[File:Blackhillrig1.jpg|thumb| Rig and furrow at Roughrig reservoir, near Airdrie, Scotland]]
Some of the best-preserved ridge and furrow survives in the [[English counties]] of:
* [[Buckinghamshire]]
* [[Cambridgeshire]]
* [[County Durham]]
* [[Derbyshire]]
* [[Gloucestershire]]
* [[Lincolnshire]]
* [[Leicestershire]]
* [[Northamptonshire]]
* [[Nottinghamshire]]
* [[Oxfordshire]]
* [[Warwickshire]]
* [[West Yorkshire]]

In Scotland, 4-600 acres of rig and furrow survive in one area outside the town of Airdrie.

Ridge and furrow often survives on higher ground where the arable land was subsequently turned over to [[Sheep husbandry|sheep walk]] in the 15th century and has never been ploughed out since by modern ploughing methods, today surviving still as pasture and grazing for sheep where the effect is clearly visible, especially when the sun is low or after a dusting of snow. It is often associated with [[deserted medieval village]]s.

This carbon travels down into the roots of the plant, where some travels back up to the leaves. The fixed carbon traveling to the root is radiated outward into the surrounding soil where microbes use it as food for growth. In return, microbes attach to the plant root where it improves the roots access to nutrients and its resistance to environmental stress and pathogens. In specific plant/root symbiotic relationships, the plant root secretes flavonoids into the soil which is sensed by microbes, where these microbes release nod factors to the plant root which promotes the infection of the plant root.

The '''root microbiome''' is the dynamic [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[microorganisms]] associated with plant [[root]]s. Because they are rich in a variety of carbon compounds, plant roots provide unique environments for a diverse assemblage of soil microorganisms, including [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[archaea]].

==Function==

===Types of Symbioses===
Root associated microbes include [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]] living within or on the surface of roots, as well as in the [[rhizosphere]]. [[Symbiosis|Symbionts]] associated with plant roots subsist off of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products (carbon rich molecules) from the plant host and can exist anywhere on the [[Symbiosis|mutualist/parasite]] continuum.

Root symbionts may improve their host's access to [[Plant nutrition#Functions of nutrients|nutrients]],&lt;ref name="vdH"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Heijden MG, Bardgett RD, van Straalen NM |title=The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=296–310 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18047587 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01139.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marschner |first1=Petra |last2=Crowley |first2=David |last3=Rengel |first3=Zed |year=2011 |title=Rhizosphere interactions between microorganisms and plants govern iron and phosphorus acquisition along the root axis – model and research methods |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=883–94 |doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Laura E. |last1=Green |first2=Andrea |last2=Porras-Alfaro |first3=Robert L. |last3=Sinsabaugh |date=September 2008 |title=Translocation of Nitrogen and Carbon Integrates Biotic Crust and Grass Production in Desert Grassland |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=1076–85 |jstor=20143553 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01388.x|bibcode=2009JEcol..98...74B }}&lt;/ref&gt; produce [[Plant hormone|plant-growth regulators]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lugtenberg B, Kamilova F |title=Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=63 |issue= |pages=541–56 |year=2009 |pmid=19575558 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.162918}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve [[Abiotic stress|environmental stress]] tolerance of their host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latch |first1=Garrick C.M. |year=1993 |title=Physiological interactions of endophytic fungi and their hosts.

Symbionts may be biotrophic (subsisting off of living tissue) or necrotrophic (subsisting off of dead tissue).

===Mutualist-Parasite Continuum===
While some microbes may be purely [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]]ic or [[Parasite|parasitic]], many may behave one way or the other depending on the host species with which it is associated, environmental conditions, and host health.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; A host’s immune response controls symbiont infection and growth rates.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; If a host’s immune response is not able to control a particular microbial species, or if host immunity is compromised, the microbe-plant relationship will likely reside somewhere nearer the parasitic side of the mutualist-parasite continuum. Similarly, high nutrients can push some microbes into parasitic behavior, encouraging unchecked growth at a time when symbionts are no longer needed to aid with nutrient acquisition.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt;

==Composition==
Roots are colonized by [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Because they are [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], fungi can extend [[hypha]]e from nutrient exchange organs within host cells into the surrounding rhizosphere and bulk soil. Fungi that extend beyond the root surface and engage in nutrient-carbon exchange with the plant host are commonly considered to be [[Mycorrhizal fungi|mycorrhizal]], but external hyphae can also include other [[Endophyte|endophytic]] fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi can extend a great distance into bulk soil,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; thereby increasing the root system’s reach and surface area, enabling mycorrhizal fungi to acquire a large percentage of its host plant’s nutrients. In some ecosystems, up to 80% of plant nitrogen and 90% of plant phosphorus is acquired by mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;ref name="vdH"/&gt; In return, plants may allocate ~20-40% of their carbon to mycorrhizae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sally E. |last1=Smith |first2=David J. |last2=Read |title=Mycorrhizal Symbiosis |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Academic Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-08-053719-1}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mycorrhizae===
{{main|Mycorrhiza}}
Mycorrhizae include a broad variety of root-fungi interactions characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form mycorrhizal associations, and there is evidence that some mycorrhizae transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The main groups include [[ectomycorrhiza]]e, [[arbuscular mycorhiza]]e, [[ericoid mycorrhiza]]e, [[orchid mycorrhiza]]e, and [[monotropoid mycorrhizae]]. Monotropoid mycorrhizae are associated with plants in the [[monotropaceae]], which lack [[chlorophyll]]. Many [[Orchidaceae|Orchids]] are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of mycorrhizal associations are called [[Myco-heterotrophy|mycoheterotrophs]].

===Endophytes===
{{main|Endophyte}}
Endophytes are bacteria or fungi that live within plant tissue. They may colonize inter-cellular spaces, the root cells themselves, or both. [[Rhizobia]] and [[dark septate endophytes]] (which produce [[melanin]], an [[antioxidant]] that may provide resilience against a variety of environmental stresses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ari |last1=Jumpponen |first2=James M. |last2=Trappe |date=October 1998 |title=Dark Septate Endophytes: A Review of Facultative Biotrophic Root-Colonizing Fungi |journal=New Phytologist |volume=140 |issue=2 |pages=295–310 |jstor=2588371 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are famous examples.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Archaea===
{{main|Archaea}}
Archaea are traditionally thought of as [[Extremophile|microbes belonging to extreme environments]]. Though they are found in plant roots, little is known about their effect on plant health or their role in the root microbiome.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

==Assembly Mechanisms==
There is an ongoing debate regarding what mechanisms are responsible for assembling individual microbes into [[Community (ecology)|communities]]. There are two primary competing hypotheses. One is that "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects," meaning [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors pose the only constraints, through [[natural selection]], to which microbes colonize what [[Ecology#Physical environments|environments]]. This is called the [[Niche (ecology)|niche]] hypothesis, and its counterpart is the hypothesis that neutral processes, such as distance and geographic barriers to [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]], control microbial community assembly when [[Taxon|taxa]] are equally [[Biological fitness|fit]] within an environment. In this hypothesis, differences between individual taxa in modes and reach of dispersal explain the differences in microbial communities of different environments.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt; Most likely, both natural selection and neutral processes affect microbial community assembly, though certain microbial taxa may be more restricted by one process or the other depending on their physiological restrictions and mode of dispersion.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt;

Microbial dispersal mechanisms include wind, water, and hitchhiking on more mobile macrobes. Microbial dispersion is difficult to study, and little is known about its effect on microbial community assembly relative to the effect of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt; particularly in roots. For this reason only assembly mechanisms that fit within the niche hypothesis are discussed below.

The taxa within root microbial communities seem to be drawn from the surrounding soil, though the relative abundance of various taxa may differ greatly from those found in bulk soil due to unique [[Niche (ecology)|niches]] in the root and rhizosphere.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

===Biotic Assembly Mechanisms===
Different parts of the root are associated with different microbial communities. For example, fine roots, root tips, and the main root are all associated with different communities,&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marschner |first1=P |last2=Yang |first2=C.-H |last3=Lieberei |first3=R |last4=Crowley |first4=D.E |year=2001 |title=Soil and plant specific effects on bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1437–45 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rhizosphere, root surface, and root tissue are all associated with different communities,&lt;ref name ="Gottel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; likely due to the unique chemistry and nutrient status of each of these regions. Additionally different plant species, and even different cultivars, harbor different microbial communities,&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchner"/&gt; probably due to host specific immune responses&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; and differences in carbon root exudates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broeckling CD, Broz AK, Bergelson J, Manter DK, Vivanco JM |title=Root exudates regulate soil fungal community composition and diversity |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=738–44 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18083870 |pmc=2227741 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02188-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Host age affects root microbial community composition, likely for similar reasons as host identity.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt; The identity of neighboring vegetation has also been shown to impact a host plant's root microbial community composition.&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bogar LM, Kennedy PG |title=New wrinkles in an old paradigm: neighborhood effects can modify the structure and specificity of Alnus-associated ectomycorrhizal fungal communities |journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=767–77 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23078526 |doi=10.1111/1574-6941.12032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meinhardt KA, Gehring CA |title=Disrupting mycorrhizal mutualisms: a potential mechanism by which exotic tamarisk outcompetes native cottonwoods |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=532–49 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22611852 |doi=10.1890/11-1247.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abiotic Assembly Mechanisms===
Abiotic mechanisms also affect root microbial community assembly&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardoim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedersoo"/&gt; because individual taxa have different optima along various [[environmental gradient]]s, such as nutrient concentrations, pH, moisture, temperature, etc. In addition to chemical and climatic factors, soil structure and disturbance impact root biotic assembly.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

===Succession===
The root microbiome is dynamic, fluid within the constraints imposed by the biotic and abiotic environment. As in [[Macroecology|macroecological]] systems, the historical trajectory of the microbiotic community may partially determine the present and future community. Due to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between microbial taxa, the taxa colonizing a root at any given moment could be expected to influence which new taxa are acquired, and therefor how the community responds to changes in the host or environment.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt;  While the effect of initial community on microbial [[Ecological succession|succession]] has been studied in various environmental samples, [[human microbiome]], and laboratory settings, it has yet to be studied in roots.

'''School of Paris''' refers to the many [[Manuscript illumination|manuscript illuminators]], whose identities are mostly unknown, who made Paris an internationally important centre of illumination throughout the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods of the [[Middle Ages]], and for some time into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/euwf.html France 1400-1600, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these artists were [[Master Honoré]],&lt;ref&gt;Branner, Robert (1977) ''Manuscript Painting in Paris During the Reign of Saint Louis: A Study of Styles''.

The '''Sokal affair''', also called the '''Sokal hoax''',&lt;ref name="Derrida97"&gt;Derrida (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[scholarly publishing sting]] perpetrated by [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]]. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to ''[[Social Text]]'', an academic journal of [[postmodern]] [[cultural studies]]. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's [[Rigour#Intellectual rigour|intellectual rigor]] and, specifically, to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies&amp;nbsp;– whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]]&amp;nbsp;– [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name="experiments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies |last=Sokal |first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date= 5 June 1996 |accessdate= 2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative [[Hermeneutics]] of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan D.|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|journal=Social Text|date=1996|volume=46–47|pages=217–252|doi=10.2307/466856|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. It proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic [[peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate=April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| date=November 28, 1994| work = [[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| url = http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html| title = Mystery science theater| author1 = Bruce Robbins| author2 = Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt;

The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of commentary about the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of [[postmodern philosophy]] on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of ''Social Text''; and whether ''Social Text'' had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.

==Background==
In an interview on the U.S. radio program ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading ''[[Higher Superstition]]'' (1994), in which authors [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] claim that some humanities journals would publish anything as long as it had "the proper leftist thought" and quoted (or was written by) well-known leftist thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first = Alan|last = Sokal|subjectlink = Alan Sokal|interviewer = [[Robert Siegel]]|title = Parody|work = [[All Things Considered]]|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = 15 May 1996|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1043441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=mLgyyDSicEwC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=higher+superstition+proper+leftist+thought#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20superstition%20proper%20leftist%20thought&amp;f=false|title = The Ivory Tower of Babel: Why the Social Sciences are Failing to Live Up to Their Promises|first = David|last = Demers|publisher = [[Algora Publishing]]|year = 2011|isbn = 9780875868806|chapter = Jesse Jackson vs. The Professors|pages = 15–40|quote = Sokal got the idea for his "experiment" after reading Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt's ''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994).  Gross and Levitt argued that the success of getting published in postmodern journals was based not on the quality of the work but rather on its "academic leanings &amp;ndash; papers displaying the proper leftist thought, especially if written by or quoting well known authors, were being published in spite of their low quality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross and Levitt had been vocal defenders of the [[scientific realist]] camp of the "[[science wars]]", opposing postmodernist academics who questioned [[Objectivity (science)|scientific objectivity]]. They asserted that [[anti-intellectual]] sentiment in [[liberal arts]] departments (and especially in English departments) caused the rise of [[deconstruction]]ist thought, which eventually led to a deconstructionist critique of science.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} They saw the critique as a "repertoire of rationalizations" for avoiding the study of science.&lt;ref&gt;''Higher Supersitition'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Article==
Sokal reasoned that, if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct, the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it. What would matter would be [[ideology|ideologic]] obsequiousness, fawning references to deconstructionist writers, and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon.  Writing after the article was published and the hoax revealed, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy. The editors of Social Text liked my article because they liked its conclusion: that "the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project" [sec. 6]. They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. "Revelation: A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies". ''Sokal Hoax: The Sham That Shook the Academy.'' Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska, 2000. 49-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Content of the article===
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" proposed that [[quantum gravity]] has [[Progressivism|progressive]] political implications, and that the "[[morphogenetic field (Rupert Sheldrake)|morphogenetic field]]" could be a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity (a morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by [[Rupert Sheldrake]] in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair's aftermath as "a bizarre [[New Age]] idea").&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt; Sokal wrote that the concept of "an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being" was "dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook".

After referring skeptically to the "so-called scientific method", the article declared that "it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical 'reality{{'"}} is fundamentally "a social and linguistic construct".  It went on to state that because scientific research is "inherently theory-laden and self-referential", it "cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities" and that therefore a "liberatory science" and an "emancipatory mathematics", spurning "the elite caste canon of 'high science{{'"}}, needed to be established for a "postmodern science [that] provide[s] powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project".

Moreover, the article's footnotes conflate academic terms with sociopolitical rhetoric, e.g.:

{{quote|Just as [[liberal feminist]]s are frequently content with a minimal agenda of legal and social equality for women and "[[pro-choice]]", so liberal (and even some [[socialist]]) mathematicians are often content to work within the hegemonic [[Zermelo–Fraenkel framework]] (which, reflecting its nineteenth-century liberal origins, already incorporates the axiom of equality) supplemented only by the [[axiom of choice]].}}

===Publication===
Sokal submitted the article to ''Social Text'', whose editors were collecting articles for the "[[Science Wars]]" issue. "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" was the only article submitted by a natural scientist. Later, after Sokal's self-exposure of his [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[hoax]] article in the journal ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', the ''Social Text'' editors said in a published essay that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make,&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; and had had concerns about the quality of the writing, stating "We requested him (a)&amp;nbsp;to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and (b)&amp;nbsp;to excise most of his footnotes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Lingua Franca|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite subsequently designating the physicist as having been a "difficult, uncooperative author", and noting that such writers were "well known to journal editors", ''[[Social Text]]'' published the article in acknowledgment of the author's credentials in the May 1996 Spring/Summer "Science Wars" issue.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; The editors did not seek peer review of the article by physicists or otherwise; they later defended this decision on the basis that ''Social Text'' was a journal for open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to the physics discipline.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt;

==Responses==

===Follow-up between Sokal and the editors===
In the May 1996 issue of ''Lingua Franca'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal revealed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" was a hoax and concluded that ''Social Text'' "felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject" because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias.&lt;ref name="experiments" /&gt; In their defense, the ''Social Text'' editors said they believed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" "was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field" and that "its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ross, [http://www.math.tohoku.ac.jp/~kuroki/Sokal/sokaltxt/00005.txt "A discussion of Jacques Derrida and Deconstruction"], May 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Besides criticizing his writing style, the ''Social Text'' editors accused Sokal of behaving [[ethics|unethically]] in deceiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bruce |last1=Robbins |first2=Andrew |last2=Ross |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf |format=PDF |title=Editorial response to Sokal hoax by editors of Social Text |year= 1996|publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal said the editors' response illustrated the problem he highlighted. ''Social Text'', as an academic journal, published the article not because it was faithful, true and accurate to its subject but because an "[[Argument from authority|academic authority]]" had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing. The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation. Sokal remarked:

{{quote|My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of [[literary criticism|lit crit]] (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. ... There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless, or even counterproductive.&lt;ref name=MST/&gt;}}

''Social Text'''s response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal's piece was a parody. Instead, they speculated Sokal's admission "represented a change of heart, or a folding of his intellectual resolve". Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article's absurdity was hard to spot:

{{quote|In the second paragraph I declare without the slightest evidence or argument, that "physical 'reality' (note the scare quotes) [...] is at bottom a social and linguistic construct."  Not our ''theories'' of physical reality, mind you, but the reality itself. Fair enough. Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment.  I live on the twenty-first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, John, The Oxford Book of Parodies, Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 307&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Book by Sokal and Bricmont===
{{main|Fashionable Nonsense}}
In 1997, Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] co-wrote ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (U.S.: ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science]]'', U.K.: ''Intellectual Impostures'', 1998).&lt;ref name="EnglishPreface"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|author2=[[Jean Bricmont]]|title=Intellectual Impostures|publisher=Profile Books|year=1998|location=London|page=xii|isbn=1-86197-631-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The book featured analysis of extracts from established [[intellectual]]s' writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|work=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed with a critical summary of [[postmodernism]] and criticism of the [[strong programme]] of [[social constructionism]] in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Epstein97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm|title=Postmodernism and the Left|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Epstein|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Epstein|work=[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]&lt;!-- vol. 6, no. 2 (new series), whole no. 22 --&gt;|date=Winter 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004646/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage and Jacques Derrida===
As Sokal revealed the hoax, the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] was initially one of the targets of discredit in the United States, particularly in newspaper coverage.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; A U.S. weekly magazine used two images of Derrida, a photo and a [[caricature]], to illustrate a "dossier" on the Sokal article.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; Derrida responded to the hoax in "Sokal et Bricmont ne sont pas sérieux" ("Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious"), first published on 20 November 1997 in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruining the chance to carefully sort out controversies about scientific objectivity. Derrida went on to fault him and coauthor Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith in describing their follow-up book, ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (UK: ''Intellectual Impostures''; US: ''Fashionable Nonsense''): they had published two articles almost simultaneously, one in English in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 17 October 1997&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "The Furor Over Impostures intellectuelles: What Is All the Fuss About?" ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' 17 October 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and one in French in ''[[Libération]]'' on 18–19 October 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Que se passe-t-il ?" ''[[Libération]]'' 18–19 October 1997. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but while the two articles were almost identical, they differed in how they treated Derrida. The English-language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal and Bricmont's book: "Such well-known thinkers as Althusser, Barthes, and Foucault—who, as readers of the TLS will be well aware, have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel—appear in our book only in a minor role, as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize." The French-language list, however, included Derrida: "Des penseurs célèbres tels qu'Althusser, Barthes, Derrida et Foucault sont essentiellement absents de notre livre." Derrida may also have been sensitive to a slight difference between the French and English versions of ''Impostures intellectuelles''. In the French, his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an "isolated" instance of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Impostures intellectuelles''. Paris: Odile Jacob, 1997. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida's work contained "no systematic misuse (or indeed attention to) science."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Fashionable Nonsense''. New York: Picador USA, 1998. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Brian J. (2006). Hopkins Impromptu: Following Jacques Derrida Through Theory's Empire. ''MLN'', 121(4), pp. 919-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida cried foul, but Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was "banal."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Réponse à Jacques Derrida et Max Dorra." ''[[Le Monde]]'', 12 December 1997. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Derrida concluded, as the title of his article indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |pages=70 |nopp=true |isbn=08-047-4619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science criticism===
Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner, the [[Cornell University]] science and technology studies department chairman, wrote "The Sokal Affair in Context" (1997),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein used a similar approach to Sokal's, submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response. Though far more systematic than Sokal's work, it received scant media attention. Hilgartner argued that the intellectual impact of the successful Sokal hoax cannot be attributed to its quality as a "demonstration" but rather to journalistic hyperbole and the anti-intellectual biases of some American journalists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Sokal Affair scandal extended from academia to the public press. The [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]], criticized in ''Fashionable Nonsense'', described the scandal as a "[[tempest in a tea cup]]". Retired [[Northeastern University]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays meant to discredit the statements of Sokal and his allies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gabriel |last=Stolzenberg |url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr |title=Debunk: Expose as a Sham or False |publisher=Math.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized, rendering their criticism meaningless. In ''Social Studies of Science'', Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/reply_to_stolzenberg_v2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reply to Gabriel Stolzenberg|work=Social Studies of Science |publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing his "tendentious misrepresentations" of their work and criticizing Stolzenberg's commentary about the "[[strong programme]]" of the sociology of science. In the same issue, Stolzenberg replied, arguing that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings. He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments proposed by each party, bearing in mind that "the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolzenberg|first1=Gabriel|title=Reply to Bricmont and Sokal|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr/reply_to_bs.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological follow-up study==
In 2009, Cornell sociologist Robb Willer performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal's paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic. He found that students who believed the paper's author was a high-status intellectual rated it higher in quality and intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willer |first= Robb|last2= Kuwabara|first2= Ko|last3= Macy|first3= Michael|date= September 2009|title= The False Enforcement of Unpopular Norms|url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4570/false%20enforcement.pdf|journal= American Journal of Sociology|volume= 115|issue= 2|pages= 451–90|access-date=21 February 2015|doi=10.1086/599250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2788">'''Synchronous context-free grammars''' ('''SynCFG''' or '''SCFG'''; not to be confused with [[Stochastic context-free grammar|stochastic CFGs]]) are a type of [[formal grammar]] designed for use in [[transfer-based machine translation]]. Rules in these grammars apply to two languages at the same time, capturing grammatical structures that are each other's translations.

The theory of SynCFGs borrows from [[syntax-directed transduction]] and [[syntax-based machine translation]], modeling the reordering of clauses that occurs when translating a sentence by correspondences between phrase-structure rules in the source and target languages. Performance of SCFG-based MT systems has been found comparable with, or even better than, state-of-the-art [[phrase-based machine translation]] systems.&lt;ref name="Chiang"&gt;{{cite journal

==Formalism==
Rules in a SynCFG are superficially similar to CFG rules, except that they specify the structure of two phrases at the same time; one in the source language (the language being translated) and one in the target language. Numeric indices indicate correspondences between non-terminals in both constituent trees. Chiang&lt;ref name="Chiang"/&gt; gives the Chinese/English example:

: {{math|''X'' →}} (yu {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} you {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, have {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}})

This rule indicates that an {{mvar|X}} phrase can be formed in Chinese with the structure "yu {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} you {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}", where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are variables standing in for subphrases; and that the corresponding structure in English is "have {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}" where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are independently translated to English.

In [[Latin America]], '''tierra fría''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''cold land'') are mountain locations where high [[elevation]] results in a markedly cooler [[climate]] than that encountered in the lowlands at a comparable [[latitude]]. The combination of low latitude and high altitude &amp;mdash; typically between approximately 6,000&amp;nbsp;ft (about 1,850 m) and 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft (about 3,600 m)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

in locations within 10° of the [[equator]] &amp;mdash; produces a climate that falls into the same category as many [[oceanic climate]]s found along the west coasts of the continents within the temperate zones &amp;mdash; mild temperatures all year round, with monthly averages ranging from about 10°C (50°F) in the coldest months to about 18°C (64.4°F) in the warmest months (at places further poleward the range of altitudes where this climate exists becomes progressively lower). Common crops grown in the tierra fría are potatoes, wheat, barley, oats, corn, and rye.

Beyond the ''tierra fría'' is a region known as the ''[[Suni (geography)|suni]]'', ''[[puna grassland|puna]]'', or ''[[páramo]]s''; near the Equator this encompasses places with altitudes of between roughly 12,000&amp;nbsp;ft (3,600 m) and 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (4,500 m), representing the [[treeline]] and the [[snow line]] respectively.  Vegetation here resembles that found in the [[tundra]] of the [[polar climate|polar]] regions.  Still higher is the ''[[tierra nevada]]'', where permanent snow and ice prevail. The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal ([[Altitudinal zonation]]) used following altitudes: 2,300 m (end of the Cloud forest or ''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]''), 3,500 m ([[Treeline]]) and 4,800 m ([[puna grassland|Puna]] end).&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú.

First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, Boletín del Museo de historia natural „Javier Prado“, n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Latin America's largest cities are found in the tierra fria, most notably [[Bogotá|Bogotá, Colombia]], altitude 2,640 m, [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]], altitude 2,240 m and [[Quito|Quito, Ecuador]], altitude 2,850 m; all three cities are also the capitals of those respective countries.

[[Agriculture]] in the region resembles that which is conducted in valley areas in the temperate zones, featuring such crops as [[barley]] and [[potato]]es.

This '''timeline of plesiosaur research''' is a chronologically ordered list of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions, and cultural portrayals of [[plesiosaurs]], an order of [[marine reptiles]] that flourished during the [[Mesozoic Era]]. The first scientifically documented plesiosaur fossils were discovered during the early [[:Category:19th century in paleontology|19th century]] by [[Mary Anning]].&lt;ref name="ellis-intro-3" /&gt; Plesiosaurs were actually discovered and described before [[dinosaurs]].&lt;ref name="ellis-overview-20" /&gt; They were also among the first animals to be featured in [[Paleoart|artistic reconstructions]] of the ancient world, and therefore among the earliest prehistoric creatures to attract the attention of the lay public.&lt;ref name="ellis-overview-21" /&gt; Plesiosaurs were originally thought to be a kind of primitive transitional form between marine life and terrestrial [[reptiles]]. However, now plesiosaurs are recognized as highly derived marine reptiles descended from terrestrial ancestors.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-118" /&gt;

Early researchers thought that plesiosaurs laid [[egg (biology)|egg]]s like most reptiles. They commonly imagined plesiosaurs crawling up beaches and burying eggs like [[turtles]]. However, later opinion shifted towards the idea that plesiosaurs gave live birth and never went on dry land.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-119" /&gt; Plesiosaur locomotion has been a source of continuous controversy among paleontologists.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-136" /&gt; The earliest speculations on the subject during the 19th century saw plesiosaur swimming as analogous to the paddling of modern [[sea turtles]]. During the 1920s opinion shifted to the idea that plesiosaurs swam with a [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]] motion.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-137" /&gt; However, a paper published in 1975 that once more found support for sea turtle-like swimming in plesiosaurs.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-138" /&gt; This conclusion reignited the controversy regarding plesiosaur locomotion through the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-139" /&gt; In 2011, [[F. Robin O'Keefe]] and [[Luis M. Chiappe]] concluded the debate on plesiosaur reproduction, reporting the discovery of a gravid female plesiosaur with a single large embryo preserved inside her.&lt;ref name="okeefe-chiappe-pregnant-870" /&gt;

Associated remains of plesiosaurs and animals like the diving [[bird]] ''[[Hesperornis]]'' or the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'' may have inspired legends about conflict between [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunder Birds]] and Water Monsters told by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[Paleontology in Kansas|Kansas]] and [[Paleontology in Nebraska|Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="mayor-bone-cheyenne-178-211" /&gt;

This represents a span of time approximating 3.3 million years. He found ''Dolichorhynchops osborni'' to have had an even longer lifespan, from the middle Turonian to the early Campanian., or roughly 4 million years. His research also suggested that there was a span of time during the life of the Western Interior Seaway in which it was not inhabited by polycotylids.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-147" /&gt;

He also reported that the ''Dolichorhynchops'' specimen KUVP 40001 from the Pierre Shale of South Dakota may have achieved the extraordinary length of 23 feet.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-129" /&gt; The large size of the Pierre Shale ''Dolichorhynchops'' compared to those of the earlier Smoky Hill Chalk suggested to Carpenter that these plesiosaurs were evolving larger body sizes over time. In fact the Pierre Shale specimens of ''Dolichorhynchops'' were nearly as large as ''Brachauchenius lucasi''.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-153" /&gt; Carpenter described a particularly large specimen of that latter taxon in this paper as well, specifically FHSM VP-321.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-152" /&gt; His study of ''Brachauchenius'' led him to concur with Williston that it was closely related to ''Liopleurodon ferox''.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-152" /&gt;

* [[Tamaki Sato]] and [[Kazushige Tanabe]] reported that a partial long necked plesiosaur skeleton had been discovered on the banks of [[Hokkaido]]'s [[Obirashibe River]]. Although they could not identify its exact species, the specimen was significant because its stomach contents provided clues to long-necked plesiosaur diets. This individual's gut preserved the [[beaks]] of thirty small [[ammonites]].&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-155-156" /&gt;
* [[John A. Long]] bemoaned the fact that the putative "''Kronosaurus queenslandicus''" uncovered by a Harvard team during the early 1930s had still not been formally described for the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-176" /&gt;
* Michael Everhart and Glenn Storrs excavated additional ''Elasmosaurus'' ribs, vertebrae and gastroliths at the site of the 1991 discovery.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-124" /&gt;

* [[Theagarten Lingham-Soliar]] published further criticism of Robinson's interpretation of the biomechanics of plesiosaur locomotion.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-141" /&gt;
* O'Keefe described the new species Hauffiosaurus zanoni.&lt;ref name="smith-appendix1-258" /&gt;
* Michael Everhart re-examined UNSM 1195.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-127" /&gt;
* Lingham-Soliar argued that plesiosaur hind-flippers weren't mobile or muscular enough to help propel them through the water.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-135" /&gt;
* Everhart published a study of the gastroliths associated with the elasmosaur specimen KUVP 129744 from Kansas. The specimen was associated with roughly 13.1&amp;nbsp;kg of gastroliths. The largest of these was 17&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1.4&amp;nbsp;kg in weight. Everhart would later compare its size to that of a softball and observe that not only was it one of the largest known plesiosaur gastroliths, but also one of the largest gastroliths from any animal.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-137" /&gt;

''November''
* ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', a newspaper based in [[Adelaide]], Australia bought the Addyman opalized plesiosaur specimen for $25,000 and donated it to the [[South Australian Museum]]. A paleontologist at the museum named [[Ben Kear]] identified it as a member of the genus ''[[Leptocleidus]]''. The two foot long specimen was the smallest specimen of the genus ever found and probably a baby.&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-174" /&gt;

'''[[2001 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C"&gt;2001&lt;/span&gt;]]'''{{anchor|2001}}

* [[David J. Cicimiurri]] and [[Michael J. Everhart]] published a study of the Styxosaurus snowii specimen NJSM 15435, which preserved both stomach contents and gastroliths.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-137" /&gt; Among the stomach contents were remains of the bony fish Enchodus.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-134" /&gt; By this point in time at least fifteen different plesiosaur specimens were known with preserved stomach contents.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-155" /&gt; The researchers observed that the Enchodus remains preserved in NJSM 15435 were an example of shifting dietary preferences in plesiosaurs, who fed primarily on cephalopods for most of their evolutionary history, before coming to rely more heavily on fishes during the Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-134" /&gt;

They also noted that some of NJSM 15435's gastroliths were scarred by rounded chips and arc-shaped marks. These were likely inflicted by contact with other gastroliths during the churning of the animal's stomach, and constituted physical evidence that plesiosaurs used their gastroliths to help break down their food during digestion.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-139" /&gt; Cicimurri and Everhart disputed the hypothesis that plesiosaurs used their gastroliths for ballast on the grounds that swallowing and vomiting such stones would be relatively difficult for the long-necked forms and their feeding grounds may have been hundreds of miles from sources of stones.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-159"/&gt;

* Everhart resumed the study of the partially digested plesiosaur skull bones, FHSM VP-13966. He sought the expertise of Ken Carpenter due to his relevant 1996 paper on short-necked plesiosaurs. Carpenter identified the bones as probable Dolichorhynchops remains.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-150" /&gt;
* Noe published another study of ''Pachycostasaurus''. He changed his mind regarding its diet. Where previously he believed it to feed on soft-bodied animals, the robust and "heavily ornamented" build of its teeth suggested it fed on harder, bonier prey.&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-191" /&gt;

[[File:Ichthyosaurus Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|right|Life restoration of ''[[Leptocleidus capensis]]''.]]
''September''
* [[Eberhard Frey]], [[Celine Bachy]], and [[Wolfgang Stinnesbeck]] gave a presentation on the Aramberri pliosaur remains to the [[European Workshop on Vertebrate Paleontology]] in [[Florence]], Italy. The paleontologists could not identify its species.&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-181-182" /&gt;

''September 11''
* Everhart was forced to cancel plans to examined the ''Tylosaurus'' specimen USNM 8898 and its polycotylid dinner USNM 9468 due to the September 11th terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-145" /&gt;

* [[Robin O'Keefe]] publishes a series of papers examining the aspect ratios of plesiosaur flippers and comparing them to the wings of [[birds]], [[bats]], and [[aircraft]]. O'Keefe concluded that long-necked plesiosaurs were long distance swimmers, while pliosaurs were more maneuverable.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-142-143" /&gt;

* Druckenmiller described the new species ''[[Edgarosaurus muddi]]''.&lt;ref name="smith-appendix1-258" /&gt;
* Michael Everhart examined FHSM VP-398 and found Sternberg's original note revealing that these fossils had been collected at the same site as the 1991 Elasmosaurus discovery. Everhart realized that the remains discovered there collectively represented most of the bones that had been missing from the Elasmosaurus type specimen. He inferred that they may represent fragments that fell off of the decomposing type carcass while it was adrift, before its final burial and fossilization.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-124" /&gt;
* An elasmosaur specimen with over 600 associated gastroliths was discovered in the Pierre Shale of Nebraska. The specimen is now catalogued as UNSM 1111-002.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-137" /&gt;

''December 30''
* The [[BBC]] began making sensational claims about the Aramberri pliosaur, claiming that the unidentified pliosaur was a ''Liopleurodon'', that it was 65 feet long, that its teeth were the size of [[machetes]], and its jaws powerful enough to crush [[granite]].&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-182" /&gt;

* The [[University of Nebraska]] led the excavation of a long-necked plesiosaur skeleton on local [[Santee Sioux]] land.&lt;ref name="mayor-conflicts-303" /&gt; The Santee people requested that the skeleton be mounted and displayed with a plaque acknowledging them as the source of the fossils and as having given permission for the [[University of Nebraska State Museum|museum]] to display the remains. However, the museum claims it could not honor the request as it did not have the funding to mount the skeleton for display, and it further claimed that the land the fossils were recovered from was of "disputed" ownership.&lt;ref name="mayor-conflicts-303-304" /&gt;
* Mulder and others reported the presence of elasmosaur remains in Europe.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-129" /&gt;

[[File:Thililua BW.jpg|thumb|right|Life restoration of ''[[Thililua]]'']]
* Sato described the new genus and species Terminonatator ponteixensis. In his study of the animal's skeleton, he found that the vertebral discs in the neck were flat on both sides and packed tightly together. He estimated that there would have been only about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm of cartilaginous padding between these discs. These observations provided additional evidence for a lack of flexibility in plesiosaur necks.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-132" /&gt;
* Everhart argued contrary to Carpenter's 1996 paper that polycotylids were present throughout the life of the Western Interior Seaway.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-148" /&gt;
* Everhart finally described the partially digested partial plesiosaur skull he discovered in 1992. These were among the earliest known plesiosaur fossils in the Smoky Hill Chalk. He has since concluded that the animal that partially digested the remains was probably a shark, which would go on to vomit them up before they were buried and preserved.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-149" /&gt;

* Everhart argued that the greater abundance of arc shaped marks and rounded divots in plesiosaur gastroliths compared to rocks deposited by ancient rivers and sea shores was evidence for their use in the breakdown of plesiosaurs' food.&lt;ref name="everhart-elasmosaurs-139" /&gt;
* Everhart redescribed the Tylosaurus specimen USNM 8898 and its polycotylid dinner USNM 9468. Contrary to Sternberg's original assessment of the stomach contents as representing a "huge plesiosaur" Everhart found it to be a young polycotylid only about 2-2.5 m long.&lt;ref name="everhart-pliosaurs-145" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7017">'''Virtual prototyping''' is a method in the process of product development. It involves using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-automated design]] (CAutoD) and [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) software to validate a design before committing to making a physical [[prototype]]. This is done by creating (usually 3D) computer generated geometrical shapes (parts) and either combining them into an "assembly" and testing different mechanical motions, fit and function. The assembly or individual parts could be opened in CAE software to simulate the behavior of the product in the real world.

==Background==
The product design and development process used to rely primarily on engineers' experience and judgment in producing an initial concept design. A physical prototype was then constructed and tested in order to evaluate its performance. Without any way to evaluate its performance in advance, the initial prototype was highly unlikely to meet expectations. Engineers usually had to re-design the initial concept multiple times to address weaknesses that were revealed in physical testing.

==Move towards virtual prototypes==
Today, manufacturers are under pressure to reduce time to market and optimize products to higher levels of performance and reliability. A much higher number of products are being developed in the form of virtual prototypes in which engineering simulation software is used to predict performance prior to constructing physical prototypes. Engineers can quickly explore the performance of thousands of design alternatives without investing the time and money required to build physical prototypes. The ability to explore a wide range of design alternatives leads to improvements in performance and design quality. Yet the time required to bring the product to market is usually reduced substantially because virtual prototypes can be produced much faster than physical prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = James C., Jr. | last1 = Schaaf | first2 = Faye Lynn | last2 =Thompson | title = Systems Concept Development with Virtual Prototyping | citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.2308 | conference = 29th conference on Winter simulation | pages = 941–947 | date = 1997 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = LaCourse | url = http://www.cadalyst.com/manufacturing/virtual-prototyping-pays-9774 | title = Virtual Prototyping Pays Off | journal = Cadalyst Magazine | date = May 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tim | last = Ghazaleh | url = http://pcdandf.com/cms/images/stories/mag/0411/0411ghazaleh.pdf | title = Virtual Prototyping | journal = Printed Circuit Design &amp; Manufacture Magazine | date = November 1, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Von Thomas | last = Otto | url = http://www.digital-engineering-magazin.de/blaetterkataloge/2010_06/flash.html#/17/ | title = Endlich umfassend simulieren | journal = Digital Engineering | volume = 6/10 | date = July–August 2010 | access-date = 2010-10-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102211840/http://www.digital-engineering-magazin.de/blaetterkataloge/2010_06/flash.html#/17/ | archive-date = 2011-01-02 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End-to-end prototyping==
End-to-end prototyping accounts fully for how a product or a component is manufactured and assembled, and it links the consequences of those processes to performance. Early availability of such physically realistic virtual prototypes allows testing and performance confirmation to take place as design decisions are made; enabling the acceleration of the design activity and providing more insight on the relationship between manufacturing and performance than can be achieved by building and testing physical prototypes.  The benefits include reduced costs in both design and manufacturing as physical prototyping and testing is dramatically reduced/eliminated and lean but robust manufacturing processes are selected.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad El Khaldi, Raymond Ni, Pierre Culiere, Peter Ullrich, Carlos Terres Aboitiz.

==Effects==
The research firm Aberdeen Group&lt;!-- Until there's a name change filed, we use corporate name, not marketing name--&gt; reports that best-in-class manufacturers, who make extensive use of simulation early in the design process, hit revenue, cost, and launch date and quality targets for 86% or more of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Aberdeen Group (October 2006). [http://www.reden.nl/bestanden/Aberdeen_Simulation_Driven_Design.pdf "Simulation-Driven Design Benchmark Report: Getting It Right the First Time"]. p. i. October 2006.  Retrieved 2010-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Best-in-class manufacturers of the most complex products get to market 158 days earlier with $1.9 million lower costs than all other manufacturers. Best-in-class manufacturers of the simplest products get to market 21 days earlier with $21,000 fewer product development costs.&lt;ref&gt;Aberdeen, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Fisker Automotive]] used virtual prototyping to design the rear structure and other areas of its Karma plug-in hybrid to ensure the integrity of the fuel tank in a rear end crash as required for [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] (FMVSS) 301 certification.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.sae.org/11735/ Fisker reduces number of prototypes, cuts time to market with Virtual Performance Solution]," ''Automotive Engineering International'', January, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agilent Technologies]] used virtual prototyping to design cooling systems for the calibration head for a new high-speed [[oscilloscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt Richter, "[http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2013/10/hot-box Simulation techniques help cool the calibration head for the world's fastest real-time oscilloscope]," ''R&amp;D Magazine'', October, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miele]] used virtual prototyping to improve the development of its washer-disinfector machines by simulating their operational characteristics early in the [[design cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Better Way to Make Medical Instruments Come Clean," ''Medical Design Technology'', October, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Several CAE software solutions (for example, [[Working Model]] and SimWise) offer the possibility to check the benefits of virtual prototyping even for students and small companies, and collection of case studies are available since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Lista Studio, "[http://www.lista.it/atnet/index.htm Lista Studio's Case Studies]".&lt;/ref&gt;
