==History==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2017}}
Five businessmen founded 3M in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]], [[Minnesota]], in 1902.&lt;ref name=CPS&gt;"3M." Company Profiles for Students. Gale. 1999. Retrieved October 4, 2012, from [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427200011.html HighBeam Research]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a [[mining]] venture, the goal was to mine [[corundum]], but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were [[anorthosite]], which had no commercial value.&lt;ref name=CPS /&gt; Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905.&lt;ref name=CPS /&gt; The company moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and began researching and producing [[sandpaper]] products.&lt;ref name=CPS /&gt; [[William L. McKnight]], later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and [[Archibald Bush|A.&amp;nbsp;G. Bush]] joined in 1909.&lt;ref name=CPS /&gt; 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay [[dividend]]s.&lt;ref name=CPS /&gt;

The company moved to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St.&amp;nbsp;Paul]] in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]], Minnesota in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=900 Bush Avenue: The House that Research Built: Early Years in Saint Paul|url=http://saintpaulhistorical.com/items/show/354|website=Saint Paul Historical|publisher=Historic Saint Paul|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began by mining stone from [[quarries]] for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business.&lt;ref name="The 3M Story"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation|publisher=3M Company|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and [[Scotch Tape|Scotch-brand tapes]]. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and of the [[S&amp;P 500]].

===Founding===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
[[File:3M Museum 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[John Dwan Office Building]], where 3M was founded; a museum]]
The founders original plan was to sell the mineral [[corundum]] to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of [[Lake Superior]] and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral [[anorthosite]].&lt;ref name="MPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200206/03_haega_3Mhistory |title=MPR: 3M at 100 – on the right path for growth? |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failing to make [[sandpaper]] with the anorthosite, the founders decided to import minerals like Spanish [[garnet]], after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers complained that the garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near [[olive oil]], and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; this was the first instance of [[research and development]] at 3M.

===Expansion and modern history===
The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane "[[Scotch Tape]]" and sound-deadening materials for cars.

In 1947, 3M began producing [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA) by [[electrochemical fluorination]].&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prevedouros K, Cousins IT, Buck RC, Korzeniowski SH | title =Sources, fate and transport of perfluorocarboxylates| journal =Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume =40 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 |date=January 2006 | doi =10.1021/es0512475 |pmid=16433330}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair.

In 1951, [[DuPont]] started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion-dollar-a-year profit by the 1990s.&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?_r=0 | title=The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare | publisher=New York Times: Rob Bilott was a corporate defense attorney for eight years | date=6 January 2016 | accessdate=8 January 2016 | author=Rich, Nathaniel |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.&lt;ref name=Emmett2006&gt;{{cite journal

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of [[board game]]s, largely under the "[[3M bookshelf game series]]" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through [[department store]]s, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German "[[Eurogame]]s". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers [[Sid Sackson]] and [[Alex Randolph]]. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by [[Avalon Hill]].

3M's Mincom division introduced several models of [[magnetic tape recorder]]s for [[instrumentation]] use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model [[3M M79|M79]] recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video [[post-production]] industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as [[character generator]]s and several different models of [[Vision mixer|video switchers]], from models of [[audio router|audio]] and [[video router]]s to video mixers for studio production work.

3M Mincom was involved in some of the first [[digital audio]] recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the [[Sound 80]] studios in [[Minneapolis]]. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the "3M Digital Audio Mastering System",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/1978-EM-Mastering/ |title=1978 3M Digital Audio Mastering System-Mix Inducts 3M Mastering System Into 2007 TECnology Hall of Fame |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313125926/http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/1978-EM-Mastering/ |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of a 32-track digital audio recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for mixdown &amp; final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.

3M launched "Press 'n Peel" in stores in four cities in 1977, but results were disappointing.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f08e8a9a-fcd7-11df-ae2d-00144feab49a.html#axzz18hyDnyKX|title=First Person: 'We invented the Post-It Note'|author=Art Fry and Spencer Silver|accessdate=2010-12-20|publisher=''FT Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2ndchance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/article/tv.accesshollywood.com/tv.accesshollywood.com-couple-who-lost-800000-foxs-million-dollar-money-drop-will-get-another-chance-play-cash|title=TV News Headlines - Yahoo TV|work=Yahoo TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later 3M instead issued free samples directly to consumers in [[Boise, Idaho]], with 94 percent of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; The product was sold as "Post-its" in 1979 when the rollout introduction began,&lt;ref name="nyt10"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/business/media/25show.html?_r=0 |title=Right on the $800,000 Question, They Lost Anyway |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold across the United States&lt;ref name="nyt10"/&gt; from April 6, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/758/000173239/|title=Spencer Silver|accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year they were launched in Canada and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/pastpresent/history_tl.html|title=The Evolution of the Post-it Note|accessdate=2010-02-13|publisher=3M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the company's [[Computer data storage|data storage]] and [[Digital imaging|imaging]] divisions were spun off as Imation Corporation. In doing so 3M shed 20% of its sales, employees and product lines at a cost of only 5% of its profits and immediately looked much improved in the estimation of Wall Street analysts. These businesses, with annual sales of over $2 billion had generated handsome profits for 3M which funded R&amp;D and development of many new business lines but were largely in "sunset" industries: printing products, photographic film, and removable storage media. Imation shortly sold its imaging and [[photographic film]] businesses largely to Kodak in order to concentrate on storage. Imation was purchased by a hedge fund in 2016 and ceased to exist as an independent business. What is left is now called [[Glassbridge Enterprises]], an American holding company.

As of 2012, 3M was one of the 30 companies included in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], added on August 9, 1976, and was 97 on the 2011 [[Fortune 500]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortune 500 2011: Fortune 1,000 Companies 1–100|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/full_list/|work=Fortune Magazine|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has 132 plants and over 67,000 employees worldwide, with sales offices in over 200 countries{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The vast majority of the company's employees are local nationals, with few employees residing outside their home country. Its worldwide sales are over $20 billion, with international sales 58% of that total.

In 2002, 3M changed its legal name to 3M Company; it had been popularly known as "3M" for much of its history. Also in 2002, the company agreed to acquire AiT Advanced Information Technologies Corp. for about $37.4 million in cash, after AiT had strongly hinted it had put itself on the auction block.

On December 20, 2005, 3M announced a major partnership with [[Roush Fenway Racing]], one of [[NASCAR]]'s premier organizations. In 2008, the company sponsored [[Greg Biffle]] in the NASCAR [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Sprint Cup Series]] as he drove the No.&amp;nbsp;16 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]. In addition, on February 19, 2006, 3M announced that it would become the title sponsor of the [[Consumers Energy 400|3M Performance 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]] until 2011.

On April 4, 2006, 3M announced its intention to sell its [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] non-core business. The pharmaceuticals businesses were sold off in three deals, in Europe, the Americas, and the remainder of the world. Another division of the Health Care business, Drug Delivery Systems, remains with 3M. The Drug Delivery System division continues to contract manufacture inhalants and [[transdermal]] drug-delivery systems, and has now taken on manufacture of the products whose licenses were sold during the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release

On August 30, 2010, 3M announced that they had acquired [[Cogent Systems]] for $943 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sayer|first=Peter|title=3M Offers $943M for Biometric Security Vendor Cogent Systems|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/204400/article.html|accessdate=16 February 2013|newspaper=[[PC World]]|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.3m.com/press-release/company/3m-completes-acquisition-arizant-inc|title=3M Completes Acquisition of Arizant Inc.|publisher=3M|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company.

3M follows a business model based on "the ability to not only develop unique products, but also to manufacture them efficiently and consistently around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpro.co.uk/2013/01/27/3m-cultivating-core-competency/|title=3M: Cultivating Core Competency|publisher=digitpro|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of [[Avery Dennison]] was being bought by 3M for $550 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/01/03/3m-avery-dennison-deal/ |title=3M buys office supply unit of Avery Dennison for $550M &amp;#124; Minnesota Public Radio News |publisher=Minnesota.publicradio.org |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Will|title=3M Drops Avery Dennison Unit Buyout Amid Antitrust Worry|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-04/3m-drops-avery-dennison-unit-buyout-amid-antitrust-worry|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, 3M announced that it was selling [[Scientific Anglers]] and [[Ross Reels]] to [[Orvis]]. Orvis said it planned to continue running the company as an independent entity at its [[Midland, Michigan]] headquarters and that the Ross Reels would also continue independent operations at its headquarters in [[Montrose County, Colorado]]. While under its ownership, 3M had chemists and other scientists develop improved fly lines that were easier to cast, floated at a higher level in the water, and dried faster for its fishing brands.

In 1999 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] began investigating [[Perfluorinated compound|perfluorinated chemicals]] after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS).&lt;ref&gt;Aziz Ullah.

In 1983, the [[Oakdale Dump]] in [[Oakdale, Minnesota]], was listed as an EPA [[Superfund]] site after significant [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] [[contamination]] by [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]] and [[heavy metals]] was uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund Site: Oakdale Dump Oakdale, MN|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Contams&amp;id=0503840|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s.

In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/global/sustainability/ |title=3M U.S.: Sustainability at 3M |publisher=Solutions.3m.com |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/02/3m-forms-renewable-energy-division-54663 |title=3M Forms Renewable Energy Division &amp;#124; Renewable Energy News Article |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M for {{dollarsign|US}}5 billion in punitive damages, claiming they released PFCs, a very toxic chemical according to the EPA but unknown at the time of release,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} into local waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BT31L20101230 | work=Reuters | title=Minnesota sues 3M over pollution claims | date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After many long delays, a settlement for $850 million was reached in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/3m-pfc-groundwater-pollution-trial-announcement|title=Minnesota settles water pollution suit against 3M for $850 million|author=Dunbar|first=Elzabeth|date=February 20, 2018|work=|accessdate=February 20, 2018|publisher=MPR News|last2=Marohn|first2=Kirsti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellner1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fellner |first1=Carrie |title=Toxic Secrets: The town that 3M built - where kids are dying of cancer |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/toxic-secrets-the-town-that-3m-built-where-kids-are-dying-of-cancer-20180613-p4zl83.html |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating facilities==
[[File:3Mwatertower.jpg|140px|thumb|right|120px|3M facility in St. Paul, Minnesota]]
3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and some division laboratories in the US are in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the United States, 3M operates 80 manufacturing facilities in 29 [[U.S. state|states]], and 125 manufacturing and converting facilities in 37 countries outside the US (in 2017).&lt;ref name=Annual2017 /&gt; 

In March 2016, 3M completed a {{Convert|400000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} research-and-development building that cost $150 million on its Maplewood campus. Seven hundred scientists from various divisions occupy the building. They were previously scattered across the campus. 3M hopes concentrating its research and development in this manner will improve collaboration. 3M received $9.6 million in local [[tax increment financing]] and relief from state sales taxes in order to assist with development of the building.&lt;ref name="DePass"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DePass|first1=Dee|title=3M Co. opens new $150 million R&amp;D lab in Maplewood|url=http://www.startribune.com/3m-co-opens-new-150-million-r-d-lab/371754821/|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[silver]] [[relief]] was endowed by [[Pellegrino II of Aquileia|Pellegrino II]], the [[patriarch of Aquileia]], around 1200 and adorns today the main [[Altar (Catholicism)|altar]] of the church ''Santa Maria Assunta''.&lt;ref name="Stiftung von Pligrim II."/&gt; It shows [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus]] surrounded by [[archangel]]s and groups of [[saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 1f."/&gt; The piece is notable for its rich ornamentation and its early [[typographic]] inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011; Visintini 2007; Pertoldi 1997; Koch 1994; Lipinsky 1986; Cuscito 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Cividale 0904 Duomo interior 1.jpg|thumb|View along the [[nave]] onto the illuminated altarpiece in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]]]

The altarpiece is located in the cathedral [[Santa Maria Assunta (Cividale)|Santa Maria Assunta]] in the town of Cividale in [[Friuli]]. The rectangular relief plate which measures about one meter high and two meters wide is made of partly [[gilded]] silver. Protected by a modern glass case, it towers above the principal altar in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. It was consecrated by Pellegrino II who was [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (episcopal)|patriarch of Aquileia]] between 1195 and 1204.&lt;ref name="Stiftung von Pligrim II."&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;1f.; Lipinsky 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;75f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece is divided into four parts: the center consists of a [[triptych]] which shows Mary as the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother of God]] ([[Latin]] ''mater dei'') with the Child Jesus in her lap. From left and right the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] rush to the seated mother and her child. The whole scene takes place under a three-arched [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]. The triptych is flanked by two departments which display, in three horizontal lines each, a total of 25 male and female saints standing next to one other. All figures except the Child Jesus are identifiable by name. A frame displaying a series of head medallions without inscriptions runs all around the triptych and the two lateral sections. In the upper horizontal frame piece Christ and [[John the Baptist]] as well as the [[four Evangelists]] are depicted. In its lower counterpart Pellegrino II, kneeling at the feet of Mary, can be identified by an accompanying inscription as the donator of the altarpiece. On the inside of the two frame boards a votive inscription composed of ten [[Leonine verse]]s runs horizontally across the altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 1f."&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==
All inscriptions of the altarpiece were written in Latin. The font of the dedicatory inscription is overall classified as Gothic capitalis.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, p. 2"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; Modern commentators agree that the inscriptions were produced by hammering individual [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] punches one by one into the silver plate.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;19; Visintini 2007, fn.&amp;nbsp;82; Pertoldi 1997; Lipinsky 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;78&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this typographic method can be derived from the observation that the [[letterform]]s comply with the criterion of [[Type–token distinction#Typography|type identity]] according to which every letter imprint must come from one and the same letter punch.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt; The type identity is ''inter alia'' evident in the repeated occurrence of the faulty letter "R" throughout the text that indicates a damaged letter punch.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[high relief]] letters stand proud in rectangular recesses created by the bases of the [[low relief]] punches; the fine edges between these recesses are a further indication of the sequential use of individual letter punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt; A number of letters which are not properly aligned to their [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] provide additional evidence that the artisan worked with separate punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt;

A total of about forty [[Movable type|types]], which come in equal parts in a smaller and larger font size, were employed for creating the inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 4"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller ones were used for the names of the saints and the donor's inscription of the patriarch, while the names of the archangels, of the Mother of God, the abbreviations of sanctus/sancta ("holy") and the two-line inscription were printed with the larger set.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 4"/&gt; The latter text was punched into eight silver strips which were strung together and nailed onto the wooden substructure of the altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, p. 2"/&gt;

According to the art historian Angelo Lipinsky, the altarpiece may have been inspired by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] which were decorated by the same typographic technique in the 10th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lipinsky 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;78f.; Koch 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; However, a random check with the [[:de:Limburger Staurothek|Limburg Staurotheca]] which dates from this period showed that the inscription was [[engraved]] directly into the metal.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;2f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] of 1119 is another early example of typographic text production in the Latin West.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"&gt;Brekle 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–25&lt;/ref&gt; It differs in some technical details though: its plate is made of [[clay]], not silver, and the inscription was created in low relief with (wooden) stamps, not metal punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt;

The '''Association for Information and Image Management''' or '''AIIM''' (pronounced aim) is a non-profit membership organization. AIIM provides education, market research, and certification for information professionals.

AIIM was founded in 1943 as the '''National Microfilm Association'''. It became the "Association for Information and Image Management" in 1982. The name would change again in 2018 to the "Association for Intelligent Information Management," maintaining the AIIM acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|year=2005|publisher=International Federation of Library Associations|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|isbn=3-598-21840-0|pages=346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_Vi_ykArs8C&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=Association+for+Information+and+Image+Management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ODrsUKHrGemc2QWZ1IGgAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Association%20for%20Information%20and%20Image%20Management&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|editor=Marko Schweizer|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AIIM was founded in 1943 as the National Microfilm Association. As microfilm fell into disuse, the association changed its name to the Association for Information and Image Management, or "AIIM" for short, in 1982. The name change demonstrated a broadening of focus for the association. 
 
In 2000, AIIM created the term Enterprise Content Management (ECM), which referred to the strategies, methods, and tools used throughout the lifecycle of an organization's documents, and other content, that relate to the organization's processes. 

At the AIIM Conference 2017, AIIM agreed with a blog post published by Gartner titled "The Death of ECM and Birth of Content Services" that "ECM is now dead (kaput, finite, an ex-market name)." AIIM announced that the term Enterprise Content Management would be replaced by the term Intelligent Information Management (IIM). This new term would encompass the management of data and content, not just content by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mancini|first1=John|title=The Next Wave — Moving from ECM to Intelligent Information Management|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/332414/AIIM_Blog/Intel-info-Next-Wave-2017-updated.pdf|website=AIIM|publisher=AIIM|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Management Training==
In 2006, AIIM launched its first training course titled ECM Master Class. Today, AIIM offers training on a variety of information management technologies, including:

* [[Business Process Management]]
* Electronic Records Management
* [[Enterprise Content Management]]
* Information Governance
* [[SharePoint]] and Office 365
* Taxonomy and Metadata

These courses are available online and in an in-person classroom setting. At the AIIM Conference 2017, AIIM announced they had trained over 60,000 students.

==Certified Information Professional (CIP)==
AIIM set out to create a certification for information professionals as a means of standardizing on the body of knowledge necessary to be successful in this profession. AIIM worked with industry experts and focus groups to define this body of knowledge and launched a certification and test based on it in 2011.

In July 2016, the Certified Information Professional exam was updated to reflect changes in information management technology and behavior. 

By 2017, more than 1,500 information professionals had earned the CIP.

==The AIIM Conference==
The AIIM Conference was officially launched in 2012. The annual event brings together over 600 attendees, consisting mostly of information management end-users, from over 25 countries to see presentations and take part in discussions on the best practices, current trends, and top issues facing the information management industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = AIIM Conference | publisher = AIIM | url = http://www.aiimconference.com | accessdate =2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive Leadership Council Summit==
The AIIM Executive Leadership Council has two delegations, the Americas and European. Each delegation meets twice a year for a think tank summit where participants discuss Information Management-related topics such as the impact of these technologies on the workplace and future organizational transformations.

Findings from the summits are published as AIIM Trendscape reports which forecast the changes the information management industry will incur over the next 24 months and set priorities to take advantage of these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Executive Leadership Council | publisher = AIIM | url = http://www.aiim.org/Membership/Executive-Leadership-Council | accessdate =2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic English''' is an [[English language|English]]-based [[Controlled natural language|controlled language]] created by linguist and philosopher [[Charles Kay Ogden]] as an [[international auxiliary language]], and as an aid for teaching [[ESL|English as a second language]]. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930).

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in [[World War II]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified Technical English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1572-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design principles ==
Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a [[controlled natural language|controlled small vocabulary]] which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasing]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called "operators".  His ''General Introduction'' says "There are no 'verbs' in Basic English", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.&lt;ref&gt;A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112933/http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 |date=December 4, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|What the World needs most is about 1,000 more dead languages—and one more alive.|C. K. Ogden, The System of Basic English}}

== Word lists ==
Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's [[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Basic English word list]]. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a [[wikt:Appendix:1000 basic English words|basic 1000-word]] vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 "international" words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's "International Word" List—Alphabetic]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a "standard" English level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; This 2000 word vocabulary represents "what any learner should know". At this level students could start to move on their own.

Ogden's [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English combined wordlist|Basic English 2000 word list]] and Voice of America's [[:simple:Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book|Special English 1500 word list]] serve as dictionaries for the [[Simple English Wikipedia]].

&lt;!-- Do not use the "Copyvio/core" template directly; the above line is generated by "subst:Copyvio|url" --&gt;
The [[grammar|word use]] of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer [[wikt:exception|exceptions]]. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.

Ogden's rules of [[grammar]] for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rules of Grammar | url = http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html | date = 1 January 1996 | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Form plurals by appending an "S" on the end of the word. Where special rules are normally necessary, such as using "ES" or "IES", use them.
*There are two word endings to change each of the 150 adjectives:  "-ER" and "-EST".
*There are two word endings to change the verb word endings, "-ING" and "-ED".
*Form adverbs from qualifiers by adding "-LY".
*Talk about amounts with "MORE" and "MOST".  Use and know "-ER" and "-EST".
*Give adjectives a negative meaning with "UN-"
*Form questions with the opposite word order, and with "DO".
*Operators and pronouns [[inflection|inflect]] as in normal English.
*Make [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English compound wordlist|combined words]] ([[compound word|compound]]s) from two nouns (for example "milkman") or a noun and a directive ("sundown").
*Measures, numbers, money, days, months, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms, e.g. Date/Time: 20 May 1972 at 21:00
*Where necessary, technical expressions or other terms required for the task at hand may be used and take on their local form.

== Criticism ==
Like all [[international auxiliary language]]s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as inevitably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html Farewell to Auxiliary Languages]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a sample quotation from [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&amp;L=AUXLANG&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2560 the auxlang mailing list archives] and another from noted linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teaching aid for [[ESL|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818175724/http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }} for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', "How Basic is Basic English?" in which he claimed, "It's not basic, and it's not English." The essence of his complaint is that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also argues that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and notes that there had been no empirical studies showing that it made language simpler.&lt;ref name="Flesch"&gt;Flesch, R. F. "How Basic is Basic English?" 'Harper's Magazine'', March 1944. pp.&amp;nbsp;339-343.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary references ==
In the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite that after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |author2=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language= |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=109 |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held... From 1942 to 1944, working as a colleague of William Empson's, he produced a series of broadcasts to India written in Basic English, trying to use its programmed simplicity, as a ''Tribune'' article put it, 'as a sort of corrective to the oratory of statesmen and publicists.' Only during the last year of the war did he write 'Politics and the English Language,' insisting that the defense of English language has nothing to do with the setting up of a Standard English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evelyn Waugh]] criticized his own 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', which he had previously called his magnum opus, in the preface of the 1959 reprint: "It &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[World War II]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster—the period of [[soya beans]] and Basic English—and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language that now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Waugh | first=Evelyn | title=Brideshead Revisited  | location=New York | publisher=Dell | origyear=1946 | year=1959}}. Full [http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Evelyn-Waugh/Brideshead-Revisited/Evelyn-Waughs-Author-commentary-for-Brideshead-Revisited preface text] available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his story ''[[Gulf (novella)|Gulf]]'', science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a [[constructed language]] called [[Speedtalk]], in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single [[phoneme]], as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert A., ''Gulf'', in ''Assignment in Eternity'', published by Signet Science Fiction (New American Library), 1953. pp. 52–53: "It was possible to establish a one-to-one relationship with Basic English so that ''one phonetic symbol'' was equivalent to an entire word".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BeBionic''' is a commercial [[prosthetic hand]] designed to enable [[amputees]] to perform everyday activities, such as eating, drinking, writing, typing, turning a key in a lock and picking up small objects. 

The first version of the bebionic hand was launched at the World Congress and Orthopädie &amp; Reha-Technik, Trade Show, [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORTHOPÄDIE International Trade Show|url=http://www.ot-leipzig.de/LeMMon/ort_web_eng.nsf/framessuchen?OpenPage&amp;Query=bebionic|publisher=ORTHOPAEDIE + REHA-TECHNIK 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RSLSteeper launches bebionic fully articulating myo-electric hand|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rslsteeper-bebionic-fully-articulating-myo-electric-hand/15501/|publisher=GizMag|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

The bionic hand is said to receive instructions from sensors that detect the movement of the muscles in the patient’s arm. These instructions are processed, which are then directed to the 337 mechanical parts, which are present within this bionic hand that eventually, mimic natural human movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com/article/micromo-faulhaber-prosthetic-medical-device-bebionic-3917/|title=Bebionic myoelectric hand prosthesis - Today's Medical Developments|work=Today's Medical Developments|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2011, the bebionic second-generation prosthetic hand was updated with improvements to speed, accuracy, grip and durability. The updated version also saw the bebionic hand available two sizes - medium and large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bionic hand gets a grip on prosthetics market|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/8816665/Bionic-hand-gets-a-grip-on-prosthetics-market.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The device was upgraded with new, higher capacity 2200mAh split cell internal batteries for increased usage time.

'''Cornelius Kingsley Garrison Billings''' (September 17, 1861 in [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga]], [[New York (state)|New York]] – May 6, 1937 in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]]) was a wealthy industrialist tycoon,&lt;ref name=greater /&gt; philanthropist, art collector, and a noted horseman and horse breeder.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt; An eccentric man,&lt;ref name=death /&gt; Billings invested much of his time and money promoting the sport of [[harness racing|trotting]], also known as "harness racing" or "matinee racing".&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

== Life and career ==
Billings was born in [[Saratoga, New York]] on September 17, 1861, the son of Albert M. Bilings, a resident of Vermont,&lt;ref name=hervey&gt;Hervey, John Lewis (May 12 &amp; 19, 1937) [http://www.mi-harness.net/publct/hh/billings.html "C. K. G.

He was raised in [[Chicago, Illinois]] from the age of three, attended schools in Chicago, and then [[Racine College]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]. When he finished college at 17 years old in 1879, he joined the [[Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company]] &amp;ndash; of which his father was a principal investor and president &amp;ndash; beginning as a laborer.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;&lt;ref name=rush&gt;Rush, Paul (January 11, 2009) [http://paulrush-newyorkstories.blogspot.com/2009/01/horseback-dinner.html "The Horseback Dinner"] ''Paul Rush New York Stories''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death /&gt; When he became the firm's president in 1887,&lt;ref name=death /&gt; he brought about the mergers from 1895 to 1910 of 12 gas companies into Peoples Gas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://accel.peoplesgasdelivery.com/company/history.aspx "Our History"] [[Peoples Energy]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  He became chairman of the board of the company in 1901, a position he held until 1911.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

In 1885, Billings married Blanche E.

During his years in Chicago, Billings was the founder and a charter member of the Chicago Athletic Club, served on the West Park Commission, and on the board of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

In 1901, at the age of 40, Billings, who had inherited a controlling interest in Peoples Gas, but had retired from the day-to-day running of the company,&lt;ref name=rush /&gt; moved to [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], where he and his family lived in a townhouse on [[Fifth Avenue]] at [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]].&lt;ref name=dim /&gt;

Billings, who owned 75 racing or trotting horses, would later build an extensive estate in Upper Manhattan, on the site of what is now [[Fort Tryon Park]], but first built a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} stable there, at the cost of $200,000. It was completed in 1903. The stable, which was {{convert|250|ft}} long and {{convert|125|ft}} wide and two stories tall "with numerous towers and cupolas", had 22 box stalls and 9 straight stalls, a {{convert|75|ft|adj=on}} outdoor training ring, a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}}-by-{{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} sleigh room, feed rooms, a hayloft, and a 5,000 bushel zinc-lined [[granary]]. It also had a gymnasium, a blacksmith shop with forge, a trophy room to display Billings' awards from the amateur races he won, and two five-room suites of living quarters.  The interior was designed in oak and Georgia pine. The stable had steam heat, electric light, and hot water, all provided by its dynamo room. About twenty-five men were employed.&lt;ref name=harness /&gt;

Nearby the stable was a 14-room {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}}-by-{{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} lodge for guests, which featured an {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}}-tall observation tower.&lt;ref name=harness&gt;Staff (March 22, 1903) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/svc/tmach/v1/refer?res=9B01E6DD1F3DEE32A25751C2A9659C946297D6CF&amp;pdf=true "The Light Harness Horse: Luxury Stables for C.

[[File:billingsparty.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Billings' horse party]]

=== Dinner on horseback ===
Billings wished to celebrate the completion of his trotting stable, and his selection to be the head of the New York Equestrian Club, by giving a dinner for 36 of his male horse-riding friends in the stable on March 29, 1903. He engaged the noted restaurateur [[Louis Sherry]] to cater the event, but to avoid reporters who staked out the estate after news of the dinner had spread, Billings changed the venue at Sherry's suggestion to the grand ballroom of Sherry's restaurant at [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[44th Street (Manhattan)|44th Street]].  The ballroom had been decorated to look like an English country estate, complete with imitation brooks. Wanting he and his guests to be mounted on horses while they ate, the floor was covered with turf.  The horses, which were docile animals rented from nearby riding academies, were brought to the fourth-floor ballroom via the freight elevator.  The participants, arranged in a circle, ate from specially built silver trays which were attached to their saddles and drank through rubber tubes connected to iced bottles of champagne in their saddlebags. The waiters, one for each diner, served the numerous courses dressed as if grooms at a [[fox hunt]]. The 32 docile horses were each attended by an elaborately dressed groom, and near the end of the evening elaborate troughs filled with oats were brought in for the horses to eat from.&lt;ref name="fyi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="horseback"/&gt;&lt;ref name=greater&gt;{{cite greater|page=468n15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=luncheon&gt;Staff (March 30, 1903) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/svc/tmach/v1/refer?res=990CE1DA1E30E733A25753C3A9659C946297D6CF&amp;pdf=true "Luncheon in a Stable"] ''[[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening concluded with a vaudeville show.&lt;ref name=luncheon/&gt;

The $50,000 bill for the dinner (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|50000|1903|fmt=c}} in {{inflation-year|US}}) included the cost of a photographer from the celebrated [[Byron Company]] to document the event.&lt;ref name="fyi"&gt;Pollak, Michael (August 15, 2004) [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/nyregion/fyi-632325.html?pagewanted=1 "F.Y.I.: For an Appetizer, Hay"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horseback"&gt;Bryk, William (March 30, 2005) [https://www.nysun.com/on-the-town/banquet-on-horseback/11409/ "Banquet on Horseback"] ''[[New York Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Billings officially opened his new stable with a luncheon for members of the Equestrian Club and other wealthy horsemen and dignitaries from around the country. Some rode there on horseback, but most traveled by elevated train to the 155th Street station located at the Harlem Speedway, and were conveyed to the stable by automobiles.&lt;ref name=luncheon /&gt;

=== Billings sells his horses ===
In 1903, Billings, who was a prominent member of the [[Jockey Club (United States)|Jockey Club]] and was part-owner of the [[Jamaica Race Course]] in [[Jamaica, Queens]],&lt;ref name=death /&gt; was regarded as a "Grand Marshal" of [[harness racing]] ("trotting" or "matinee racing"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://matineeclub.tripod.com/BBytes/RiseandFall.html "The Rise, Decline and Fall(?) of Matinee Racing"] Western Reserve Matinee Club&lt;/ref&gt; but in November 1905, just two years after his stable was completed, he sold his stock of horses at [[Madison Square Garden]], saying that he proposed to go abroad for a few years.  Billings held back only three horses from the sale, plus one that was withdrawn because it was lame.  The sale of 18 horses brought in $46,270, with the top seller bringing in $10,500.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (November 24, 1905) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/11/24/101250136.pdf "CKG Billings Horses sold for Big Prices"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estates ==
[[File:Estate of C.K.G. Billings.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Tryon Hall, the Manhattan estate of C.K.G. Billings]]

=== Tryon Hall ===
The Billings' mansion at [[196th Street (Manhattan)|West 196th Street]] and [[Fort Washington Avenue|Fort Washington Road]]&lt;ref name=luncheon /&gt; was designed by [[Guy Lowell]], who enlarged the lodge which had been built as part of the stables.  It was organized around a central courtyard with a fountain. Landscape architect [[Charles Downing Lay]] designed the grounds. Billings called it "Tryon Hall", after Fort Tryon, which had been located there, itself named after Sir William Tryon, who was the last Governor of the English colony of New York.&lt;ref name=dim /&gt;&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt; The mansion stood on one of the highest points in Manhattan, overlooking the Hudson River to the west, and the Broadway Valley to the east.

By 1907, Billings, his wife, two children, and 23 servants had moved from their Manhattan townhouse into the massive Louis XIV-style chateau, now their full-time residence.  It included an observatory tower topped by an octagonal room, which had a 360-degree unobstructed view. The estate had a casino with a swimming pool, [[squash (sport)|squash court]] and [[bowling alley]] for entertaining, as well as Billings' extensive stables and an area to exercise his horses.&lt;ref name=dim /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Barr (1911) [https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009916061#page/n11/mode/2up ''Fort Tryon Hall: The Residence of C. K. G. Billings, Esq.: A Descriptive and Illustrative Catalogue Issued Privately by the Owner''] Washington Heights, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrance to the estate was originally at the top of the hill, approached via [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and [[181st Street (Manhattan)|West 181st Street]], to Fort Washington Road, but the upper part of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] was completed at about the same time as Billings' mansion, and he wanted a driveway which connected the mansion directly to that section of the roadway.  Unfortunately, there was a steep {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} cliff between the road and the mansion. Billings' hired the firm of [[Buchman &amp; Fox]] to find a solution, which they did: granite was removed from the cliff to allow a passage for a zig-zagging driveway, and the stone was then used both as a retaining wall, and for the construction of an arched viaduct that the driveway initially passed through. The arched passage became known as the "Billings Arcade". The entrance to the driveway had granite pillars that were {{convert|16|ft}} tall, which supported {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tall gates which were {{convert|10|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name=dim /&gt;
 
The entire driveway project took a year for over a hundred workers to complete, at the cost of $250,000.  It raised the overall cost of the estate to more than $2 million.&lt;ref name=dim /&gt; The Billings Arcade still remains as part of [[Fort Tryon Park]], as does part of the driveway, now used as a pedestrian path.  Another remnant is a gardener's cottage, originally a gatehouse for the estate's upper entrance, now used for park offices. The gateposts of the driveway entrance to the estate were refurbished in 2017.  The driveway no longer connects to the roadway which was once Riverside Drive and is now the northbound side of the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]].

In the nearby Hudson River, Billings kept his {{convert|232|ft|m|adj=on}} yacht, ''[[TS Vanadis|Vanadis]]'' which was built in 1908.&lt;ref name=clydeships /&gt;

Billings sold his Tryon Hall estate in 1917 to [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]].  His family had already moved into an apartment on Fifth Avenue and [[63rd Street (Manhattan)|63rd Street]], which has 21 rooms, and for which he paid $20,000 a year in rent.  Rockefeller was assembling parcels for the creation of a park designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] which he planned to develop and then give to the city &amp;ndash; this eventually became Fort Tryon Park. As part of Rockefeller's plan, he was going to tear down Tryon Hall but was held back by popular sentiment. During World War I, he offered use of the house to the U.S. government as a hospital, and was prepared to outlay $500,000 for the conversion, but this did not happen.  After that, the mansion was rented to Nicolas C. Partos of the Partola Manufacturing Company, at first for the summer of 1918, but then extending for years.  Partos and his family was still in residence when the building burned down on March 7, 1926.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc&gt;Kuhn, Jonathan "Fort Tryon Park" in {{cite enc-nyc2|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capraro, Douglas (June 10, 2014) [https://untappedcities.com/2014/06/10/the-remains-of-fort-tryon-parks-turn-of-the-century-mansion-near-the-cloisters/ "The Remains of Fort Tryon Park’s Turn of the Century Mansion Near the Cloisters"] ''Untapped Cities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim&gt;Miller, Tom (October 21, 2013) [http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-lost-billings-mansion-tryon-hall.html "The Lost Billings Mansion -- 'Tryon Hall'"] ''Daytonian in Manhattan''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 7, 1926) [https://www.nytimes.com/1926/03/07/archives/billings-mansion-destroyed-by-fire-loss-near-1000000-chateau-owned.html "Billings Mansion Destroyed by Fire"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Farnsworth ===
After leaving Tryon Hall, Billings moved to another grand estate he had built, this one called "Farnsworth", named for his mother's family,&lt;ref name=death /&gt; and located in [[Locust Valley, New York]], on [[Long Island]].  It was again designed by Guy Lowell, this time in the [[Georgian Revival architecture|Georgian Revival style]], with the landscaping of the extensive grounds designed by Andrew Robeson Sargent of Boston.   The buildings alone on the estate cost $1,550,000 in 1915.   Although Georgian in style, Lowell designed it to be similar to an Italian villa, in that the mansion was built around a patio at its center.  The house featured 11 master bedrooms with 9 baths and 19 servants bedrooms with 4 baths.  The appointments were expensive and luxurious.&lt;ref name=pudding&gt;[http://halfpuddinghalfsauce.blogspot.com/2013/09/farnsworth-long-island-home-of-c-k-g.html "'Farnsworth' The Long Island Home of C. K. G. Billings, Esq., at Locust Valley — A Country Estate in Every Respect Perfectly Appointed] on ''The Country House'' website (September 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the grandeur of the surrounding, Billings did not stay in Farnsworth any longer than he had in Tryon Hall.  With World War 1 raging, and his health failing, Farnsworth began to sell off his East Coast properties in preparation for moving to California.&lt;ref name=pudding /&gt;&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

Billings moored his yacht ''Vanadis'' in the nearby waters. In 1916, he had sold the original ''Vanadis'' to [[Morton F. Plant House|Morton F. Plant]] in return for the smaller yacht ''[[Kanawha (1899)|Kanawha]]'', after the ''Vanadis'' struck the steamship ''Bunker Hill'', killing two people.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;&lt;ref name=clydeships&gt;[http://www.clydeships.co.uk/view.php?ref=10055#v Vanadis"] ''Scottish Built Shps''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Billings ordered a second, larger yacht &amp;ndash; {{convert|246|ft}} long &amp;ndash; which he also named ''[[Lady Hutton|Vanadis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/vanadis_1924.htm ''M/S Vanadis'']&lt;/ref&gt; This ship is now anchored at [[Riddarholmen]] in [[Stockholm]], and is now the hotel Mälardrottningen, with the ship rechristened as ''[[Lady Hutton]]'', after the actress [[Barbara Hutton]].&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19881123&amp;id=HWsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0SsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2659,7335508 |newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=November 23, 1988 |title=All Aboard: Luxury Yacht Rocks Gently at Stockholm Harbor |first1=Margo |last1=Hammond |format=PDF |pages=33, 35 |accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brook Hill |last1=Snow |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-03-15/features/8701160473_1_stockholm-lady-hutton-prices-increase |location=Stockholm, Sweden |date=March 15, 1987|title=Off The Beaten Path The Lady Hutton, One Of The World's Largest Luxury Yachts, Is Now An Elegant Hotel In Downtown Stockholm |newspaper=[[Sun Sentinel]] |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanadis to Lady Hutton, Kajsa Karlsson, (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other estates ===
At various times, Billings also owned a {{convert|5000|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]] called [[Curles Neck Farm]], which he bought in 1913 and developed into one of the country's prime horse-breeding facilities. He had another estate in [[Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] and a summer home in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=dim /&gt;&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

When he moved to Santa Barbara, Billings had a mansion built in the hills of that city, which he called "Asombrosa".  It was damaged by an earthquake in the mid-1930s, and he had another, smaller, house built nearby.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

== Later life ==
In 1911, Billings became the Chairman of the Board of [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide and Carbon Company]] &amp;ndash; a company he helped to found&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt; &amp;ndash; a position he held until his death in 1937. His mother died in 1913, leaving him $450,000; at that time his net worth was estimated to be $30 million,&lt;ref name=death /&gt; equivalent to ${{inflation|US|30|1913|fmt=c}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{inflation-year|US}}.  At one time he was reported to be one of the five richest men in the United States.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

Around 1915, Billings &amp;ndash; a member of the Turf and Field Club at [[Belmont Park]]&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt; &amp;ndash; was said to be the owner of the fastest stallion, mare, and [[gelding]] in the world.  He was also part-owner of the [[Kentucky Derby]]-winning [[Omar Khayyam]].&lt;ref name=death /&gt; He was also the principal investor in the Billings Parks race track in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], which eventually closed because of anti-betting laws passed by that state.  At one time he bought a controlling interest in the Kentucky Breeder's Association, which prevented that organization from going under. The association was reorganized, and Billings later donated his stock to the group.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

Billings moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]] in 1917, but maintained ownership of "Farnsworth" on Long Island, where he kept some of his horses.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;  Others were kept at the Glenville Race Track in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

In 1926, Billings sold his art collection, which included works by [[Jean-Charles Cazin]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[John Crome]], [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Jules Dupré]], [[Charles Jacque]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Constant Troyon]], and [[Félix Ziem]] for $401,300,&lt;ref&gt;Staff (1926) [https://archive.org/stream/famousmasterpiec00amer#page/n5/mode/2up ''Famous Masterpieces opf the French, Dutch, and English Schools: The Collection of C.

He was also part of a group of investors who built the [[Pierre Hotel]] in Manhattan, which opened in 1930.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

After being in bad health for ten years, Billings was reported to be seriously ill on May 3, 1937, and he died from pneumonia on his estate at Billings Park, near Santa Barbara, on May 6. At the time of his death, he was still the chairman of the board of the Union Carbide Carbon Company, and was described as  "one of America's wealthiest men" and "Santa Barbara's wealthiest and most philanthropic citizen."&lt;ref name=ill&gt;Staff (May 3, 1937) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/svc/tmach/v1/refer?res=9F0DE7D7103AE23ABC4B53DFB366838C629EDE&amp;pdf=true "C.

The funeral for Billings was held in Santa Barbara on May 8, and he was later buried in [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;

Despite the reputation which has attached to Billings in the aftermath of the horseback dinner he was memorialized quite differently: &lt;blockquote&gt;Personally Mr. Billings was a man of retiring, modest, nature, who shunned the limelight except when driving or riding one of his horses upon the race course, always dressed very quietly, and in every way made himself as inconspicuous as possible. He was happiest when surrounded by the small circle of intimate friends that he best-loved ... He was the loyalest of friends and when he had once given his good will to a man it was never withdrawn unless it had been abused. His benefactions and gifts were boundless and in them, he took the greatest pleasure. In all social relations he was the reverse of pompous, arrogant or domineering, was democratic and genial and, that rarest of all things—always the same admirable and wonderful character in every spot and place, at all times and seasons and under all circumstances.&lt;ref name=hervey /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''car analogy''' is a common technique used by [[engineering]] textbooks to ease the understanding of [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts in which a [[car]], its composite parts, and common circumstances surrounding it are used as [[analogy|analogs]] for elements of the conceptual [[systems]].

==Uses of car analogies==
The efficiency of car analogies reside on their capacity to explain difficult concepts (usually due to their high abstraction level) on more mundane terms with which the target audience is comfortable, and with which many also have a special interest. Due to that, car analogies appear more often on works related to [[applied sciences]] and [[technology]].

In order to work, car analogies translate [[force|agents of action]] as the car driver, the seller, or police officers; likewise, elements of a [[system]] are referred as car pieces, such as wheels, motor, or ignition keys. [[Resources]] tend to appear as gas, speed, or as the money that can be spent on better accessories/vehicles.

For example, in the paragraph:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"[[Zener diode]]s regulate voltage by acting as complementary loads, drawing more or less current as necessary to ensure a constant voltage drop across the load. This is analogous to regulating the speed of an automobile by braking rather than by varying the throttle position."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Semi/SEMI_3.html#xtocid1418812 |title=Lessons in Electric  Circuits |volume=III - Semiconductors |chapter=Diodes and Rectifiers |first=Tony R |last=Kuphaldt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Current (resource) is depicted as the car's speed, while the role of the brakes is performed by the Zener diodes (element of the system).

Car analogies are also typically used to explain the quality differences between two similar tools or hardware pieces; in that case, the best one is usually described as a [[mid-engined]] Italian [[supercar]] or a high-end [[luxury vehicle]].

'''Chip creep''' refers to the problem of an [[integrated circuit]] (chip) working its way out of its socket over time. This was mainly an issue in early PCs.

Chip creep occurs due to thermal expansion, which is expansion and contraction as the system heats up and cools down. It can also occur due to vibration. While chip creep was most common with older memory modules, it was also a problem with [[CPU]]s and other main chips that were inserted into sockets. A example is the Apple III, where it's CPU would be dislodged and the user would need to reseat the chips.

To fix chip creep, users of older systems would often have to remove the case cover and push the loose chip back into the socket. Today's [[computer systems]] are not as affected by chip creep, since chips are more securely held, either by various types of retainer clips or by being soldered into place, and since system cooling has improved.

'''Clock drift''' refers to several related phenomena where a [[clock]] does not run at exactly the same rate as a reference clock. That is, after some time the clock "drifts apart" or gradually desynchronizes from the other clock i.e. the crystal-based clocks used in computers, like any
other clocks, subject to clock drift, which means that they count time at different rates and so they diverge. This phenomenon is used, for instance, in [[computer]]s to build [[random number generator]]s. On the negative side, clock drift can be exploited by [[timing attack]]s.

== In non-atomic clocks ==
{{main|Frequency drift}}

Everyday clocks such as [[watch|wristwatches]] have finite precision.  Eventually they require correction to remain accurate.  The rate of drift depends on the clock's quality, sometimes the stability of the power source, the ambient temperature, and other subtle environmental variables. Thus the same clock can have different drift rates at different occasions.

More advanced clocks and old mechanical clocks often have some kind of speed trimmer where one can adjust the speed of the clock and thus correct for clock drift. For instance, in [[pendulum clock]]s the clock drift can be manipulated by slightly changing the length of the [[pendulum]].

A quartz oscillator is less subject to drift due to manufacturing variances than the pendulum in a mechanical clock.  Hence most everyday quartz clocks do not have an adjustable drift correction.

== Atomic clocks ==

[[Atomic clock]]s are very precise and have nearly no clock drift. Even the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's rotation rate]] has more drift and variation in drift than an atomic clock due to [[tidal acceleration]] and other effects. The principle behind the atomic clock has enabled scientists to re-define the [[SI unit]] [[second]] in terms of exactly 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the [[caesium]] atom. The precision of these oscillations allows atomic clocks to drift roughly only one second in a hundred million years; currently, the most accurate of which loses one second every 15 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=James|title=The most accurate clock ever built only loses one second every 15 billion years|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8466681/most-accurate-atomic-clock-optical-lattice-strontium|website=The Verge|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibney|first1=Elizabeth|title=Hyper-precise atomic clocks face off to redefine time|url=http://www.nature.com/news/hyper-precise-atomic-clocks-face-off-to-redefine-time-1.17689|website=Nature|accessdate=17 September 2016|pages=16–17|doi=10.1038/522016a|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) [[time standard]] and its derivatives (such as the [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC)) are based on [[weighted average]]s of atomic clocks worldwide.

== Relativity ==

As [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] predicted, relativistic effects can also cause clock drift due to [[time dilation]]. This is because there is no fixed universal time, time being relative to the observer. [[Special relativity]] describes how two clocks held by observers in different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]] (i.e. moving with respect to each other but not accelerating or decelerating) will each appear to either observer to tick at different rates.

In addition to this, [[general relativity]] gives us [[gravitational time dilation]]. Briefly, a clock in a stronger gravitational field (e.g. closer to a planet) will appear to tick more slowly. People holding these clocks (i.e. those inside and outside the stronger field) would all agree on which clocks appear to be going faster.

Note that it is time itself rather than the function of the clock which is affected. Both effects have been experimentally observed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Time dilation is of practical importance. For instance, the clocks in [[Global Positioning System|GPS satellites]] experience this effect due to the reduced gravity they experience (making their clocks appear to run more quickly than those on Earth) and must therefore incorporate relativistically corrected calculations when reporting locations to users.  If general relativity were not accounted for, a navigational fix based on the GPS satellites would be false after only 2 minutes, and errors in global positions would continue to accumulate at a rate of about 10 kilometers each day.&lt;ref&gt;Pogge, Richard W.; [http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html "Real-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System"]  Accessed 30 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Random number generators ==
{{see also|Hardware random number generator#Clock drift}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
[[Computer program]]s often need high quality random numbers, especially for [[cryptography]]. There are several similar ways clock drift can be used to build [[random number generator]]s (RNGs).

One way to build a [[hardware random number generator#Clock drift|hardware random number generator]] is to use two independent [[Crystal oscillator|clock crystals]], one that for instance ticks 100 times per second and one that ticks 1 million times per second. On average the faster crystal will then tick 10,000 times for each time the slower one ticks. But since clock crystals are not precise, the exact number of ticks will vary. That variation can be used to create random bits. For instance, if the number of fast ticks is even, a 0 is chosen, and if the number of ticks is odd, a 1 is chosen. Thus such a 100/1000000 RNG circuit can produce 100 somewhat random bits per second.
Typically such a system is biased—it might for instance produce more zeros than ones—and so hundreds of somewhat-random bits are [[decorrelation|"whitened"]] to produce a few unbiased bits.

There is also a similar way to build a kind of "software random number generator". This involves comparing the timer tick of the operating system (the tick that usually is 100–1000 times per second) and the speed of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. If the OS timer and the CPU run on two independent clock crystals the situation is ideal and more or less the same as the previous example. But even if they both use the same clock crystal the [[Process (computing)|process]]/program that does the clock drift measurement is "disturbed" by many more or less unpredictable events in the CPU such as [[interrupt]]s and other processes and programs that runs at the same time. Thus the measurement will still produce fairly good random numbers. Some argue{{Who|date=July 2009}} they are then not true random numbers but they seem to be good enough for most needs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Most hardware random number generators such as the ones described above are fairly slow. Therefore, most programs only use them to create a good seed that they then feed to a [[pseudorandom number generator]] or a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] to produce many random numbers fast.

== Timing attack ==

In 2006, a [[side channel attack]] was published&lt;ref&gt;
Steven J. Murdoch. ''Hot or Not: Revealing Hidden Services by their Clock Skew'', ACM CCS 2006. [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/ccs06hotornot.pdf (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; that exploited clock skew based on CPU heating. The attacker causes heavy CPU load on a [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] server ([[Tor hidden service]]), causing CPU heating. CPU heating is correlated with clock skew, which can be detected by observing timestamps (under the server's real identity).

[[File:Weizmann's passport photo.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Chaim Weizmann]]]]
'''''Clostridium acetobutylicum''''', [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]] 824, is a commercially valuable [[bacterium]] sometimes called the "'''Weizmann Organism'''", after Jewish-Russian-born [[Chaim Weizmann]]. A senior lecturer at the [[University of Manchester]], [[England]], he used them in 1916 as a bio-chemical tool to produce  at the same time,  jointly, [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], and [[butanol]] from [[starch]]. The method has been described since as the [[ABE process]],  (Acetone Butanol Ethanol fermentation process), yielding 3 parts of [[acetone]], 6 of [[butanol]], and 1 of [[ethanol]]. Acetone was used in the important wartime task of casting [[cordite]]. The alcohols were used to produce vehicle fuels and [[synthetic rubber]].

Unlike [[yeast]], which can digest only [[sugar]] into [[alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], ''C. acetobutylicum'' and other Clostridia can digest [[whey]], [[sugar]], [[starch]], [[cellulose]] and perhaps certain types of [[lignin]], yielding  [[butanol]], [[propionic acid]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], and [[glycerin]].

==In genetic engineering==

In 2008, a strain of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' was genetically engineered to synthesize butanol; the genes were derived from ''Clostridium acetobutylicum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = M.

One of the crucial [[enzyme]]s - a [[fatty acid|fatty]] [[acyl-CoA]] [[reductase]] - came from ''Clostridium acetobutylicum''.

[[File:Americanexpressplatinumemvcontactless.jpg|thumb|right|A contactless enabled American Express charge card issued in the UK]]
'''Contactless payment''' systems are [[credit card]]s and [[debit card]]s, [[key fob]]s, [[smart card]]s, or other devices, including [[smartphone]]s and other [[mobile device]]s, that use [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) or [[near field communication]] (NFC, e.g. [[Samsung Pay]], [[Apple Pay]], [[Google Pay]], Fitbit Pay, or any bank mobile application that support Contactless) for making secure payments. The embedded chip and antenna enable consumers to wave their card, fob, or handheld device over a [[Credit card terminal|reader]] at the [[point of sale]] terminal.  Contactless payments are made in close physical proximity, unlike [[mobile payments]] which use broad-area cellular or [[WiFi]] networks and do not involve close physical proximity.

Some suppliers claim that transactions can be almost twice as fast as a conventional [[cash]], credit, or debit card purchase. Because no [[signature]] or [[PIN number|PIN]] verification is typically required, contactless purchases are typically limited to small value sales. Lack of authentication provides a window during which [[credit card fraud|fraudulent purchases]] can be made while the card owner is unaware of the card's loss.

In 2012, MasterCard Advisors wrote that consumers are likely to spend more money using their cards due to the ease of small transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/new-mastercard-advisors-study-on-contactless-payments-shows-almost-30-lift-in-total-spend-within-first-year-of-adoption/|title= New MasterCard Advisors Study on Contactless Payments Shows Almost 30% Lift in Total Spend Within First Year of Adoption|accessdate=2013-03-13|work=newsroom.mastercard.com|date=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MasterCard]] Canada says it has seen "about 25 percent" higher spending by users of its [[MasterCard Contactless|Mastercard Contactless]]-brand RFID credit cards.&lt;ref&gt;Dubinsky, Zach.

[[EMV]] is a common standard used by major credit card and smartphone companies for use in general commerce.  [[Contactless smart card]]s that function as  [[stored-value card]]s are becoming popular for use as [[transit system]] [[Public transport#Electronic fare card|farecards]], such as the [[Oyster card]] or [[RioCard]].  These can often store non-currency value (such as monthly passes) in additional to fare value purchased with cash or electronic payment.

==History==
[[Mobil]] was one of the most notable early adopters of a similar technology, and offered their "[[Speedpass]]" contactless payment system for participating [[Mobil]] gas stations as early as 1997. Although Mobil has since merged with Exxon, the service is still offered at many of [[ExxonMobil]]'s stations. [[Freedompay]] also had early wins in the contactless space with [[Bank of America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secureidnews.com/news-item/freedompay-makes-waves-in-contactless-payment/|title=FreedomPay makes waves in contactless payment - SecureIDNews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-05-29-mcdonalds-e-payments.htm | work=USA Today | title=McDonald's testing e-payment system | date=2001-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McDonald's]], [[KFC]], [[Burger King]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Eat (restaurant)|Eat]], [[Heron Foods]], [[Pret a Manger]], [[Stagecoach Group]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[AMT Coffee]], [[Tesco]], [[Asda]] and [[Lidl]] are among the retailers offering contactless payments to their customers in the UK. In March 2008, [[Eat (restaurant)|Eat]] became the first restaurant chain to adopt contactless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paymentsnews.com/2008/03/first-fully-int.html|title= First Fully Integrated Contactless Payment System in UK|accessdate=2012-08-26|work =www.paymentnews.com|date= 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major financial entities now offering contactless payment systems include [[MasterCard]], [[Citibank]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[American Express]], [[KeyBank]], [[Barclays]], [[Barclaycard]], [[HSBC]], [[Lloyds Banking Group]], [[FreedomPay]], [[The Co-operative Bank]], [[Nationwide Building Society]] and [[The Royal Bank of Scotland Group]]. [[Visa Inc.#payWave|Visa payWave]], American Express Expresspay, and [[MasterCard#MasterCard Contactless|MasterCard Contactless]] are examples of contactless credit cards which have become widespread in the U.S. and UK.

The first contactless cards in the UK were issued by Barclaycard in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/17411/barclaycard-rolls-out-oyster-payments-card|title=Barclaycard rolls out Oyster payments card|last=|first=|date=September 2007|website=Finextra|publisher=Finextra|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|12}}, there are approximately 58 million contactless-enabled cards in use, in the UK, and over 147,000 terminals in use though this is growing in numbers and percentages of adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Francis|title=Contactless payments taking off in the UK in 2015|url=http://www.mobiletransaction.org/contactless-payments-uk/|website=mobiletransaction.org|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactless.info/Facts-and-Stats.asp |title=Key Facts and Stats|accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721223225/http://www.contactless.info/Facts-and-Stats.asp |archivedate=July 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telecom operators are starting to get involved in contactless payments via the use of [[near field communication]] phones. [[Belgacom]]'s [[Pingping (payment)|Pingping]], for example, has a stored value account and via a partnership with [[Alcatel-Lucent]]'s [[Touchatag]] provides contactless payment functionalities. In January 2010, Barclaycard partnered with mobile phone firm [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], to launch a contactless credit card in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.home.barclaycard/news/barclaycard-orange-partnership.html|title=Orange and Barclaycard deliver next step in their partnership with contactless co-branded credit card|last=|first=|date=January 2010|website=Barclaycard|publisher=Barclaycard|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orange and Barclaycard also announced in 2009 that they would be launching a mobile phone with contactless technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/4958655/Barclaycard-and-Orange-unveil-pay-by-mobile-service.html|title= Barclaycard and Orange unveil pay-by-mobile service by Garry White|accessdate=2010-08-06 |work= Daily Telegraph|publisher= |date= 2009-03-08 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the first mobile phones with MasterCard PayPass and/or Visa payWave certification appeared. A PayPass or payWave account can be assigned to the embedded secure element and/or SIM card within the phones. [[Google Pay]] is an application for devices running Google's Android OS, which allows users to make purchases using [[Near field communication|NFC]], which initially required a physical secure element but this was replaced by [[host card emulation]] which was introduced in Android 4.4 (KitKat). [[Softcard]] (formerly known as Isis mobile wallet), Cityzi and Quick Tap wallets for example, use a secure SIM card to store encrypted personal information. Contactless payments with enabled mobile phones still occur on a small scale, but every month an increasing number of mobile phones are certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified phones|url=http://www.nfc-phones.org/certified-phones/|publisher=nfc-phones.org|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, MasterCard announced that it would partner with Weve, which is a joint venture between [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]], [[Telefónica UK]], and [[Vodafone UK]], to focus on mobile payments. The partnership will promote the development of "contactless mobile payment systems" by creating a universal platform in Europe for it.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Alexandra.

Retrieved 2/10/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Transport for London]]'s Tube began accepting contactless payment. The number of completed contactless journeys has now exceeded 300m. On Friday 18 December, the busiest single day in 2015, a record 1.24m journeys were completed by over 500k unique contactless cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.home.barclaycard/contactless/contactless-has-caught-on-underground.html|title=Contactless has caught on underground|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Barclaycard|publisher=Barclaycard|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Erste Group]] launched an NFC only debit card implemented as a sticker in Austria. It can be used at any NFC supporting terminal for transactions of unlimited amount however for transactions over the floor limit of 25 EUR a PIN is required to confirm the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sparkasse.at/erstebank/Privatkunden/Konto-karten/BankCard-NFC/Sticker|title=BankCard Sticker|last=|first=|date=January 2016|website=Erste Bank und Sparkassen|publisher=Erste Bank Group|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822043548/https://www.sparkasse.at/erstebank/Privatkunden/Konto-karten/BankCard-NFC/Sticker|archivedate=2016-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, contactless payments start to become even broader with [[wearable technology]] devices also offering this payment feature.

In 2018, the Westpac Banking Corporation in Australia revealed contactless payment statistics from 2017 and claimed in the report that contactless payments approached saturation point by being used in over 90% of purchases. The Australian St.George Bank reported 94.6% usage for the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.westpac.com.au/personal-banking/credit-cards/explore/visa-contactless-payments-data/|title=Contactless Payments Statistics Australia 2017 {{!}} Westpac|website=www.westpac.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Depending on the economic space, there may be a payment limit on single transactions, and some contactless cards can only be used a certain number of times before customers are asked for their PIN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/debit-card/contactless.asp|title=Lloyds Bank - UK Bank Accounts - Contactless Debit Cards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contactless debit and credit transactions use the same [[chip and PIN]] network as older cards and are protected by the same fraud guarantees. Where PIN is supported, the contactless part of the card remains non-functional until a standard [[chip and PIN]] transaction has been executed.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/my-card-doesn-t-work&lt;/ref&gt; This provides some verification that the card was delivered to the actual cardholder.

Under fraud guarantee standards U.S. banks are liable for any fraudulent transactions charged to the contactless cards.{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}

==Floor limit==
Because no [[signature]] or [[PIN number|PIN]] verification is typically required, contactless purchases are typically limited to a set maximum amount per transaction, known as a ''[[floor limit]]''. Limits may vary between banks.

[[Image:Multiplexed_Analogue_Components_transmission_(simulation).jpg|thumb|Simulated MAC signal. From left to right: digital data, chrominance and luminance]]
[[Image:D2-MAC processing.png|thumb|D2-Mac processing on a Philips satellite receiver from 1990]]
'''D2-MAC''' is a [[satellite television]] transmission standard, a member of [[Multiplexed Analogue Components]] family. It was created to solve [[D-MAC]]'s bandwidth problem on European cable systems.
* D2-MAC uses half the data rate of [[D-MAC]] {{nowrap|(10.125 Mbit/s)}}
* D2-MAC has a reduced vision bandwidth, about 1/2 that of D-MAC.
* D2-MAC retains most of the quality of a [[D-MAC]] signal—but consumes only 5&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth.

== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).

Audio and Scrambling (selective access)
* Audio, in a format similar to [[NICAM]] was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM sub-carrier.
* The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, [[EuroCrypt]], a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

==History and politics==
MAC was developed by the UK's [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) and in 1982 was adopted as the transmission format for the UK's forthcoming [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) television services (eventually provided by [[British Satellite Broadcasting]]). The following year MAC was adopted by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) as the standard for all DBS.

By 1986, despite there being two standards, D-MAC and D2-MAC, favoured by different countries in Europe, an EU Directive imposed MAC on the national DBS broadcasters, to provide a stepping stone from analogue [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] formats to the eventual [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[digital TV|digital]] television of the future, with European TV manufacturers in a privileged position to provide the equipment required.

However, the [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellite system was also starting up at this time (the first satellite, [[Astra 1A]] was launched in 1989) and that operated outside of the EU’s MAC requirements, due to being a non-DBS satellite. Despite further pressure from the EU (including a further Directive originally intended to make MAC provision compulsory in TV sets, and a subsidy to broadcasters to use the MAC format), most broadcasters outside Scandinavia preferred the lower cost of PAL transmission and receiving equipment.

In the 2000s, the use of D-MAC and D2-MAC ceased when the satellite broadcasts of the channels concerned changed to DVB-S format.&lt;ref&gt;''High Above'' Broadgate Publications (April, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VIA EPIA''' (''[[VIA Technologies|VIA]] Embedded Platform Innovative Architecture'') is a series of [[mini-ITX]], em-ITX, [[nano-ITX]], [[pico-ITX]] and [[pico-ITXe]] [[motherboard]]s with integrated VIA [[Microprocessor|processor]]s. They are small in size and consume less power than computers of comparable capabilities.

There are several types of VIA EPIA motherboard: [[Nano-ITX]] versions, based on the [[VIA CoreFusion]] processor series, and [[Mini-ITX]] form factor featuring VIA CPUs and [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridges]] in separate packaging. They were originally built for industrial applications but came to have a wide range of applications in the consumer market, such as [[carputer]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[HTPC]]s, and Small File [[server (computing)|server]]s.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Though we have steadily grown, we committed too many resources too quickly. We built up areas of our business in ways that have proven to be inefficient. Going forward, we are streamlining certain functions, like sales, so we can continue to speed up and scale others, like product development and engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evernote.com/blog/2018-09-18-message-from-ceo/|title=A Message from the CEO|date=2018-09-18|work=evernote.com {{!}} Blog|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
===Coding and versions===
In 2010, the coding language for the suite was changed from [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for version 3.5 to [[C++]] in version 4.0 to improve performance.&lt;ref name="lextrait"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lextrait.com/Vincent/implementations.html |title=The Programming Languages Beacon |first=Vincent |last=Lextrait |date=December 2013 |access-date=July 21, 2015 |edition=13.0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530/http://www.lextrait.com/Vincent/implementations.html |archivedate=May 30, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2010/10/26/evernote-4-for-windows-is-here/|title = Evernote 4 for Windows is here!|date = October 26, 2010|access-date = July 21, 2015|website = Evernote Blog|publisher = Evernote Corporation|last = Constantinou|first = Philip|type = blog}}{{Self-published inline|date = July 2015|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data entry===
As well as the keyboard entry of typed notes, Evernote supports image capture from cameras on supported devices, and the recording of voice notes. In some situations, text that appears in captured images can be recognized using [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] and [[Web annotation|annotated]]. Evernote also supports touch and tablet screens with [[handwriting recognition]]. Evernote web-clipping plugins are available for the most popular Internet browsers that allow marked sections of webpages to be captured and clipped to Evernote. If no section of a webpage has been highlighted, Evernote can clip the full page. Evernote also supports the ability to e-mail notes to the service, allowing for automated note entry via e-mail rules or filters.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, Jonathan. [http://jonwestfall.com/2010/09/scan-directly-from-your-office-to-evernote/ Scan Directly from your Office to Evernote] ''JonWestfall.com'', September 28, 2010. (Accessed July 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where suitable hardware is available, Evernote can automatically add geolocation tags to notes. 

As of November 2018, Evernote Pro integrates directly with [[Google Drive]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Microsoft Teams]], and [[Slack (software)|Slack]], and Evernote Pro adds an integration with [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evernote.com/compare-plans|title=Compare plans and get started for free  {{!}} Evernote|website=Evernote|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of Evernote also support integrations through [[IFTTT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ifttt.com/evernote|title=IFTTT|last=IFTTT|website=ifttt.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zapier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zapier.com/apps/evernote/integrations/|title=Evernote Integrations|last=Zapier|website=Zapier|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Evernote deprecated its direct integration with [[Twitter]]&lt;ref name="Tweet to self: Evernote gets Twitter integration"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://m.cnet.com/news/tweet-to-self-evernote-gets-twitter-integration/10216234?ds=1 | title=Tweet to self: Evernote gets Twitter integration | work=C Net News | date=April 9, 2009 | access-date=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of these third-party services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/11/26/how-to-capture-your-social-media-memories-with-evernote/|title=How to Capture Your Social Media Moments with Evernote|last=|first=|date=November 26, 2013|website=The Evernote Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209171421/http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/11/26/how-to-capture-your-social-media-memories-with-evernote/|archive-date=December 9, 2013|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data storage and access====
On supported operating systems, Evernote allows users to store and edit notes on their local machine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evernote Data Usage|url=https://evernote.com/privacy/data_usage.php|website=Evernote|access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[SQLite]] database in Windows.&lt;ref&gt;http://mengwong.livejournal.com/84064.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Users with Internet access and an Evernote account can also have their notes automatically synchronized with a master copy held on Evernote's servers. This approach lets a user access and edit their data across multiple machines and operating system platforms, but still view, input and edit data when an Internet connection is not available. However, notes stored on Evernote servers are not encrypted.

Where Evernote client software is not available, online account-holders can access their note archive via a web interface or through a media device. The service also allows selected files to be shared for viewing and editing by other users. 

The Evernote software can be downloaded and used as "stand-alone" software without using the online portion of an Evernote account (online registration is required for initial setup, however), but it will not be able to upload files to the Evernote server, or use the server to synchronize or share files between different Evernote installations. Also, no image or Image-PDF (Premium only) recognition and indexing will take place if the software is used entirely offline.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Accounts==
[[File:3 months Evernote Premium gift card - Evernote Taiwan User Meetup (6353586689).jpg|thumb|Evernote Premium [[gift card]].]]
Evernote is a free online service that allows users to upgrade to Plus*, Premium, or a Business account. Free, Plus* and Premium Evernote accounts have a maximum limit of 100,000 notes and 250 notebooks.&lt;ref name="help.evernote.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005247 |title=What are the system limits of Evernote? |access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic customers can upload 60 MB of data each month. Plus* customers get a 1 GB upload limit, offline notes on mobile devices, as well as passcode lock for mobile devices. Emails can also be sent to their Evernote account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evernote Pricing|url = https://evernote.com/pricing/|website = Evernote|access-date = May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium subscribers are granted 10 GB of new uploaded data every month, faster word recognition in images, heightened security, PDF annotation, Context, where notes and news articles can be seen, which are related to the open note and the ability to search text within PDF documents. They also receive additional options for notebook sharing. Each of free, Plus* and Premium account types allow notebook sharing with other Evernote users; however, the accounts are distinguished by editing capabilities. In regards to shared notebooks, editing permissions to non-paid account holders may only be granted to premium Evernote subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.evernote.com/link/portal/16051/16058/Article/629/An-Introduction-to-Sharing |title=Evernote Support &amp;#124; Evernote |publisher=Support.evernote.com |date= |access-date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Premium plan information [https://www.evernote.com/about/premium/ Evernote.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902041108/http://www.evernote.com/about/premium/ |date=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The free service does not make files available offline on iOS and Android devices; while sometimes they are available from cache, editing these files can cause conflicts when synchronizing.

With the full version of Evernote Business, users sync and view work documents through a variety of platforms, such as Mac, iPhone and iPads, Web, Windows and Android Devices. Files that can be uploaded include spreadsheets, presentations, notes and design mock ups.

==History==
The goal of any engine control system is to allow the engine to perform at maximum efficiency for a given condition. Originally, engine control systems consisted of simple mechanical linkages connected physically to the engine. By moving these levers the pilot or the flight engineer could control fuel flow, power output, and many other engine parameters. The {{lang|de|Kommandogerät}} mechanical/hydraulic engine control unit for Germany's [[BMW 801]] piston aviation radial engine of World War II was just one notable example of this in its later stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunston |first=Bill |date=1989 |title=World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines |url= |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |page=26 |isbn=1-85260-163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanical engine control was progressively replaced first by [[analog device|analog electronic]] engine control and, later, digital engine control. 

Analog electronic control varies an electrical signal to communicate the desired engine settings.  The system was an evident improvement over mechanical control but had its drawbacks, including common electronic noise interference and reliability issues. Full authority analogue control was used in the 1960s and introduced as a component of the [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593]] engine of the supersonic transport aircraft [[Concorde]].&lt;ref name=concorde_analogue1&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Roger W|title=Flight Control Systems: Practical Issues In Design and Implementation|date=2000|publisher=Institute of Electrical Engineers|isbn=0852967667|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqhmXXdTIcIC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=concorde%20analogue&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=concorde%20analogue&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more critical inlet control was digital on the production aircraft.&lt;ref name=concorde_analogue2&gt;{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Kenneth|title=Concorde: Story of a Supersonic Pioneer|date=2001|publisher=Science Museum|isbn=9781900747424|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzNUJlX7CXoC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=concorde%20analogue&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=concorde%20analogue&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital electronic control followed. In 1968 [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliott Automation]], in conjunction with the [[National Gas Turbine Establishment]], worked on a digital engine control system that completed several hundred hours of operation on a [[Rolls-Royce Olympus]] Mk 320.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202110.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s, [[NASA]] and [[Pratt and Whitney]] experimented with their first experimental FADEC, first flown on an [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] fitted with a highly modified [[Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30]] left engine. The experiments led to [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F100]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000]] being the first military and civil engines, respectively, fitted with FADEC, and later the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000]] as the first commercial "dual FADEC" engine.  The first FADEC in service was the [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus]] engine developed for the [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier II]] by [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] and [[Smiths Group|Smiths Industries Controls]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunston (1990) ''Avionics: The story and technology of aviation electronics''  Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough UK. {{page number missing|date=November 2017}}, {{ISBN|1-85260-133-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

True full authority digital engine controls have no form of manual override available, placing full authority over the operating parameters of the engine in the hands of the computer.  If a total FADEC failure occurs, the engine fails.  If the engine is controlled digitally and electronically but allows for manual override, it is considered solely an EEC or [[Engine control unit|ECU]].  An EEC, though a component of a FADEC, is not by itself FADEC.  When standing alone, the EEC makes all of the decisions until the pilot wishes to intervene.
 
FADEC works by receiving multiple input variables of the current flight condition including [[air density]], throttle lever position, engine temperatures, engine pressures, and many other parameters.  The inputs are received by the EEC and analyzed up to 70 times per second.  Engine operating parameters such as fuel flow, stator vane position, air bleed valve position, and others are computed from this data and applied as appropriate.  FADEC also controls engine starting and restarting.  The FADEC's basic purpose is to provide optimum engine efficiency for a given flight condition.

FADEC not only provides for efficient engine operation, it also allows the manufacturer to program engine limitations and receive engine health and maintenance reports.  For example, to avoid exceeding a certain engine temperature, the FADEC can be programmed to automatically take the necessary measures without pilot intervention.

===Safety===

With the operation of the engines so heavily relying on automation, safety is a great concern.  [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]] is provided in the form of two or more separate but identical digital channels. Each channel may provide all engine functions without restriction.  FADEC also monitors a variety of data coming from the engine subsystems and related aircraft systems, providing for [[fault tolerant]] engine control.

Engine control problems simultaneously causing loss of thrust on up to three engines have been cited as causal in the crash of an Airbus A400M aircraft at Seville Spain on 9 May 2015. Airbus Chief Strategy Officer Marwan Lahoud confirmed on 29 May that incorrectly installed engine control software caused the fatal crash. "There are no structural defects [with the aircraft], but we have a serious quality problem in the final assembly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/31/airbus_software_config_brought_down_a400m/|title=Airbus confirms software brought down A400M transport plane|last=Chirgwin|first=Richard|date=2015-05-31|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===

A typical civilian transport aircraft flight may illustrate the function of a FADEC.  The flight crew first enters flight data such as wind conditions, [[runway]] length, or cruise altitude, into the [[flight management system]] (FMS).  The FMS uses this data to calculate power settings for different phases of the flight.  At takeoff, the flight crew advances the throttle to a predetermined setting, or opts for an auto-throttle takeoff if available.  The FADECs now apply the calculated takeoff thrust setting by sending an electronic signal to the engines; there is no direct linkage to open fuel flow.  This procedure can be repeated for any other phase of flight.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In flight, small changes in operation are constantly made to maintain efficiency.  Maximum thrust is available for emergency situations if the throttle is advanced to full, but limitations can’t be exceeded; the flight crew has no means of manually overriding the FADEC.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Advantages==

* Better [[fuel efficiency]]
* Automatic engine protection against out-of-tolerance operations
* Safer as the multiple channel FADEC computer provides [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in case of failure
* Care-free engine handling, with guaranteed [[thrust]] settings
* Ability to use single engine type for wide thrust requirements by just reprogramming the FADECs
* Provides semi-automatic engine starting
* Better systems integration with engine and aircraft systems
* Can provide engine long-term health monitoring and diagnostics
* Number of external and internal parameters used in the control processes increases by one order of magnitude
* Reduces the number of parameters to be monitored by flight crews
* Due to the high number of parameters monitored, the FADEC makes possible "Fault Tolerant Systems" (where a system can operate within required reliability and safety limitation with certain fault configurations)
* Saves weight

==Disadvantages==
* Full authority digital engine controls have no form of manual override available, placing full authority over the operating parameters of the engine in the hands of the computer.
**If a total FADEC failure occurs, the engine fails.
**Upon total FADEC failure, pilots have no manual controls for engine restart, throttle, or other functions.
**Single point of failure risk can be mitigated with redundant FADECs (assuming that the failure is a random hardware failure and not the result of a design or manufacturing error, which may cause identical failures in all identical redundant components). 
* High system complexity compared to hydromechanical, analogue or manual control systems
* High system development and validation effort due to the complexity
* Whereas in crisis (for example, imminent terrain contact), a non-FADEC engine can produce significantly more than its rated thrust, a FADEC engine will always operate within its limits.

==Requirements==

* Engineering processes must be used to design, manufacture, install and maintain the sensors which measure and report flight and engine parameters to the control system itself.
* Formal systems engineering processes are often used in the design, implementation and testing of the software used in these safety-critical control systems.  This requirement led to the development and use of specialized software such as [[model-based systems engineering]] (MBSE) tools. The application development toolset SCADE (from [[Esterel Technologies]]) (not to be confused with the application category [[SCADA]]) is an example of an MBSE tool and has been used as part of the development of FADEC systems.

==Research==
[[NASA]] has analyzed a distributed FADEC architecture rather than the current centralized, specifically for helicopters. Greater flexibility and lower life cycle costs are likely advantages of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/cdtb/aboutus/Distributed_Engine_Control-DC.pdf|title=Distributed Engine Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Nasa.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the appropriate voltage for the battery type and with proper temperature compensation, a float charger may be kept connected indefinitely without damaging the battery.

However, it should be understood that the concept of a float voltage does not apply equally to all battery chemistries.  For instance, [[lithium ion]] cells have to be float charged with extra care because if they are float charged at just a little over optimum voltage, which is generally the full output voltage of the lithium cell, the chemical system within the cell will be damaged to some extent.  Some lithium ion variants are less tolerant than others, but generally overheating, which shortens cell life is likely, and fire and explosion possible other outcomes. It is important to make certain that the battery cell involved can be safely float charged, and that the charger circuit goes into float charge status when full charge is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.electronicsweekly.com/market-sectors/power/float-charging-lithium-ion-cells-2006-02/|title=Float charging lithium ion cells|publisher=Electronics Weekly.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15394">'''Glass frit bonding''', also referred to as '''glass soldering''' or '''seal glass bonding''', describes a [[wafer bonding]] technique with an intermediate [[glass]] layer. It is a widely used [[electronic packaging|encapsulation]] technology for surface [[Microelectromechanical systems|micro-machined structures]], e.g., [[accelerometer]]s or [[gyroscope]]s.&lt;ref name="Dre2006" /&gt; This technique utilizes low melting glass ("[[Solder#Glass solder|glass solder]]") and therefore provides various advantages including that [[viscosity]] of glass decreases with an increase of temperature. The [[viscous flow]] of glass has effects to compensate and planarize surface irregularities, convenient for bonding wafers with a high roughness due to [[plasma etching]] or [[vapor deposition|deposition]]. A low viscosity promotes [[hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] encapsulation of structures based on a better adaption of the structured shapes.&lt;ref name="Kne2003" /&gt; Further, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE) of the glass material is adapted to [[silicon]]. This results in low [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the [[wafer bonding|bonded wafer]] pair.

Glass frit bonding can be used for many surface materials, e.g., silicon with [[hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] surface, [[silicon dioxide]], [[silicon nitride]], [[aluminium]], [[titanium]] or [[glass]], as long as the CTE are in the same range. This bonding procedure also allows the realization of metallic [[feedthrough]]s to contact active structures in the hermetically sealed cavity. Glass [[frit]] as a [[dielectric material]] does not need additional [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] for preventing [[leakage current]]s at process temperatures up to 125&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt;

Following advantages resulting in using glass frit bonding procedure:&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;
* [[screen printing]] process applicable on thin, structured wafer
* no electrical potentials during bonding process necessary
* low tension due to low bonding temperature
* selective bonding based on structured intermediate glass layer
* bonding of rough wafer surfaces
* no [[outgassing]] after bonding, better chemical durability, higher strength compared to organic [[adhesive]]s
* high [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] and stable hermetical sealing
* easier process compared to metallic or [[eutectic]] layer procedures

== Overview ==
The glass [[frit]] bond procedure is used for the encapsulation and mounting of components. The coating of glass frit layers is applied by [[spin coating]] for thickness of 5 to 30&amp;nbsp;µm or commonly by [[screen printing]] for thickness of 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt;

To achieve process temperatures beneath 450&amp;nbsp;°C [[lead glass|leaded glass]] or lead silicate glass is used. The glass frit is a paste consisting glass powder, organic [[Binder (material)|binder]], inorganic [[Filler (materials)|fillers]] and [[solvent]]s. This low melting glass paste is milled into powder (grain size &lt;&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;µm) and mixed with organic binder forming a printable viscous paste.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; Inorganic fillers, i.e. [[cordierite]] particles (e.g. Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]) or [[barium silicate]], are added to the melted glass paste to influence properties, i.e. lowering the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and glass frit.&lt;ref name="NDGB2010" /&gt; The solvents are used to adjust the viscosity of the organic binder. Several glass frit pastes are commercially available, e.g. FERRO FX-11-0366, and every single one need individual handling after deposition.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt; The choice of the paste depends on various factors, i.e. deposition method, substrate material and process temperatures.&lt;ref name="Kne2003" /&gt;

The glass used for MEMS applications consists of particles and lead oxide. Latter lowers the [[glass transition]] temperature below 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="PDE+2006" /&gt; The [[redox|reduction]] of lead oxide by the silicon leads to the formation of [[lead]] precipitations at the silicon-glass interface. Those precipitations decrease the strength of the bond and are reliability risks that have to be considered for the lifetime predictions of the devices.&lt;ref name="NDGB2010" /&gt;

The printed glass frit structures are heated to form compact glass. The heating process is necessary to drive out the solvents and binder. This results in a subsequent [[sintering|particle fusion]] of the glass powder. Using mechanical pressure the wafers are bonded at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="Kne2003" /&gt;

The procedural steps of glass frit bonding are divided into the following:&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt;

# Deposition of glass paste
# Burn out and firing (in order to form glass layer)
# Bonding process
# Cooling down

== Procedural steps ==

=== Glass frit deposition ===
[[Screen printing]], as a commonly used deposition method, provides a technique of structuring for the glass frit material. This method has the advantage of material deposition on structured cap wafers without any additional processes, i.e. [[photolithography]].&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt;

Screen printing enables the possibility of selective bonding. So only in areas where bonding is required the glass frit is deposited.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt;

The risk of glass frit flowing into the structures can be prevented by optimization of the screen printing process. Under high positioning precision the sizes of the structures in the range of 190&amp;nbsp;µm with a minimum spacing of &lt;&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;µm are achievable. The exact positioning of the screen print structures to the cap wafer are required to ensure an accurate bond. The bonded structures are, dependent on the [[wettability]] of the printed surface, 10 to 20% wider than the designed screen.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;

To ensure a uniform glass thickness, all structures should have the same width. The printed glass frit high is about 30&amp;nbsp;µm and provides a gap of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;µm between the bonded wafers after bonding (compare to cross sectional SEM images).&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; A bond surface activation is not necessary to promote a higher bonding strength.&lt;ref name="SPWW2004" /&gt;

=== Thermal conditioning ===
Thermal conditioning transforms the glass paste into glass layer and is important to prevent voids inside the glass frit layer.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; The conditioning process consists of:

* Glazing of organic binder and solvents
* Melting of glass particle to compact glass
* Formation of solid connection between glass and wafer surface

The initial step comprises drying for 5 to 7 minutes at 100 to 120&amp;nbsp;°C in order to diffuse solvents out of the interface. This starts the polymerization of the organic binder. The binder molecules are linked to long-chain polymers what solidifies the paste.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;

The organic binder of the glass paste has to be burned with heating up to a specific temperature (325 to 350&amp;nbsp;°C) where the glass is not fully melted for 10 to 20 minutes. This so-called glazing ensures the [[outgassing]] of the organic additives.

Further, a pre-melting or sealing step heats the material to the process temperature between 410 and 459&amp;nbsp;°C for 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;min. The material fully melts and forms a compact glass without any inclusions. The inorganic fillers are melted down and the properties of the bond glass are fixed.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; The melting of the glass starts at the silicon-glass interface directed to the glass surface. During the melting process the [[porosity]] of the glass eliminates and based on the compression of the intermediate layer the thickness of the glass decreases significantly.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;

=== Bonding process ===
The glass frit bonding, starting with alignment of the wafers, is a thermo-compressive process that takes place in the bonding chamber at specific pressure. Under bonding pressure wafers are heated up to the process temperature around 430&amp;nbsp;°C for a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; On the one hand a short bonding time causes the glass frit to spread insufficiently, on the other hand a longer bonding time causes the glass frit to be overflown subsequently leaving voids.&lt;ref name="SPWW2004" /&gt;

The alignment has to be very precise and stable to prevent shifting. This can be realized using clamps or special pressure plates.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; Shifting can occur through temporarily staggered pressure, not precise vertical pressure based on misalignment of the bonding tools or the difference of thermal expansion between the bonding tools.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;

During bonding a supporting tool pressure is applied to improve the thermal input into the bonding glass and equal wafer geometry inadmissibility (i.e. bow and warp) supporting wettability.&lt;ref name="KWF2006" /&gt; Based on the sufficiently high viscosity of the glass, bonding can take place nearly without pressure.&lt;ref name="Kne2004" /&gt;

The bonding temperature needs to be high enough to reduce the viscosity of the glass material and ensures a good wetting of the bond surface, but also low enough to prevent overspreading of the glass frit material. The heating up over 410&amp;nbsp;°C enables the wetting of the bond surface. A good [[wetting]] is indicated by a low edge angle. The atomic wafer surface layers are fused into the glass at an atomic level.&lt;ref name="KWF2006" /&gt; This forms a thin glass mixture at the interface which forms the strong bond between the glass and the wafer.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt;

=== Cooling down ===
During cooling down under pressure a mechanically strong and hermetically sealed wafer bond is formed.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt; The cooling process leads especially at higher temperatures to thermal stress in the glass frit layer that has to be considered in the lifetime analysis of the bond frame.&lt;ref name="PDE+2006" /&gt; The wafer pair is removed from the bond chamber at lower temperatures to prevent thermal cracking of the wafers or the bond interface by [[thermal shock]]s.&lt;ref name="KWF2006" /&gt;

The bonding strength is mainly dependent on the density, the spreading area of the glass frit layer and the surface layer of the bonding interface. It is high enough, around 20&amp;nbsp;MPa, for most applications and comparable to those achieved with [[anodic bonding]]. The hermeticity ensures the correct function and a sufficient reliability of the bond and therefore the product. Further, the bonding yield of glass frit bonded wafers is very high, normally &gt;&amp;nbsp;90&amp;nbsp;%.&lt;ref name="SPWW2004" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Glass frit bonding is used to encapsulate surface [[Microelectromechanical systems|micro-machined sensors]], i.e. [[gyroscope]]s and [[accelerometer]]s. Other applications are the sealing of absolute [[pressure sensor]] cavities, the mounting of [[optical window]]s and the capping of thermally active devices.&lt;ref name="Kne2005" /&gt;

'''Gym floor covers''' can either be a carpet-based protection system or is a large plastic [[tarpaulin|tarp]], similar to a painters tarp, usually divided into equal sections {{convert|6|to|10|ft}} wide each to cover up the entire [[gym]] floor. Gym floor covers are available in roll or tile systems.These covers are often used in large venues designed for athletic events when non-athletic events are being held there such as receptions, award ceremonies, indoor track meets, gymnastic events and graduations.  

==History==
Gym floor covers are employed to prevent floor damage and improve safety, allowing for sports venues to be used for other purposes. Covers are used to prevent [[slip and fall]] accidents, while protecting underlying hardwood floor from foot traffic damage and heavy furniture scratches and dents. The newer carpet topcloth systems also improve acoustics in the gymnsium.

The first plastic tarp gym floor cover was invented and manufactured by Covermaster Inc. in 1969 with  Seattle-based Floor Guardian Inc.{{cn|date=October 2014}} following up by manufacturing a recycled content, removable, portable carpet based protection system in the late 1970s to answer the demand for a product that was less of a trip hazard, environmentally sound and classier looking than what many felt was essentially a painter's tarp. Since then, the quality of the materials has greatly evolved. Most manufacturers have switched from vinyl and [[polyethylene]] materials to more durable [[polyester]] fabric. In 2013, Protex Matting Inc. answered environmental concerns by introducing the newest 100% recycled polyester top cloth gym floor covers made completely from recycled plastic water bottles, reusing approximately 7000 water bottles for every 10,000 sq. ft produced {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The best plastic tarp gym floor covers today are made of single-layer woven polyester and the newest [[polymer]] materials made via the knife-coating process, which enables dyes to be deposited deep into the core of the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. material and prevent peeling of the layers - a side effect of [[extrusion]] coating or [[lamination]] process.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Gym floor cover comparison.jpg|frame|'''Gym floor cover texture comparison:''' &lt;br /&gt;polyester double-sided cover vs. vinyl single-sided gym floor cover]] --&gt;.

Modern gym floor covers are manufactured with a variety of colors, anti-slip surfaces, and weights ranging from {{convert|6|to|32|oz/sqyd}}. Custom sizing is available with most products. The following technical characteristics are used to describe and classify the covers: filament size, weave count, total weight, core weight, tear strength, tensile strength, [[adhesion]], [[coefficient of friction]], slip resistance, [[hydrostatic]] resistance, fire resistance and others.

==Usage==

There are several common ways to install floor coverings. For the tarp method, each section is laid down to slightly overlap adjacent sections and then secured with special adhesive tape. This fastens the individual segments together into a cohesive unit. The carpet method, by contrast, affixes the segments to the floor via reusable velcro straps. Newer tile systems allow more flexibility in installation and do not require adhesive or velcro tape, but are much more labor intensive for larger floors.

Installing and deploying large covers can be labour-intensive task. The most efficient way involves rolling and unrolling each section separately, and storing them on the gym floor cover storage system (rack) in a rolled up state to prevent creases and dust accumulation. Advances in the newer Protex GymPro products allow for smaller storage racks, while the newer tile systems are stacked on compact platform trucks for storage and transport. Dual cleaning brush assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers. Carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using more traditional carpet cleaning techniques.

Plastic tarp gym floor covers have a typical lifetime of 10–15 years. Carpet-based covers have a lifetime of 15–20+ years.

The '''Hot Particulate Ingestion Rig''' ('''HPIR''') is a [[gas burner]] that can shoot sand into a hot gas flow and onto a target material to test how that material’s [[thermal barrier coating]] is impacted by the molten sand.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=2914|title=Army researchers search for technology solutions to defeat sand|last=|first=|date=November 2, 2016|work=United States Army Research Laboratory|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] to experiment with new coating materials for [[Gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] used in military aircraft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2016/11/17/army-researchers-take-up-fight-against-sand/|title=Army researchers take up fight against sand|last=Panzino|first=Charlsy|date=November 17, 2016|work=Army Times|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The HPIR uses standard military fuel and dry compressed air to produce combusted gas flows that can range from 400&amp;nbsp;°C to 1650&amp;nbsp;°C that travels as fast as 1060 meters per second or 0.8 Mach. A [[LabVIEW]] interface is used to monitor and control all the operations of the HPIR parameters and pneumatic table. Monitoring is also performed by Williamson PRO series single/dual wavelength [[pyrometer]]s, S-type [[thermocouple]]s, and a FLIR SC6700 mid-wave [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared (IR)]] camera in order to determine the [[emissivity]] of each sample.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|editor-last=Lanagan|editor-first=Michael|editor2-last=Fukushima|editor2-first=Manabu|editor3-last=Kim|editor3-first=Young-Wook|editor4-last=Shimamura|editor4-first=Kiyoshi|editor5-last=Imanaka|editor5-first=Nobihito|editor6-last=Ohji|editor6-first=Tatsuki|editor7-last=Amoroso|editor7-first=Jake|editor8-last=Lanagan|editor8-first=Michael|title=Proceedings of the 12th Pacific Rim Conference on Ceramic and Glass Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYZZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA8-PA6&amp;lpg=RA8-PA6&amp;dq=%22hot+particulate+ingestion+rig%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zIr9dBjGoK&amp;sig=tmzi-4H6gnQpq7GcnO_SQEmBWjo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjagI6XgrjcAhVCneAKHTbVCUEQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hot%20particulate%20ingestion%20rig%22&amp;f=false|journal=Ceramic Transactions|volume=264|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samples are placed in a steel holder in front of the rig at a 10 degree incident angle so that heats up the surface in a uniform manner. A pneumatic table moves the sample into the flame and an S-type thermocouple is used to monitor the flame’s temperature. During testing, the sample is initially exposed to a hot gas flow at 0.28 Mach at a flame temperature of 815&amp;nbsp;°C until the pyrometer detects that the surface temperature of the target has reached 540&amp;nbsp;°C. Then, the sample goes through several cycles of heating and cooling as an initial survivability check before it can be exposed to even higher temperatures. Short-term durability testing consists of three of these cycles with the heating stage reaching engine-relevant temperatures and the cooling stage set at ambient conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the HPIR was modified to ingest sand and salt into the [[combustion chamber]] at 1 to 200 grams per minute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sandphobic Coating Technology ==
In 2015, researchers at ARL were tasked with finding a way to prevent flying, micron-sized sand and dust particles from entering the gas turbine engines of military aircraft and damaging the internal machinery.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghoshal|first=Anindya|last2=Murugan|first2=Muthuvel|last3=Barnett|first3=Blake|last4=Kerner|first4=Kevin|date=May 2015|title=Turbomachinery Blade Thermomechanical Interface Science and Sandphobic Coatings Research|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277206462_Turbomachinery_Blade_Thermomechanical_Interface_Science_and_Sandphobic_Coatings_Research|journal=American Helicopter Society International 71st Annual Forum 2015 Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rotorandwing.com/2018/01/16/sand-phobic-turbine-coating-improvements-detailed-us-army-research-lab-paper/|title=Sand-Phobic Turbine Coating Improvements Detailed in US Army Research Lab Paper|last=Murugan|first=Muthuvel|date=January 16, 2018|work=Rotor &amp; Wing International|access-date=August 17, 2018|last2=Ghoshal|first2=Anindya|last3=Walock|first3=Michael|last4=Nieto|first4=Andy|last5=Bravo|first5=Luis|last6=Barnett|first6=Blake|last7=Pepi|first7=Marc|last8=Swab|first8=Jeffrey|last9=Pegg|first9=Robert|last10=Rowe|first10=Chris|last11=Zhu|first11=Dongming|last12=Kerner|first12=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While modern engines have particle separators that can filter out large particles, fine, powder-like sand particles that are smaller than 100 micrometers in size have consistently managed to pass through the engine’s [[combustor]]s and attach to the blades and vanes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As the rotor blades experienced cycles of heating and cooling during operation, the particles melted due the extreme temperatures and then subsequently hardened onto the turbine blades.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, the micron-sized sand particles have frequently destroyed the engine’s internal coating, which has led to severe sand glazing, blade tip wear, calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate (SMAS) attack, [[oxidation]], plugged cooling holes, and, ultimately, engine loss. This problem has recently worsened due to the fact that more recent, state-of-the-art turbine engines operate at much higher temperatures than past generation turbomachinery, ranging from 1400&amp;nbsp;°C to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to ARL scientists, the damage caused by these tiny sand particles have reduced the lifespan of a typical [[General Electric T700|T-700]] engine from 6000 hours to 400 hours, and replacing the rotors can cost more than $30,000. They estimate that one third of fielded engines used by the military have been affected by this sand ingestion problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aerotechnews.com/blog/2017/01/06/sandphobic-coating-technology/|title=Sandphobic coating technology|last=|first=|date=January 6, 2017|work=Aerotech News|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a collaborative research effort with the [[Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center|U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC)]], the U.S. Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]], ARL modified the HPIR so that it can model how sand particles adhere, melt, and glassify on thermal barrier coatings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to ARL researchers, the HPIR is the first system to confirm how the sand particles damage the turbine blades at temperatures similar to that of a turbine engine out on the field. Using high-speed imaging technology, ARL scientists were able to film how sand particles experience a phase change from solid to liquid before being deposited onto turbine blade material targets and vaporizing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2018, the team used the HPIR to test different coating materials and develop what they call “sandphobic coatings,” which will be designed so that the sand particles flake off the rotor blades instead of attaching to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

HITL models may conform to [[human factors]] requirements as in the case of a [[mockup]].  In this type of simulation a human is always part of the simulation and consequently influences the outcome in such a way that is difficult if not impossible to reproduce exactly.  HITL also readily allows for the identification of problems and requirements that may not be easily identified by other means of simulation.

HITL is often referred to as interactive simulation, which is a special kind of physical simulation in which physical simulations include human operators, such as in a [[flight simulator|flight]] or a [[driving simulator]].

==Benefits==
Human-in-the-loop allows the user to change the outcome of an event or process.  HITL is extremely effective for the purposes of training because it allows the trainee to immerse themselves in the event or process  {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  The immersion effectively contributes to a positive transfer of acquired skills into the real world.  This can be demonstrated by trainees utilizing flight simulators in preparation to become pilots.

HITL also allows for the acquisition of knowledge regarding how a new process may affect a particular event. Utilizing HITL allows participants to interact with realistic models and attempt to perform as they would in an actual scenario. HITL simulations bring to the surface issues that would not otherwise be apparent until after a new process has been deployed.  A real-world example of HITL simulation as an evaluation tool is its usage by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) to allow air traffic controllers to test new automation procedures by directing the activities of simulated air traffic while monitoring the effect of the newly implemented procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Sollenberger, R. (2005). Human-in-the-Loop Simulation Evaluating the Collocation of the User Request Evaluation Tool. U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration, 1. Retrieved July 19, 2010, from http://hf.tc.faa.gov/technotes/dot-faa-ct-tn04-28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most processes, there is always the possibility of [[human error]], which can only be reproduced using HITL simulation.  Although much can be done to automate systems, humans typically still need to take the information provided by a system to determine the next course of action based on their judgment and experience. Intelligent systems can only go so far in certain circumstances to automate a process; only humans in the simulation can accurately judge the final design.  Tabletop simulation may be useful in the very early stages of project development for the purpose of collecting data to set broad parameters, but the important decisions require human-in-the-loop simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Human-in-the-loop simulation: (2007, Spring). Port Technology International, 32, 1-2. Retrieved July 19, 2010, from http://www.marinesafety.com/research/documents/HumanintheloopSimulationasPublishedinPortTechnologyInternationalIssue32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-in-the-loop simulation within virtual simulation taxonomy ==
Virtual simulations inject HITL in a central role by exercising [[motor control]] skills (e.g. flying an airplane), [[decision making]] skills (e.g. committing fire control resources to action), or [[communication skills]] (e.g. as members of a [[C4I]] team).

* [[Digital puppetry|Digital puppetry]]

==Misconceptions==
Although human-in-the-loop simulation can include a computer simulation in the form of a synthetic environment, computer simulation is not necessarily a form of human-in-the-loop simulation, and is often considered as human-out-of-the loop simulation. In this particular case, a computer model’s behavior is modified according to a set of initial parameters. The results of the model differ from the results stemming from a true human-in-the-loop simulation because the results can easily be replicated time and time again, by simply providing identical parameters.

icCube is a company founded in Switzerland that provides [[business intelligence]] software of the same name. The solution can be fully embedded as an integrated solution, can be hosted in a managed environment or installed locally, on premises.

The BI tool allows end-users to create or edit dashboards themselves and is capable of processing data from multiple sources in real-time. The solution distinguishes itself by making the dashboards, the dashboard builder, the schema/cube builder and the server monitoring application accessible from a browser only. No software has to be installed at the device of the end-user.

Next to the browser-based dashboard builder, data can be accessed by running queries directly on the OLAP cube using MDX, SQL or R.

== History ==
icCube sells an [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) server.

Starting in June 2010 with its first public community version (0.9.2). Since then, the company has released new versions multiple times per year.

== Architecture ==

icCube is implemented in [[Java programming language|Java]] and follows [[J2ee|J2EE]] standards. For the latter, it embeds both an [[Http|HTTP]] server ([[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]]) and a servlet container to handle all the communication tasks.

Being an in-memory OLAP server, the icCube server does not need to source its data from a RDBMS; any  [http://www.iccube.com/support/documentation/user_guide/schemas_cubes/datasources.html data source] that exposes its data in a tabular form can be used; several plugins exists for accessing files, HTTP stream, etc. Accessing datasource that expose JSON objects is also supported (e.g., MongoDB). icCube is then taking care of possibly complex relations (e.g., many-2-many) implied by the JSON structure.

Accessing icCube (cube modeling, server monitoring, MDX queries, Web reporting and dashboards) is performed through a unique Web interface.

The icCube OLAP server does not use any caching or pre-aggregation mechanism.

=== Interfaces ===

icCube uses  [[Multidimensional Expressions]] (MDX) as its query language and several extensions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/iccube/|title=Chris Webb on icCube MDX Declared Functions}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the original language : function declarations, vector (even at measures level), matrix, objects, Java and R interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccube.com/newsletter/release-2.5/|title=icCube extends MDX with OO capabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
icCube patented an MDX debugger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US8533218|title=Debugging system for multidimensional database query expressions on a processing server}}&lt;/ref&gt;
icCube supports a standard interface and a proprietary one.

'''Industrial Arts Curriculum Project''' (IACP) was established by Donald G. Lux and Willis Ray, the IACP project coordinators, to established an [[industrial arts]] curriculum concerned with the instructional representation of the structure of knowledge.  They placed their work within the classification of [[Praxiology|praxiological knowledge]], asserting that their quest was nothing less than to identify the knowledge base that underlies all practical and vocational arts subject areas.

This [[Joint venture|joint project]] between [[Ohio State University]] and [[University of Illinois system|the University of Illinois]] was initiated in June, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herschbach|first1=Dennis R.|title=Technology Education: Foundations and Perspectives|date=1990|publisher=American Technical Publishers, Inc|pages=86–90)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course Content==
The IACP was designed for 7th and 8th grade junior high grade levels (before the middle school transition), and had two year-long courses, "The World of Construction" and "The World of Manufacturing" (McKnight and McKnight Publishers, 1970). The concept was based on the idea that there is virtually nothing that people use on a daily basis that is not either constructed or manufactured, and that children should be taught the basis of those technologies at an early age to prevent "technological illiteracy."

===The World of Construction===
The World of Construction, commonly the 7th grade curriculum, taught students about how residential and commercial buildings are built. Students got a taste of woodworking, concrete, electrical and other construction trades. The final big project was to build a cross-section of a house in the traditional wood shop in the school.

===The World of Manufacturing===
In 8th grade, "The World of Manufacturing" was taught in the traditional metal shop of the school. Students learned about metal working crafts and trades, and as a culminating activity, set up an assembly line to create a number of items. (One of the items was a screwdriver, and whenever the students took them home, most of the screws in the school had been removed by the end of the day, causing maintenance headaches for caretakers.)

In 2005 KIBLA was with other partners again successful on EU-Culture 2000 and we finished 2 new projects, e-Agora,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagora.info European art project e-Agora]&lt;/ref&gt; which developed a virtual multimedia platform for innovative production and presentation of Performing Arts and will use the latest communication technologies (multi-user shared environments on the Internet) in order to interconnect European theatres, cultural centres, and enhance their co-operation, and TRG – Transient reality generators (http://fo.am/trg/), that focuses on the phenomenon of Mixed Reality (environments containing significant virtual and physical interaction possibilities, strongly intertwined) and examines the potential of synaesthetic MR experience design, in which the art-works become all-encompassing art-worlds. KIBLA was 3 years in a row (2001, 2002, 2003) the most successful Slovenian cultural institution and organisation internationally.

==Memberships and references==
Australian artist [[Stelarc]] has said for KIBLA »this is the best cyber space in the world,« the great Eduardo Kac, who works at the Art Institute of Chicago, »something like this doesn't exist in United States« and Joseph Tabby, university professor and writer, »I came to visit Slovenia, because I've heard about KIBLA.« A title in Slovenian magazine Mladina: »To Maribor, because of KIBLA!« and in NeDelo (the biggest Slovenian newspaper, Sunday issue) was written: »Maribor Kibla is by its space possibilities and its conceptual structure, that combines gallery, spaces for performance, specialised bookshop and cyber café undoubtedly the most exemplary project of a kind.« In Romanian newspaper CLUJENAUI was written »KIBLA is the most important and the biggest multimedia centre in Eastern Europe.« Dr. Janez Strehovec, the leading Slovenian new media theoretician, stated, »Kibla is the main Slovenian centre for new media art (and theory).« Artist, scientist, researcher and professor on the University Caxias do Sul, Brazil, dr.

'''Lilli Hornig''' (née '''Schwenk'''; March 22, 1921 – November 17, 2017) was a Czech-American scientist who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], as well as a feminist activist.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/science/donald-hornig-a-bomb-scientist-and-brown-president-dies-at-92.html?_r=0|title=Donald Hornig, Last to See First A-Bomb, Dies at 92|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manhattan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/lilli-hornigs-interview|title=Voices of the Manhattan Project, Lilli Hornig's Interview|website=Manhattanprojectvoices.org|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt;

==Early life==
Hornig was born in [[Ústí nad Labem]] in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.idnes.cz/lilli-hornig-usti-fat-man-nagasaki-dr4-/vojenstvi.aspx?c=A150805_193741_vojenstvi_kuz|title=Destrukce ji nepřekvapila. Rodačka z Ústí pracovala na bombě pro Nagasaki|date=6 August 2015|website=iDNES.cz|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Erwin Schwenk, an organic chemist, and the former Rascha Shapiro, a pediatrician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/obituaries/lilli-hornig-96-dies-a-bomb-researcher-lobbied-for-women-in-science.html|title=Lilli Hornig, 96, Dies; A-Bomb Researcher Lobbied for Women in Science|first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=27 November 2017|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 her family moved to Berlin. Four years later she and her mother came to the United States, following her father who had moved there to escape the Nazis.&lt;ref name=manhattan/&gt; As her parents were Jewish, her father was threatened with imprisonment in a concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/lilli-hornigs-interview|title=Lilli Hornig's Interview|website=Manhattanprojectvoices.org|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She obtained her BA from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] in 1942 and her Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=wesleyan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesconnect.wesleyan.edu/s/1318/images/editor_documents/women_of_wesleyan/hornig__lilli.pdf|title=Untitled|publisher=Wesconnect, Wesleyan University|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 she married [[Donald Hornig]].

==Career==
Hornig went with her husband to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] where he had obtained a job; after being originally asked to take a typing test, her scientific skills were recognized and she was given a job as a staff scientist for the [[Manhattan Project]], in a group working with plutonium chemistry.&lt;ref name=chemical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/hotarticles/cenear/950717/art02.html|title=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=July 17, 1995|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howes2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth H. Howes|title=Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys0N4rFgt6UC&amp;pg=PA85|date=April 1, 2003|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-192-1|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later it was decided that plutonium chemistry was too dangerous for women, and so she worked in high-explosive lenses instead. While at Los Alamos she signed a petition urging that the first atom bomb be used on an uninhabited island as a demonstration.&lt;ref name=chemical/&gt;

Hornig later became a chemistry professor at [[Brown University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/12/hornig|title=Lilli Hornig|last=|first=|date=|work=Brown University News|access-date=2018-01-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chairwoman of the chemistry department at [[Trinity Washington University|Trinity College]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trinitydc.edu/president/2017/12/dr-lilli-hornig-a-prophetic-voice/|title=Dr. Lilli Hornig: A Prophetic Voice {{!}} President's Office - Trinity Washington University|website=www.trinitydc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chemical/&gt; She was appointed by [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson]] as a member of a mission to the Republic of Korea that began the founding of the Korea Institute for Science and Technology.&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt;

A feminist, Hornig was the founding director of HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) under the auspices of the Committee for the Concerns of Women in New England Colleges and Universities first organized by Sheila Tobias.&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt; She served on equal opportunity committees for the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Cancer Institute]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. She was the research chair of the Committee for the Equality of Women at Harvard, and consulted with and participated in many studies of women's science education and careers.&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt;

Hornig was a Life Trustee of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and was a trustee of the [[Wheeler School]].&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt;

==Death==
Hornig died on November 17, 2017, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], aged 96.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/obituaries/lilli-hornig-96-dies-a-bomb-researcher-lobbied-for-women-in-science.html|title=Lilli Hornig, 96, Dies; A-Bomb Researcher Lobbied for Women in Science|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrahydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties are also found in other plants, such as ''[[Tropaeolum]]'' (nasturtium), ''[[Opuntia]]'' (prickly pear), ''[[Alchemilla]]'', cane, and also on the wings of certain insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darmanin|first1=Thierry|last2=Guittard|first2=Frédéric|title=Superhydrophobic and superoleophobic properties in nature|journal=Materials Today|date=1 June 2015|volume=18|issue=5|pages=273–285|doi=10.1016/j.mattod.2015.01.001|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702115000024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional principle==

The high surface tension of water causes droplets to assume a nearly spherical shape, since a sphere has minimal surface area, and this shape therefore demands least solid-liquid surface energy. On contact with a surface, adhesion forces result in [[wetting]] of the surface. Either complete or incomplete wetting may occur depending on the structure of the surface and the fluid tension of the droplet.&lt;ref name=Baeyer2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=von Baeyer |author2=H. C. |year = 2000|title = The Lotus Effect|journal = [[The Sciences]]|volume = 40|pages = 12–15|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cause of self-cleaning properties is the hydrophobic water-repellent double structure of the surface.&lt;ref name=Neinhuis1997&gt;{{cite journal|author = Neinhuis, C.|author2=Barthlott, W. |year = 1997 |title = Characterization and distribution of water-repellent, self-cleaning plant surfaces |journal = [[Annals of Botany]]|volume = 79|pages = 667–677|doi = 10.1006/anbo.1997.0400|issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables the contact area and the adhesion force between surface and droplet to be significantly reduced resulting in a self-cleaning process.&lt;ref name=Barthlott2001&gt;{{cite journal|first = Wilhelm|last = Barthlott|author2=Neinhuis, C. |year = 2001|title = The lotus-effect: nature's model for self cleaning surfaces|journal = [[International Textile Bulletin]]|volume = 1|pages = 8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2005&gt;{{cite book|author = Forbes, P.|year = 2005|title = The Gecko's Foot, Bio-inspiration – Engineering New Materials and devices from Nature|publisher = Fourth Estate|location = London|isbn = 978-0-00-717990-9|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2008&gt;{{cite journal|author = Forbes, P.|year = 2008|title = Self-Cleaning Materials|journal = [[Scientific American]]|volume = 299|issue = 2|pages = 67–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This hierarchical double structure is formed out of a characteristic epidermis (its outermost layer called the cuticle) and the covering waxes. The epidermis of the lotus plant possesses papillae with 10&amp;nbsp;µm to 20&amp;nbsp;µm in height and 10&amp;nbsp;µm to 15&amp;nbsp;µm in width on which the so-called epicuticular waxes are imposed. These superimposed waxes are hydrophobic and form the second layer of the double structure. This system regenerates. This bio-chemical property is responsible for the functioning of the water repellency of the surface.

The hydrophobicity of a surface can be measured by its [[contact angle]]. The higher the contact angle the higher the hydrophobicity of a surface. Surfaces with a contact angle &lt; 90° are referred to as hydrophilic and those with an angle &gt;90° as hydrophobic. Some plants show contact angles up to 160° and are called ultrahydrophobic, meaning that only 2–3% of the surface of a droplet (of typical size) is in contact. Plants with a double structured surface like the lotus can reach a contact angle of 170°, whereby the droplet's contact area is only 0.6%. All this leads to a self-cleaning effect.

Dirt particles with an extremely reduced contact area are picked up by water droplets and are thus easily cleaned off the surface. If a water droplet rolls across such a contaminated surface the adhesion between the dirt particle, irrespective of its chemistry, and the droplet is higher than between the particle and the surface. As this self-cleaning effect is based on the high surface tension of water it does not work with organic solvents. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of a surface is no protection against graffiti.

This effect is of a great importance for plants as a protection against [[pathogen]]s like [[fungus|fungi]] or [[algae]] growth, and also for animals like [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] and other insects not able to cleanse all their body parts.
Another positive effect of self-cleaning is the prevention of contamination of the area of a plant surface exposed to light resulting in reduced photosynthesis.

==Technical application==
When it was discovered that the self-cleaning qualities of ultrahydrophobic surfaces come from physical-chemical properties at the microscopic to nanoscopic scale rather than from the specific chemical properties of the leaf surface,&lt;ref name=Solga2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Solga, A. |author2=Cerman, Z. |author3=Striffler, B. F. |author4=Spaeth, M.  |author5=Barthlott, W.|year = 2007|title = The dream of staying clean: Lotus and biomimetic surfaces|journal = [[Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics]]|volume = 2|issue=4 |pages = S126–S134|doi=10.1088/1748-3182/2/4/S02|pmid=18037722 |citeseerx=10.1.1.477.693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Biomimetics, Design by Nature|journal = [[National Geographic Magazine]]|author = Mueller, T.|date = April 2008|pages = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Stable Biomimetic Super-Hydrophobic Engineering Materials|author = Guo, Z.|author2=Zhou, F. |author3=Hao, J. |author4=Liu, W. |journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|year = 2005|volume = 127|issue = 45|pages = 15670–15671|doi = 10.1021/ja0547836|pmid = 16277486}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery opened up the possibility of using this effect in  manmade surfaces, by mimicking nature in a general way rather than a specific one.

Some [[nanotechnology|nanotechnologists]] have developed treatments, coatings, paints, roof tiles, fabrics and other surfaces that can stay dry and clean themselves by replicating in a technical manner the self-cleaning properties of plants, such as the lotus plant. This can usually be achieved using special fluorochemical or silicone treatments on structured surfaces or with compositions containing micro-scale particulates.

In addition to chemical surface treatments, which can be removed over time, metals have been sculpted with femtosecond pulse lasers to produce the lotus effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vorobyev|first1=A. Y.|last2=Guo|first2=Chunlei|title=Multifunctional surfaces produced by femtosecond laser pulses|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=117|issue=3|pages=033103|doi=10.1063/1.4905616|bibcode = 2015JAP...117c3103V |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials are uniformly black at any angle, which combined with the self-cleaning properties might produce very low maintenance solar thermal energy collectors, while the high durability of the metals could be used for self-cleaning latrines to reduce disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borghino|first1=Dario|title=LAsers help create water-repelling, light-absorbing, self-cleaning metals|url=http://www.gizmag.com/water-repelling-metals/35701/|website=gizmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further applications have been marketed, such as self-cleaning glasses installed in the sensors of traffic control units on German autobahns developed by a cooperation partner (Ferro GmbH).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
The Swiss companies [[HeiQ]] and [http://www.schoeller-textiles.com/en.html Schoeller Textil] have developed stain-resistant textiles under the brand names "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160812113734/http://heiq.com/products/eco-dry/ HeiQ Eco Dry]" and "[http://www.schoeller-textiles.com/en/technologies/nanosphere.html nanosphere]" respectively. In October 2005, tests of the Hohenstein Research Institute showed that clothes treated with NanoSphere technology allowed tomato sauce, coffee and red wine to be easily washed away even after a few washes. Another possible application is thus with self-cleaning awnings, tarpaulins and sails, which otherwise quickly become dirty and difficult to clean.

Superhydrophobic coatings applied to microwave antennas can significantly reduce [[rain fade]] and the buildup of ice and snow. "Easy to clean" products in ads are often mistaken in the name of the self-cleaning properties of hydrophobic or ultrahydrophobic surfaces.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} Patterned ultrahydrophobic surfaces also show promise for "lab-on-a-chip" microfluidic devices and can greatly improve surface-based bioanalysis.&lt;ref name=Ressine2007&gt;{{cite book|author = Ressine, A.|author2=Marko-Varga, G. |author3=Laurell, T. |year = 2007|title = Porous silicon protein microarray technology and ultra-/superhydrophobic states for improved bioanalytical readout|volume = 13|pages = 149–200|doi = 10.1016/S1387-2656(07)13007-6|pmid = 17875477|series = Biotechnology Annual Review|isbn = 978-0-444-53032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superhydrophobic or hydrophobic properties have been used in dew harvesting, or the funneling of water to a basin for use in irrigation.  The [[Groasis Waterboxx]] has a lid with a microscopic pyramidal structure based on the ultrahydrophobic properties that funnel condensation and rainwater into a basin for release to a growing plant's roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.groasis.com/en/technology/the-different-forms-of-condensation | title=The different forms of condensation - Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research history==
Although the self-cleaning phenomenon of the lotus was possibly known in Asia long before (reference to the lotus effect is found in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'',&lt;ref name="BhagavadGita"&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/5/10/ Bhagavad Gita 5.10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910113030/http://vedabase.net/bg/5/10/ |date=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) its mechanism was explained only in the early 1970s after the introduction of the [[scanning electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=Barthlott1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2008/&gt; Studies were performed with leaves of ''[[Tropaeolum]]'' and lotus (''Nelumbo'').&lt;ref name=Barthlott1997/&gt; "The Lotus Effect" is a registered trademark of STO SE &amp; CO.

'''MicroTCA''' is an open standard embedded computing specification created by [[PICMG]].  First ratified in 2006, the specification utilizes the existing [[Advanced Mezzanine Card]] (AMCs) in a hot-swappable backplane format.  It features MicroTCA Carrier Hubs (MCHs) which provide IPMI-based shelf management and switching functionality to the system. MicroTCA systems provide up to 99.9999% uptime in a smaller form factor than 3U and 6U [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] systems.  A typical mid-sized 4HP AMC is 73.8mm x 18.96mm x 181.5mm.   There are also compact-sized AMCs at 3HP wide (13.88mm) and full-sized at 6HP wide (28.95mm).  Double modules have also been created, extending the height of the modules from 73.8mm to 148.8mm.  The architecture was originally designed for telecom applications, but MicroTCA has gained significant popularity in other applications including military/aerospace, railway, high-energy physics, and more.

MTCA.0 is the core specification, with MTCA.1 for Air Cooled Rugged MicroTCA with a rugged latching system, MTCA.3 for Hardened Conduction Cooled MicroTCA, and MTCA.4 for Rear I/O and Precision Clocking.  Although MicroTCA.4 is geared towards High Energy Physics, it is also used in other applications as a way to incorporate rear I/O and multi-channel A/D and D/A conversion. MTCA.4 is used in the [[DESY]] MicroTCA Lab and as the low-level radio-frequency control system for the [[XFEL]] experiments.

MicroTCA utilizes high-speed serial fabrics including [[Gigabit Ethernet]] (10GbE is ratified and 40GbE is in draft), [[PCIe]], [[Serial RapidIO]], etc.  Clock distribution is supported by the MCH with 3 clocks defined and an additional 4 clocks and AMC.0 R2 describes four additional clocks.

The '''Mifos Initiative''' is a U.S.-based non-profit that exists to support and collectively lead the open source Mifos X project. Founded in October 2011, the organization encompasses a community of financial service providers, technology specialists, financial services experts and open source developers working together to grow the [[MifosX|Mifos X]] open source platform for financial services. Its goal is to speed the elimination of poverty by enabling financial service providers to more effectively and efficiently deliver responsible financial services to the world's 2.5 billion poor and unbanked.

== History ==

===Initiated by Grameen Foundation===

Development of the software began as an initiative of the Grameen Foundation in 2004. At the Grameen Foundation, James Dailey and Tapan Parikh realized that the software being used by most microfinance institutions (MFIs) was outdated, expensive or otherwise fell short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2012/04/18/mifos-microfinance Microfinance: Why Open Source Means Bigger Impact]&lt;/ref&gt; James and Tapan brainstormed something new: an open-source software that launched as Mifos in 2006. The name "Mifos" originally came from an acronym "MIcro Finance Open Source", but is now used as the brand, rather than an acronym. Mifos existed within Grameen Foundation until 2011, when it was decided that Mifos would split off to be an independent, open-source entity.

===Transitioned to its own community===

On June 1, 2011, Grameen Foundation announced that it would be  ending its direct involvement with the Mifos Initiative and transitioning the project to its own organization, the Mifos Initiative, which now controls the Mifos and MIfos X projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mifos.org/community/news/grameen-foundation-transition-mifos-community-led-effort Grameen Foundation to Transition Mifos to Community-Led Effort]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mifos.org/ MIFOS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MifosX community includes developers, implementers, and users from various countries who collaborate through [https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOSX/Getting+started+-+Contributing+to+MifosX#Gettingstarted-ContributingtoMifosX-MifosXMailingLists mailing lists], [http://mifos.org/community/communications/mifos-irc IRC], and annual conferences.

=== Involvement ===

Every year, MifosX developers and users from around the world gather to help shape the vision for MifosX. The summit is open to the public and has conferences, exhibitions and other audience-oriented events. The 2012 summit was held in [[Bangalore]] and in 2013 it was held at [[Jaipur]] in the month of October. Held in Kuampala, Uganda, the 2014 Summit was a four-day event with a large focus on hands-on training for partners and users, collaborative tech sessions for contributors, &amp; educational sessions led by external experts from the fin-tech &amp; financial inclusion sector. It was Mifos' third annual summit, and aimed to expand and grow in the East African community.

MifosX has also participated in several other independent events. In 2013, Mifos has participated in [[Google Summer of Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/cosm |title=GSoC 2013 - COSM | publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Random Hacks of Kindness]] during RHoK Global December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/problems/connecting-clients-their-financial-data-integrating-sms-communications-mifos |title=Financial data integrating using sms communications | publisher=Random Hacks of Kindness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mifos has been part of . Mifos has also been a part of the FinDEVr San Francisco 2014 event, acting as a sponsor. One of Mifos' members, James Dailey (board member and Chief Innovation Officer), took the stage to discuss the reinvention of banking. On the first of November, Mifos Initiative also took part in the [http://www.alhudacibe.com/gimf2014/ Global Islamic Microfinance Forum], held in Dubai, UAE.

'''Mobile banking''' is a service provided by a [[bank]] or other [[financial institution]] that allows its customers to conduct [[financial transaction]]s remotely using a [[mobile device]] such as a [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer|tablet]]. Unlike the related [[internet banking]] it uses software, usually called an [[Mobile app|app]], provided by the financial institution for the purpose.  Mobile banking is usually available on a 24-hour basis.  Some financial institutions have restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through mobile banking, as well as a limit on the amount that can be transacted. Mobile banking is dependent on the availability of an internet or data connection to the mobile device.
 
Transactions through mobile banking depend on the features of the mobile banking app provided and typically includes obtaining account balances and lists of latest transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, remote check deposits, [[Peer-to-peer banking|P2P payments]], and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or another's [[deposit account|account]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=pB_6qEL5ppkC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=history+%22mobile+banking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXzdKl8ejdAhUO2o8KHaFsBZ8Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20%22mobile%20banking%22&amp;f=false|title=Mobile Banking|last=BBVA|first=|publisher=Centro de Innovación BBVA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some apps also enable copies of statements to be downloaded and sometimes printed at the customer's premises.
 
From the bank's point of view, mobile banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a [[Branch (banking)|bank branch]] for non-cash withdrawal and deposit transactions. Mobile banking does not handle transactions involving cash, and a customer needs to visit an [[automated teller machine|ATM]] or bank branch for cash withdrawals or deposits.  Many apps now have a [[remote deposit]] option; using the device's [[Camera phone|camera]] to digitally transmit cheques to their financial institution.
 
Mobile banking differs from [[mobile payment]]s, which involves the use of a mobile device to pay for goods or services either at the [[point of sale]] or remotely,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpmg.com/GE/en/Insightmagazine/Documents/Monetizing_mobile_report_ENG.pdf/ KPMG “Monetizing Mobile” July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; analogously to the use of a debit or credit card to effect an [[EFTPOS]] payment.

== History ==
The earliest mobile banking services used [[SMS]], a service known as [[SMS banking]]. With the introduction of [[smart phones]] with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] support enabling the use of the [[mobile web]] in 1999, the first European banks started to offer mobile banking on this platform to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |title = The World's first WAP Bank is Norwegian |publisher = itavisen.no |date = 1999-09-24 |accessdate = 2010-10-18 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504023854/http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |archivedate = 4 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile banking before 2010 was most often performed via SMS or the [[mobile web]].  [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] initial success with [[iPhone]] and the rapid growth of phones based on [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)]] have led to increasing use of special [[mobile app]]s, downloaded to the mobile device.  With that said, advancements in web technologies such as [[HTML5]], [[CSS3]] and [[JavaScript]] have seen more banks launching mobile web based services to complement native applications. These applications are consisted of a [[web application]] module in [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] such as [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|J2EE]] and functions of another module [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|J2ME]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving: SocProS 2014, Volume 2|last=Das|first=Kedar|last2=Deep|first2=Kusum|last3=Pant|first3=Millie|last4=Bansal|first4=Jagdish|last5=Nagar|first5=Atulya|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9788132222194|location=Heidelberg|pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A recent study (May 2012) by Mapa Research suggests that over a third of banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |title = A third of banks have mobile detection |publisher = Mapa Research |date = 2012-05-16 |accessdate = 2012-05-16 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130128181645/http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |archivedate = 28 January 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have mobile device detection upon visiting the banks' main website. A number of things can happen on mobile detection such as redirecting to an app store, redirection to a mobile banking specific website or providing a menu of mobile banking options for the user to choose from.

== A mobile banking conceptual ==
In one academic model,&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari and Buse, 2007, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; mobile banking is defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mobile Banking refers to provision and availment of banking- and financial services with the help of mobile telecommunication devices.The scope of offered services may include facilities to conduct bank and stock market transactions, to administer accounts and to access customised information."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this model mobile banking can be said to consist of three inter-related concepts:

* Mobile accounting
* Mobile brokerage
* Mobile financial information services

Most services in the categories designated ''[[accounting]]'' and ''[[brokerage]]'' are transaction-based. The non-transaction-based services of an informational nature are however essential for conducting transactions - for instance, balance inquiries might be needed before committing a money remittance. The accounting and brokerage services are therefore offered invariably in combination with information services. Information services, on the other hand, may be offered as an independent module.'''

Mobile banking may also be used to help in business situations as well as financial

== Mobile banking services ==
Typical mobile banking services may include:

===Account information===
# Mini-statements and checking of account history
# Alerts on account activity or passing of set thresholds
# Monitoring of term deposits
# Access to loan statements
# Access to card statements
# [[Mutual fund]]s / equity statements
# Insurance policy management

===Transaction===
# [[Giro|Funds transfers]] between the customer's linked accounts
# Paying third parties, including [[Electronic bill payment|bill payments]] and third party [[Electronic fund transfer|fund transfers]](see, e.g., [[Fast And Secure Transfers|FAST]]) 
# [[Remote deposit|Check Remote Deposit]]

===Investments===
# Portfolio management services
# Real-time stock

===Support===
# Status of requests for credit, including mortgage approval, and insurance coverage
# Check (cheque) book and card requests
# Exchange of data messages and email, including complaint submission and tracking
# ATM Location

===Content services===
# General information such as weather updates, news
# [[Loyalty program|Loyalty-related]] offers
# [[Location-based service]]s

A report by the US Federal Reserve (March 2012) found that 21 percent of mobile phone owners had used mobile banking in the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/mobile-device-report-201203.pdf Federal Reserve Board, "Consumers and Mobile Financial Services," March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey conducted by Forrester, mobile banking will be attractive mainly to the younger, more "tech-savvy" customer segment. A third of mobile phone users say that they may consider performing some kind of financial transaction through their mobile phone. But most of the users are interested in performing basic transactions such as querying for account balance and making bill

===Future functionalities in mobile banking===
Based on the 'International Review of Business Research Papers' from World business Institute, Australia, following are the key functional trends possible in world of Mobile Banking.
With the advent of technology and increasing use of smartphone and tablet based devices, the use of Mobile Banking functionality would enable customer connect across entire customer life cycle much comprehensively than before.

Illustration of objective based functionality enrichment In Mobile Banking:
* Communication enrichment: - Video Interaction with agents, advisors.
* Pervasive Transactions capabilities: - Comprehensive “Mobile wallet”
* Customer Education: - “Test drive” for demos of banking services
* Connect with new customer segment: - Connect with Gen Y – Gen Z using games and social network ambushed to surrogate bank’s offerings
* Content monetization: - Micro level revenue themes such as music, e-book download
* Vertical positioning: - Positioning offerings over mobile banking specific industries
* Horizontal positioning: - Positioning offerings over mobile banking across all the industries
* Personalization of corporate banking services: - Personalization experience for multiple roles and hierarchies in corporate banking as against the vanilla based segment based enhancements in the current context.
* Build Brand: - Built the bank’s brand while enhancing the “Mobile real estate”.

==Challenges for a mobile banking solution==

Key challenges in developing a sophisticated mobile banking application are :

===Handset accessibility===

There are a large number of different mobile phone devices and it is a big challenge for banks to offer a mobile banking solution on any type of device. Some of these devices support [[Java ME]] and others support [[SIM Application Toolkit]], a WAP browser, or only [[SMS]].

Initial interoperability issues however have been localized, with countries like India using portals like "R-World" to enable the limitations of low end java based phones, while focus on areas such as South Africa have defaulted to the [[USSD]] as a basis of communication achievable with any phone.

The desire for interoperability is largely dependent on the banks themselves, where installed applications(Java based or native) provide better security, are easier to use and allow development of more complex capabilities similar to those of internet banking while SMS can provide the basics but becomes difficult to operate with more complex transactions.

There is a myth that there is a challenge of interoperability between mobile banking applications due to perceived lack of common technology standards for mobile banking. In practice it is too early in the service lifecycle for interoperability to be addressed within an individual country, as very few countries have more than one mobile banking service provider. In practice, banking interfaces are well defined and money movements between banks follow the IS0-8583 standard. As mobile banking matures, money movements between service providers will naturally adopt the same standards as in the banking world.

In January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) Banking Sub-Committee, chaired by CellTrust and VeriSign Inc., published the Mobile Banking Overview for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Mobile Channel Platforms such as Short Message Services ([[SMS]]), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044330/http://mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===

As with most internet-connected devices, as well as mobile-telephony devices, [[cybercrime]] rates are escalating year-on-year. The types of cybercrimes which may affect mobile-banking might range from unauthorized use while the owner is using the mobile banking, to remote-hacking, or even jamming or interference via the internet or telephone network data streams. This is demonstrated by the [[malware]] called ''SMSZombie.A'', which infected Chinese Android devices. It was embedded in wallpaper apps and installed itself so it can exploit the weaknesses of China Mobile SMS Payment system, stealing banks credit card numbers and information linked to financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Automated Enterprise Systems for Maximizing Business Performance|last=Papajorgji|first=Petraq|last2=Pinet|first2=Francois|last3=Guimaraes|first3=Alaine|last4=Papathanasiou|first4=Jason|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466688414|location=Hershey, PA|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most advanced malwares discovered recently was the [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] called ''Bankbot''. It went past Google's protections in its Android app marketplace and targeted [[Wells Fargo]], [[Chase Bank|Chase]], and [[Citibank]] customers on Android devices worldwide before its removal by Google in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/bankbot-android-malware-sneaks-into-the-google-play-store-for-the-third-time/|title=BankBot Android malware sneaks into the Google Play Store - for the third time {{!}} ZDNet|last=Palmer|first=Danny|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This malicious app was activated when users opened a banking app, overlaying it so it can steal banking credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digitalguardian.com/blog/mobile-banking-trojan-bankbot-identified-removed-google-play|title=Mobile Banking Trojan BankBot Identified, Removed From Google Play|last=Brook|first=Chris|date=2017-11-21|work=Digital Guardian|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{see also|Mobile security}}In the banking world, currency rates may change by the millisecond.
Security of financial transactions, being executed from some remote location and transmission of financial information over the air, are the most complicated challenges that need to be addressed jointly by mobile application developers, wireless network service providers and the banks' IT departments.

The following aspects need to be addressed to offer a secure infrastructure for financial transaction over wireless network :

# Physical part of the hand-held device. If the bank is offering smart-card based security, the physical security of the device is more important.
# Security of any thick-client application running on the device. In case the device is stolen, the hacker should require at least an ID/Password to access the application.
# [[Authentication]] of the device with service provider before initiating a transaction. This would ensure that unauthorized devices are not connected to perform financial transactions.
# User ID / Password [[authentication]] of bank’s customer.
# [[Encryption]] of the data being transmitted over the air.
# [[Encryption]] of the data that will be stored in device for later / off-line analysis by the customer.

[[One-time password]] (OTPs) are the latest tool used by financial and banking service providers in the fight against [[cyber fraud]].&lt;ref name="otp"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104955/http://www.mobilepaymentsworld.com/mobile-payments/issue-pdfs/MPW_Q1_07_screen.pdf], Mobile payments&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of relying on traditional memorized passwords, OTPs are requested by consumers each time they want to perform transactions using the online or mobile banking interface. When the request is received the password is sent to the consumer’s phone via SMS. The password is expired once it has been used or once its scheduled life-cycle has expired.

Because of the concerns made explicit above, it is extremely important that [[SMS gateway]] providers can provide a decent quality of service for banks and financial institutions in regards to [[SMS]] services. Therefore, the provision of [[service level agreements]] (SLAs) is a requirement for this industry; it is necessary to give the bank customer delivery guarantees of all messages, as well as measurements on the speed of delivery, throughput, etc. SLAs give the service parameters in which a messaging solution is guaranteed to perform.

===Scalability and reliability===
Another challenge for the [[chief information officer|CIO]]s and [[chief technical officer|CTO]]s of the banks is to scale-up the mobile banking infrastructure to handle exponential growth of the customer base. With mobile banking, the customer may be sitting in any part of the world (true anytime, anywhere banking) and hence banks need to ensure that the systems are up and running in a true 24 x 7 fashion. As customers will find mobile banking more and more useful, their expectations from the solution will increase. Banks unable to meet the performance and reliability expectations may lose customer confidence. There are systems such as [[Mobile Transaction Platform]] which allow quick and secure mobile enabling of various banking services. Recently in India there has been a phenomenal growth in the use of Mobile Banking applications, with leading banks adopting Mobile Transaction Platform and the [[Reserve Bank of India|Central Bank]] publishing guidelines for mobile banking operations.

===Application distribution===
Due to the nature of the connectivity between bank and its customers, it would be impractical to expect customers to regularly visit banks or connect to a web site for regular upgrade of their mobile banking application. It will be expected that the mobile application itself check the upgrades and updates and download necessary patches (so called "Over The Air" updates). However, there could be many issues to implement this approach such as upgrade / synchronization of other dependent components.

'''User adoption'''

It should be noted that studies have shown that a huge concerning factor of having mobile banking more widely used, is a banking customer's unwillingness to adapt. Many consumers, whether they are misinformed or not, do not want to begin using mobile banking for several reasons. These can include the learning curve associated with new technology, having fears about possible security compromises, just simply not wanting to start using technology, etc.

===Personalization===

It would be expected from the mobile application to support personalization such as :
# Preferred Language
# Date / Time format
# Amount format
# Default transactions
# Standard Beneficiary list
# Alerts

African nations such as Kenya would rank highly if SMS mobile banking were included in the above list. Kenya has 38% of the population as subscribers to M-Pesa as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa_timeline/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Though as of 2016 mobile banking applications have seen a tremendous growth in kenyan banking sector who have capitalised on android play store and apple store to put their applications. Kenyan banks like [[Equity Bank Kenya Limited]] Eazzy banking application and [[The Co-operative Bank]] Mco-op cash application have proved to be a success mobile banking applications.

Mobile banking is used in many parts of the world with little or no infrastructure, especially remote and rural areas. This aspect of [[mobile commerce]] is also popular in countries where most of their population is [[unbanked]]. In most of these places, banks can only be found in big cities, and customers have to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest bank.

In Iran, banks such as [[Parsian Bank|Parsian]], [[Tejarat Bank|Tejarat]], [[Bank Pasargad|Pasargad Bank]], [[Mellat Bank|Mellat]], Saderat, [[Sepah Bank|Sepah]], Edbi, and Bankmelli offer the service. Banco Industrial provides the service in Guatemala.  Citizens of Mexico can access mobile banking with Omnilife, [[Bancomer]] and MPower Venture.
[[Kenya]]'s [[Safaricom]] (part of the [[Vodafone Group]]) has the [[M-Pesa]] Service, which is mainly used to transfer limited amounts of money, but increasingly used to pay utility bills as well. In 2009, [[Zain Group|Zain]] launched their own mobile money transfer business, known as ZAP, in Kenya and other African countries. Several other players in Kenya such as Tangerine, [[MobiKash]] and [[Funtrench Limited]] also have network-independent mobile money transfer. In [[Somalia]], the many telecom companies provide mobile banking, the most prominent being [[Hormuud Telecom]] and its [[Hormuud Telecom#ZAAD service|ZAAD]] service.

[[Telenor Pakistan]] has also launched a mobile banking solution, in coordination with Taameer Bank, under the label Easy Paisa, which was begun in Q4 2009.  [[Eko India Financial Services]], the business correspondent of [[State Bank of India]] (SBI) and [[ICICI Bank]], provides bank accounts, deposit, withdrawal and remittance services, [[micro-insurance]], and [[micro-finance]] facilities to its customers (nearly 80% of whom are migrants or the unbanked section of the population) through mobile banking.&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/opinion/03friedman.html?_r=3&amp;hp|title=Do Believe the Hype|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Friedman|date=November 2, 2010|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a year of 2010, mobile banking users soared over 100 percent in [[Kenya]], China, [[Brazil]] and United States with 200 percent, 150 percent, 110 percent and 100 percent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/49148.php Mobile Banking Surges As Emerging Markets Embrace Mobile Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dutch Bangla Bank]] launched the very first mobile banking service in [[Bangladesh]] on 31 March 2011. This service is launched with 'Agent' and 'Network' support from mobile operators, [[Banglalink]] and [[Citycell]]. [[Sybase#Products|Sybase 365]], a subsidiary of [[Sybase|Sybase, Inc]]. has provided software solution with their local partner Neurosoft Technologies Ltd. There are around 160 million people in Bangladesh, of which, only 13 per cent have bank accounts. With this solution, Dutch-Bangla Bank can now reach out to the rural and unbanked population, of which, 45 per cent are mobile phone users. Under the service, any mobile handset with subscription to any of the six existing mobile operators of Bangladesh would be able to utilize the service. Under the mobile banking services, bank-nominated [[Banking agent]] performs banking activities on its behalf, like opening mobile banking accounts, providing cash services (receipts and payments) and dealing with small credits. Cash withdrawal from a mobile account can also be done from an ATM validating each transaction by 'mobile phone &amp; PIN' instead of 'card &amp; PIN'. Other services that are being delivered through mobile banking system are person-to-person (e.g. fund transfer), person-to-business (e.g. merchant payment, utility bill payment), business-to-person (e.g. salary/commission disbursement), government-to-person (disbursement of government allowance) transactions.

In May 2012, [[Laxmi Bank Limited]] launched the very first mobile banking in [[Nepal]] with its product [[Mobile Khata]]. Mobile Khata currently runs on a third-party platform called [[Hello Paisa]] that is interoperable with all the telecoms in Nepal viz. [[Nepal Telecom]], [[NCell]], [[Smart Tel]] and UTL, and is also interoperable with various banks in the country. The initial joining members to the platform after [[Laxmi Bank Limited]] were Siddartha Bank, Bank of Kathmandu, Commerz and Trust Bank Nepal and International Leasing and Finance Company. In country with roughly 30 million population, over 5 million have subscribed to mobile banking in Nepal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.khalti.com/fintech-trends/mobile-banking-in-nepal/|title=Over 5 Million Use Mobile Banking In Nepal|last=|first=|date=6 November 2018|website=Khalti Digital Wallet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the recent data from [[Nepal Rastra Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nrb.org.np/bfr/statistics/cms_pdf/Bhadau_2075(Mid%20Sep%202018).pdf|title=Nepal Rastra Bank Monthly Statistics|last=|first=|date=6 November 2018|website=Nepal Rastra Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the central bank of Nepal.

[[Barclays]] offers a service called [[Barclays Pingit]], and [[Hello Money]] offering services in Africa, allowing transfer of money from the United Kingdom to many parts of the world with a mobile phone. [[Pingit]] is owned by a consortium of banks. In April 2014, the UK [[Payments Council]] launched the [[Paym]] mobile payment system, allowing mobile payments between customers of several banks and building societies using the recipient's mobile phone number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paym overview|url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/mobile_payments/overview_of_paym/|publisher=Payments Council|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nov 2017 the [[State Bank of India]] launched an integrated banking platform in India called [[YONO]] offering conventional banking functions but also payment services for things such as online shopping, travel planning, taxi booking or online education. &lt;ref name = "news_HinduBusinessLine_20171123_a"&gt;{{cite news|title=SBI launches YONO, an integrated app for financial services|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/sbi-launches-yono-an-integrated-app-for-financial-services/article9970915.ece|accessdate=24 November 2017|publisher=Business Line, The Hindu|date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NCR 53C9x''' is a family of application-specific integrated circuits ([[ASIC]]) produced by the former [[NCR Corporation]] and others for implementing the [[SCSI]] (small computer standard interface) bus protocol in hardware and relieving the host system of the work required to sequence the SCSI bus.  The 53C9x was a low-cost solution and was therefore widely adopted by [[OEM]]s in various [[motherboard]] and peripheral device designs.  The original 53C90 lacked [[direct memory access]] (DMA) capability, an omission that was addressed in the 53C90A and subsequent versions.

The 53C90(A) supported the [[SCSI-1]] protocol, implemented the eight bit parallel SCSI bus, and eight bit host data bus transfers.  The 53C94 added [[SCSI-2]] features to those of the 53C90A, and the 53C96 added support for the [[differential signaling|high voltage differential]] (HVD) parallel bus.  The 53CF94 and 53CF96 also implemented larger transfer sizes and 20 MB/second synchronous SCSI bus speed (the so-called [[Ultra SCSI#SCSI-3|ultra-SCSI]] protocol).  All members of the 53C94/96 type support both eight and 16 bit host bus transfers via [[programmed input/output]] (PIO) and DMA.&lt;ref&gt;AMD publication 17348, revision B, May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[QLogic]] FAS216 and [[Emulex]] ESP100 chips are a drop-in replacement for the NCR 53C94.  The 53C90A and 53C(F)94/96 were also produced under license by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD).&lt;ref&gt;AMD publication 17348, revision B, May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of systems which included the 53C9x controller includes:

'''53C94'''

*[[Sun Microsystems]] [[SPARCstation]]s and the SPARCclassic
*[[DEC 3000 AXP]]
*[[DECstation]]s and the PMAZ-A [[TURBOchannel]] card

==Casio G'zOne==
In the United States and Japan, NEC Casio Mobile also manufactures phones under the ''Casio G'zOne'' brand. This device line with a small cosmetic differences and RF firmware adoption were also sold in the Republic of Korea. Then widely spread around the world (including non-official sales from the US and Korea) due to the rare IP68 protective design and close to outstanding hardware specs of some models like Commando C811 / CA-201L at the moment of the release.

==Name changing==
As of October 1, 2014, NEC Casio Mobile Communications, announced that its official name is now NEC Mobile Communications.
Since then, official site is now: https://web.archive.org/web/20160223105020/http://www.nec-mobilecom.com/
Old NEC Casio site https://web.archive.org/web/20140926071701/http://www.nec-casio-mobile.com/ (and all its software/updates domains) were closed in the February 2015.
It seems that company simply dropped support for all the popular and not so old NEC Casio models released just in a 2013-2014.
Previously, in 2013 NEC planned to close smartphone production in 2014, leaving in production the conventional mobile phones and the tablets.

==End of life==
As of January 1, 2016, NEC Mobile Communications seems to be completely gone from the mobile phone market. Official web site is completely closed. Any support abandoned. Users left alone with their devices.

'''Nanosensors''' are [[sensor]]s whose active elements include [[nanomaterials]]. There are several ways being proposed today to make nanosensors; these include [[Top-down and bottom-up design#top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly|top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly]], and [[molecular self-assembly]].&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Foster LE |title= Medical Nanotechnology: Science, Innovation, and Opportunity |place=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-13-192756-6 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Nanomaterials-based sensors have several benefits in [[sensitivity and specificity]] over sensors made from traditional materials. Nanosensors can have increased specificity because they operate at a similar scale as natural biological processes, allowing functionalization with chemical and biological molecules, with recognition events that cause detectable physical changes. Enhancements in sensitivity stem from the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials, as well as novel physical properties of nanomaterials that can be used as the basis for detection, including [[nanophotonics]]. Nanosensors can also potentially be integrated with [[nanoelectronics]] to add native processing capability to the nanosensor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nano.gov/node/100|title=Nanotechnology-Enabled Sensing|last=|first=|date=2009|website=National Nanotechnology Initiative|pages=4–10|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One-dimensional nanomaterials such as [[Nanowire|nanowires]] and [[Nanotube|nanotubes]] are well suited for use in nanosensors, as compared to bulk or [[Thin film|thin-film]] planar devices.  They can function both as transducers and wires to transmit the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/tb/c7tb01557g#!divAbstract |title= Highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection of a prostate cancer biomarker |year=2017 |last1= Juzgado |first1=A. |last2= Solda |first2=A. |last3=Ostric |first3=A. |last4=Criado |first4=A. |last5=Valenti |first5=G. |last6=Rapino |first6=S. |last7=Conti |first7=G. |last8=Fracasso |first8=G. | |last9=Paolucci |first9=F. ||last10=Prato |first10=M. |journal= J. Mater. Chem. B |volume=5 |pages=6681 | |doi=10.1039/c7tb01557g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their high surface area can cause large signal changes upon binding of an analyte.  Their small size can enable extensive [[multiplexing]] of individually addressable sensor units in a small device.  Their operation is also "label free" in the sense of not requiring fluorescent or radioactive labels on the analytes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are several challenges for nanosensors, including avoiding [[fouling]] and drift, developing reproducible calibration methods, applying preconcentration and separation methods to attain a proper analyte concentration that avoids saturation, and integrating the nanosensor with other elements of a sensor package in a reliable manufacturable manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Potential applications for nanosensors include medicine; detection of contaminants and pathogens in the workplace, the environment, for [[first responder]]s, and in products such as food; and monitoring manufacturing processes and equipment and transportation systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Medicinal uses of nanosensors mainly revolve around the potential of nanosensors to accurately identify particular cells or places in the body in need. By measuring changes in [[volume]], [[concentration]], [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] and [[velocity]], [[Gravitational force|gravitational]], [[Electric field|electrical]], and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] forces, [[pressure]], or [[temperature]] of cells in a body, nanosensors may be able to distinguish between and recognize certain cells, most notably those of [[cancer]], at the molecular level in order to deliver medicine or monitor development to specific places in the body.&lt;ref name="F2"&gt;{{cite book|date=1999|title=Nanomedicine, Volume 1: Basic Capabilities|place=Austin |publisher=Landes Bioscience|isbn=1-57059-680-8|author=Freitas Jr. RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of operation ==
There are many mechanisms by which a recognition event can be [[Transducer|transduced]] into a measurable signal.  Electrochemical nanosensors are based on detecting a [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] change in the nanomaterial upon binding of an analyte, due to changes in [[scattering]] or to the depletion or accumulation of [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]].  One possibility is to use nanowires such as [[Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor|carbon nanotubes]], [[Conductive polymer|conductive polymers]], or metal oxide nanowires as gates in [[Field-effect transistor|field-effect transistors]], although as of 2009 they had not yet been demonstrated in real-world conditions.  Other examples include electromagnetic or [[Plasmonics|plasmonic]] nanosensors, spectroscopic nanosensors such as [[surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]], magnetoelectronic or [[Spintronics|spintronic]] nanosensors, and mechanical nanosensors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nano.gov/node/100|title=Nanotechnology-Enabled Sensing|last=|first=|date=2009|website=National Nanotechnology Initiative|pages=12–26|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the first working examples of a synthetic nanosensor was built by researchers at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="F6"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Poncharal P|author2= Wang ZL|author3= Ugarte D|author4= de Heer WA|title= Electrostatic Deflections and Electromechanical Resonances of Carbon Nanotubes |journal= Science |volume=283|pages=1513–1516|date=1999 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved attaching a single particle onto the end of a [[carbon nanotube]] and measuring the [[resonance|vibrational frequency]] of the nanotube both with and without the particle. The discrepancy between the two frequencies allowed the researchers to measure the mass of the attached particle.&lt;ref name="F1" /&gt;

Chemical sensors, too, have been built using [[Chemiresistor#Carbon nanotubes|nanotubes]] to detect various properties of gaseous molecules. Carbon nanotubes have been used to sense [[ionization]] of gaseous molecules while nanotubes made out of titanium have been employed to detect atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="F7"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Modi A|author2=Koratkar N|author3=Lass E|author4= Wei B|author5=Ajayan PM|title= Miniaturized Gas Ionization Sensors using Carbon Nanotubes|journal= Nature |volume=424|pages=171–174|date=2003|doi=10.1038/nature01777|pmid=12853951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F8"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kong J|author2= Franklin NR|author3= Zhou C|author4= Chapline MG|author5= Peng S|author6=  Cho K|author7=  Dai H.|title= Nanotubes Molecular Wires as Chemical Sensors |journal= Science |volume=287 |issue=5453 |pages=622–625|date=2000 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these involve a system by which nanosensors are built to have a specific pocket for another molecule. .When that particular molecule, and only that specific molecule, fits into the nanosensor, and light is shone upon the nanosensor, it will reflect different wavelengths of light and, thus, be a different color.&lt;ref name="F3"&gt;{{cite book|date=2003|title=Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea|place=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Prentice Hall]|isbn=0-13-101400-5|author=Ratner MA|author2=Ratner D|author3=Ratner M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, Flood et al. have shown that [[supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] host-guest chemistry offers quantitative sensing using [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman scattered light]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Determination of Binding Strengths of a Host-Guest Complex Using Resonance Raman Scattering |first9=Amar H. |last9=Flood |first8=Lasse |last8=Jensen |first7=Eric W. |last7=Wong |first6=Jan O. |last6=Jeppesen |first5=Sune D. |last5=Nygaard |first4=Thomas S. |last4=Hansen |first3=Martin |last3=Christensen |first2=Stinne W. |last2=Hansen |first1=Edward H. |last1=Witlicki  |date=2009 |volume=113 |pages=9450–9457 |doi=10.1021/jp905202x |journal=[[J. Phys. Chem. A]] |issue=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy|SERS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Turning on Resonant SERRS Using the Chromophore-Plasmon Coupling Created by Host-Guest Complexation at a Plasmonic Nanoarray |first7=Amar H. |last7=Flood |first6=Lasse |last6=Jensen |first5=Eric W. |last5=Wong |first4=Jan O. |last4=Jeppesen |first3=Stinne W. |last3=Hansen |first2=Sissel S. |last2=Andersen |first1=Edward H. |last1=Witlicki  |journal=[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] |date=2010 |volume=132 |pages=6099–6107 |doi=10.1021/ja910155b |issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanophotonics|Photonic]] devices can also be used as nanosensors to quantify concentrations of clinically relevant samples. A principle of operation of these sensors is based on the chemical modulation of a [[hydrogel]] film volume that incorporates a Bragg grating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yetisen AK|author2= Montelongo Y|author3= Vasconcellos FC|author4= Martinez-Hurtado JL|author5= Neupane S|author6= Butt H|author7= Qasim MM|author8= Blyth J|author9= Burling K|author10= Carmody JB|author11= Evans M|author12= Wilkinson TD|author13= Kubota LT|author14= Monteiro MJ|author15= Lowe CR|title= Reusable, Robust, and Accurate Laser-Generated Photonic Nanosensor |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=3587–3593 |journal=[[Nano Lett.]]|date=2014 |doi=10.1021/nl5012504 |pmid=24844116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the hydrogel swells or shrinks upon chemical stimulation, the Bragg grating changes color and diffracts light at different wavelengths. The diffracted light can be correlated with the concentration of a target analyte.

One example of nanosensors involves using the fluorescence properties of [[cadmium selenide]] [[quantum dot]]s as sensors to uncover tumors within the body. A downside to the cadmium selenide dots, however, is that they are highly toxic to the body. As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less toxic material while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells.&lt;ref name="F3" /&gt;

==Production methods==
There are currently several hypothesized ways to produce nanosensors. Top-down lithography is the manner in which most integrated circuits are now made. It involves starting out with a larger block of some material and carving out the desired form. These carved out devices, notably put to use in specific [[MEMS sensor generations|microelectromechanical systems]] used as microsensors, generally only reach the [[microscopic scale|micro]] size, but the most recent of these have begun to incorporate nanosized components.&lt;ref name="F1" /&gt;

Another way to produce nanosensors is through the bottom-up method, which involves assembling the sensors out of even more minuscule components, most likely individual [[atoms]] or molecules. This would involve moving atoms of a particular substance one by one into particular positions which, though it has been achieved in laboratory tests using tools such as [[atomic force microscope]]s, is still a significant difficulty, especially to do en masse, both for logistic reasons as well as economic ones. Most likely, this process would be used mainly for building starter molecules for self-assembling sensors.

The third way, which promises far faster results, involves self-assembly, or "growing" particular nanostructures to be used as sensors. This most often entails an already complete set of components that would automatically assemble themselves into a finished product. Accurately being able to reproduce this effect for a desired sensor in a laboratory would imply that scientists could manufacture nanosensors much more quickly and potentially far more cheaply by letting numerous molecules assemble themselves with little or no outside influence, rather than having to manually assemble each sensor.

The '''Presidential Communications Group''' or simply the '''Communications Group''', is the collective name for the newly formed{{when|date=November 2018}} offices within the [[Office of the President of the Philippines]] and refers to the following positions and offices: the Presidential Spokesperson and the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO)—formerly the Office of the Press Secretary.

The Communications Group is primarily responsible for planning, programming, and coordinating the activities that will most effectively collect information about what is happening in the Executive branch of the government, and getting this information to the [[Mass media|media]]. The Group's other role is to help Filipinos understand government policies and programs, and to shore up support for them.

==Presidential Spokesperson==
[[File:Ph seal office of presidential spokesperson (English).png|right|110px]]
The Presidential Spokesperson speaks on behalf of the President about matters of public interest. Considering the restricted level of access that the media has to the Chief Executive, the Spokesperson is expected to be the primary source of presidential directives in the absence of the President of the Philippines.

The Presidential Spokesperson is not subject to confirmation by the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]], and does not have any specific item or template in government.

The current Presidential Spokesperson is [[Salvador Panelo]] (who succeeded [[Harry Roque]]) while the Assistant to the Presidential Spokesperson is [[China Jocson]] of the [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte Administration]].

==Presidential Communications Operations Office==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PCOO-logo.png|Presidential Communications Operations Seal|right|110px]] --&gt;

The Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) is in charge of disseminating the government’s message to private media entities. It exercises supervision and control over state-owned media entities to disseminate the official messages properly and effectively in accordance with the communications plan. It is responsible for the accreditation and authentication of the credentials of foreign media correspondents in line with its primary task to cultivate relations and assist private media entities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/08/09/briefing-on-presidential-communications-reforms/&lt;/ref&gt; During the administration of [[Benigno Aquino III]], the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) was named the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO).

The PCOO head holds a cabinet rank. He/she is assisted by an undersecretary for administration and finance, an undersecretary for operations, a chief of staff, an assistant secretary for legislative affairs, and an electronic data processing division chief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/07/30/executive-order-no-4/&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCOO is composed of the following units and agencies:
* News and Information Bureau
* [[Philippines News Agency]]
* [[Philippine Information Agency]]
* [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]
* [[People's Television Network]]
* [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] - Bureau of Broadcast Services (Radyo Pilipinas)
* PBS-Radio-Television Malacañang
* Bureau of Communications Services
* National Printing Office
* APO Production Unit
* OP Web Development Office (commonly referred to as the President's New Media Team)
* Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office (PCDSPO)

==Units under the Presidential Communications Operations Office==

===Presidential News Desk===
The Presidential News Desk (PND) functions as the [[newsroom]] of [[Malacañang Palace]]. It gathers and disseminates information, such as [[press release|press]] and [[photograph|photograph releases]], and official statements from the Palace, on a daily basis.

The PND operates from Sundays to Saturdays, 5:00&amp;nbsp;AM to 7:00&amp;nbsp;PM.  It is headed by a chief [[editing|editor]] and is composed of a [[managing editor]], [[deskman|deskmen]], and [[reporter]]s. Other units, which support the PND are Electronic Data Processing, Transcription and Monitoring, and Photographs.

[[Francisco Tatad]] conceived the PND. He was the Press Secretary to [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. It was then called the Central Desk and was located in the Mabini Building. During the [[administration (government)|administration]] of President [[Corazon C. Aquino]], Press Secretary Benigno Teodoro relegated the Central Desk, which became the News and Reportorial Section, as a section of the Presidential Press Staff. Under the [[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos]] administration, Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes strengthened presidential coverage and set up the PND.

===Philippine Information Agency===
[[File:Philippine Information Agency Logo.svg|60px|right]]
The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), established by Executive Order No. 100, is the main development communication arm of the government. It is under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO). 

The PIA directly serves the Presidency and the executive branch of the national, regional and provincial levels through its 16 regional offices and 71 provincial information centers. 

Its core services include: information gathering/research, production and dissemination, and institutional development and capacity-building focusing on alliance-building, networking, communication-related training, consultancy and technical assistance. The PIA is also the advertising arm of the government.

It is currently headed by Harold E. Clavite (director general) and Gregorio Angelo C. Villar (deputy director general), assisted by staff directors in the central office, regional directors in the regional offices, and more than 500 permanent and contractual employees.

Its tagline is "Empowering Communities". The PIA works with community stakeholders, including local government units, line agencies, private entities, schools, colleges and universities, civil society organizations, and other groups in ensuring proper dissemination of information at the grassroots level. The agency advocates responsible sharing of information and responsible use of social media. Its current management and personnel work with the mantra and belief that "a well-informed Filipino is an empowered Filipino".

In 2017, the PIA was tasked by PCOO to take the lead in promoting the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit and established information kiosks in more than 90 locations in the country and conducted community fora and dialogue with community leaders and local townsfolk.

===Bureau of Communication Services===
The Bureau of Communication Services is the attached agency of the PCOO that is tasked to provide materials and services related to various functions of the Presidency, PCOO and the general public.

It also produces information materials for state events such as the anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]], ''[[Araw ng Kalayaan]]'' celebrations, and others. Director IV John S. Manalili is the bureau's current director.

===Presidential Broadcast Staff - Radio TV Malacañang===
Created by President Corazon C. Aquino&lt;ref&gt;under Executive Order No. 297 on July 25, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;, the Presidential Broadcast Staff - Radio Television Malacañang is tasked to provide the necessary media services, video and audio, to the incumbent President, to document all official engagements, and to make available to the public accurate and relevant information on the activities, programs and pronouncements of the national leadership.

The agency is involved in television coverage and documentation, news and public affairs syndication of all the activities of the President, either live or delayed telecast through government or private collaborating networks.

===Media networks===
There are two government-run television networks, which are the [[People's Television Network]] (PTV-4) and the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC-13). The [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) constitutes the government radio network.

IBC-13 and RPN-9 were sequestered by the government after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship. However, plans are being made to [[Privatization|privatize]] IBC-13 and RPN-9 within two years to raise money. According to the 2009 report of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG), IBC-13 is valued at PHP 3.074 billion while RPN-9 is valued at PHP 1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100817-287204/Marcos-bucks-plan-to-sell-2-TV-networks Marcos bucks plan to sell 2 TV networks] ''Inquirer.net'' 2010-08-10. Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/08/10/10/pcgg-urges-gov%E2%80%99t-fast-track-sale-rpn-9-ibc-13 PCGG urges gov’t to fast-track sale of RPN-9, IBC-13] ''ABS-CBNnews.com.'' 2010-08-10. Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Printing Office===
[[File:National Printing Office (NPO).svg|right|120px]]
The National Printing Office (NPO) was established by Executive Order.&lt;ref&gt;No. 285 on July 25, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive Order 285 abolished the General Services Administration and transferred its functions to other agencies. Its Government Printing Offices were merged with the printing units of the PIA. The NPO is mandated by Executive Order 285 to print [[form (document)|forms]], official [[ballot]]s, public documents, and public information materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npo.gov.ph/about-us/mandate/|title=Mandate {{!}} National Printing Office|website=npo.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News and Information Bureau===
The News and Information Bureau's main aim is to provide services relating to the development and formulation of a domestic and foreign information program for the Government in general, and the Presidency in particular, including the development of strategies for the dissemination of information on specific government programs. It is composed of the following divisions:
*Finance and Administrative Division
*Presidential Press Staff
*Media Accreditation and Relations Division/International Press Center
* Philippines News Agency

===OP Web Development Office===
The OP Web Development Office, commonly referred to as the President's New Media Team, is responsible for the establishment and management of the President's Official Website and Official Presence on social networking channels such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]]. It is also partly responsible for the feedback mechanism of the President wherein it receives the comments, concerns and suggestions through the Contact Us section of the President's website. It is also responsible for the President's Social Media engagement and in maximizing the use of new technologies to further the President's agenda, policies and programs.

===Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office===
[[File:PCDSPO.jpg|right|110px]]
The Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office (PCDSPO) ensures that all aspects of communications are covered, to ensure that the administration’s message has been delivered successfully. This includes market research and polling. It devises the communications strategy to promote the President’s agenda throughout all media, and among the many people with whom the administration interacts. This can include, but is not limited to, the State of the Nation address, televised press conferences, statements to the press, and radio addresses. This office also works closely with cabinet-level departments and other executive agencies, in order to create a coherent strategy through which the president’s message can be disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/08/09/briefing-on-presidential-communications-reforms/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the administration of former president [[Benigno Aquino III]], the PCDSPO head held a cabinet rank. The head was supported by a deputy of undersecretary rank, a chief of staff, an assistant secretary for messaging, and an electronic data processing division chief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/07/30/executive-order-no-4/&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Rodrigo Duterte]] became the President in 2016, the PCDSPO was merged with the PCOO, thus effectively abolishing the PCDSPO. The PCOO was renamed as the Presidential Communications Office before it was reverted to Presidential Communications Operations Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/16/1593534/martin-andanar-eyes-renaming-pcoo  Martin Andanar eyes renaming PCOO], Patricia Lourdes Viray, [[The Philippine Star]], June 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to June 30, 2016, the PCDSPO was composed of the following units and agencies, all of which were under the PCOO:
* Presidential Message Staff
* The OP Correspondence Office (previously placed under the Office of the Communications Director from the Presidential Management Staff per E.O. No. 348, 11 August 2004)

==Controversies==
The PCOO has been criticized for various errors and lapses committed by the office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/opinion/2017/06/02/seares-calling-out-state-medias-mistakes-545378|title=Seares: Calling out state media’s mistakes|last=Seares|first=Atty.

'''SAP BusinessObjects Lumira''' also known as '''Lumira''' is a [[business intelligence]] software developed and marketed by [[BusinessObjects|SAP BusinessObjects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-debuts-lumira-self-service-business-intelligence/|title=SAP Debuts Lumira; Self-service Business Intelligence|publisher=ZDNet|first=Andrew|last=Nusca|date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is used to manipulate and visualize data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2013/05/13/sap-renames-visual-intelligence-lumira-and-sticks-it-in-the-cloud/|title=SAP Renames Visual Intelligence "Lumira and Sticks it in the Cloud"|publisher=Gigaom|first=David|last=Meyer|date=May 13, 2013|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lumira was initially launched as SAP Visual Intelligence in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativeretailtechnologies.com/doc/sap-releases-sap-s-visual-intelligence-to-keep-its-data-visualization-applications-0001|title=SAP Releases SAP's Visual Intelligence to Keep its Data Visualization Applications Up to Par with the Rise of In-Memory Databases|publisher=Innovative Retail Technologies|date=June 7, 2012|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the software could only use SAP's [[SAP HANA|HANA]] platform as a data source. The second release expanded data sources to include [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayforce.com/2012/07/visual-intelligence/ |title=SAP Visual Intelligence: Self-service Dashboards for Business Analysts|publisher=Bayforce|first=Clare |last=Plaisance |date=July 25, 2012 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, SAP rebranded the software under the Lumira name and began offering a version of the software as a [[cloud computing]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/sap-steps-up-visual-analytics-mobile-bi/d/d-id/1110025?|title=SAP Steps Up Visual Analytics, Mobile BI|publisher=InformationWeek|first=Cindi |last=Howson|date=May 19, 2013|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the cloud version of Lumira was absorbed into SAP's Cloud For Analytics software, while the Lumira Server and Lumira Desktop software remained separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-teched-a-deeper-look-at-the-new-cloud-for-analytics-platform/|title=SAP TechEd: A Closer Look at the New 'Cloud for Analytics' Platform|publisher=ZDNet|first=Doug |last=Henschen|date=October 23, 2015|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2992441/software-as-a-service/sap-unwraps-project-orca-and-gives-it-a-new-name.html|title=SAP Unwraps Project Orca and Gives it a New Name|publisher=Computerworld|first=Katherine |last=Noyes|date=October 13, 2015 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, Lumira 2.x was announced. The upcoming software is said to be able to run applications from the Design Studio 1.6 data visualization software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxcoxygen.com/news/from-design-studio-1.6-to-lumira-2.0|title=From Design Studio 1.6 to Lumira 2.0|publisher=UXC Oxygen|first=Kevin |last=Allen|date=August 29, 2016 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spektr-RG''' (Russian for ''[[Electromagnetic spectrum|Spectrum]]'' + ''[[X-ray|Röntgen]]'' + ''[[Gamma ray|Gamma]]''; also called '''Spectrum-X-Gamma''', '''SRG''', '''SXG''') is a Russian/German [[high-energy astronomy|high-energy astrophysics]] observatory. {{As of|April 2016}} it is planned to launch in 2019.&lt;ref name="Spektr-RG" /&gt;
The primary instrument of the mission is [[eROSITA]], built by the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] (MPE). It is designed to be used to conduct a 4-year X-ray survey sky, the first in a medium X-ray band up to 10 keV energies.
This survey will detect many new [[Galaxy cluster|clusters of galaxies]] and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].
The second instrument, [[ART-XC]], is a Russian high energy X-ray telescope.
This instrument and spacecraft are being built under the leadership of the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI). 

== Spacecraft ==
The Spektr-RG programme was revived in 2005&lt;ref name ="IKI2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/SXG/PROJECT/SXG-eng.htm | date = 2005-10-30 | accessdate=2011-02-04 | publisher = [[Russian Space Research Institute]] | title = Spectrum-RG/eRosita/Lobster mission definition document}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the spacecraft was in final stages of assembly during 2016. Instrument launch is scheduled for early-2019.&lt;ref name="Spektr-RG"/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">[[Image:Willem Einthoven ECG.jpg|thumb|250px|An early commercial ECG machine, built in 1911 by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company]]

The '''string galvanometer''', also known as the '''Einthoven galvanometer''', invented around 1901 by Dutch physician [[Willem Einthoven]] was the first practical [[electrocardiograph]] (ECG); it was one of the earliest instruments capable of detecting and recording the very small [[electric current]]s produced by the human [[heart]] and produced the first reliable [[electrocardiogram]]s. The original machines achieved "such amazing technical perfection that many modern day electrocardiographs do not attain equally reliable and undistorted recordings".&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;'Willem Einthoven and the Birth of Clinical Electrocardiography a Hundred Years Ago', S. Serge Barold, Cardiac Electrophysiology Review, Springer Netherlands January 2003 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u12323617k211v4r/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Einthoven was awarded the 1924 [[Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his work.

==History==

Previous to the string galvanometer, scientists were using a machine called the capillary [[electrometer]] to measure the heart’s electrical activity, but this device was unable to produce results of a diagnostic level.&lt;ref&gt;'Einthoven's String GalvanometerThe First Electrocardiograph', Moises Rivera-Ruiz et al, Tex Heart Inst J. © 2008 by the Texas Heart Institute [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=18612490]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willem Einthoven]] invented  the string galvanometer at [[Leiden University]] in the early 20th century, publishing the first registration of its use to record an electrocardiogram in a [[Festschrift]] book in 1902. The first human electrocardiogram was recorded in 1887, however it was not until 1901 that a quantifiable result was obtained from the string galvanometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
  |title=ECG Complete

  |first2=A.N.  |last2=Borg

  |publisher=Elsevier Limited 
  |ref=harv
  |page=2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, the physicians [[Arthur MacNalty]], M.D. Oxon, and [[Thomas Lewis (cardiologist)|Thomas Lewis]] teamed to become the first of their profession to apply electrocardiography in medical diagnosis. Einthoven was awarded the [[Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1924 for his work.{{sfnp|Bowbrick|Borg|2006|page= 10 }}

==Mechanics==

Einthoven's invention consisted of a very long (several metres) silver-coated [[quartz]] filament of negligible mass that conducted the electrical currents from the heart. This filament was acted upon by powerful [[electromagnet]]s positioned either side of it, which caused sideways displacement of the filament in proportion to the current carried due to the [[electromagnetic field]]. The movement in the filament was heavily magnified and projected through a thin slot onto a moving photographic plate.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Einthoven 1901" &gt;[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/einthoven.html Einthoven (1901)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The filament was originally made by drawing out a filament of glass from a crucible of molten glass. To produce a sufficiently thin and long filament an [[arrow]] was fired across the room so that it dragged the filament from the molten glass. The filament so produced was then coated with [[silver]] to provide the conductive pathway for the current.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_w9v_ZkzTZoC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=string+galvanometer+arrow&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9kIiUHQJcy&amp;sig=nkKW7k_G1DQJlcqOhwmATDy-Wiw#PPA113,M1 A History of Electrocardiography pg 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; By tightening or loosening the filament it is possible to very accurately regulate the sensitivity of the galvanometer.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required 5 operators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nia.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Publications/AgingHeartsandArteries/chapter05.htm NIH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514154547/http://www.nia.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Publications/AgingHeartsandArteries/chapter05.htm |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and weighed some 600&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref name="Einthoven 1901" /&gt;

===Procedure===

Patients are seated with both arms and left leg in separate buckets of saline solution. These buckets act as electrodes to conduct the current from the skin's surface to the filament. The three points of electrode contact on these limbs produces what is known as [[Einthoven's triangle]], a principle still used in modern-day ECG recording.{{sfnp|Bowbrick|Borg|2006|pages= 9–10 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1467">A '''sylphon''' is an old name for a cylindrically symmetrical [[metal bellows]].   When made of metal, the sylphon shape was formerly created by [[metal spinning]] onto a metal mandrel (model), and now by hydrostatic forming within a mold.   Because the mold contains the convolutions of the bellows, the mold must be constructed in parts so that it can be disassembled when the forming process is complete.  Legendary experimental physicist [[John Donovan Strong|John Strong]] makes occasional use of the term sylphon in his famous book [https://www.amazon.com/Procedures-Experimental-Physics-John-Strong/dp/0917914562 ''Procedures in Experimental Physics'']. 

A sylphon, or bellows, is used, among other purposes, to transfer motion through the wall of a vacuum chamber.  It can be used as a squeeze piston for simple pumps.  It can also be used as a flexible coupling to transfer rotary motion between shafts.

The sylphon was invented in the early 1900s by meteorologist [[Weston Fulton]] (1871&amp;ndash;1946), who named it for the [[sylph]]s of Western mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Neely, "[http://monkeyfire.com/mpol/dir_zine/dir_2000/1040/t_cover.html Miracle on Third Creek]," ''Metro Pulse'', 5 October 2000. Retrieved: 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a trade name used by Johnson Controls for pneumatically operated valves and damper actuators utilizing a metal bellows, they were rendered obsolete in the 1930s and 40s

The '''System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval''' ('''SEDAR''') is a mandatory document filing and retrieval system for Canadian public companies. It is similar to [[EDGAR]], the filing system operated by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for United States public companies. SEDAR is administered by the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]], a coordinating body comprising the 13 Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions, and operated on their behalf since 2014 by the [[Alberta Securities Commission]].

SEDAR search results are rendered in [[PDF]] format. Searches of the database can be made by company name, industry group, document type or date filed.

Through registered filing agents, public companies file documents such as [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]]es, [[financial statements]] and material change reports. In the interest of transparency and full disclosure these documents are accessible to the public. Documents filed with regulators prior to the implementation of SEDAR in 1997 may be available from the individual securities commissions but in the case of the British Columbia Securities Commission historical filings are unretrievable and may have been destroyed.

'''Ultra-high-definition television''' (also known as '''Ultra HD television''', '''Ultra HD''', '''UHDTV''', '''UHD''' and '''Super Hi-Vision''') today includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]], which are two [[digital video]] formats with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]]. These were first proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and later defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr-lex.be/info-stuff/ultrahighdef.html|title=Just how useful is 2160p aka 4K?|first=Alexander|last=Thomas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013/06/defining-the-future-of-television|title=Defining the Future of Television|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ce_press"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.ce.org/News/News-Releases/Press-Releases/2014/Leading-Television-Industry-Players-Line-Up-To-Sup.aspx |title= Leading Television Industry Players Line Up To Support ‘4K Ultra HD’ | accessdate = 18 December 2014 | date = 11 November 2014 |work=2014 Press Releases | publisher =Consumer Electronics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet4k"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-now-supports-4k-resolution-videos/ |title= YouTube now supports 4k-resolution videos | accessdate = 18 December 2014 | date = 9 July 2010|first = Josh | last = Lowensohn |work=Tech Culture | publisher =CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] announced on October 17, 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of 16:9 or wider and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/what-is-ultra-hdtv/ | title = What is Ultra HDTV? | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-4k-and-8k-ultra-hd/ | title = The Ultimate Guide to 4K Ultra HD | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Ultra HD Forum]] was created to bring together the end-to-end video production ecosystem to ensure interoperability and produce industry guidelines so that adoption of Ultra-high-definition television could accelerate.

===Resolution===
Two resolutions are defined as UHDTV:&lt;ref name="ITURecommendationUHDTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UHDTVdefined" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "UHDTV4Kand8K" /&gt;

* UHDTV-1 is 3840 pixels wide by 2160 pixels tall (8.29 [[megapixel]]s), which is four times as many pixels as 1920 × 1080 (2.07 megapixels) of current [[1080p]] [[High-definition television|HDTV]] (full HDTV).
** Also known as ''4K UHD''. Not to be confused with [[4K resolution#Resolutions|other 4K resolutions]] such as the 4096 × 2160 ''DCI 4K''/''Cinema 4K''.
* UHDTV-2 is 7680 pixels wide by 4320 pixels tall (33.18 megapixels), also referred to as ''8K UHD'', which is sixteen times as many pixels of current [[1080p]] [[High-definition television|HDTV]], which brings it closer to the detail level of [[IMAX|15/70 mm IMAX]].&lt;ref name="UHDTVdefined" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Dibeg | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | contribution-url = http://www.dibeg.org/news/previous_doc/0208BrazilSET/D012NHKreseach.pdf#page=39 | contribution = Research Activities of NHK Science and Technical Research Laboratories | title = SET Open House | place = [[Brazil|BR]] | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = [[Japan|JP]] | url = http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/publica/bt/en/fe0018.pdf#page=2 | title = Progress on Large, Wide-screen Image Presentation | publisher = NHK STRL | journal = Broadcast Technology | number = 18 |date=Spring 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NHK]] advocates the 8K UHDTV format with [[22.2 surround sound]] as Super Hi-Vision.

===Color space, dynamic range, frame rate and resolution/aliasing===
The human visual system has a limited ability to discern improvements in resolution when picture elements are already small enough or distant enough from the viewer.  At home-viewing distances and current TV sizes, HD resolution is near the limits of resolution for the eye and increasing resolution to 4K has little perceptual impact, as consumers are beyond the critical distance ([[Bernard J. Lechner|Lechner distance]]) to appreciate the differences in pixel count between 4K and HD.  One exception to note is that even if resolution surpasses the resolving ability of the human eye, there is still an improvement in the way the image appears due to higher resolutions reducing [[aliasing]].

In this context, it is important to be aware of two different types of what is often referred to be aliasing, but occur because of different reasons:

The first one results in false detail/moiré/striped patterns in the displayed image due to improper filtering of high spatial frequencies contained in the original image. Thus, all the details exceeding the [[Nyquist frequency]], which is determined by the resolution of the display like a TV or projector, will fold back into the given bandwidth, leading to distortion in the form described before. This issue is not caused by the limited resolution of the display and can principally be avoided by filtering the original image when downscaling it to the proper native display resolution.

The often witnessed pixelized stairsteps of a low resolution image is not a direct consequence of what would correctly be called [[aliasing]] as no "false frequencies" are present but because the pixel pattern is simply not detailed enough. When reproduced correctly with a non-pixel-based screen in theory, any image would not become pixelized with lower and lower resolution, but only less and less sharp. Which leads to the second type.

The second type is more precisely called "imaging", at least in the audio domain, however misleadingly often enough called [[aliasing]] as well (even in technical literature), and refers to the high frequencies introduced by the nowadays pixel-based display of images. The individual pixels which in theory are only supposed to serve as individual samples for an entirely analog reconstruction, just like with audio, by their nature, when used "as is", have sharp discrete edges which equal high spatial frequencies (which couldn't have been present in the analog original in the first place as they would have been filtered before the A/D-process takes place), leading to a "pixelized" look if inside the visible bandwidth.

This second type of [[aliasing]] (imaging) can be defeated in two ways: one can use a pixel-based resolution which, depending on the distance and eyesight of the user, is high enough so that the eyes and their optical system serve as a low-pass filter (which already happens with 2K in many environments) or secondly, one could correctly filter the high spatial frequencies (anti-imaging, analog to the audio domain again) by either using other techniques than a pixel-based screen (CRT for example) or applying an optical filter in addition between the screen and the user.

In this context, raising the display resolution as mentioned before introduces two advantages in practise, where pixel-based displays and non-perfect downscaling probably will continue to persist: when downscaling without proper filtering, the higher end-resolution of the display allows more "headroom", where less aliasing will occur because the false frequencies will be "mirrored back" into the regular bandwidth at a later point, becoming eligible or less apparent at least.

Secondly, the higher the display resolution, the higher the high spatial frequencies will be as well, which are introduced by the pixel-based rasterizarion. Compared to the audio domain, it is essentially noise shaping. In the case of images and video, the "noise" will be shifted into frequencies beyond what the eyes are able to resolve, cleaning up the usable bandwidth which is the actual image the user is supposed to see.

UHDTV, however, allows other image enhancements than pixel density. Specifically, dynamic range and color are greatly enhanced, and these impact saturation and contrast differences that are readily resolved and greatly improve the experience of 4KTV compared to HDTV. UHDTV allows the future use of the new [[Rec. 2020]] (UHDTV) color space which can reproduce colors that cannot be shown with the current [[Rec. 709]] (HDTV) color space.&lt;ref name="TVTechnologyDecember2012SuperHiVision" /&gt;

In terms of [[CIE 1931 color space]], the new Rec.&amp;nbsp;2020 color space covers 75.8%, compared to coverage by the [[DCI-P3]] [[digital cinema]] reference projector color space of just 53.6%, 52.1% by [[Adobe RGB color space]], while the Rec.&amp;nbsp;709 color space covers only 35.9%.&lt;ref name="TVTechnologyDecember2012SuperHiVision" /&gt; UHDTV's increases in dynamic range allow not only brighter highlights but also increased detail in the greyscale. UHDTV also allows for frame rates up to 120 [[frame rate|frames per second]] (fps).&lt;ref name="UHDTV4Kand8K" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Recommendation2020"&gt;{{cite news |title= BT.2020: Parameter values for ultra high-definition television systems for production and international programme exchange | publisher=ITU |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.2020-0-201208-I/en |date= August 23, 2012 |accessdate = August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UHDTV potentially allows Rec. 2020, higher dynamic range, and higher frame rates to work on HD services without increasing resolution to 4K, providing improved quality without as high of an increase in bandwidth demand.

In April 2012, NHK (in collaboration with Panasonic) announced a {{convert |145|in|cm|abbr= on}} display (7680×4320 at 60 fps), which has 33.2 million 0.417&amp;nbsp;mm square pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 145-inch Ultra High Definition plasma display |publisher=DIGINFO TV |url=http://www.diginfo.tv/v/12-0072-r-en.php |date=April 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the four major Korean terrestrial broadcasters ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], MBC, SBS, and EBS) announced that in the future, they would begin test broadcasts of UHDTV on channel 66 in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="TechnicalReviewApril"&gt;{{cite news |title=Progression of 3DTV and Ultra High Definition Television |publisher=Technical Review |page=27 |url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1x55i/TechnicalReviewApril/resources/29.htm |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UHDTVetnews"&gt;{{cite news |title=UHDTV Broadcasting Tested by Terrestrial Stations |publisher=etnews.com |author=Jun Ji-youn |url=http://english.etnews.com/communication/2619925_1300.html |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, the UHDTV technical details had not yet been decided.&lt;ref name="TechnicalReviewApril" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UHDTVetnews" /&gt; [[LG Electronics]] and [[Samsung]] are also involved in UHDTV test broadcasts.&lt;ref name="UHDTVetnews" /&gt;

In May 2012, NHK showed the world's first ultra-high-definition shoulder-mount camera.&lt;ref name="NHKUHDTVShoulderMountCamera"&gt;{{cite news |title=World's first Ultra High Definition shoulder-mount camera |publisher=DIGINFO TV |url=http://www.diginfo.tv/v/12-0092-d-en.php |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing the size and weight of the camera, the portability had been improved, making it more maneuverable than previous prototypes, so it can be used in a wide variety of shooting situations.&lt;ref name="NHKUHDTVShoulderMountCamera" /&gt; The single-chip sensor uses a Bayer color-filter array, where only one color component is acquired per pixel.&lt;ref name="NHKUHDTVShoulderMountCamera" /&gt; Researchers at NHK have also developed a high-quality up-converter, which estimates the other two-color components to convert the output into full resolution video.&lt;ref name="NHKUHDTVShoulderMountCamera" /&gt;

Also in May 2012, NHK showed the ultra-high-definition imaging system it has developed in conjunction with Shizuoka University, which outputs 33.2-megapixel video at 120 fps with a [[color depth]] of 12 bits.&lt;ref name="2012NHK120fpsUHDTV"&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK 33 Megapixel 120fps Ultra High Definition imaging system |publisher=DIGINFO TV |url=http://www.diginfo.tv/v/12-0091-d-en.php |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012NHKOpenHouse120ImageSensor"&gt;{{cite news |title=120 Hz Super Hi-Vision Image Sensor |publisher=NHK |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/open2012/html/tenji/013_e.html |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ultra-high-definition broadcasts at full resolution are designed for large, wall-sized displays, there is a possibility that fast-moving subjects may not be clear when shot at 60 fps, so the option of 120 fps has been standardized for these situations.&lt;ref name="2012NHK120fpsUHDTV" /&gt; To handle the sensor output of approximately 4 billion pixels per second with a data rate as high as 51.2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s, a faster analog-to-digital converter has been developed to process the data from the pixels, and then a high-speed output circuit distributes the resulting digital signals into 96 parallel channels.&lt;ref name="2012NHK120fpsUHDTV" /&gt; This {{convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} CMOS sensor is smaller and uses less power when compared to conventional ultra-high-definition sensors, and it is also the world's first to support the full specifications of the ultra-high-definition standard.&lt;ref name="2012NHK120fpsUHDTV" /&gt;

===Standardization for Europe===
[[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] approved the Standard TS 101 154 V2.1.1, published (07/2014) in the DVB Blue Book A157 ''Specification for the use of Video and Audio Coding in Broadcasting Applications based on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream'', which was published by [[ETSI]] in the following months.

===Standardization for Korea===
Standards for UHDTV in Korea have been developed by its [[Telecommunications Technology Association]].

On August 30, 2013, the scenarios for 4K-UHDTV service were described in the Report "TTAR 07.0011: A Study on the UHDTV Service Scenarios and its Considerations".

On May 22, 2014, the technical report "TTAR-07.0013: Terrestrial 4K UHDTV Broadcasting Service" was published.

On October 13, 2014, an interim standard – "TTAI.KO-07.0123: Transmission and Reception for Terrestrial UHDTV Broadcasting Service" – was published based on HEVC encoding, with MPEG 2 TS, and DVB-T2 serving as the standards.

On June 24, 2016, a standard – "TTAK.KO-07.0127: Transmission and Reception for Terrestrial UHDTV Broadcasting Service" – was published based on HEVC encoding, with MMTP/ROUTE IP, and ATSC 3.0 serving as the standards.

'''United Biscuits''' ("UB") is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] food manufacturer, makers of [[McVitie's]] biscuits, [[Jacob's]] [[Cream cracker|Cream Crackers]], and [[Twiglets]]. The company was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and was once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. In November 2014, the company was acquired by [[Yıldız Holding]] and is now part of [[Pladis]].

==History==
United Biscuits (UB) was formed in 1948 by a merger of two Scottish family businesses: McVitie &amp; Price and MacFarlane Lang.&lt;ref&gt;"A New Biscuit Company." ''The Times'' [London, England] 19 March 1948: 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, William Crawford &amp; Sons, best known for its [[shortbread]], was acquired by United Biscuits for £6 million.&lt;ref&gt;"United Biscuits Crawfords For More Than £6M." ''The Times'' [London, England] 24 May 1962: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the company also acquired William MacDonald &amp; Sons for £2.8 million, and brought the Penguin brand to the group.&lt;ref&gt;"£2.8M. Biscuit Merger." ''The Times'' [London, England] 21 January 1965: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, United Biscuits acquired ''Carr's of Carlisle'', makers of [[Water biscuit|Table Water biscuits]], from [[James Goldsmith]]'s [[Cavenham Foods]] for £2.75 million.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rowley. "Cavenham sell biscuit interests for £4m." ''The Times'' [London, England] 5 July 1972: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1974, United Biscuits acquired the US-based [[Keebler Company]] for $53 million. It also owned the [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy Bar]] fast food restaurant chain between 1977 and 1989.&lt;ref name="caterersearch"&gt;"[http://www.caterersearch.com/Companies/33925/wimpy-international-ltd.html Information on Wimpy's Franchise]",''Caterer Search''. Retrieved on 29 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

United Biscuits acquired the frozen food company [[Ross Group|Ross Young's]] from [[Hanson plc|Hanson]] in 1988 for £335 million.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/about-us.php?rnd=2djB9FgOnxaVmYVMBx3FiTobV4FKJlNRfAt0h2mHW8U%3D |publisher=United Biscuits |date= |title=History |accessdate=4 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142916/http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/about-us.php?rnd=2djB9FgOnxaVmYVMBx3FiTobV4FKJlNRfAt0h2mHW8U%3D |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Biscuits sold Keebler for $500 million in 1995 after giving up efforts to break into the American market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/07/business/united-biscuits-sells-keebler-for-500-million.html United Biscuits Sells Keebler for $500 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

United Biscuits was acquired in May 2000 by Finalrealm, a consortium of financial investors, as well as [[Nabisco]] Holdings Corporation. As part of the transaction, UB acquired Nabisco's European businesses.&lt;ref name="find1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2002_April_25/ai_85280727|publisher = Eurofood  |date = 25 April 2002  |title = UB to weigh up its options |accessdate = 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sold [[Young's Bluecrest]] in 2001, in order to concentrate on the sweet biscuit sector.&lt;ref name="find4"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2001_March_29/ai_73233545|publisher = Eurofood  |date = 29 March 2001  |title = United Biscuits selling Young's stake |accessdate = 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, United Biscuits bought the UK portion of [[Groupe Danone]]'s Jacob's Biscuit Group for £240 million, including Cream Crackers and Twiglets.&lt;ref name="find3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040724/ai_n12801313|work= [[The Independent]] |date = 24 July 2004 |title = Danone sells its UK biscuits to United |accessdate = 12 April 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the company sold its Southern European biscuits business to [[Kraft Foods]], which in turn left the owner syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/migrationtemp/2943018/City-sandwich.html|work = The Daily Telegraph  |date = 11 July 2006 |title = City sandwich |accessdate = 4 January 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, [[MidOcean Partners]] sold the company to a consortium made up of the [[Blackstone Group]] and [[PAI Partners]].&lt;ref name="find2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061026/ai_n16803530|work = [[The Independent]] |date = 26 October 2006 |first= Gary |last =Parkinson |title = Private-equity companies snap up United Biscuits in a &lt;nowiki&gt;[pound]&lt;/nowiki&gt;1.6bn |accessdate = 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was completed in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/80256C1A0047922E/vWeb/pcHHUS6WHM5F |publisher=United Biscuits |date=15 December 2006 |title=Blackstone and PAI complete purchase of UB |accessdate=12 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180234/http://www.unitedbiscuits.com/80256C1A0047922E/vWeb/pcHHUS6WHM5F |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.altassets.net/private-equity-news/cinven-midocean-to-sell-united-biscuits.html |publisher= Alt Assets |date = 25 October 2006 |title = Cinven, MidOcean to sell United Biscuits |accessdate = 25 November 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}

'''Utility computing''', or '''The Computer Utility''',  is a service provisioning model in which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to the customer as needed, and charges them for specific usage rather than a flat rate. Like other types of on-demand computing (such as grid computing), the utility model seeks to maximize the efficient use of resources and/or minimize associated costs. Utility is the packaging of [[system resource]]s, such as computation, storage and services, as a metered service.  This model has the advantage of a low or no initial cost to acquire computer resources; instead, resources are essentially rented.

This repackaging of computing services became the foundation of the shift to "[[Code on demand|on demand]]" computing, [[software as a service]] and [[cloud computing]] models that further propagated the idea of computing, application and network as a service.

There was some initial skepticism about such a significant shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher=ZD Net | url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/on-demand-computing-what-are-the-odds/296135 | title=On-demand computing: What are the odds?  | first= | last= | date=Nov 2002 | accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new model of computing caught on and eventually became mainstream.

IBM, HP and Microsoft were early leaders in the new field of utility computing, with their business units and researchers working on the architecture, payment and development challenges of the new computing model. Google, Amazon and others started to take the lead in 2008, as they established their own utility services for computing, storage and applications.

Utility computing can support grid computing which has the characteristic of very large computations or sudden peaks in demand which are supported via a large number of computers.

"Utility computing" has usually envisioned some form of [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] so that the amount of storage or computing power available is considerably larger than that of a single [[time-sharing]] computer.  Multiple servers are used on the "back end" to make this possible.  These might be a dedicated [[computer cluster]] specifically built for the purpose of being rented out, or even an under-utilized [[supercomputer]].  The technique of running a single calculation on multiple computers is known as [[distributed computing]].

The term "[[grid computing]]" is often used to describe a particular form of distributed computing, where the supporting nodes are geographically distributed or cross [[administrative domain]]s.  To provide utility computing services, a company can "bundle" the resources of members of the public for sale, who might be paid with a portion of the revenue from clients.

One model, common among [[volunteer computing]] applications, is for a central server to dispense tasks to participating nodes, on the behest of approved end-users (in the commercial case, the paying customers).  Another model, sometimes called the [[Virtual Organization (Grid computing)|Virtual Organization]] (VO),{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} is more decentralized, with organizations buying and selling [[Computational resource|computing resources]] as needed or as they go idle.

The definition of "utility computing" is sometimes extended to specialized tasks, such as [[web service]]s.

== History ==
Utility computing merely means "Pay and Use", with regards to computing power.
Utility computing is not a new concept, but rather has quite a long history. Among the earliest references is:
{{cquote|If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.|author=[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]|source=speaking at the MIT Centennial in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architects of the Information Society, Thirty-Five Years of the Laboratory for Computer Science at MIT|editor1-first=Hal|editor1-last=Abelson|first1=Simson|last1=Garfinkel|isbn=978-0-262-07196-3|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc7dkLGLKrcC&amp;pg=PA1|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

IBM and other mainframe providers conducted this kind of business in the following two decades, often referred to as time-sharing, offering computing power and database storage to banks and other large organizations from their worldwide data centers. To facilitate this business model, mainframe operating systems evolved to include process control facilities, security, and user metering. The advent of mini computers changed this business model, by making computers affordable to almost all companies. As Intel and AMD increased the power of PC architecture servers with each new generation of processor, data centers became filled with thousands of servers.

In the late 90's utility computing re-surfaced. InsynQ, Inc. launched [on-demand] applications and desktop hosting services in 1997 using HP equipment. In 1998, HP set up the Utility Computing Division in Mountain View, CA, assigning former Bell Labs computer scientists to begin work on a computing power plant, incorporating multiple utilities to form a software stack. Services such as "IP billing-on-tap" were marketed. HP introduced the [[HP Utility Data Center|Utility Data Center]] in 2001. Sun announced the [[Sun Cloud]] service to consumers in 2000. In December 2005, [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] launched Alexa Web Search Platform, a Web search building tool for which the underlying power is utility computing. Alexa charges users for storage, utilization, etc. There is space in the market for specific industries and applications as well as other niche applications powered by utility computing. For example, PolyServe Inc. offers a [[clustered file system]] based on commodity server and storage hardware that creates highly available utility computing environments for mission-critical applications including Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases, as well as workload optimized solutions specifically tuned for bulk storage, high-performance computing, vertical industries such as financial services, seismic processing, and content serving. The Database Utility and File Serving Utility enable IT organizations to independently add servers or storage as needed, retask workloads to different hardware, and maintain the environment without disruption.

In spring 2006 [[3tera]] announced its AppLogic service and later that summer Amazon launched [[Amazon EC2]] (Elastic Compute Cloud). These services allow the operation of general purpose computing applications. Both are based on [[Xen]] virtualization software and the most commonly used operating system on the virtual computers is Linux, though Windows and Solaris are supported. Common uses include web application, SaaS, image rendering and processing but also general-purpose business applications.

'''Vector Graphic''' was an early microcomputer company founded in 1976, the same year as [[Apple Computer]], during the pre-[[IBM]] [[Personal Computer|PC]] era, along with the [[NorthStar Horizon]], [[IMSAI]], and [[MITS Altair]].

The first product was a memory card for the [[S-100 bus]]. A full microcomputer using the [[Z80]] [[microprocessor]], the Vector 1,&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3047428/how-two-bored-1970s-housewives-helped-create-the-pc-industry|title=How Two Bored 1970s Housewives Helped Create The PC Industry |last=Edwards|first=Benj|date=July 22, 2015|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in 1977. There were several Vector Graphic models produced. The Vector 1+ had a [[floppy disk]] drive.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; The Vector Graphic 3 had a fixed keyboard housed anchoring a combined screen terminal and CPU case. The Vector Graphic 4 was a transitional 8-bit and [[16-bit]] hybrid model.

Although primarily used with the [[CP/M]] operating system, the Vector 3 ran several others including [[OASIS operating system|OASIS]], [[Micropolis Disk Operating System]] (MDOS), and [[Micropolis Z80 Operating System]] (MZOS).

Early Vector Graphic models used the [[Micropolis Corporation|Micropolis]] floppy disk controller and Micropolis floppy disk drives. Later models were designed with the integrated floppy drive-hard drive controller and used [[Tandon Corporation|Tandon]] floppy drives. Almost all used unusual 100-track per inch [[5¼" floppy drive|5&amp;thinsp;¼-inch floppy drives]] and 16-sector hard sector media.  Some models included [[8" floppy drive|8-inch floppy drives]] and [[hard disk drive]]s.

Vector Graphic sales peaked in 1982, by which time the company was publicly traded, at $36 million. It faltered soon after due to several factors. The introduction of the [[IBM PC]] in August 1981 shifted the market and smaller players lost momentum. The Vector 4 was accidentally pre-announced in April 1982, the same month that founder and chief hardware designer Robert Harp left the company after a dispute with co-founder (and wife) Lore Harp over control of the company. The early announcement of the Vector 4, which had a separate keyboard tethered to the computer (as opposed to a combined keyboard and terminal) resulted in a sharp decrease in sales of the Vector 3 as customers delayed purchases up to six months until the new product was available. In addition, the company had decided to use the CP/M operating system in the Vector 4, which they considered a superior operating system than MDOS; management recognized the nature of their gamble, as IBM would move the market in a different direction if it elected to use the DOS operating system for their competing product, the IBM 8080. The gamble did not pay off, and by the end of 1984 Lore Harp was gone and [[venture capital]] investors took over.  By summer 1985 only three dozen employees remained, down from a peak of 425 workers in 1982. Ultimately, the Vector Graphic headquarters and assembly factory, across from a 17-person company (Amgen) and  next to the 101 freeway, was converted into a Home Depot store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-20/business/fi-2173_1_vector-graphic The Rise and Decline of Vector Graphic: Management Mistakes and IBM Crush Couple's Computer Venture], August 20, 1985, by Daniel Akst, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy followed in December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-25/business/fi-21221_1_vector-graphic Vector Graphic Seeks Chapter 11 Protection], December 25, 1985, by Daniel Akst, ''Los Angeles Times'', Retrieved August 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A sought-for merger partner was not found and [[chapter 7 liquidation]] of remaining assets resulted in October 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-20/business/fi-14533_1_vector-graphic Firm With Storybook Start Has Sad Ending: Vector's Assets Liquidated], October 20, 1987, by Barry Stavro, ''Los Angeles Times'', Retrieved August 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Vector Graphic computers had many innovations, such as the Flashwriter integrated video and keyboard controller. Vector Graphic was known for their Memorite [[word processing]] application.  When combined with the Flashwriter, the Vector Graphic Memorite software gave low-cost{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2016}} word processing capability, which had previously only been available with dedicated word processors.

As of 2007, Vector Graphic still had a small but active user community.
