The '''1981 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] [[motor race]] held at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]] on May 31, 1981.

==Race==
The start of the race was delayed after a fire in the Loews Hotel kitchens, which necessitated the fire service pumping large quantities of water to put the fires out. Water then seeped through the floors of the hotel and into the tunnel, delaying the race for an hour. [[Nelson Piquet]] led for much of the race, but crashed out late on. New race leader Alan Jones then suffered a fuel feed problem in the latter stages of the race, allowing [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in his [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], to take his first victory since 1979. Championship leader [[Carlos Reutemann]] retired with gearbox problems, breaking a 15-race streak of consistently finishing in the points.

'''''Avec les Hommes de l'eau''''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] 1938 short documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
The Berwinne sails off Leopoldville (now known as [[Kinshasa]]) up the [[Congo River]]. Along the way, it stops at a small village to take on board a plentiful supply of slow-burning wood. Once loaded, the boat sails away, leaving a mesmerised local population behind on the shore. Along the route, the boat encounters canoes and "watermen" carrying out typical activities such as fishing, crocodile hunting, carving hippopotamus meat and salting it for preservation.

'''Azad Hind Radio''' was a propaganda radio service that was started under the leadership of Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in [[Germany]] in 1942 to encourage [[India]]ns to fight for freedom. Though initially based in Germany, its headquarters was shifted to [[Singapore]] and later to [[Rangoon]] following the course of the war in [[South East Asia]]. Following Netaji's departure to South East Asia, the German operations were continued by [[A.C.N. Nambiar]], the head of the [[Indische Legion|Indian Legion]] in Germany and later Ambassador of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]] in Germany. &lt;ref name=oocities&gt;{{cite web|title=Netaji's Addresses on Azad Hind Radio|url=http://www.oocities.org/vayujeet/netaji.html|publisher=oocities.org|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=hindustantimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Afridi |first=Sahroz |title=Freedom struggle on air |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopal/freedom-struggle-on-air/article1-1031782.aspx |publisher=hindustantimes.com |accessdate=19 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313024912/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopal/freedom-struggle-on-air/article1-1031782.aspx |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=dailymail-uk&gt;{{cite web|title=Immortalising the Bengali 'voice' of Bose's Azad Hind Radio in Tokyo |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2140517/Immortalising-Bengali-voice-Boses-Azad-Hind-Radio-Tokyo.html|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=newindianexpress&gt;{{cite web|title=Netaji to come alive on Azad Hind Radio|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/article144419.ece#.UwTbAGKSyBI|publisher=newindianexpress.com|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The station broadcast weekly news bulletins in [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto]] and [[Urdu]] only as these were the languages of potential volunteers for the Indian Legion in Germany and the [[Indian National Army]] in southeast Asia. The majority of the volunteers spoke these Indian languages only. 

Azad Hind Radio aimed to counter the broadcasts of Allied radio stations. On Azad Hind Radio, Netaji referred the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as the ''Bluff and Bluster Corporation'' and the [[All India Radio]] as the ''Anti Indian Radio''.

{{Taxation|expanded=International}}
A '''currency transaction tax''' is a [[tax]] placed on the use of currency for various types of transactions. The tax is associated with the [[financial sector]] and is a type of [[financial transaction tax]], as opposed to a [[consumption tax]] paid by consumers, though the tax may be passed on by the financial institution to the customer.

==Types of currency transaction taxes==
Currency transaction taxes have been proposed as taxes on domestic currency usage as part of the [[Automated Payment Transaction tax|automated payment transaction (APT) tax]] and on international currency transactions, the [[Tobin tax]] and the [[Spahn tax]].

=== APT tax===
{{main|Automated payment transaction tax}}
The automated payment transaction (APT) tax was first proposed in Buenos Aires at the International Institute of Public Finance Conference by Edgar L. Feige in 1989 and an extended version of the proposal appeared in Economic Policy in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feige |first=Edgar L.&gt; |title='Taxation for the 21st century: the automated payment transaction (APT) tax', |journal=Economic Policy Journal |date=October 2000 |volume=31 |pages=473–511 |url=http://econwpa.wustl.edu/eps/pe/papers/0106/0106002.pdf |doi=10.1111/1468-0327.00067 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204222326/http://econwpa.wustl.edu/eps/pe/papers/0106/0106002.pdf |archivedate=2004-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The APT tax proposal is a generalization of the Keynes tax&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, J.M. (1936). The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace, New  York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tobin tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tobin|first=James|title='A proposal for international monetary reform',|journal=Eastern Economic Journal|date=July 1978|volume=4|issue=3–4|pages=153–159|url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p04b/p0495.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APT tax consists of a small flat tax levied on all transactions. The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking or payments system. In order to assure that all cash transactions are also taxed, the APT system proposes to exact a tax on currency as it enters and leaves the banking system. In order to be an effective means of discouraging currency usage for tax evasion, the APT tax imposes a tax rate on currency higher than the rate automatically charged on cheque transactions. Since cash can be used multiple times between the time it enters into circulation and the time it is returned to the banking system, the APT currency transaction tax is set at a multiple of the rate charged for all other transactions using non cash payment methods.

===Tobin tax===
{{main|Tobin tax}}
A Tobin tax is a tax on all [[Spot market|spot conversions]] of one currency into another. Named after the economist [[James Tobin]], the tax is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the [[Bretton Woods system]] effectively ended.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/eej/eeconj/v4y1978i3-4p153-159.html |title=A Proposal for International Monetary Reform |author=James Tobin |date=July–October 1978 |work=Eastern Economic Journal|publisher=Eastern Economic Association |pages=153–159|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spahn tax===
{{main|Spahn tax}}
In 1995, [[Paul Bernd Spahn]] suggested an alternative involving "a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax, plus an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates as a piggyback. The latter would be dormant in times of normal financial activities, and be activated only in the case of speculative attacks. The mechanism allowing the identification of abnormal trading in world financial markets would make reference to a "crawling peg" with an appropriate exchange rate band. The exchange rate would move freely within this band without transactions being taxed. Only transactions effected at exchange rates outside the permissible range would become subject to tax. This would automatically induce stabilizing behavior on the part of market participants."&lt;ref name = "Spahn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/profs/spahn/pdf/publ/7-041.pdf |title=International Financial Flows and Transactions Taxes: Survey and Options |author=[[Paul Bernd Spahn]] |date= June 16, 1995|work= |publisher= University of Frankfurt/Main; Paper originally published with the [[International Monetary Fund]] as Working Paper WP/95/60.|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, [[Belgium]] will introduce the Spahn tax once all countries of the [[eurozone]] introduce a similar law.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Central Bank|ECB]] (2004). [http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2004_34_f_sign.pdf Opinion of the European Central Bank (CON/2004/34)]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005 former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel called for a European Union Tobin tax which he thought would base the community's financial structure on more stable and independent grounds. However, the proposal was rejected by the European Commission.

===Special Drawing Rights===
On September 19, 2001, retired speculator [[George Soros]] put forward a proposal, [[special drawing rights]] or SDRs that the rich countries would pledge for the purpose of providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the [[Tobin tax]] idea. He stated, "I think there is a case for a Tobin tax... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets. It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/soros.html Asia Society: Speeches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==

===Impacts===
In 1994, Canadian economist Rodney Schmidt noted that "in two-thirds of all the outright forward and currency [[Currency swap|swap transactions]], the money moved into another currency for fewer than seven days. In only 1 per cent did the money stay for as long as one year. While the volatile exchange rates caused by all this rapid movement posed problems for national economies, it was the bread and butter of those playing the [[currency markets]]. Without constant fluctuations in the currency markets, Schmidt noted, there was little opportunity for profit."&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/44/101.html |title= The Cult of impotence; Making Sure the Rich Stay Rich|author=[[Linda McQuaig]] |date= March 22, 1998|work= |publisher= [[Toronto Star]]; republished by Hartford Web Publishing  |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This certainly seemed to suggest the interests of currency traders and the interests of ordinary citizens were operating at cross-purposes."&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt;

"Schmidt also noted another interesting aspect of the foreign- exchange market: The dominant players were the [[private bank]]s, which had huge pools of capital and access to information about currency values. Since much of the market involved moving large sums of money (typically in the tens of millions of dollars) for very short periods of time (often less than a day), banks were perfectly positioned to participate. Among [[Currency swap|swap transactions]], which represented a major chunk of the foreign exchange market, 86 per cent of the transactions were actually between banks."&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt;

A representative of a “pro Tobin tax” NGO argued as follows: "[The Tobin tax] is designed to reduce the power financial markets have to determine the economic policies of national governments. Traditionally, a country’s [[central bank]] buys and sells its own currency on international markets to keep its value relatively stable. The bank buys back its currency when a ‘glut’ caused by an investor selloff threatens to reduce the currency’s value. In the past, most central banks had enough cash in reserve to offset any selloff or ‘attack’. However, this is no longer the case. Speculators now have more cash than all the world’s central banks put together. Official global [[foreign exchange reserve|reserves]] are less than half the value of one day of global foreign-exchange turnover. Many countries are simply unable to protect their currencies from speculative attack."&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newint.org/issue320/tobin.htm |title= Time for Tobin!|author=Robin Round |date= January–February 2000|work= |publisher= [[New Internationalist]]|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By cutting down on the overall volume of foreign-exchange transactions, a Tobin Tax would mean that central banks would not need as much reserve money to defend their currency. The tax would allow governments the freedom to act in the best interests of their own economic development, rather than being forced to shape fiscal and monetary policies according to demands of fickle financial markets."&lt;ref name="Robin"/&gt;

==Implemented of a Tobin tax==
In early November 2007, a regional Tobin tax was adopted by the [[Bank of the South]] in [[Latin America]], after an initiative of Presidents [[Hugo Chavez]] from [[Venezuela]] and [[Néstor Kirchner]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinpermiso.info/textos/index.php?id=1496 SIN PERMISO - artículos en la WEB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electoral College''' ({{lang-de|Kur}}) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was the gathering of [[prince elector]]s in order to vote for the next [[King of the Romans]] and [[Roman-German Emperor|Emperor]]. The German name of this gathering, ''Kur'', is derived from the [[Middle High German]] ''kur'' or ''kure'' ("election").

Initially all the so-called "great ones of the Empire" (''Große des Reiches'') were entitled to vote, but by the second half of the 13th century, only the [[prince electors]] were entitled to participate in the [[royal election]].

'''Europalia''' is a major [[international]] [[arts festival]] held every two years to celebrate one invited country’s [[cultural heritage]]. Europalia was established in [[Brussels]] in 1969, and from the beginning Europalia was designed to be a [[multidisciplinary]] cultural festival.

Its name is a combination of two words: “[[Europe]]” and “[[Opalia]],” an [[ancient Roman]] [[harvest festival]] held in mid-December in honour of [[Ops]], earth-goddess and fertility deity. Her name lies at the root of the [[Latin]] word “Opus”, that denotes a work of art.

The main Europalia events traditionally take place in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] capital but many other cities across the country also host exhibitions and performances. For several years other European cities (in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]]) have been associated with Europalia and also offer activities on the festival programme.

From the beginning of October to January, the culture of the invited country is illustrated in a prestigious series of exhibitions – [[ancient art|ancient]], [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], [[photography]], [[craft]]s, mode and design – and also a variety of events : [[orchestra]]s, [[musical ensemble]]s and [[solo (music)|soloist]]s, [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[literature|literary]] and [[science|scientific]] colloquia, [[academic conference|conferences]], [[film|cinema]] retrospectives, [[folklore|folkloric]] and popular traditional performances, [[gastronomy]] combine with exhibitions to offer the most complete view possible of a country’s arts and culture. This is the highly original formula of Europalia.

Each festival develops a partnership, not only with the chosen country but also with prominent [[museum]]s, [[cultural center|cultural centres]] and [[performing arts center|performance halls]] in Belgium and neighbouring countries. The festival expenses are shared between Belgium and the invited country. Europalia is financially supported by Belgium’s national, regional and community governments and numerous private companies.

Europalia calls on the collaboration of the most renowned international specialists to help conceive the festival as well as to participate in [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquia]] and conferences. Europalia events are extensively covered by [[television]], [[radio]] and [[print media]], and attract a large European audience, eager to discover a country’s cultural treasures assembled exceptionally for more than three months in this important festival.

In the 19th century, [[Napoleon]] took power and established the [[First French Empire]]. His subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the course of continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. France was a [[Triple Entente|major participant]] in [[World War I]], from which it [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)|emerged victorious]], and was one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]], but came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation]] by the [[Axis powers]] in 1940.  Following [[liberation of France|liberation]] in 1944, a [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was established and later dissolved in the course of the [[Algerian War]].  The [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], led by [[Charles de Gaulle]], was formed in 1958 and remains today.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of France}}

Originally applied to the whole [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], the name "France" comes from the [[Latin]] "{{lang|la|[[Francia]]}}", or "country of the [[Franks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_history.shtml |title=History of France |publisher=Discoverfrance.net |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824051936/http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_history.shtml |archivedate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern France is still named today "Francia" in Italian and Spanish, "Frankreich" ("Frankish Empire") in German and "Frankrijk" in Dutch, all of which have more or less the same historical meaning.

There are various theories as to the origin of the name Frank. Following the precedents of [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Jacob Grimm]],&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Walter Copland (1857). The Franks, from Their First Appearance in History to the Death of King Pepin.

The concept of [[Gaul]] emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the [[Rhine]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France are roughly the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic ''Gauls''. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences.

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region ''[[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]]'' ("Our Province"), which over time evolved into the name [[Provence]] in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZEIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |title=Provence in Stone |work=Life |page=77 |date=13 July 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into Roman provinces.&lt;ref name=c53&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including [[Lugdunum]] (present-day [[Lyon]]), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.&lt;ref name=c53 /&gt; These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a [[Roman Forum|forum]], a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], a [[Circus (building)|circus]], an [[amphitheatre]] and [[thermal bath]]s. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the French language evolved). The [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] merged with the [[Celtic polytheism|Gallic paganism]] into the same [[syncretism]].

From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its [[limes|fortified borders]] being attacked on several occasions by [[barbarian]]s.&lt;ref name=c77&gt;Carpentier et al. 2000, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 312, Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantin I]] converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the [[Migration Period|Barbarian Invasions]] resumed,&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], such as the [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul, Spain and other parts of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapsing Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|alt=animated gif showing expansion of Franks across Europe|Frankish expansion from 481 to 843/870.]]
At the end of the [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the [[Domain of Soissons|Kingdom of Syagrius]]. Simultaneously, [[Britons (historical)|Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled the western part of [[Armorica]]. As a result, the Armorican [[peninsula]] was renamed [[Brittany]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived and independent [[petty kingdom]]s arose in this region.

The pagan Franks, from whom the ancient name of "Francie" was derived, originally settled the north part of [[Gaul]], but under [[Clovis I]] conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul. In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than [[Arianism]]; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" (''{{lang-fr|La fille aînée de l'Église|links=no}}'') by the papacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |title=Faith of the Eldest Daughter&amp;nbsp;– Can France retain her Catholic heritage? |publisher=Wf-f.org |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112834/http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French kings would be called "the Most Christian Kings of France" (''{{lang|und|Rex Christianissimus}}'').

The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]] and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]], except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where [[Germanic languages]] emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The [[Roi fainéant|last Merovingian kings]] [[Power behind the throne|lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the Palace|mayors of the palace]] (head of household). One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated an [[Islamic invasion of Gaul]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son, [[Charlemagne]], reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of [[Normandy]]) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

[[File:Chateau de Chenonceau.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Château de Chenonceau]], nowadays part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]], was built in the early 16th century.]]
The French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|official language of France]] and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the [[Italian Wars]], between France, [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Refusing to accept the Spanish-Portuguese claims of supremacy in the [[New World]], King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] ordered his [[privateer]]s to sail against his Spanish rival, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who ruled as Holy Roman Emperor from 1519 until 1556. The Emperor's realm extended from Spain to parts of what are now Italy, Austria, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. French explorers, such as [[Jacques Cartier]] or [[Samuel de Champlain]], claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the [[French colonial empire|First French colonial empire]]. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were murdered in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day |title=Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wars of Religion were ended by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.

Under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], the energetic [[Cardinal Richelieu]] promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence ([[dueling]], carrying weapons, and maintaining private army). By the end of 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force" as the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985).

The war cost France 300,000 casualties. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]], a period of trouble known as the [[Fronde]] occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and [[sovereign court]]s as a reaction to the [[Absolutism (European history)|rise of royal absolute power]] in France.

The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into [[courtier]]s at the [[Palace of Versailles]], Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the [[Demographics of France|most populous country in Europe]] and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Language and Diplomacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/language-and-diplomacy/ |title=Language and Diplomacy |publisher=Nakedtranslations.com |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721070018/http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/language-and-diplomacy/ |archivedate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.

Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], Louis XIV's great-grandson, France lost [[New France]] and most of its [[French India|Indian possessions]] after its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], which ended in 1763. Its [[Metropolitan France|European territory]] kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] (1766) and [[Corsica]] (1770).

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Louis XV's grandson, actively [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported the Americans]], who were seeking their [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]] (realised in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]). The financial crisis that followed France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|discovery of oxygen]] (1778) and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]] (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]], took part in the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[authority]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.

=== Revolutionary France (1789–1799) ===
{{Main|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789–1799)|French Revolution}}
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[French Revolution]].]]
Facing financial troubles, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] summoned the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] (gathering the three [[Estates of the realm]]) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the [[Commoner|Third Estate]] formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], signalling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]]. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, a date which would become [[Bastille Day|France's National Day]].

In early August 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[August Decrees|abolished the privileges]] of the [[French nobility|nobility]] such as [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]] and exclusive hunting rights.
Through the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789|Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" to "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.

In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] reorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous [[flight to Varennes]] (June 1791) seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.

In August 1791, the Emperor of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the [[French Constitution of 1791]], thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)|constitutional monarchy]]. In the newly established [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the '[[Girondins]]', who favored war with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and a group later called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s', who opposed such a war. A majority in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they [[French Revolutionary Wars|declared war on Austria]].{{efn-ur|The present-day state of [[Austria]] did not exist as such, its territory was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which also comprised the present-day states of [[Hungary]], [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648–1867)|Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia#Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1918)|Slovakia]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovenia#The Middle Ages to the early modern period|Slovenia]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]: that Habsburg Monarchy was usually called 'Austria'.}}

Ex-King Louis XVI was [[Trial of Louis XVI|convicted]] of [[treason]] and [[Execution of Louis XVI|guillotined in January 1793]].
France had declared war on England and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria, Great Britain and the Dutch Republic invaded France; in March, France created a "[[sister republic]]" in the "[[Republic of Mainz]]".

Also in March 1793, the [[War in the Vendée|civil war of the Vendée against Paris]] started, evoked by both the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790 and the nationwide army [[conscription]] early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too.
A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the '[[Girondins]]' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the Convention.
The counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vendée, by July had spread to [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], [[Normandy]], Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Terror in the French Revolution |first=Marisa |last=Dr Linton |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf |publisher=Kingston University |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''" Détruisez la Vendée !

Political disagreements and enmity in the [[National Convention]] between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined.
Meanwhile, [[French Revolutionary Wars|France's external wars]] in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium.
In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) religion and fair distribution of food.
Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the '[[French Directory|Directory]]'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and from royalism.

As a continuation of [[French Revolutionary Wars|the wars]] sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of [[Napoleonic Wars|European Coalitions]] declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstadt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] or [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Blanning"&gt;{{cite news |title=Napoleon and German identity |first=Tim |last=Blanning |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001329960 |newspaper=History Today |location=London |date=April 1998 |volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[Metric system]], the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. After the catastrophic [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy [[Bourbon Restoration#First Restoration (1814)|restored]]. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref name="Blanning" /&gt; After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the monarchy was [[Bourbon Restoration|re-established]] (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations.

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]]. In that year, French troops conquered [[Algeria]], establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. According to historian [[Ben Kiernan]], the French conquest and pacification of Algeria from 1830 until the early twentieth century slaughtered 825,000 Algerian people.

In 1848 general unrest led to the [[French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and male [[universal suffrage]], both briefly enacted during the French Revolution were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the [[President of France|president of the French Republic]], [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second French Empire|second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], in [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]] which resulted in the annexation of the [[duchy of Savoy]] and the [[county of Nice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

France had [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its [[List of largest empires|global overseas colonial empire]] extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the [[British Empire]].

Over the following year the Allies and the [[French Resistance]] emerged victorious over the [[Axis powers]] and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|wage war against Germany]] and to [[Épuration légale|purge collaborators from office]]. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a [[Social security in France|social security]] system). The GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], which saw spectacular economic growth (''les [[Trente Glorieuses]]''). France was one of the founding members of [[NATO]] (1949).

Despite its military victory, France granted [[French Évian Accords referendum, 1962|independence to Algerians]]. The war exacted a heavy human toll among the Algerian population. It resulted in some 500,000 deaths and 2,137,000 internally displaced Algerians.&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; A vestige of the colonial empire are the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|French overseas departments and territories]].

In the context of the [[Cold War]], de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern bloc]]s. To this end, he withdrew from [[NATO]]'s military integrated command, he launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]] and made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[Franco-German relations]] in order to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring a Europe of [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. In the wake of the series of worldwide [[protests of 1968]], the [[May 1968 in France|revolt of May 1968]] had an enormous social impact. In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal ([[secularism]], [[individualism]], [[sexual revolution]]). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.

In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]], but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the [[Eurozone]] in 1999, and signing the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025215249/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archivedate=25 October 2005 |title=Declaration by the Franco-German Defense and Security Council |publisher=Elysee.fr |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509044211/http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 May 2014 |title=France and NATO |work=La France à l'Otan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:France cities.png|thumb|alt=see description|upright=1.1|A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants.]]
[[File:Massif du Mont-Blanc (hiver panoramique).jpg|thumb|alt=Panorama of Mont Blanc mountain range above gray clouds under a blue sky|[[Mont Blanc]], the highest summit in Western Europe, marks the border with Italy.|upright=1.1]]
The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in [[Western Europe]] and is called [[Metropolitan France]], to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the [[North Sea]] in the north, the [[English Channel]] in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. It land borders consist of [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the northeast, Germany and [[Switzerland]] in the east, [[Italy]] and [[Monaco]] in the southeast, and [[Andorra]] and [[Spain]] in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as ''{{lang|fr|l'Hexagone}}'' ("The [[Hexagon]]"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is [[Corsica]]. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6° W]] and [[10th meridian east|10° E]], on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zone. Its continental part covers about 1000&amp;nbsp;km from north to south and from east to west.

France has several [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]] across the world, which are organised along different :
* In South America: [[French Guiana]].
* In the Atlantic Ocean: [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and, in the Antilles: [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barthélemy]].
* In the Pacific Ocean: [[French Polynesia]], the special collectivity of [[New Caledonia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[Clipperton Island]].
* In the Indian Ocean: [[Réunion island]], [[Mayotte]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Saint-Paul|St. Paul]] and [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] islands, and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]]
* In the Antarctic: [[Adélie Land]].

France has land borders with [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]] via [[French Guiana]] and with the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] through the French portion of [[Saint Martin]].

Metropolitan France covers {{convert|551500|km2|sqmi|0}},&lt;ref name=France /&gt; the largest among [[European Union]] members.&lt;ref name = superficy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm |title=Europa Official Site&amp;nbsp;– France |accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding [[Adélie Land]]), is {{convert|643801|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the [[Alps]] in the southeast, the [[Massif Central]] in the south central and [[Pyrenees]] in the southwest.

Due to its numerous [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest [[Exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4,260,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), just behind the EEZ of the United States (11,351,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 4,383,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia (8,148,250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 4,111,312&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.

=== Geology, topography and hydrography ===
[[File:Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil - Grotte du Grand Roc 13.JPG|thumb|Caves in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]], part of the [[UNESCO]] Prehistoric Sites and [[Lascaux|Decorated Caves]] of the [[Vézère|Vézère Valley]].]]
[[File:2013.07.05 roussillon - roque anthéron 172.JPG|thumb|Geological formations near [[Roussillon, Vaucluse]] dating back to [[Post-classical history]].]]
Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the [[Armorican Massif]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Morvan]], the [[Vosges]] and [[Ardennes]] ranges and the island of [[Corsica]] were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At {{convert|4810.45|m|ft|0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/mont-blanc-shrinks-by-45cm-in-two-years-20091106-i0kk.html |title=Mont Blanc shrinks by {{convert|45|cm|2 |abbr=on}} in two years |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; above sea level, [[Mont Blanc]], located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe.

Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the [[French Riviera]], coastal cliffs such as the [[Côte d'Albâtre]], and wide sandy plains in the [[Languedoc]]. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers [[Seine]], the [[Loire]], the [[Garonne]], the [[Rhône]] and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the [[Camargue]]. Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has {{convert|11|e6km2}} of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

=== Climate ===
Most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan France are located in the oceanic climate zone, Cfb and Cfc in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]. Corsica and a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the Csa and Csb zones. As the French metropolitan territory is relatively large, the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances:
* The west of France has strictly [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb)&amp;nbsp;– it extends from [[French Flanders|Flanders]] to the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide, narrower to the north and south but wider in [[Brittany]], which is almost entirely in this climate zone.
** The climate of the Southwest is also oceanic but warmer.
** The climate of the Northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier.
** Away from the coast, the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat. The Paris sedimentary basin and, more so, the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter. Therefore, most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones.
* The [[Continental climate|semi-continental climate]] (Dfa) of the north and centre-east (Alsace, plains of the Saône, the middle part of the Rhône, [[Dauphiné]], [[Auvergne]] and [[Savoy]]).
* The Mediterranean and the lower Rhône valley experience a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa and Csb) due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]] and [[Tramontane]] winds.
* The [[mountain climate|mountain (or alpine) climates]] (Dfc and ET) are confined to the [[French Alps|Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the summits of the [[Massif Central]], the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and the [[Vosges]].
* In the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]], there are three broad types of climate:
** A [[tropical climate]] (Am) in most overseas regions including eastern [[French Guiana]]: high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season.
** An [[equatorial climate]] (Af) in western [[French Guiana]]: high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year.
** A [[Subarctic climate|subpolar climate]] (Et) in [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and in most of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]: short mild summers and long very cold winters.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of France}}
The French Republic is divided into 18 [[Regions of France|regions]] (located in [[Europe]] and overseas), five [[Overseas collectivities of France|overseas collectivities]], one [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]], one special collectivity – [[New Caledonia]] and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – [[Clipperton Island|Clipperton]].

;Regions
{{France Regions Labelled Map}}

Since 2016 France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in [[metropolitan France]] (including the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La réforme territoriale |language=fr |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |publisher=[[Government of France]] |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230075909/http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |archivedate=30 December 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five located [[overseas region|overseas]].&lt;ref name=France /&gt; The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php |title=Departments of France |language=fr |publisher=Myfrenchproperty.com |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142645/http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[Réunion]]) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union.

The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 [[Cantons of France|cantons]].&lt;ref name=constituencies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&amp;ref_id=t_0203R |title=Circonscriptions administratives au 1er janvier 2015 : comparaisons régionales |trans-title=Administrative constituencies of 1 January 2015: regional comparisons |language=fr |publisher=[[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]] |accessdate=5 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033500/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&amp;ref_id=t_0203R |archivedate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cantons are then divided into 36,658 [[Communes of France|communes]], which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.&lt;ref name=constituencies /&gt; Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]].

The regions, departments and communes are all known as [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and definitely abolished by the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946.

;Overseas territories and collectivities
In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] ([[French Polynesia]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]), one ''[[sui generis]]'' collectivity ([[New Caledonia]]), one [[overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] ([[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean ([[Clipperton Island]]).

Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the [[CFP franc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetahititraveler.com/touristinfo/moneycurr.asp |title=Currency and Exchange Rate |publisher=Thetahititraveler.com |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717034857/http://www.thetahititraveler.com/touristinfo/moneycurr.asp |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2085rank.html?countryName=France&amp;countryCode=fr&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;rank=7#fr |title=2085rank |website=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive branch itself has two leaders: the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], currently [[Emmanuel Macron]], who is [[head of state]] and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=The 5-year term: referendum of 24 September 2000 |language=fr |url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/quinquennat/index.shtml |title=Le quinquennat : le référendum du 24 Septembre 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812105736/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/quinquennat/index.shtml |archive-date=12 August 2010 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government, led by the president-appointed [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].

Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/election_senateurs.html |title=The senatorial elections |website=Sénate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politique.net/2007081801-le-role-du-senat.htm |title=Le role du Sénat |trans-title=What is the purpose of the Senate? |date=18 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618060857/http://www.politique.net/2007081801-le-role-du-senat.htm |archive-date=18 June 2010 |dead-url=no |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.

Until World War II, [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] were a strong political force in France, embodied by the [[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party]] which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] and its successor the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the [[Gaullist Party]], whose name changed over time: the [[Rally of the French People]] (1947), the [[Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (1958), the [[Rally for the Republic]] (1976), the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (2007) and [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, [[Radical centrism|radical centrist]] party [[En Marche!]] became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of France}}
France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal]] system;&lt;ref name=France /&gt; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]). Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]] (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: ''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.'' That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]

French law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' laws are prohibited).&lt;ref&gt;In European countries, legal doctrine has long faced the question of succession of criminal laws in time: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=La rivendicazione di Gallo |journal=Mondoperaio edizione online |date=2015 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89426924}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] and administrative courts are headed by the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Council of State]].

To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the ''[[Journal officiel de la République française]]''.

France does not recognise [[religious law]] as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, "offences against [[Decency|public decency]]" (''contraires aux bonnes mœurs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble à l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, [[Pacte civil de solidarité|civil unions]] for homosexual couples are permitted, and since May 2013, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption]] are legal in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=François Hollande signs same-sex marriage into law |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130518-france-gay-marriage-law-adoption |accessdate=27 June 2013 |publisher=France 24 |date=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|as old as 1881]].

[[Freedom of religion in France|Freedom of religion]] is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a [[Inner Six|founding member]].

The French Armed Forces (''Forces armées françaises'') are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] as supreme commander. They consist of the [[French Army]] (''Armée de Terre''), [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale'', formerly called ''Armée de Mer''), the [[French Air Force]] (''Armée de l'Air''), the French Strategic Nuclear Force (''Force Nucléaire Stratégique'', nicknamed ''Force de Frappe'' or "Strike Force") and the Military Police called [[National Gendarmerie]] (''Gendarmerie nationale''), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the [[List of countries by number of troops|largest armed forces]] in the world and the largest in the EU.

While the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the [[Minister of the Armed Forces (France)|Ministry of the Armed Forces]], it is operationally attached to the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]] as far as its civil police duties are concerned.

When acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the [[Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie]] (''Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (''Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (''Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (''Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale'', or in short ''Gendarmerie mobile'') which have the task to maintain public order.

The following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] (''Garde républicaine'') which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (''Gendarmerie maritime'') serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (''Prévôté''), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie.

As far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (''Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure'') is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (''Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur'') is a division of the National Police Force (''Direction générale de la Police Nationale''), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national [[conscription]] since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml La fin du service militaire obligatoire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808230428/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml |date=8 August 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– La documentation française&lt;/ref&gt;

France has a special military corps, the [[French Foreign Legion]], founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called ''Tercio'', was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish).

France is a [[Big Five (United Nations)|permanent member of the Security Council of the UN]], and a [[List of states with nuclear weapons#Five nuclear-weapon states under the NPT|recognised nuclear state]] since 1960. France has signed and ratified the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbto.org/the-treaty/status-of-signature-and-ratification/ |title=Status of signature and ratification |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. France's annual military expenditure in 2011 was US$62.5 billion, or 2.3%, [[List of countries by military expenditure share of GDP|of its GDP]] making it the [[List of countries by military expenditures|fifth biggest military spender in the world]] after the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="SIPRI Yearbook 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending/ |title=The 15 countries with the highest military spending worldwide in 2012 (in billion U.S. dollars) |publisher=Sipri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as "''[[Force de Frappe]]''"), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four [[Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'']] class submarines equipped with [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|''ASMP'']] medium-range [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-ground missiles]] with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear warheads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Paix et les Conflits, [http://obsarm.org/obsnuc/puissances-mondiales/france-forces.html ''Etat des forces nucléaires françaises au 15 août 2004''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725004911/http://obsarm.org/obsnuc/puissances-mondiales/france-forces.html |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]] long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM)]] attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]] [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]. The new [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale F3]] aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ''ASMP-A'' missile with a nuclear warhead.

Since the [[Middle Ages]], France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, [[Pope Sylvester II]], born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the [[abacus]] and [[armillary sphere]], and introduced [[Arabic numerals]] and [[clock]]s to Northern and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog |title=Lives of the Necromancers |author=William Godwin |year=1876 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Paris]], founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;André Thuilier, Histoire de l'université de Paris et de la Sorbonne, Paris, Nouvelle librairie de France, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, mathematician [[René Descartes]] defined a [[Rationalism|method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge]], while [[Blaise Pascal]] became famous for his work on [[probability]] and [[fluid mechanics]]. They were both key figures of the [[Scientific revolution]], which blossomed in Europe during this period. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] was founded by [[Louis XIV]] to encourage and protect the spirit of French [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest [[academy of sciences|academies of sciences]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was marked by the work of biologist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] and chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], who discovered the role of [[oxygen]] in [[combustion]], while [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] published the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', which aimed to give access to "useful knowledge" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Peter, A social history of knowledge: from Gutenberg to Diderot, Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 2000, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Industrial Revolution]], the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as [[Augustin Fresnel]], founder of modern [[optics]], [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] who laid the foundations of [[thermodynamics]], and [[Louis Pasteur]], a pioneer of [[microbiology]]. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist [[Henri Poincaré]], physicists [[Henri Becquerel]], [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]], remained famous for their work on [[radioactivity]], the physicist [[Paul Langevin]] and virologist [[Luc Montagnier]], co-discoverer of [[HIV AIDS]]. [[Hand transplantation]] was developed on 23 September 1998 in [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] by a team assembled from different countries around the world including [[Jean-Michel Dubernard]] who, shortly thereafter, performed the first successful double hand transplant.&lt;ref name ="dubernard1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lanzetta M |title=Second report (1998–2006) of the International Registry of Hand and Composite Tissue Transplantation |journal=Transpl Immunol. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17584595 |doi=10.1016/j.trim.2007.03.002 |author2=Petruzzo P |author3=Dubernard JM |display-authors=3 |last4=Margreiter |first4=Raimund |last5=Schuind |first5=Frederic |last6=Breidenbach |first6=Warren |last7=Nolli |first7=Roberta |last8=Schneeberger |first8=Stephan |last9=Van Holder |first9=Carlo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote surgery|Telesurgery]] was developed by [[Jacques Marescaux]] and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, [[Lindbergh Operation]]).&lt;ref name=istmarescaux&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghodoussi |first=Dr. |title=Media Collection |url=http://www.intersurgtech.com/media.html |publisher=Interface Surgical Technologies, LLC |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[face transplant]] was first done on 27 November 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='My face transplant saved me' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6058696.stm |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2006 |first=Naomi |last=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4484728.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title=Woman has first face transplant |date=30 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr [[Bernard Devauchelle]].

{{Main|Demographics of France|French people}}
[[File:France population density 40pc.png|thumb|alt=map of population in France|Population density in the French Republic at the 1999 census.]]

With an estimated total population of 67.15 million people {{as of|2017|October|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Démographie – Population au début du mois – France (inclus Mayotte à partir de 2014) |publisher=Insee |language=fr |url=https://www.bdm.insee.fr/bdm2/affichageSeries?idbank=001641607&amp;page=tableau&amp;request_locale=en |trans-title=Demography – Population at the beginning of the month – France (including Mayotte since 2014) }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65 million in metropolitan France, France is the [[List of countries by population#List|20th most populous country in the world]] and the third-most populous in Europe. France is also second most populous country in the [[European Union]] after [[Germany]].

France is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a fairly high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, France was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006, with the natural growth rate (excess of births over deaths) rising to 300,000 and with the immigration the population grew with almost 400,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1280882#titre-bloc-4 |title=Bilan démographique 2006 : un excédent naturel record |publisher=Insee |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the late 2010s it fell to 200,000. This was the highest rate since the end of the [[baby boom]] in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the [[total fertility rate]] from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. {{as of|January 2017}} the fertility rate was 1.93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bilan démographique 2016 |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2554860 |publisher=Insee |accessdate=19 January 2017 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=population&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1332 |title=Bilan démographique 2010 |publisher=Insee |accessdate=20 January 2011 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/sd2008/dd/excel/sd2008_t44_fe.xls |title=Tableau 44&amp;nbsp;– Taux de fécondité générale par âge de la mère |publisher=Insee |accessdate=20 January 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427013815/http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/sd2008/dd/excel/sd2008_t44_fe.xls |archivedate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
Most [[French people]] are of [[Celtic peoples|Celtic]] ([[Gauls]]) origin, with an admixture of [[Italic peoples|Italic]] ([[Roman Empire|Romans]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Franks]]) groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean-Louis Brunaux |title=Nos ancêtres les Gaulois |trans-title=Our ancestors the Gauls |editor=Seuil |date=2008 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different regions reflect this diverse heritage, with notable [[Bretons|Breton]] elements in western France, [[Aquitani]]an in the southwest, [[Scandinavia]]n in the northwest, [[Alemanni]]c in the northeast and [[Ligures|Ligurian]] influence in the southeast. Large-scale [[immigration]] over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yazid Sabeg |author2=Laurence Méhaignerie |author1-link=Yazid Sabeg |language=fr |url=http://www.conventioncitoyenne.com/documents/oubliesdelegalite.pdf |title=Les oubliés de l'égalité des chances |trans-title=The forgotten of equal opportunities |publisher=[[Institut Montaigne]] |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13377324 |title=France's ethnic minorities: To count or not to count |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE, for its acronym in French) published a study which reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012.
According to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2014/11/28/qui-sont-les-nouveaux-immigres-qui-vivent-en-france-1751452-705.php |title=Qui sont les nouveaux immigrés qui vivent en France ? |language=fr |trans-title=Who are the new immigrants living in France? |website=SudOuest |date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is French,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145028/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/constitution/constitution2.htm La Constitution- La Constitution du 4 Octobre 1958]&amp;nbsp;– Légifrance&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Romance language]] derived from [[Latin]]. Since 1635, the [[Académie française]] has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French Flemish|Flemish]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialect), [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] ([[German language|German]] dialect), [[Basque language|Basque]], and others. (see [[Languages of France]]) [[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language of Corsica until May 9, 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Abalain, Hervé, (2007) ''Le français et les langues historiques de la France'', Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]]. The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]].

From the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a [[lingua franca]] among the educated classes of Europe.&lt;ref name=exception&gt;Joffre Agnes [http://www.franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html ls the French obsession with "cultural exception" declining?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017023619/http://franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html |date=17 October 2011 }}.

For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by [[Henri Grégoire]] found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]] or [[Occitan language|Occitan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 Rapport Grégoire an II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405022802/http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century.

As a result of France's extensive [[French colonial empire|colonial ambitions]] between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |title=The International Education Site |publisher=Intstudy.com |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227075911/http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the [[West Indies]] and the South Pacific ([[French Polynesia]]). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.

It is estimated that between 300 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about-france.com/french/french-language.htm |title=French: one of the world's main languages |publisher=About-france.com |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516223437/http://about-france.com/french/french-language.htm |archivedate=16 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 million&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/francophonie/francophonie.htm Qu'est-ce que la Francophonie ?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623113030/http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/francophonie/francophonie.htm |date=23 June 2011 }}&amp;nbsp;– [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]&lt;/ref&gt; people worldwide can speak French, either as a [[mother tongue]] or a [[second language]].

According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the [[European Union]] and carried in France by the [[Insee]] and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the first mother tongue of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.30 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 0.96 million), Spanish (1.2%, 0.77 million) and Italian (1.0%, 0.64 million).

France is a [[secular]] country, and [[freedom of religion]] is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of ''[[laïcité]]'', a strict [[separation of church and state]] under which public life is kept completely secular.

According to a survey held in 2016 by [[Institut Montaigne]] and [[Institut français d'opinion publique]] (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian as of that year; at the same time 39.6% of the population had no religion ([[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]]), 5.6% were [[Muslim]]s, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.&lt;ref name="2016Montaigne-IFOP"/&gt; Estimates of the number of [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] vary widely.

In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornament. After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, France established ''[[laïcité]]'' by passage of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206213909/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |archivedate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1905 the French Government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]]). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;''Joy of Sects'', Sam Jordison, 2006, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Certain groups, such as [[Scientology]], [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]], are considered [[cult]]s ("''[[sect#Corresponding words in other European languages|sectes]]''" in French),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |title=Commission d'enquête sur les sectes |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore do not have the same status as recognised religions in France. ''Secte'' is considered a pejorative term in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Society2.html |title=Society2 ; religion in France ; beliefs ; secularism (laicité) |publisher=Understandfrance.org |accessdate=20 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916220047/http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Society2.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df=}}{{Self-published source|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in France}}

[[File:Absolute BNUS 01.JPG|thumb|alt=Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire at Strasbourg, stone building with portico by a park|The [[Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire|National and University Library]] on the campus of the [[University of Strasbourg]].]]

In 1802, [[Napoleon]] created the [[lycée]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/352505/lycee |title=Lycée |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is [[Jules Ferry]] who is considered to be the father of the French modern school, which is free, secular, and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605080546/http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/site-jeunes/laicite/fiche-dates/fiche-1881-1882/fiche.pdf 1881–1882 : Lois Ferry École publique gratuite, laïque et obligatoire]. Assemblé Nationale&lt;/ref&gt; (school attendance in France is now compulsory until the age of 16&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.senat.fr/rap/l97-504/l97-5041.html II. L'évolution du contenu de l'obligation scolaire]. Sénat.fr&lt;/ref&gt;).

Nowadays, the schooling system in France is centralised, and is composed of three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/fra?lg=en |title=Compare your country – PISA 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]]. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (''école maternelle'') and elementary school (''école élémentaire''). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (''collège'') and leads to the national certificate ([[Diplôme national du brevet]]). The second is offered in high schools (''lycée'') and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (''baccalauréat'', available in professional, technical or general flavours) or certificate of professional competence (''certificat d'aptitude professionelle'').

[[Education in France#Higher education|Higher education]] is divided between [[Universities in France|public universities]] and the prestigious and selective ''[[Grandes écoles]]'', such as [[Sciences Po Paris]] for Political studies, [[HEC Paris]] for Economics, [[Polytechnique]] and the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] that produce high-profile engineers, or the [[École nationale d'administration]] for careers in the [[Grands corps de l'État|Grands Corps]] of the state. The ''Grandes écoles'' have been criticised for alleged [[elitism]];&lt;ref name="gécoles"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/formation/2010/01/08/01015-20100108ARTFIG00525-les-grandes-ecoles-dans-la-tourmente-.php Les grandes écoles dans la tourmente]&amp;nbsp;– [[Le Figaro]]&lt;/ref&gt; they have produced many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.

Since higher education is funded by the state, the fees are very low; tuition fees vary from €150 to €700 depending on the university and the different levels of education (''licence, master, doctorate''). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. The tuition fees in public engineering schools are comparable to universities, albeit a little higher (around €700). However they can reach €7000 a year for private engineering schools, while business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15000 a year. Health insurance for students is free until the age of 20.

Since Liberty is part of the motto "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]", as the French put it, this painting has become the primary symbol of the French Republic]]
France has been a centre of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.

The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting [[Monument historique|historical monuments]]. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a [[cultural exception]] to defend audiovisual products made in the country.

France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 [[List of museums in France|museums]] welcoming more than 50&amp;nbsp;million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, "Cultura statistics", [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/culture/deps/2008/pdf/minichiffrescles2010-en.pdf Key figures]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency [[Centre des monuments nationaux]], which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.

The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many [[List of castles in France|castles]]) and religious buildings ([[List of cathedrals in France|cathedrals]], [[List of basilicas in France|basilicas]], [[church (building)|church]]es), but also statutes, memorials and [[Gardens of France|gardens]].

=== Art ===
{{Main|French art}}

The origins of French art were very much influenced by [[Flemish art]] and by [[Italian art]] at the time of the Renaissance. [[Jean Fouquet]], the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting [[School of Fontainebleau]] was directly inspired by Italian painters such as [[Primaticcio]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]], who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of [[Baroque era]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy.

[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting by Claude Monet of woman with parasol facing left in field from the Musée d'Orsay|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Musée d'Orsay]]).]]
The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists.

French artists developed the [[rococo]] style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon]] favoured artists of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and the highly influential [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] defined the style known as [[Academism]]. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-François Millet]], a style that eventually evolved into [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]].

In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], Claude Monet and [[Auguste Renoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/guide-to-impressionism/guide-to-impressionism |title=Guide to Impressionism |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation of impressionist-style painters, [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Georges Seurat]], were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/063/article_34792.asp Le néo-impressionnisme de Seurat à Paul Klee] 15 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[fauvism|fauvist artists]] [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]].&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Art (United States), [http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm The Fauves (dossier)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105195501/http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm |date=5 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/culturefr/articles/098/article_63189.asp Vlaminck, version fauve], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by [[Georges Braque]] and the Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned [[Musée du Louvre]], such as [[Mona Lisa]], also known as La Joconde. While the [[Louvre Palace]] has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station [[Gare d'Orsay]], in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).&lt;ref&gt;Musée d'Orsay (official website), History of the museum&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-museum/home.html From station to museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html |title=History of the painting collection |publisher=Musee-orsay.fr |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern works are presented in the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], which moved in 1976 to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]].

During the Middle Ages, many fortified [[castle]]s were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are [[Chinon (castle)|Chinon]], [[Château d'Angers]], the massive [[Château de Vincennes]] and the so-called [[Cathar castles]]. During this era, France had been using [[Romanesque architecture]] like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint Sernin Basilica]] in [[Toulouse, France|Toulouse]], the largest romanesque church in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeupclose.com/article/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ |title=Toulouse's Saint Sernin, Largest Romanesque Church in Europe |publisher=Europeupclose.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204930/http://www.europeupclose.com/article/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac Abbey]].

The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the [[French Renaissance]] and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the [[Loire Valley]], from 1450 with as a first reference the [[Château de Montsoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.valdeloire-travel.com/en/product/chateau-de-montsoreau/|title=Come to visit the most beautiful village in France in Montsoreau|work=Val de Loire Travel|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.valdeloire.org/Connaitre/Au-fil-de-l-histoire/Le-Val-de-Loire-siege-du-pouvoir-royal/Charles-VII-et-Louis-XI|title=Charles VII et Louis XI -Know -Val de Loire patrimoine mondial|last=Loire|first=Mission Val de|date=|website=loirevalley-worldheritage.org|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such residential castles were the [[Château de Chambord]], the [[Château de Chenonceau]], or the [[Château d'Amboise]].

Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, [[French Baroque architecture|Baroque architecture]] replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Claude Lébedel&amp;nbsp;– Les Splendeurs du Baroque en France: ''Histoire et splendeurs du baroque en France'' page 9: "Si en allant plus loin, on prononce les mots 'art baroque en France', on provoque alors le plus souvent une moue interrogative, parfois seulement étonnée, parfois franchement réprobatrice: Mais voyons, l'art baroque n'existe pas en France!"&lt;/ref&gt; In the secular domain, the [[Palace of Versailles]] has many baroque features. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at [[Les Invalides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jLmFbEdqBDUC&amp;pg=PA86 |title=Architecture and the Politics of Gender in Early Modern Europe |first=Helen |last=Hills |page=86 |isbn=978-0-7546-0309-2 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the [[Place Stanislas]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. On the military architectural side, [[Vauban]] designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1283 |title=Fortifications of Vauban |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/ |title=Official site of the UNESCO |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Revolution, the [[Republicanism|Republicans]] favoured [[Neoclassicism]] although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the [[Panthéon, Paris|Parisian Pantheon]] or the [[Capitole de Toulouse]]. Built during the first French Empire, the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Église de la Madeleine|Sainte Marie-Madeleine]] represent the best example of [[Empire style]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paris: City Guide |year=2008 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74059-850-4 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OtabdzMdbboC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Napoleon III]], a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque [[Palais Garnier]] were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century, [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic [[Eiffel Tower]].

In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |title=Urbanisme : Des gratte-ciel à Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?nbsp;– Posez vos questions |publisher=MYTF1News |author=Henri SECKEL |date=8 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029152433/http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729154317/http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html |date=29 July 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– NCI Business Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|French literature}}

The earliest French literature dates from the [[Middle Age]]s, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' and ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]''. Other authors are known, for example [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].

Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and the various [[chansons de geste]]. The ''Roman de Renart'', written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the mediaeval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was [[François Rabelais]], whose novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' has remained famous and appreciated until now. [[Michel de Montaigne]] was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', created the literary genre of the essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |title=Montaigne |publisher=Humanistictexts.org |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525201508/http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French poetry]] during that century was embodied by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]. Both writers founded the [[La Pléiade]] literary movement.

During the 17th century, [[Madame de La Fayette]] published anonymously ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'', a novel that is considered to be one of the very first [[psychological novel]]s of all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiodramareviews.com/id438.html |title=La Princesse de Cleves by Madame de Lafayette, adapted by Jo Clifford |publisher=Radiodramareviews.com |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810091607/http://www.radiodramareviews.com/id438.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean de La Fontaine]] is one of the most famous [[fabulist]]s of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching [[wisdom]] and [[common sense]] to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as "''À l'œuvre, on connaît l'artisan."[A workman is known by his chips].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean de La Fontaine]], ''Fables'' (1668–1679), I., 21, ''Les Frelons et les Mouches à miel''; reported in Thomas Benfield Harbottle and Philip Hugh Dalbiac, ''Dictionary of Quotations (French and Italian)'' (1904), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French literary figures.jpg|thumb|alt=see description|French literary figures. Clockwise from top left: [[Molière]] is the most played author in the [[Comédie-Française]];&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.comedie-francaise.fr/histoire-et-patrimoine?id=525 Auteurs et répertoires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919234251/http://comedie-francaise.fr/histoire-et-patrimoine?id=525 |date=19 September 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Official site of the Comédie Française&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Hugo]] is one of the most important French novelists and poets; 19th-century poet, writer and translator [[Charles Baudelaire]]; 20th-century philosopher and novelist [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].]]

[[Jean Racine]], whose incredible mastery of the [[alexandrine]] and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as ''[[Phèdre]]'' or ''[[Britannicus]]''. He is, along with [[Pierre Corneille]] (''[[Le Cid]]'') and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of the France's [[Louis XIV of France#Patronage o the arts|golden age]]. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the [[Western literature]],&lt;ref&gt;"Author of some of the finest comedies in the history of the theater". Hartnoll, Phyllis (ed.). The Oxford Companion to the Theatre, 1983, Oxford University Press, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; wrote [[Molière#List of major works|dozens of plays]], including ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', ''[[L'Avare]]'', ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', and ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as "the language of Molière" (''la langue de Molière''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randall |first=Colin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1475046/France-looks-to-the-law-to-save-the-language-of-Moliere.html |title=France looks to the law to save the language of Molière |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; just like English is considered as "the language of [[Shakespeare]]".

French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Denis Diderot]]'s best-known works are ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' and ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]''. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and [[obscurantism]]. During that same century, [[Charles Perrault]] was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including ''[[Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Bluebeard]]''. At the start of the 19th century, [[symbolist poetry]] was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://users.skynet.be/litterature/symbolisme/symbolismefrancais.htm Le symbolisme français]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as "the greatest French writer of all times"&lt;ref name=victor&gt;{{cite web |title=Victor Hugo est le plus grand écrivain français  |url=http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_75.pdf|format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723121408/http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_75.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for excelling in all [[literary genre]]s.

''[[Les Contemplations]]'' and ''[[La Légende des siècles]]'' are considered as "poetic masterpieces",&lt;ref name = hugo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/victor-hugo-criticism/hugo-victor |title=Victor Hugo 1802–1885 |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, [[Dante]] and [[Homer]].&lt;ref name = hugo /&gt; His novel ''[[Les Misérables]]'' is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/100_novel.html |title=All-Time 100 Best Novels List |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' has remained immensely popular.

Other major authors of that century include [[Alexandre Dumas]] (''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte-Cristo]]''), [[Jules Verne]] (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''), [[Émile Zola]] (''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]''), [[Honoré de Balzac]] (''[[La Comédie humaine]]''), [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]] (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]''), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.

=== Philosophy ===
{{Main|French philosophy}}
Medieval philosophy was dominated by [[Scholasticism]] until the emergence of [[Humanism in France|Humanism]] in the Renaissance. [[Modern philosophy]] began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. Descartes revitalised [[Western philosophy]], which had been declined after the Greek and Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.friesian.com/hist-2.htm |title=The Beginning of Modern Sciences |publisher=Friesian.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Frans Hals painting of René Descartes facing right in black coat and white collar|[[René Descartes]], founder of modern philosophy.]]

French philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Baron de Montesquieu]] theorised the principle of [[separation of powers]], which has been implemented in all [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] since [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|it was first applied in the United States]]. [[Voltaire]] came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.

19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Auguste Comte]], who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis de Bonald]] and [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Félicité Robert de Lamennais]], who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman [[Edmund Burke]], one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of [[positivism]], which [[Émile Durkheim]] reformulated as a basis for social research.

In the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]] thrived with thinkers such as [[Henri Bergson]] and it influenced American [[pragmatism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s version of [[process philosophy]]. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with [[Jules Henri Poincaré]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavaillès]] and [[Jules Vuillemin]]. Influenced by German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], the philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the craddle of [[postmodern philosophy]] with [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]].

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of France}}
France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[François Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the "Roi Soleil", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of [[French opera]] and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.&lt;ref&gt;Girdlestone p. 14: "It is customary to couple him with Couperin as one couples Haydn with Mozart or Ravel with Debussy."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed |date=January 2018}}

[[File:Berlioz Petit BNF Gallica-crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1863]]
French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the [[Romantic music]] era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: [[Hector Berlioz]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''), [[Georges Bizet]] (best known for ''[[Carmen]]'', which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), [[Gabriel Fauré]] (best known for his ''[[Pavane (Fauré)|Pavane]]'', [[Requiem (Fauré)|''Requiem'']], and ''[[Fauré Nocturnes|nocturnes]]''), [[Charles Gounod]] (best known for his ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]'' and his [[opera]] ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''), [[Jacques Offenbach]] (best known for his 100 [[operetta]]s of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''), [[Édouard Lalo]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'' for violin and [[orchestra]] and his [[Cello Concerto (Lalo)|Cello Concerto in D minor]]), [[Jules Massenet]] (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are ''[[Manon]]'' (1884) and ''[[Werther]]'' (1892)) and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (he has many frequently-performed works, including ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse macabre]]'', ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Opera), ''[[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Symphony No. 3]]).

[[File:Claude Debussy 1900 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Debussy]], 1900]]
Later came precursors of modern classical music. [[Érik Satie]] was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian [[avant-garde]], best known for his ''[[Gymnopédies]]''. [[Francis Poulenc]]'s best known works are his piano suite ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'' (1919), the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' (1923), the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'' (1928) for [[harpsichord]] and orchestra, the opera ''[[Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' (1957), and the ''[[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]]'' (1959) for [[soprano]], choir and orchestra. [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] are the most prominent figures associated with [[Impressionist music]]. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and [[chromaticism]] influenced many composers who followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/claude-debussy-mn0000768781/biography |title=Claude Debussy&amp;nbsp;– Biography&amp;nbsp;– AllMusic |author=Allen Schrott |work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of [[atonality]].

Ravel's piano compositions, such as ''[[Jeux d'eau (Ravel)|Jeux d'eau]]'', ''[[Miroirs]]'', ''[[Le tombeau de Couperin]]'' and ''[[Gaspard de la nuit]]'', demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the ''[[Rapsodie espagnole]]'', ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'', his arrangement of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and his orchestral work ''[[Boléro]]'' (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, [[Maurice Ohana]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] contributed to the evolutions of [[contemporary classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Lloyd |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126668117 |title=Composer-Conductor Pierre Boulez At 85 |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland ([[Roman Polanski]], [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], and [[Andrzej Żuławski]]), [[Argentina]] ([[Gaspar Noé]] and [[Edgardo Cozarinsky]]), Russia ([[Alexandre Alexeieff]], [[Anatole Litvak]]), Austria ([[Michael Haneke]]), and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Géla Babluani]], [[Otar Iosseliani]]) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as [[Luc Besson]], [[Jacques Tourneur]], or [[Francis Veber]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]].

Although the French film market is dominated by [[Hollywood]], France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.&lt;ref name = erudit&gt;{{fr icon}} Damien Rousselière [http://www.erudit.org/revue/hphi/2005/v15/n2/801295ar.pdf Cinéma et diversité culturelle: le cinéma indépendant face à la mondialisation des industries culturelles].

=== Fashion ===

Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "haute couture" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression [[Haute couture]] is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion and style ({{lang-fr|link=no|la mode}}) dates largely to the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 181. DeJean, chapters 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|link=no|couture {{noitalic|or}} haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses such as [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]], and [[Givenchy]]. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of [[Grasse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about-france.com/tourism/french-perfume.htm |title=French perfume |publisher=About-France.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the elitist "Haute couture" came under criticism from France's [[May 1968 in France|youth culture]]. In 1966, the designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a [[prêt-à-porter]] ("ready to wear") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by [[Sonia Rykiel]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Claude Montana]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Christian Lacroix]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as [[LVMH]].

In 2005 the national service [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre]] introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.

The four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium [[France Télévisions]], while public broadcasting group [[Radio France]] run five national radio stations. Among these public media are [[Radio France Internationale]], which broadcasts programmes in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel [[TV5 Monde]].

A meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'œuvre'' or ''entrée'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) and/or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, [[foie gras]], [[French onion soup]] or a [[croque monsieur]]. The plat principal could include a [[pot au feu]] or [[steak frites]]. The dessert could be [[mille-feuille]] pastry, a [[macaron]], an [[éclair]], [[crème brûlée]], [[Chocolate mousse|mousse au chocolat]], [[crêpe]]s, or [[Café liégeois]].

French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the [[quality of life]] and the attractiveness of France.&lt;ref name =quality /&gt; A French publication, the [[Michelin guide]], awards ''Michelin stars'' for excellence to a select few establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fairburn, Carolyn |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F91F33FE0903F10&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA |title=Fading stars&amp;nbsp;– Michelin Red Guide |work=[[The Times]] |date=29 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Beale, Victoria |author2=Boxell, James |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:FINB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13885C564656C1C8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA |title=Falling stars |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3starrestaurants.com/michelin-restaurants-star-guide.asp |title=Michelin 3 Star Restaurants around the world |website=Andy Hayler's 3 Star Restaurant Guide |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724032127/http://www.3starrestaurants.com/michelin-restaurants-star-guide.asp |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan overtakes France with more Michelin-starred restaurants |author=Gilles Campion |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine.

==History==
Founded by Marguerite Ravel, the federation was unofficially started in 1949 in [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[France]],  at a meeting between the ''Fédération Féline Française'' (French Cat Federation), the Royal Cat Society of Flanders and the [[Associazione Nazionale Felina Italiana|Società Felina Italiana]] (Italian Cat Society). At the organisation's first general assembly, in [[Ghent, Belgium|Ghent]], [[Belgium]], the federation was officially founded. The original name was Fédération Internationale Féline d'Europe or FIFE. In 1972 the Brazilian Cat Club joined, making it necessary to change the Euro-centric name of the federation. The "d'Europe" was dropped, and the abbreviation was changed to FIFe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fifeweb.org/wp/org/org_intro.php|title=Fédération Internationale Féline - Introduction to the FIFe|publisher=fifeweb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
FIFe is organized into national sub-federations (e.g. Felis Britannica in the [[United Kingdom]]) which handle pedigree registrations, cat shows and awards in each country. FIFe's Executive Board and General Assembly are supported by five commissions: 
*Judges &amp; Standard Commission
*Breeding &amp; Registration Commission
*Show Commission
*Health &amp; Welfare Commission
*Disciplinary Commission

== Recognized breeds ==
Currently the FIFe recognizes 48 official breeds of cats for championship competitions. All breeds are divided into 4 categories and identified with a three-letter code, according to the Easy Mind System (EMS). The EMS is a system used by FIFe, and all its members, to easily identify cats by alphanumeric codes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fifeweb.org/wp/breeds/breeds_ems.php|title=Fédération Internationale Féline - Easy Mind System|last=|first=|date=|website=fifeweb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Gazara''' (Gazaria is a Russified version of the name; also Cassaria, Cacsarea, Gazaria, Gasaria) is the name given to the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colonies in [[Crimea]] and around the [[Black Sea]] from the mid-13th century to the late 15th century.

The word is derived from [[Khazaria]], though the [[Khazars]] had ceased to rule over the area by that time.

==Castles==
The colony was officially established with transfer of Caffa by [[Möngke Khan]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]], becoming the regional center of the Black Sea colonies. In 1357, Genoeses acquired the colony of Cembalo (today – [[Balaklava]]), in 1365 Genoese completely overtook the city of Soldaia ([[Sudak]]) from Venetian control.

===Crimea===

* Caffa
* Cembalo
* Soldaia
* Vosporo
* Sarsona
* Capitanatu Gotia (territory of [[Principality of Theodoro|Theodoro]])

===West Black Sea===
Aside of Crimea, Genoa possessed several castles on the western coast of [[Black Sea]] such as the castle of Maurocastro ([[Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky]]) in the estuary of [[Dniester]], the castle of Ginestra near [[Odessa]], the castle of Licostomo ([[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kiliya]]), the colony of [[Constanca]], the colony of Caladda (upstream of Danube).

===Taman peninsula and Tanais===
* Tana ([[Azov]])
* Matrega ([[Tmutarakan]])
* Copa
* Mapa ([[Anapa]])
* Batario ([[Novorossiysk]])
* Casto and Layso ([[Sochi]])

===Georgia===

* Chacari ([[Gagra]])
* Santa Sophia ([[Alakhadzi]])
* Pesonqa ([[Pitsunda]])
* Cavo di Buxo ([[Gudauta]])
* Niocoxia ([[New Athos]])
* Sebastopolis ([[Sukhumi]])

'''Holoholo''' is a [[Bantu language]] of DR Congo and formerly in Tanzania spoken by the [[Holoholo people]] on either side of [[Lake Tanganyika]]. Classification is uncertain, but it may belong with the [[Takama languages|Takama]] group (Nurse 2003:169).

Maho (2009) classifies D281 Tumbwe (Etumbwe) and D282 Lumbwe as closest to Holoholo. Neither has an ISO code.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

The '''Huyan''' ({{zh|c=呼延|w=Hu-yen}}) was a noble house that led the last remnants of the [[Northern Xiongnu]] to [[Dzungaria]] during the second century after the [[Battle of the Altai Mountains]]. The House of Huyan is an earlier maternal lineage name subsequently replaced by [[Xubu]], much as the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] and [[Yujiulü Shelun|Yujiulu]] (郁久閭).&lt;ref name=lin&gt;Lin (1986), p. 33–45, 114-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wang&gt;Wang (2004), p. 132–147,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bichurin N.Ya., ''"Collection of information on peoples in Central Asia in ancient times"'', vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851, p. 15 ( note 1: ''Huyan'' and ''Xubu'' always were in marital relationship with the ''Chanyu''. ''Xubu'' had a post of the State Judge. The custom of taking for the Khan maidens only from the same houses also survived in the Chingis-khan's house.)&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolian [[Khiyad]] tribe's name is probably derived from Huyan.&lt;ref&gt;History of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BCE, the upper stratum of the [[Xiongnu]] was made up of five aristocratic houses, [[Luandi]] (house of the [[Chanyu]] and the [[Tuqi King]] of the east and west), Huyan, [[Xubu]], [[Qiulin]] and [[Lan (tribe)|Lan]]. Both the Huyan and Xubu settled in the east, Qiulin and Lan in the west and Luandi at the center of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name=lin/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang&gt;Wang (2004), p. 132–147,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gumilev L.N., "Hunnu in China", Moscow, 'Science', 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto Antártico Argentino''' ('''IAA'''; {{lang-en|Argentine Antarctic Institute}} ) is the [[Argentine]] federal agency in charge of orientating, controlling, addressing and performing scientific and technical research and studies in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/INDEX.HTM official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303004340/http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/INDEX.HTM |date=2011-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as [[Argentine Antarctica]] ({{lang-es|Antártida Argentina}}) the country claimed a sector as part of its [[national territory]] consisting of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and a triangular section extending to the [[South Pole]], is delimited by the [[25th meridian west|25° West]] and [[74th meridian west|74° West]] meridians and the [[60th parallel south|60° South]] parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Beck| first = Peter J. | title = The international politics of Antarctica | publisher = Routledge| year = 1986 | page = 119 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-4g9AAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=Argentina+Antarctica&amp;ots=N6GIahpMCV&amp;sig=oJRWi_sB41tY7bK54xgpjYEmRTg#v=onepage&amp;q=Argentina%20Antarctica&amp;f=false | isbn =0709932391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administratively, Argentine Antarctica is a [[Departments of Argentina|department]] of the [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands]].

This sector overlaps with [[Antártica Chilena Province|Chilean]] and [[British Antarctic Territory|British]] claims but, under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]], there are no attempts by Argentina or any other country to actually enforce territorial claims in Antarctica.

==Mission==
According to the principles of its creation, the Instituto Antártico Argentino participates with its scientific, technical and administrative staff, in a wide range of national and international programmes for a better understanding of the Antarctic. 
Scientists are trained and deployed on [[Argentine_Antarctica#Argentine_bases|Argentine bases]] for researching on different fields of science, including [[Atmosphere]], [[Biology]], [[Oceanography]], [[Weather]], [[Chemistry]], [[Ozone Layer]], [[Global warming]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]].

==History==

===Exploration prior to the IAA===
[[Image:Sobral and Nordenskjöld.jpeg|thumb|right|Sobral with Nordenskjöld, circa 1903.]]
[[File:Unimog Antartico de la Fuerza Aerea Argentina.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unimog]] vehicle]]

[[José María Sobral]], who is considered in Argentina the father of the [[Argentine Antarctica]] and a national hero, began exploration at the end of 1901. In 1903, the [[Argentine Navy]] corvette [[ARA Uruguay|ARA ''Uruguay'']] commanded by'' Captain de Corbeta'' (Lieutenant commander) [[Julián Irízar]] successfully rescued the [[Sweden|Swedish]] expedition team of  [[Otto Nordenskjöld]]. In 1904 the Argentine permanent presence in Antarctica began with the opening of [[Orcadas Base]] on [[Laurie Island]]. Argentina was the only nation to have an Antarctic base for 40 years until the British built a base on the same islands.

On April 1, 1940, the first radio communication by [[radio ham]]s was made between [[Orcadas Base]] (LSX) and [[Buenos Aires]] (LU 7 ET).

On February 7, 1942, an amphibious [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman]] aircraft embarked on the [[ARA 1 de Mayo|ARA ''1 de Mayo'']] cargo ship made the first Argentine flight over Antarctica.

On December 13, 1947 an [[Argentine Naval Aviation]] [[Douglas DC-4]] piloted by [[Commodore (rank)|''Comodoro'']] [[Gregorio Portillo]] flew  over the [[Antarctic Circle]] in a 15 hours and 30 minutes flight.

===IAA===
On 17 April 1951, [[Hernán Pujato]] founds the ''Instituto Antartico Argentino'', by Decree Nº 7338.

In 1953 the [[San Martín Base]] started operations, and [[Jubany]] base opened two years later.

In 1958 the United States handed over the [[Ellsworth Station]] located in the [[Weddell Sea]].

In 1965 the [[Military of Argentina|Argentine military]] conducted a land military manoeuvre known as [[Operación 90]] in order to reach the [[South Pole]].

In the winter of 1968 at the request by the British embassy in [[Buenos Aires]], an Argentine Navy [[Douglas DC-4]] successfully delivered medical supplies to the British base EFE where one of its members, James K. Portwirie, was through a medical emergency. However, after a few days, Portwirie's situation worsened, making a rescue necessary. An [[Argentine Air Force]] aircraft attempted to reach the base but crashed without casualties. On August 9, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, the [[Argentine Navy]] [[icebreaker]] [[ARA General San Martín (Q-4)|ARA ''General San Martín'']] was sent to rescue Portwirie. The operation was successful, gaining the thanks of the [[British Antarctic Survey]]: ‘‘an internal campaign like this was never attempted before in Antarctic History‘‘.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/Armada%20Argentina/Buques1900a1970/BPolares/BPRompSMartin.htm ''. Sir Vivian Fuchs, el vencedor del Polo Sur, dijo: "Ruego acepte nuestras sinceras gracias por el rescate del enfermo de nuestra estación en islas argentinas. Una campaña invernal de esta naturaleza resulta sin paralelo en la historia marítima Antártica'. (Despacho R.T de Director del British Antarctic Survey) '']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marambio Base]] was founded in 1969, currently the most important Argentine base on the Antarctica. In 1975 the [[Esperanza Base]] was built, and in 1979 the [[General Belgrano II]].
In 1978, the first Antarctic baby, [[Emilio Palma]], was born in the ''Fortín Sargento Cabral'' at the [[Esperanza Base]].

===IAA in the 21st Century===
[[Image:Q5ARAAlmiranteIrizar.jpg|thumb|right|''Almirante Irízar'' icebreaker.]]

In 2002, the Argentine Navy mounted an internal operation sending Icebreaker [[ARA Almirante Irízar (Q-5)|ARA ''Almirante Irizar'']] to rescue the trapped supply vessel ''[[Magdalena Oldendorff]]''. Even though Irízar failed to break the ''Oldendorff'' free, she managed to move it to a safe position and re-supply the ship with food, medicines and medical personnel until the ice melted and the ship could return to open sea.

In 2003, under the Decree Nº 207/2003 issued by the Executive Power of Argentina, the Instituto Antártico Argentino became a part of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]

On the 2009 summer campaign, the [[Argentine Air Force]] operated the [[Teniente Matienzo Base]] only with women for three months &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1086906 Una base antártica exclusiva para mujeres]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defdigital.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=44%3Adefensa&amp;id=226%3Aexperiencia-unica-mujeres-en-la-antartida&amp;Itemid=112 Mujeres en la Antártida]&lt;/ref&gt; although there was an emergency link available with the [[Bell 212]]s helicopters stationed at [[Marambio Base]]

On 2010 a [[Wind generators|Wind generator]] designed and built by Argentine government company [[CITEDEF]] was installed on Marambio Base &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindef.gov.ar/info.asp?Id=1425 DEFENSA INSTALÓ UN GENERADOR DE ENERGÍA EÓLICA EN LA ANTÁRTIDA] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20111101083658/http://www.mindef.gov.ar/info.asp?Id=1425 |date=2011-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2011, three heavy lift helicopters were deployed in the [[Base Marambio]]: two [[Mil Mi 17]] helicopters (bought in the same year), and the remaining [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] from the [[Argentine Air Force]].

'''Intelsat 506''', previously named '''Intelsat V F-6''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1983, it was the sixth of fifteen [[Intelsat V]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[Spacebus|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]].

Intelsat V F-6 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network. He also carried a '''Maritime Communications Services''' ('''MCS''') package for [[Inmarsat]]. The satellite was deactivated on July, 1998.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on May 19, 1982, at 22:26 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,928&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="TBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_506.html|title=INTELSAT 506|publisher=TSE|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intelsat 506 was equipped with 4 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 21 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 12,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

The '''Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research''', IAI, is an [[International organization|intergovernmental organization]] supported by 19 countries in the Americas, dedicated to pursuing the principles of scientific excellence, international cooperation, and the full and open exchange of scientific information to increase the understanding of [[global change]] phenomena and their [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] implications.

Recognizing the need to better understand the natural and social processes which drive large scale [[Climate change|environmental change]], the IAI encourages interactive exchanges between scientists and policy makers. The goal of the IAI is to augment the scientific capacity in the region and to provide information to policy makers in a useful and timely manner. Its primary objective is to encourage research beyond the scope of national programs, by advancing comparative and focused studies based on scientific issues important to the region as a whole.

==The IAI's Mission==

To develop the capacity of understanding the integrated impact of present and future global change on regional and continental environments in the Americas and to promote collaborative research and informed action at all levels.

==The IAI's Core values==

IAI pursues the principles of scientific excellence, international cooperation and full and open exchange of scientific information relevant to global environmental change.

==The IAI's Vision==

The IAI was envisaged as an intergovernmental instrument by which scientists and decision makers of countries throughout the Americas might jointly address the critical issues associated with global change in the region.

==Background==

As evidenced by the participation of most of the worlds leaders in [[United Nations|the United Nations]] Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit|UNCED]]) in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], June 1992, the phenomenon of global change is perceived as one of the most critical challenges facing the world today. Physical and socio-economic evidence of global change related phenomena such as [[ozone depletion]], loss of [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and changes in rainfall patterns and intensity, can be found in all areas of the world. Regardless of whether the particular phenomenon is natural or human-induced, its effects often cross geopolitical borders. Thus, many [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] must be addressed scientifically as global or regional problems, with steps towards mitigation or alleviation taken at a national level.

==History==

In response to the plea of a regional approach entity to address global change issues, sixteen nations&lt;ref&gt;Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, United States, and Uruguay.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Americas signed the '''Agreement establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research''' on May 13, 1992, in [[Montevideo|Montevideo, Uruguay]]. The treaty has been ratified by all 16 signatories and has been acceded to by three other American nations.&lt;ref&gt;Guatemala, Jamaica, and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came into force on March 12, 1994, thus creating the IAI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/c-19.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

To accomplish IAI's mission and goals, in 1992 contributing scientists and science managers of the region crafted an initial Science Agenda. In 1997, in response to the evolving regional priorities, the IAI Scientific Advisory Committee revised the initial Science Agenda, re-arranged it and included new pressing issues in the current IAI Science Agenda.

Each member country participating in the IAI benefits from the enhancement of regional relationships, the establishment of new institutional arrangements, open exchange of scientific data, and information generated by the Institute's research programs, and the implementation of IAI Training and Education Programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gual Soler|first1=Marga|title=Intergovernmental Scientific Networks in Latin America: Supporting Broader Regional Relationships and Integration|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|volume=3|issue=4|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2014/intergovernmental-scientific-networks-in-latin-america|author-link=Marga Gual Soler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[National Science Foundation]] hosted the IAI Secretariat from September 1994 until September 1996. Afterwards, the IAI became fully operational at the IAI Directorate located in the campus of the [[Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais]] (INPE) in [[São José dos Campos]], Brazil.

'''Kevin Greening''' (30 December 1962 – 29 December 2007&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Young |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7165356.stm |title=Ex-BBC DJ Greening dies aged 44 |date=30 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British radio presenter, who co-hosted ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]] with [[Zoë Ball]] from 1997 to 1998.

==Early career==
Kevin Greening grew up in [[Bristol]] where he worked voluntarily for the Bristol Hospital Broadcasting Service and was educated at [[Bristol Grammar School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1574088/Kevin-Greening.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Kevin Greening | date=31 December 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied [[chemical engineering]] at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], where he was station manager at [[Cambridge University Radio]]. His first job was as a [[Construction|construction worker]] on the [[Humber Bridge]]. He then trained as a studio manager and began his broadcasting career at the [[BBC World Service]]. After a brief spell as a Programme assistant at BBC Radio Solent, in 1989 Greening joined London's Local station [[BBC London 94.9|BBC GLR]] as a producer, before becoming a presenter of their Breakfast show in 1991.

In April 1993, Greening joined the newly launched [[Virgin Radio]], presenting a Friday and Saturday evening show and a Sunday morning show. After two months, he took over their weekday afternoon show, where he remained until he quit Virgin in December 1993.

==Radio 1==
In January 1994, Greening joined [[BBC Radio 1]], presenting the Weekend Breakfast Show (Saturday and Sunday 7{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}am). In the summer of '94, Radio 1 agreed to cover the [[Gay Pride]] event for the first time and these reports into the general days' output were fronted by Greening; the success of these led to Radio 1 becoming a regular fixture at Gay Pride events. In May 1995 Greening was named in [[Gay Times]]' ''Top 200 Gay Men and Lesbians'' as an out gay DJ.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Gay Times|title=Top 200 Gay Men and Lesbians|page=28|date=May 1995|issue=200|first=Colin|last=Richardson|issn=0950-6101|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1994, Greening took over the Weekend Lunchtime show (Saturday and Sunday noon to 2{{nbsp}}pm). Again he featured many of his comedy characters (usually voiced by [[Andrew McGibbon]]&lt;ref name="Guardian obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2234311,00.html |title=Kevin Greening – Creative presenter who helped to salvage the Radio 1 breakfast show |date=3 January 2008 |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=22 January 2008 | location=London | first=Trevor | last=Dann}}&lt;/ref&gt;) featured on Weekend Breakfast. October 1995 saw Greening move back to Weekend Breakfast where he would remain for another 16 months. Greening was given the Drivetime show in February 1997. Regular features on the show included the "Joke du Jour", "60 Second Cinema", and the "Evening Procession".

Early mornings seemed to play a big role during Greening's time at Radio 1, as he had presented Weekend Breakfast and had also been the main stand-in presenter for [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]] and [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] on the weekday breakfast show, but October 1997 saw Greening present ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]]'' alongside [[Zoë Ball]], where he would remain for 12 months.

Greening moved to a Sunday morning show from 6:30 to 10{{nbsp}}am in September 1998. At the time he was also presenting shows for [[BBC World Service]] and a TV show for digital station [[BBC Choice]]. It was during this period that Greening became the main stand-in presenter on the network, covering for many weekday presenters including [[Scott Mills]], [[Simon Mayo]] and [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]]. There was also a period when Greening took over the weekday lunchtime show whilst regular presenter [[Jo Whiley]] was away on [[Parental leave|maternity leave]]. He occasionally made light of his status as a stand-in presenter, giving an alternative [[E-mail address|email address]] as supply.dj@bbc.co.uk (his main address being kevin.greening@bbc.co.uk)

On Sunday 16 January 2000, Greening presented his final Radio 1 show. In the last half-hour he played some of the sketches from his time with the station.

==Radio 5 Live==
Not long after he left Radio 1, in 2000 Greening moved to [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], where he was a stand-in presenter for various daytime slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Janet |last=Trewin |year=2003 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |title=Presenting on TV and Radio: An Insider's Guide |isbn=0-240-51906-X |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, whilst undertaking supply work at Five Live, he began co-presenting a Saturday Morning show on GLR's replacement, [[BBC London 94.9#BBC London Live .282000 - 2001.29|BBC London Live]], alongside [[Amanda Hussain]], the show went out from 8 to 11{{nbsp}}am on Saturday mornings and lasted until September the same year when the show was taken over by [[Danny Baker]].

==Commercial radio==
From late 2001 into 2002, [[102.2 Jazz FM]] employed him for various slots, then in May 2002, he briefly joined London's [[Heart 106.2]] presenting their 2{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}pm weekend afternoon show.

In June 2002, he joined London's Rock station [[Xfm London|XFM]], sitting in for [[Christian O'Connell]] on the Breakfast Show.  One month later, he took over the station's mid-morning slot from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm, where he remained until December 2003.

In January 2004, he was moved to the Station's ''Best of X'' show on Saturday evenings from 6 to 9{{nbsp}}pm.

After a stand-in stint on the [[BBC 6 Music]] Night Train programme, and in addition to his Saturday evening show on [[Xfm London|XFM]], in April 2004, he re-joined 102.2 Jazz FM to present a Sunday morning show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 2{{nbsp}}pm. Shortly after, he also took over from [[Clive Warren]] on Saturdays from 10{{nbsp}}am to 2{{nbsp}}pm.

On 7 June 2005, he took over the 10{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}3{{nbsp}}pm slot on 102.2 Jazz FM's replacement, [[102.2 Smooth FM]]. From 26 March 2007, he moved to a 1{{snd}}4{{nbsp}}pm weekday afternoon slot on the relaunched [[102.2 Smooth Radio]] where he built up a cult following. His "game with no name" quiz show, in which listeners had to suggest the most suitable song to play against a particular news item, was particularly popular.

He also presented Saturday afternoons from 2 to 5{{nbsp}}pm on the station.

==Personal life==

Greening was awarded a Fellowship by The [[Radio Academy]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The Radio Academy [http://www.radioacademy.org/about/fellows/ "Fellows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024171034/http://www.radioacademy.org/about/fellows/ |date=24 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was the only non-executive ever to be so honoured in the academy's 25 years.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt;

Greening was openly gay&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; and had a previous long-term relationship with Andy Lowe, whom he often referred to on air as his "lesbian life-partner" or "live-in chum". When their relationship came to an end in 2005, after a brief separation they continued to share their house in [[north London]].

At the time of his death Greening had been in a relationship with Sean Griffin for some time.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit" /&gt;

==Death==
On 30 December 2007, it was announced by Chris North, Greening's agent, that Greening had "died peacefully in his sleep" one day before his 45th birthday.&lt;ref name="bbcnews"/&gt; His boyfriend, Sean Griffin, was arrested the following day in connection with his death, and for possession of a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971#Penalties|Class A drug]],&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7166439.stm |title=Man arrested after Greening death |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but charges in relation to Greening's death were not pursued by police.

On 3 January 2008, it was revealed following the [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] that Greening died of a heart attack after taking large quantities of [[cocaine]], [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]].&lt;ref name="Former radio DJ killed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/33433 |title=Former Radio 1 DJ killed by 'sex and drugs binge' |publisher = [[NME]] |date=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent part of the night prior to his death at the Recon event&lt;ref&gt;Recon is a [[Fetish clothing|fetish wear]] on-line store http://shop.recon.com with an associated [[social network]] http://www.recon.com&lt;/ref&gt; held at The Arches nightclub in [[Southwark]], London.

Greening was buried on 18 January 2008 in a [[Natural burial|woodland burial ground]] after a [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] farewell ceremony in accordance with his wishes.

At the inquest into his death, a verdict of death by misadventure was recorded as a result of a self-induced drug overdose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,91248-1317928,00.html DJ Died After Gay Bondage Session] ''[[Sky News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death an award was named after him at the [[Student Radio Association|Student Radio Association's]] annual Student Radio Awards. The Kevin Greening Award is dedicated to recognising unique on-air creativity, for which Greening was known.

'''Kohvik Moon''' is a [[restaurant]] in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], located near the [[Viking Line]] harbour.

The restaurant focuses on simple food. Despite its small size and non-central location, it is so popular that since its opening in December 2010, the restaurant was almost full of customers every day for several months, and its owners often had to work almost round the clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/ruoka/artikkeli/1+Kohvik+Moon+on+etsimisen+v%C3%A4%C3%A4rti/1135256961232 Kohvik Moon on etsimisen väärti].

'''''Læsebog i Modersmaalet''''' (informally referred to as "Pauss og Lassen"), later titled '''''Hjemme og ute''''' and '''''Heime og ute''''', was a [[reading book]] series that was published in numerous editions between 1884 and 1958 and that was widely used in the school system of Norway for around 80 years. The work's original authors were [[Bernhard Cathrinus Pauss]] and [[Hartvig Lassen]]. After Lassen's death, the series was edited by Pauss and [[Andreas Martin Corneliussen]], and after Pauss' death by Corneliussen and [[Olaf Ellefsen]]. From 1921, the work was edited by [[Mathilde Munch]] and [[Sven Svensen]] and retitled ''Hjemme og ute''. At times, the series was used by half of all pupils in Norwegian schools.

The first edition was published eight years before [[Nordahl Rolfsen]]'s ''[[Læsebog for Folkeskolen]]'', and was more strongly characterized by the continuity from the Danish literary heritage, although it also featured the first contours of the Norwegian literary golden age.&lt;ref&gt;Sverre Sletvold, ''Norske lesebøker 1777–1969'', Trondheim, Universitetsforlaget, 1971, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="908">The '''Maiestas Carolina''' was a [[legal code]] proposed by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1350 to govern [[Bohemia]]. It received its name not before 1617.

Based on previous legal customs and the [[Liber Augustalis]] of 1231, the aim of the code was to increase royal power.  Included among its provisions were sections granting the right to judge criminal cases solely to the king and others allowing the king greater control over functionaries in order to increase royal revenues.  The code also contained sections regarding [[conservation movement|forest conservation]].

The Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] resented the loss of their own power and opposed the code.  Charles withdrew the code in 1355, and it never came into effect.

;Philippines: There is a meatloaf dish called ''embotido'' (not to be confused with the Spanish [[embutido]]) made of well-seasoned ground pork, raisins, minced carrots, sausages, and whole boiled eggs. The meat is molded into a roll with the sausages and hard boiled eggs set in the middle. Another variation of the dish involves wrapping the meatloaf with pork crow or [[mesentery]]. It is then wrapped in aluminum foil (historically, banana leaves) and steamed for an hour. The cooked ''embotido'' may be stored in freezers. It is usually served fried and sliced for breakfast. In some parts of the Philippines, the embotido is erroneously called "''morcon''". However, the Filipino [[morcón]] itself is another dish though prepared in a similar way.

;Romania: In Romanian cuisine, there is a meatloaf dish called ''drob'', similar to other minced meat dishes in the region like the Bulgarian ''Rulo Stefani'' or the Hungarian ''Stefánia'' meatloaf, the major difference being that it is always made with lamb organs (or a mixture of lamb organs and pork or veal) and the hard boiled eggs in the centre of the ''drob'' are optional.
;South Africa: One of South Africa's most popular dishes is a form of meatloaf called [[bobotie]]. Food in South Africa varies by region, and bobotie is considered a Cape Town or Western Cape dish, but is so popular throughout the country that it is sometimes considered one of South Africa's signature dishes. It is a slightly sweet meatloaf flavored with curry spices, dried apricots and almonds, and is topped with whipped egg and milk topping which when baked on top of the meat filling creates an egg "topping". It arrived in South Africa several hundred years ago from the East Indies and became one of the signature dishes of Cape Town's Cape Malay community.
;Sweden
:Swedish meatloaf is called ''köttfärslimpa'' and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes, brown sauce and lingonberry jam.
;Turkey
In the [[Turkish cuisine]] there is a meatloaf with vegetables dish called ''dalyan köfte''.&lt;ref name="Yegul2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murat Yegul|title=The Secrets of Hearty Turkish Home Cooking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rpax4hPuPmkC&amp;pg=PP3-IA1|date=September 2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4520-4794-2|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;United Kingdom
:In the UK there are regional meatloaf dishes known as [[Haslet]].
;United States: During the [[Great Depression]], cooking meatloaf was a way to stretch the food budget for families by using an inexpensive type of meat and other ingredients as leftovers. Along with spices,&lt;ref name="Meatloaf history" /&gt; it was popular to add [[cereal|cereal grains]], bread or [[saltine]]s to the meatloaf to stretch the meat. This tradition of additions lives on with the goal of producing a lower-fat dish with superior binding and consistency.
:American meatloaf is typically eaten with some kind of [[sauce]] or [[relish]]. Many recipes&lt;ref name=Tasty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tastymeatloafrecipes.com/|title=tastymeatloafrecipes.com -  Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.tastymeatloafrecipes.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626094609/http://tastymeatloafrecipes.com/|archivedate=26 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; call for a pasta sauce or tomato sauce to be poured over the loaf to form a crust during baking. The tomato-based sauce may be replaced with simple brown gravy or onion gravy, or a can of cream of mushroom soup may be substituted, but the meatloaf is prepared in a similar manner. [[Barbecue sauce]], tomato [[ketchup]], or a mixture of tomato ketchup and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] may also be used. American meatloaf may be topped with plain ketchup or a "meatloaf sauce" consisting of ketchup and [[brown sugar]] mixed.  Another variety of meatloaf is prepared by "frosting" it with [[mashed potatoes]], drizzling it with a small amount of [[butter]], and browning in the oven.
:Meatloaf is normally served warm as part of the main course, but can also be found sliced as a [[cold cut]]. Meatloaf can be considered a typical [[comfort food]] and is served in many diners and restaurants. In a 2007 poll by ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', meatloaf was the seventh-favorite dish of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sunday Supper: Meatloaf is a favorite comfort food | website=Florida Today | date=July 21, 2015 | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/life/style/2015/07/21/sunday-supper-meatloaf-favorite-comfort-food/30472233/ | access-date=June 15, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023947/http://www.floridatoday.com/story/life/style/2015/07/21/sunday-supper-meatloaf-favorite-comfort-food/30472233/ | archivedate=September 15, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Vietnam: The Vietnamese meatloaf version is called ''giò''. It is boiled rather than baked or smoked. There are many versions of ''giò'' that differ by the ingredients used.

The chief architects of the act when it was formulated were [[John Nkomo]] and [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]]. Many regard POSA as an act that helped [[Robert Mugabe]] consolidate his power. The law gave untold powers to the police, the [[Zimbabwe Republic Police]] (ZRP). It is still under debate in the new term of rule and it is inarguably an unfair plot against human rights.

POSA has since been applied against demonstrations by the government. On August 1 2018 the law was invoked&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/breaking-news-police-invoke-posa/|title=BREAKING NEWS: Police invoke POSA {{!}} The Chronicle|website=www.chronicle.co.zw|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, resulting in the army fatally shooting protesters against alleged rigging of the [[Zimbabwean general election, 2018]].

'''''Rustem's records with drawing''''' ({{lang-ru|Записи Рустема с картинками}}) is a 1998 [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[teen]] [[city ballad]] [[film]]
==Plot==
Action of the picture consisting of four short stories happens in [[Almaty]] and covers three days between summer and fall of 1997 — from August 31 to September 2. Declared as records of the main character with drawings, it doesn't apply for serious research of the teenage environment — it more likely a look from within for a while which as if stopped at the birth of heroes in 1979. Eighteen-year-old Rustem, unlike the business little sister Madina, is lazy and inert, he looks at the world cold eyes, having hidden behind the indifferent relation to people around. The strange girl Miko shy tries to destroy Rustem's rest by fragile feeling of the first love. Almost all actors, screenwriters (second-year students of masterful direction of game cinema of Ardak Amirkulov), artists, operators — graduates or students of [[Kazakh National Academy of Arts]]. In the movie scenes from the performance "[[The Brothers Karamazov]]" are used. Amirkulov enters the movie in a cinema context, having remembered not only Nugmanov film "[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]", but also Daneliya film "[[Walking the Streets of Moscow]]" and Ioseliani film "There lived a song thrush", beating through motive of the last fortieth anniversary — the city aimless wanderings of the hero behaving to finding, but coinciding often with finding of death.

The '''Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988''' comprises a set of regulations which govern the transmissions of [[television station]]s in the United States, specifically imposing the restriction of [[satellite]] carrier transmissions of a [[Television network|network station]]'s transmissions only to subscribers who cannot receive these broadcasts via [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] and have not subscribed to a [[cable television|cable system]] providing these broadcasts, and which also concern regularizing satellite carriers' submission of lists of subscribers to networks, the coordination of broadcasting fees with territorial coverage of transmissions, and the distribution of fees to [[copyright]] owners of works included in transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wchstv.com/satellitefulltext.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In the declaration, the parties publicly stated their intent to keep [[South East Asia]] "free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers" and "broaden the areas of cooperation."
