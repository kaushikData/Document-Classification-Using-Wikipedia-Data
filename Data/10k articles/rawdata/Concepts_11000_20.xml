'''Amorality''' is an absence of, [[apathy|indifference]] towards, or disregard for [[morality]].&lt;ref name='Johnstone 2008'&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnstone | first = Megan-Jane | authorlink = | title = Bioethics: A Nursing Perspective | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 102–103 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7295-3873-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Superson 2009'&gt;{{cite book | last = Superson | first = Anita | authorlink = | title = The Moral Skeptic | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 127–159 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-19-537662-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Dictionary.com'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amorality | title = Amorality | accessdate = 2010-06-18 | work = Dictionary.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729153956/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amorality| archivedate= 29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morality and amorality in humans and animals is a subject of dispute among scientists and philosophers. If morality is intrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings either do not exist or are only deficiently human.&lt;ref name="C. S. Lewis, Abolition of Man"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Clive Staples|title=Abolition of Man|year=2010|publisher=Lits|isbn=1609421477|pages=60|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/lewis/abolition1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; If morality is extrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings can both exist and be fully human, and as such be amoral either by nature or by choice.

Amoral should not be confused with ''immoral'', which refers to an agent doing or thinking something he or she knows or believes to be [[wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 24, COLLINS,new School Dictionary, 1999, {{ISBN|0 00 472238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-human manifestations==
Any entity that is not [[sapience|sapient]] may be considered categorically amoral. For example, a rock may be used (by rational agents) for good or bad purposes, but the rock itself is neither good nor bad. In [[Ontology|ontological philosophy]], the [[Gnosticism|ancient gnostic]] concept that [[Demiurge|the material world was inherently evil]] applied morality to existence itself and was a point of concern in early Christianity in the form of [[Docetism]], as it opposed the notion that creation is good, as stated in [[The Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius of Antioch"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ignatius of Antioch|authorlink=Ignatius of Antioch|title=The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|work=Ante-Nicean Fathers|volume=1|editor1-first=Alexander|editor1-last=Roberts|editor2-first=James|editor2-last=Donaldson|editor3-first=A. Cleveland|editor3-last=Coxe|editor4-first=Kevin|editor4-last=Knight|publisher=Christian Literature Publishing|year=1885|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern science, however, the [[matter]] of the universe is often observed amorally for objective purposes.

===Animals===
Animals have long been thought to be amoral entities. However, research into the [[evolution of morality]], including [[Social animal|sociality]] and [[altruism in animals]], has sparked new debate amongst many philosophers. Many animals display behavior that is analogous to human moral behavior, such as caring for the young, protecting kin, and sharing the spoils of the hunt. Generally speaking, if this behavior is a voluntary response to ethical norms, then animals do have morality. If animals are involuntarily following innate instinct, then they are amoral.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Legal entities===
Some people consider [[corporation]]s to be intrinsically amoral entities.&lt;ref name='Hazelton 2005'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Amorality of Public Corporations | journal = Essays in Philosophy | year = 2005 | first = James | last = Hazelton |author2=Ken Cussen | volume = 6 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Quigley 2003-2004'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Catholic Social Thought and the Amorality of Large Corporations: Time to Abolish Corporate Personhood |journal=Loyola Journal of Public Interest Law |date=2003–2004 |first=William |last=Quigley |pages=109–134 |url=http://www.stthomas.edu/cathstudies/cst/conferences/bilbao/papers/quigley.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905021402/http://www.stthomas.edu/cathstudies/cst/conferences/bilbao/papers/quigley.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Stephens 2012'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Amorality of Profit: Transnational Corporations and Human Rights | journal = Berkeley Journal of International Law | year = 2012 | first = Beth | last = Stephens | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | url = http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=bjil | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Donaldson 1982'&gt;{{cite book | last = Donaldson | first = Thomas | authorlink = | title = Corporations and morality | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1982 | location = | pages = 78 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-13-177014-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">The '''Anna Karenina principle''' states that a deficiency in any [[Limiting factor|one of a number of factors]] dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.

The name of the principle derives from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words: in order to be happy, a family must be successful on ''each and every one'' of ''a'' ''range'' of criteria e.g.: sexual attraction, money issues, parenting, religion, in-laws. Failure on only ''one'' of these counts leads to ''un''happiness. Thus there are more ways for a family to be unhappy than happy.

In [[statistics]], the term ''Anna Karenina principle'' is used to describe [[Statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the [[null hypothesis]] and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied.

==Examples==

===Failed domestication===
The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, J. |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined:

*'''Diet''' – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates.
*'''Growth rate''' – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps 12 years for their herd to reach adult size.
*'''Captive breeding''' – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having [[mating]] rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases.
*'''Disposition''' – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The [[zebra]] is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent.
*'''Tendency to panic''' – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. [[Deer]] in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. Horses, however, immediately thrived from the time they were introduced to North America in the 16th century.
*'''Social structure''' – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well defined [[social hierarchy]] is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another.

==Ecological risk assessment==
{{See also|Liebig's law of the minimum}}

Moore describes applications of the ''Anna Karenina principle'' in [[ecology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful ecological risk assessments are all alike; every unsuccessful ecological risk assessment fails in its own way. Tolstoy posited a similar analogy in his novel Anna Karenina : "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." By that, Tolstoy meant that for a marriage to be happy, it had to succeed in several key aspects. Failure on even one of these aspects, and the marriage is doomed . . . the Anna Karenina principle also applies to ecological risk assessments involving multiple stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dwayne R.J.|title=The Principle Applied to Ecological Risk Assessments of Multiple Stressors|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal|date=March 2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.1080/20018091094349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aristotle's version==

Much earlier, ''[[Aristotle]]'' states the same principle in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 2):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html Nicomachean Ethics], Translated by [[W. D. Ross]], Oxford University Press, Oxford; Revised edition (11 Jun 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult – to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue; For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Order in chaos of maladaptation==
Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By studying the dynamics of correlation and variance in many systems facing external, or environmental, factors, we can typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, predict when one might occur, as correlation between individuals increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) goes up.... '''All well-adapted systems are alike, all non-adapted systems experience maladaptation in their own way,... But in the chaos of maladaptation, there is an order'''. It seems, paradoxically, that as systems become more different they actually become more correlated within limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-public/anna-karenina-principle-explains-bodily-stress-and-stockmarket-crashes Anna Karenina principle explains bodily stress and stockmarket crashes], University of Leicester, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This effect is proved for many systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=Alexander N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=Elena V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=Tatiana A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003_Correlations_Risk_and_Crisis_From_Physiology_to_Finance|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of [[social stress]] in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;Rybnikov, S.R.; Rybnikova, N.A.; Portnov, B.A. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?] Psychology &amp; Developing Societies 29(1):98-123· March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mathematical backgrounds==
[[Vladimir Arnold]] in his book ''Catastrophe Theory'' describes "The Principle of Fragility of Good Things" which in a sense supplements the Principle of Anna Karenina: good systems must meet simultaneously a number of requirements; therefore, they are more fragile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... for systems belonging to the singular part of the stability boundary a small change of the parameters is more likely to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region. This is a manifestation of a general principle stating that all good things (e.g. stability) are more fragile than bad things. It seems that in good situations a number of requirements must hold simultaneously, while to call a situation bad even one failure suffices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=V. I.|title=Catastrophe Theory|date=September 1992 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-54811-4 |edition=3rd Rev Exp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catastrophe_theory.html?id=GQoQyqia45gC |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==

=== Climate change and species range shifts ===
[[Climate change]] is expected to drive many species out of parts of their current [[species distribution|ranges]] while creating new suitable habitats elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02121 |pmid=14712274 |last1=Thomas |first1=C.

Using a [[environmental niche modelling|niche modeling]] approach, scientists have predicted that failure to migrate or adapt would result in eventual extinction of about a quarter of the world’s species this century under moderate climate change.&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt; The natural dispersal rates of many species are far slower than those needed to keep pace with projected habitat shifts in many regions of the world.&lt;ref name=Zhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M.

=== Assisted colonization vs. species introduction ===
Assisted colonization is a specific type of [[introduced species|species introduction]]. An introduction is any act of establishing a species in a habitat it does not currently occupy. It often refers to a long-distance relocation, such as the accidental introduction of an [[invasive species]] from one continent to another, or the intentional relocation of a species in decline to a habitat where it can persist. By contrast, assisted colonization acknowledges that the natural [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] rate of many species may be too slow to naturally respond to rapid human-caused environmental change and asks, “if this species could disperse fast enough to keep pace with the changing environment, where would it establish?” Assisted colonization practitioners consider helping the species disperse into such sites, which are often immediately adjacent to the species’ historical range.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = M. L. | title = Climate Change and Moving Species: Furthering the Debate on Assisted Colonization | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00780.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356–1358 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17883502| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted colonization thus represents a small artificial boost to an otherwise natural process, acknowledging that the threat—rapid human-caused environmental change—was produced by humans in the first place. Confusion of assisted colonization with species introduction in general—often much larger in scale and with greater risk of adverse impacts—may be the principal reason why some are reluctant to consider assisted colonization (see [[#Controversy|Controversy]], below).&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Hellmann | first2 = J.

=== Terminology ===
When first proposed, the idea was referred to as “assisted migration”.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The terminology was later criticized for being reminiscent of natural, cyclic animal migrations in response to changing seasons.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; It was renamed “assisted colonization,” as colonization more accurately describes the natural phenomenon that management would seek to assist. Others have sought to further distinguish this idea from any natural process by referring to it as “managed relocation.”&lt;ref name=Sax&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D.

=== Acclimatization and adaptation as alternatives to colonization ===
Even under rapid climate change, dispersal into new areas may not be necessary for some species to persist. Instead of tracking climate shifts through space, some species may be able to survive in their present locations by developing tolerance to new conditions through [[acclimatization]] and/or [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice|first1=Kevin J.|last2=Emery|first2=Nancy C.|year=2003|title=Managing microevolution: Restoration in the face of global change|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=1|issue=9|pages=469–478|doi=10.2307/3868114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skelly | first1 = D.

One study determined that evolution of higher temperature tolerance in some species of amphibians and reptiles will likely occur fast enough to allow these species to survive a 3&amp;nbsp;°C temperature increase over 100 years, consistent with low- to mid-range projections of global warming.&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; By contrast, many species, such as most [[temperate]] trees, have longer generation times and therefore may adapt more slowly; they may take thousands of years to evolve a similar increase in temperature tolerance.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; Adaptation this slow would be insufficient for keeping up with expected future global warming if colonization of new habitats is not an option.

== Types ==
Generally speaking, there are three accepted ways that assisted colonization can take place, each one of them with specific benefits and situations in which it applies. They can be defined as reintroduction, introduction and augmentation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Weeks|first = Andrew R|last2 = Sgro|first2 = Carla M|last3 = Young|first3 = Andrew G|last4 = Frankham|first4 = Richard|last5 = Mitchell|first5 = Nicki J|last6 = Miller|first6 = Kim A|last7 = Byrne|first7 = Margaret|last8 = Coates|first8 = David J|last9 = Eldridge|first9 = Mark D B|date = 2011-11-01|title = Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal = Evolutionary Applications|volume = 4|issue = 6|pages = 709–725|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|issn = 1752-4571|pmc = 3265713|pmid = 22287981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmentation ===
In augmentation, a population is identified with a small number of mating individuals. This can lead to many problems, including inbreeding depression, and often leads to a dwindling number of individuals. Further complicating matters, with such a small population and consistent inbreeding depression, genetic drift is of worry as well, leading to high levels of homozygosity. To combat these problems, individuals are reintroduced to the population. This can be done via ''ex situ'' breeding of individuals or by physically relocating a separate population to join the identified, problematic population.

=== Introduction ===
In introduction, a species is brought to a habitat in which it has never before existed. This can be done for a number of reasons, ranging from climate change associated habitat loss to the introduction of predator species that cannot be controlled. Generally speaking, this is the type of assisted colonization that contains the most potential for harmful effects, like those described elsewhere in this article. Currently, a number of introductions of endangered populations from Australia have been made with varying degrees of success to small islands near the mainland where the only reason that the population had not dispersed before was due to the physical waterway.

=== Reintroduction ===
Reintroductions involve restoring a species to its native range. The species may no longer be found there due to any number of reasons, though most common is often the introduction of predators or habitat loss due to either climate change or other human factors. This is generally done to broaden the range of threatened populations and to reconnect fragmented populations.

==Controversy==
Significant controversy has developed around the idea of assisted colonization since it was first put forth in the scientific literature in 2007.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The two sides can be separated roughly as follows. Supports generally believe that the expected benefits of assisted colonization, including saving and strengthening species, outweighs the potential harm of any project. Detractors generally believe that other conservation techniques which do not include the high risk of invasive species are not only better suited but are also more likely to succeed. This debate continues throughout the literature generally due to a lack of real-world applications and follow-ups. Though these conservation efforts are becoming increasingly common, few long term looks at their success have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

===Invasive species risk===
Perhaps the principal concern scientists have expressed over assisted colonization is the potential for relocated species to be invasive in their new habitats, driving out native species.&lt;ref name=Simberloff&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardi | first1 = A. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.12.006 | title = Assisted colonization is not a viable conservation strategy | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 248 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that assisted colonization will facilitate invasions stems mostly from observations of the vast numbers of species that have become invasive outside their native ranges by (often inadvertent) introduction by humans. Although most agree that assisted colonization efforts, unlike accidental introductions, should involve detailed planning and risk assessment, for some, any threat of introducing invasive species, no matter how small, disqualifies assisted colonization as a viable management response to climate change.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Those who wish to keep assisted colonization on the table often note that the vast majority of historical species invasions have resulted from continent-to-continent or continent-to-island transportation of species and that very few invasions have resulted from the comparatively short-distance, within-continent movement of species proposed for assisted colonization.&lt;ref name=Mueller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoegh&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoegh-Guldberg | first1 = O. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = L. | last3 = McIntyre | first3 = S. | last4 = Lindenmayer | first4 = D.

Terrestrial species that became invasive on the same continent where they originated were often transported across large biogeographic barriers, such as mountain ranges. These long-distance, within-continent translocations are unlike expected uses of assisted colonization, which generally involve helping species colonize habitats immediately adjacent to their current ranges.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

===Uncertainty in the planning process===
To identify populations at risk and locate new potential habitats, conservationists often use [[Environmental niche modelling|Niche models]]. These models predict the suitability of habitats in the future based on how closely their climates resemble the climate currently inhabited by the species. Though useful for describing broad trends, these models make a number of unrealistic assumptions that restrict the usefulness of their predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = T.

The uncertainties in predictions of future suitable habitat limits confidence in assisted colonization decisions and has led some to reject assisted colonization entirely.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Despite the uncertainty inherent in predictions of future suitable habitat, some studies have demonstrated that predictions can be quite accurate. A study of Hesperia comma butterflies in Britain identified unoccupied habitat sites that were likely to support the species under a warmer climate based on their similarity to occupied sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = C.

The data suggested that the suitable, uncolonized sites could be good targets for assisted colonization. The results suggested that if investigators can demonstrate their model makes reliable predictions with real-world data, models might be trusted for informing assisted colonization decisions.

===Weighing the risks and benefits===

The science is clear that climate change will drive many species extinct, and a traditional, land-preservation ethic will not prevent extinctions.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; Those wary of moving species instead suggest expanding networks of [[habitat corridor]]s, allowing species to naturally migrate into newly suitable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krosby | first1 = M. | last2 = Tewksbury | first2 = J. | last3 = Haddad | first3 = N.

Evidence suggests that slowly evolving and slowly dispersing species (including species that are dispersal-limited due to [[habitat fragmentation]]) will decline or go extinct in the absence of assisted colonization programs.&lt;ref name=Hoegh/&gt;

In their rejection of assisted colonization, Ricciardi and Simberloff cite the precautionary principle, stating that any unknown risk, no matter how small, of assisted colonization resulting in the creation of new invasive species is enough to require that it not be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt; Many scientists reject this position, however, noting that in many cases where extinctions due to climate change are likely, the risks of extinction from not facilitating colonization are probably far worse than the risks of facilitating colonization.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; They argue that the precautionary principle cuts both ways, and the risks of inaction must be compared against the risks of action. Others note that the ethics of assisting colonization will depend on the values of the stakeholders involved in a specific decision rather than the position of scientists on assisted colonization in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlaepfer | first1 = M.

Many therefore believe we should strive to maintain biodiversity and functioning ecosystems in the face of climate change, even if it means actively moving species beyond their native ranges.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; In the absence of assisted colonization, climate change is already causing many highly mobile species, such as butterflies, to colonize areas they have not previously inhabited.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Through assisted colonization, managers could help rare or less-mobile species keep pace, possibly preventing future extinctions due to a their inability to colonize new areas fast enough. Though some argue that nature often responds to challenges more effectively in the absence of human intervention, others note that current climate change, itself, is a human intervention.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Many species that would have been effective dispersers under slower, natural climate change may be left behind by more mobile species under current rates of human-caused climate change. Thus, through changing the climate, humans may already be artificially segregating species even without actively relocating them.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt;

Critics may also have major concerns about different genetic issues when considering assisted colonization such as maladaptation to novel environmental conditions and hybridization with similar species. These often depend on the genetic structure and level of genetic variation in the source populations. The environmental conditions in which these populations are being introduced must also be taken into account. In order to enhance genetic variation, and thus adaptive potential, material could be sourced from multiple populations. This is known as composite provenancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broadhurst|first1=Linda|title=Seed supply for broadscale restoration: maximizing evolutionary potential|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=4 September 2008|volume=1|issue=4|pages=587–597|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00045.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the environmental gradient is well known, such as predictable changes in elevation or aridity, source populations should be ‘genetically matched’ to recipient sites as best as possible to ensure that the translocated individuals ae not maladapted. This strategy of moving species beyond their current range has been suggested for those that are severely threatened or endangered. By moving them outside their native range, hopefully the immediate threats of predation, disease, and habitat loss can be avoided. However, these species are usually already suffering from some sort of genetic issue resulting from low effective population size such as inbreeding depression, loss in genetic diversity, or maladaptation. Therefore, caution must be taken with what few individuals remain and rapid population growth must be the primary goal. In the case of some species, this can be accomplished with a captive breeding program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Andrew|last2=Sgro|first2=Carla|last3=Young|first3=Andrew|last4=Frankham|first4=Richard|last5=Mitchell|first5=Nicki|last6=Byrne|first6=Margaret|last7=Coates|first7=David|last8=Eldridge|first8=Mark|last9=Sunnucks|first9=Paul|last10=Breed|first10=Martin|last11=James|first11=Elizabeth|last12=Hoffmann|first12=Ary|title=Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=18 June 2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=709–725|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|pmid=22287981|pmc=3265713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Forestry in Canada===
The British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations has acknowledged that climate change will likely threaten the health of the millions of trees that are planted in the province every year, with potential environmental and economic consequences:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Approximately 300 million tree seedlings are planted in the western USA, British Columbia (BC) and Yukon each year. Many climatologists are predicting that the climate could be 3–4°C warmer when those trees are harvested 60-80 years after planting. These changes to climate will expose trees to increased stress and health risks, compromising the many goods and services from our forests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/forgen/interior/AMAT.htm British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations--Assisted Migration Adaptation Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this threat, the Ministry has initiated a large-scale study to determine the long-term health of seedlings of 16 tree species planted beyond their native ranges, into areas expected to become suitable due to changes in climate this century.&lt;ref name=Marris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | title = Forestry: Planting the forest of the future | doi = 10.1038/459906a | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7249 | pages = 906–908 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19536238| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study will be used to develop guidelines for when and how assisted colonization of trees should be conducted.

In 2009, British Columbia also altered guidelines for selecting seeds for replanting forests after a timber harvest. Previously, foresters were required to use seeds from within 200 meters downhill and 300 meters uphill, but the new policy allows foresters to obtain seeds from up to 500 meters downhill, taking advantage of the fact that populations in warmer habitats downhill may be better adapted to the future climate of the restoration site.&lt;ref name=Marris/&gt;

===Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank, USA===
Although not actively engaging in assisted colonization, the Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank seeks to collect seeds from populations of species expected to decline or disappear due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitt | first1 = P. | last2 = Havens | first2 = K. | last3 = Kramer | first3 = A.

{{legal status}}
'''Citizenship''' is the status of a person recognized under the [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[law]] as being a legal member of a [[sovereign state]] or belonging to a [[nation]].

A person may have [[multiple citizenship]]s. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]], while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.&lt;ref&gt;Coplan, David. "Introduction: From empiricism to theory in African border studies." Journal of Borderlands Studies 25.2 (2010): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationality]] is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]] (a large [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g. the [[Citizenship of the United States#Citizenship vs. nationality|United States]], [[British nationality law#Classes of British nationality|the United Kingdom]], nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship|Nationality versus citizenship]]).

==Determining factors==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
{{further information|Nationality law}}
Each country has its own policies, regulations and criteria as to who is entitled to its citizenship. A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but in other cases an application may be required.

* Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I 8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. States normally{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state, although some do not.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.
* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries.
** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).
* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops UK government Web site: Bishops act to tackle sham marriages - New UK Border Agency approved guidance for clergy should help prevent weddings for visas, 11 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.
* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.

==History==
{{Main article|History of citizenship}}

===Polis===
{{Main article|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="tws2Y17"/&gt; The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12&gt;{{Cite book

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn =1-4025-8360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosking explained:

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (πολίτης ''politēs'' &lt; πόλις 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: "To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Civis romanus sum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn =1-4025-8360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; If Greek citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things",{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1998{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} The law itself was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During the European [[Middle Ages]], citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns, and applied mainly to middle class folk. Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.

During this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.

===Renaissance===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Subject}}
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

====United States====
[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dred Scott, plaintiff in the infamous ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case at the Supreme Court of the United States, commissioned by a "group of Negro citizens" and presented to the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, in 1888]]
From 1790 until the mid-twentieth century, United States law used racial criteria to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible to become a naturalized citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/04/news/mn-9708|title=A History of U.S. Citizenship|last=|first=|date=July 4, 1997|website=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naturalization Act of 1790|The Naturalization Act of 1790]], the first law in U.S. history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all people who were not of European descent, stating that "any alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Library of Congress|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under early U.S. laws, African Americans were not eligible for citizenship. In 1857, these laws were upheld in the US Supreme Court case [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]], which ruled that "a free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States," and that "the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393#writing-USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZO|title=Scott v. Sandford|last=|first=|date=1857|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the abolition of slavery following the [[American Civil War]] that African Americans were granted citizenship rights. [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], ratified on July 9, 1868, stated that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendment XIV|last=|first=|date=1868|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] would extend the right to become a naturalized citizen to include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870|title=Naturalization Act of 1870|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikisource|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gains made by African Americans after the Civil War, Native Americans, Asians, and others not considered "free white persons" were still denied the ability to become citizens. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] explicitly denied naturalization rights to all people of Chinese origin, while subsequent acts passed by the US Congress, such as laws in [[Naturalization Act of 1906|1906]], [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]], and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], would include clauses that denied immigration and naturalization rights to people based on broadly defined racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1917_immigration_act.html|title=1917 Immigration Act|last=|first=|date=|website=US Immigration Legislation Online|publisher=University of Washington-Bothell Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court cases such as [[Ozawa v. United States]] (1922) and [[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind|U.S. v. Bhagat Singh Thind]] (1923), would later clarify the meaning of the phrase "free white persons," ruling that ethnically Japanese, Indian, and other non-European people were not "white persons", and were therefore ineligible for naturalization under U.S. law.

Native Americans were not granted full US citizenship until the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924. However, even well into the 1960s some state laws prevented Native Americans from exercising their full rights as citizens, such as the right to vote. In 1962, New Mexico became the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/voters9.html|title=Elections: Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] that the racial and gender restrictions for naturalization were explicitly abolished. However, the act still contained restrictions regarding who was eligible for US citizenship, and retained a national quota system which limited the number of visas given to immigrants based on their national origin, to be fixed "at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality's population in the United States in 1920".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act|title=The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Office of the Historian|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that these immigration quota systems were drastically altered in favor of a less discriminatory system.

====Soviet Union====
The [[Russian Constitution of 1918|1918 constitution of revolutionary Russia]] granted citizenship to any foreigners who were living within Russia, so long as they were "engaged in work and [belonged] to the working class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article2.htm|title=1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

====National Socialism====

[[National Socialism]] or "Nazism", the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which would have different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on males of German (or so-called "Aryan") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The Reich Citizenship Law of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not prove "German" racial heritage were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred "subject" status upon birth, and could only obtain "citizen" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).

The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.

{{Quote|text="The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

The young boy or girl who is of German nationality and is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him conscious of his race and a member of the folk-community. Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in regard to physical training after he has left school; and finally he enters the army. The training in the army is of a general kind. It must be given to each individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and mental requirements of military service. The rights of citizenship shall be conferred on every young man whose health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his period of military service. This act of inauguration in citizenship shall be a solemn ceremony.

And the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be preserved by the young man as the most precious testimonial of his whole life. It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the privileges attached thereto. For the State must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State simply as earners of their livelihood there.

On the occasion of conferring a diploma of citizenship the new citizen must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. This diploma must be a bond which unites together all the various classes and sections of the nation. It shall be a greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the King of a foreign State.

The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State.

The German girl is a subject of the State but will become a citizen when she marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood independently have the right to acquire citizenship if they are German subjects."|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

==Different senses==
[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History of citizenship#Competing senses of citizenship|History of citizenship]].]]
Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both [[Social rights (social contract theory)|rights]] and [[duties]]. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

How citizenship is understood depends on the person making the determination. The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. 

Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" linking "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15&gt;{{Cite book

According to this viewpoint, citizens are sovereign, morally autonomous beings with duties to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack,&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; but are essentially passive politically,&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; and their primary focus is on economic betterment.

* The civic-republican or sometimes classical or civic humanist conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]].

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duties]] and [[rights]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Another is a question about what is the proper balance between political citizenship versus social citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arthur Stinchcombe]], citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

==International==
{{See also|Global citizenship}}
Some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''"The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy"''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===European Union===
{{Main article|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: the consolidated version.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name="Rome" /&gt; established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States&lt;ref&gt;Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.&lt;/ref&gt; which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L'Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The concept of "[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]" has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to "Commonwealth countries and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

==Subnational==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as "citizens" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

"[[Active citizenship]]" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.

===Republic of Ireland===
It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics &amp; Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called "Modern Studies" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.

==Criticism of citizenship education in schools==
There are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg &amp; Guérin"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. &amp; L.J.F. Guérin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education. ''Critical Review'', DOI: 10.1080/08913811.2016.1191191 [https://www.academia.edu/28404527/Questioning_Participation_and_Solidarity_as_Goals_of_Citizenship_Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some educationalists relate this criticism to John Dewey (see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. (2016) Dewey versus ‘Dewey’ on democracy and education, ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice'', DOI: 10.1177/1746197916648283 [https://www.academia.edu/26426259/Dewey_versus_Dewey_on_democracy_and_education]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13296">'''Civil liberties in the United States''' are certain unalienable rights retained by (as opposed to privileges granted to) citizens of the United States under the [[Constitution of the United States]], as interpreted and clarified by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and lower federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontheissues.org/askme/civil_liberties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil liberties]] are simply defined as individual legal and constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or corporations. The liberties explicitly defined, make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the [[right to privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://public.findlaw.com/civil-rights/civil-rights-basics/civil-rights-vs-liberties.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many liberties of people not defined in the Constitution, as stated in the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: ''The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' 

The extent of civil liberties and the periphery of the population of the United States who had access to these liberties has expanded over time. For example, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth|last1=Janda|first2=Jeffrey M.|last2=Berry|first3=Jerry|last3=Goldman|title=The challenge of democracy: government in America|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780618990948|page=207|edition=9. ed., update|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ_iZMofnl0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '[[Three-Fifths Compromise]]' allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for eighty years after the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"We Hold These Truths to be Self-evident;" An Interdisciplinary Analysis of the Roots of Racism &amp; slavery in America Kenneth N.

[[United States free speech exceptions|The following types of speech are not protected constitutionally]]: defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words. Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any expressive act within them.

===Sexual freedom===
The concept of sexual freedom includes a broad range of different rights that are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The idea of sexual freedom has sprung more from the popular opinion of society in more recent years, and has had very little Constitutional backing. The following liberties are included under sexual freedom: sexual expression, sexual choices, sexual education, reproductive justice, and sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glaa.org/archive/2010/woodhullreport1019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual freedom in general is considered an implied procedure, and is not mentioned in the Constitution.  

Sexual freedoms include the freedom to have consensual sex with whomever a person chooses, at any time, for any reason, provided the person is of the age of majority. Marriage is not required, nor are there any requirements as to the gender or number of people you have sex with. Sexual freedom includes the freedom to have private consensual homosexual sex (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'').

===Equal protection===

Equal protection prevents the government from creating laws that are discriminatory in application or effect.

==Overview==

The term "cognitive liberty" was coined by [[neuroethics|neuroethicist]] Dr. [[Wrye Sententia]] and legal theorist and lawyer [[Richard Glen Boire]], the founders and directors of the non-profit [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/index.html Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics] (CCLE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sententia|first=Wrye|chapter=Freedom by Design: Transhumanist Values and Cognitive Liberty|title=The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology and Philosophy of the Human Future|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sententia and Boire define cognitive liberty as "the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full power of his or her mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  FAQ - Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE) | work = General Info  | publisher = Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics | date= 2003-09-15  | url = http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/faqs/faq_general.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sententia and Boire conceived of the concept of cognitive liberty as a response to the increasing ability of technology to monitor and manipulate cognitive function, and the corresponding increase in the need to ensure individual cognitive autonomy and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia divides the practical application of cognitive liberty into two principles:

#As long as their behavior does not endanger others, individuals should not be compelled against their will to use technologies that directly interact with the brain or be forced to take certain psychoactive drugs.
#As long as they do not subsequently engage in behavior that harms others, individuals should not be prohibited from, or criminalized for, using new mind-enhancing drugs and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 227&lt;/ref&gt;

These two facets of cognitive liberty are reminiscent of [[Timothy Leary|Timothy Leary's]] "Two Commandments for the Molecular Age", from his 1968 book ''The Politics of Ecstasy'':

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
  | Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy fellow man
  | Thou shalt not prevent thy fellow man from altering his own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=Timothy|title=The Politics of Ecstasy|date=1968|publisher=Ronin Publishing|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1579510310|page=95|url=https://archive.org/details/ecstaspoliticsof00learrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Supporters of cognitive liberty therefore seek to impose both a negative and a positive obligation on states: to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, and to allow individuals to self-determine their own "inner realm" and control their own mental functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from interference===

This first obligation, to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, seeks to protect individuals from having their mental processes altered or monitored without their consent or knowledge, "setting up a defensive wall against unwanted intrusions".&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Ongoing improvements to [[neurotechnology|neurotechnologies]] such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[electroencephalography]] (or "brain fingerprinting"); and to pharmacology in the form of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[Nootropics]], [[Modafinil]] and other [[psychoactive drugs]], are continuing to increase the ability to both monitor and directly influence human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blitz|first=Marc Jonathan|title=Freedom of Thought for the Extended Mind: Cognitive Enhancement and the Constitution|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|date=2010|issue=1049|pages=1053–1055, 1058–1060|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=marc_jonathan_blitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|title=The Brain on the Stand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many theorists have emphasized the importance of recognizing cognitive liberty in order to protect individuals from the state using such technologies to alter those individuals’ mental processes: "states must be barred from invading the inner sphere of persons, from accessing their thoughts, modulating their emotions or manipulating their personal preferences."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty has been raised in relation to a number of state-sanctioned interventions in individual cognition, from the mandatory psychiatric 'treatment' of homosexuals in the US before the 1970s, to the non-consensual administration of psychoactive drugs to unwitting US citizens during [[CIA]] [[Project MKUltra]], to the forcible administration of mind-altering drugs on individuals to make them competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part I|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=1999|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/curriculum/oncoglib_123.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). ''[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition]'', in the case of ''Sell v United States''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futurist]] and bioethicist [[George Dvorsky]], Chair of the Board of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has identified this element of cognitive liberty as being of relevance to the [[autism rights movement|debate]] around the curing of [[autism spectrum]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dvorsky|first=George|title=Cognitive liberty and the right to one's mind|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/dvorsky20091020|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke University School of Law]] Professor [[Nita Farahany]] has also proposed legislative protection of cognitive liberty as a way of safeguarding the protection from self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, in the light of the increasing ability to access human memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farahany|first=Nita|title=Incriminating Thoughts|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 2012|volume=64|pages=405–406|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5321&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this element of cognitive liberty is often defined as an individual’s freedom from ''state'' interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual’s mental "inner realm".&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Bublitz and Merkel propose the introduction of a new criminal offense punishing "interventions severely interfering with another’s mental integrity by undermining mental control or exploiting pre-existing mental weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Direct interventions that reduce or impair cognitive capacities such as memory, concentration, and willpower; alter preferences, beliefs, or behavioral dispositions; elicit inappropriate emotions; or inflict clinically identifiable mental injuries would all be ''prima facie'' impermissible and subject to criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 68-70&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia and Boire have also expressed concern that corporations and other non-state entities might utilize emerging neurotechnologies to alter individuals' mental processes without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom to self-determine===
Where the first obligation seeks to protect individuals from interference with cognitive processes by the state, corporations or other individuals, this second obligation seeks to ensure that individuals have the freedom to alter or enhance their own consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who enjoys this aspect of cognitive liberty has the freedom to alter their mental processes in any way they wish to; whether through indirect methods such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]] or [[prayer]]; or through direct cognitive intervention through [[psychoactive drugs]] or [[neurotechnology]].

As psychotropic drugs are a powerful method of altering cognitive function, many advocates of cognitive liberty are also advocates of drug law reform; claiming that the "[[war on drugs]]" is in fact a "war on mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boire|first=Richard Glen|title=On Cognitive Liberty Part II|journal=Journal of Cognitive Liberties|date=2000|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/2jcl/2JCL7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCLE, as well as other cognitive liberty advocacy groups such as [http://cognitivelibertyuk.wordpress.com/ Cognitive Liberty UK], have lobbied for the re-examination and reform of prohibited drug law; one of the CCLE's key guiding principles is that: "governments should not criminally prohibit cognitive enhancement or the experience of any mental state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Freedom in Mind|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/mission.html|publisher=Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for reform of restrictions on the use of prescription cognitive-enhancement drugs (also called smart drugs or [[nootropics]]) such as [[Prozac]], [[Ritalin]] and [[Adderall]] have also been made on the grounds of cognitive liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1058-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

This element of cognitive liberty is also of great importance to proponents of the [[transhumanism|transhumanist movement]], a key tenet of which is the [[human enhancement|enhancement]] of human mental function. Dr Wrye Sententia has emphasized the importance of cognitive liberty in ensuring the freedom to pursue human mental enhancement, as well as the freedom to choose against enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia argues that the recognition of a "right to (and not to) direct, modify, or enhance one's thought processes" is vital to the free application of [[List of emerging technologies#Neuroscience|emerging]] [[neurotechnology]] to enhance human cognition; and that something beyond the current conception of freedom of thought is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 355-6&lt;/ref&gt; Sententia claims that "cognitive liberty's strength is that it protects those who do want to alter their brains, but also those who do not".&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with recognized human rights==
Cognitive liberty is not currently recognized as a human right by any international human rights treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 60&lt;/ref&gt; While [[freedom of thought]] is recognized by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), freedom of thought can be distinguished from cognitive liberty in that the former is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''whatever'' they want, whereas cognitive liberty is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to think ''however'' they want.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty seeks to protect an individual’s right to determine their own state of mind and be free from external control over their state of mind, rather than just protecting the content of an individuals’ thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that the lack of protection of cognitive liberty in previous human rights instruments was due to the relative lack of technology capable of directly interfering with mental autonomy at the time the core human rights treaties were created.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; As the human mind was considered invulnerable to direct manipulation, control or alteration, it was deemed unnecessary to expressly protect individuals from unwanted mental interference.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 61&lt;/ref&gt; With modern advances in [[neuroscience]] and in anticipation of its future development however, it is argued that such express protection is becoming increasingly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive liberty then can be seen as an extension of or an "update" to the right to freedom of thought as it has been traditionally understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2013), 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Freedom of thought should now be understood to include the right to determine one’s own mental state as well as the content of one’s thoughts. However, some have instead argued that cognitive liberty is already an inherent part of the international human rights framework as the principle underlying the rights to freedom of thought, expression and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to think in whatever manner one chooses is a "necessary precondition to those guaranteed freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Waterman]] and [[Casey William Hardison]] have argued that cognitive liberty is fundamental to Freedom of Thought because it encompasses the ability to have certain types of experiences, including the right to experience altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, 345&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that cognitive liberty can be seen to be a part of the inherent [[dignity]] of human beings as recognized by Article 1 of the UDHR.&lt;ref&gt;Bublitz and Merkel, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Most proponents of cognitive liberty agree however that cognitive liberty should be expressly recognized as a human right in order to properly provide protection for individual cognitive autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farahany, 405-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sententia (2004), 226-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal recognition==

===In the United States===
{{main|Sell v. United States}}
Richard Glen Boire of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics filed an [[amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] with the [[US Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Sell v. United States]]'', in which the Supreme Court examined whether the court had the power to make an order to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to an individual who had refused such treatment, for the sole purpose of making them [[competence (law)|competent]] to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/sell_ussc_merits.pdf "Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics In Support Of The Petition, in the case of Sell v United States"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/166/case.html ''Sell v. United States'' 539 U.S. 166 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In the case of [[Casey William Hardison|''R v Hardison'']], the defendant, charged with eight counts under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (MDA), including the production of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[LSD]], claimed that cognitive liberty was safeguarded by [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Hardison [2007] 1 Cr App R (S) 37&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison argued that "individual sovereignty over one's interior environment constitutes the very core of what it means to be free", and that as psychotropic drugs are a potent method of altering an individual's mental process, prohibition of them under the MDA was in opposition to Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 433&lt;/ref&gt; The court however disagreed, calling Hardison's arguments a "portmanteau defense" and relying upon the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN Drug Conventions]] and the earlier case of ''R v Taylor'' to deny Hardison's right to appeal to a superior court.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt; Hardison was convicted and given a 20-year prison sentence, though he was released on 29 May 2013 after nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Drug policy reform|Human enhancement}}

While there has been little publicized criticism of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical about the wisdom of recognizing cognitive liberty as a right.&lt;ref&gt;Blitz, 1063&lt;/ref&gt; [[political philosophy|Political philosopher]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Michael J. Sandel]], when examining the prospect of [[Nootropics|memory enhancement]], wrote that "some who worry about the ethics of cognitive enhancement point to the danger of creating two classes of human beings – those with access to enhancement technologies, and those who must make do with an unaltered memory that fades with age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandel|first=Michael J.|title=The Case against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674036383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive liberty then faces opposition obliquely in these interrelated debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6344">{{For|legal confiscation in the United States|search and seizure}}

'''Confiscation''' (from the [[Latin]] ''confiscare'' "to consign to the ''fiscus'', i.e. transfer to the treasury") is a legal form of [[search and seizure|seizure]] by a government or other public authority. The word is also used, popularly, of [[spoliation]] under legal forms, or of any seizure of property as punishment or in enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Confiscation|volume=6|page=907|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
As a punishment, it differs from a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] in that it is not primarily meant to match the crime but rather reattributes the criminal's ill-gotten spoils (often as a complement to the actual punishment for the crime itself; still common with various kinds of [[contraband]], such as protected living organisms) to the community or even aims to rob them of their socio-economic status, in the extreme case reducing them to utter poverty, or if he or she is condemned to death even denies them inheritance to the legal heirs.

Meanwhile, limited confiscation is often in function of the crime, the rationale being that the criminal must be denied the fruits of their fault, while the crime itself is rather punished in some other, independent way, such as [[physical punishment]]s or even a concurring fine.

Often, police will [[auction]] items confiscated via [[police auction]] or [[asset forfeiture]] and keep the proceeds. Theoretically, it is possible for owners to buy back confiscated items.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

In [[airport]]s, potentially dangerous items (such as hazardous chemicals, weapons, and sharp objects) are usually confiscated at inspections. Other items, such as certain food, may also be confiscated, depending on importation laws. Depending on the nature of the items, some may be returned at the end of the flight, while most are discarded or auctioned off. The musical comedian [[Anna Russell]] had an Irish harp confiscated by the [[U.S. Customs Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tZ5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UrMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4708%2C260163|title=Anna Here, But Without Her Harp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally, in Roman law, confiscation was the seizure and transfer of private property to the ''fiscus'' (treasury) by the emperor; hence the appropriation, under legal authority, of private property to the state.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

In modern English law, confiscation embraces [[asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] in the case of goods, and [[escheat]] in the case of lands, for crime or in default of heirs (see also [[Eminent domain]]).&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Goods may also be confiscated by the state for breaches of statutes relating to customs, excise or explosives.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] a confiscation order is a court order made under part 2 (England &amp; Wales), part 3 (Scotland) or part 4 (Northern Ireland) of the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] requiring a convicted defendant to pay a specified sum of money to the state by a specified date.

=== United States ===
During the [[American Revolution]], [[customs racketeering]] became a serious problem. By harshly enforcing customs laws, particularly the more obscure regulations, corrupt customs officials could seize property almost with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=9XHGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22Customs+racketeering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicqrKQiLDWAhVC1oMKHYILAYEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Customs%20racketeering%22&amp;f=false|title=Samuel Adams: America's Revolutionary Politician|last=Alexander|first=John K.|date=2004-01-13|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=|isbn=9781461642787|location=|pages=56|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused significant conflict between the United States and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KKX8sxOHBugC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%22Customs+racketeering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicqrKQiLDWAhVC1oMKHYILAYEQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Customs%20racketeering%22&amp;f=false|title=Revolution Downeast: The War for American Independence in Maine|last=Leamon|first=James S.|date=March 1995|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0870239597|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States among the "war measures" during the [[American Civil War]], acts were passed in 1861 and 1862 confiscating, respectively, property used for "insurrectionary purposes" and the property generally of those engaged in rebellion.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Modern trends==
There was from the late 1980s onwards a resurgence of interest in confiscation as crime prevention tool, which went hand in hand with the interest in the criminalization of [[money laundering]]. A number of international instruments, starting with the 1988 Vienna Convention, have strongly suggested the enactment of legal provisions enabling confiscation of proceeds of crime. The 40 recommendations of the [[FATF]] have also stated its importance as a crime prevention tool.

A further trend has been the reversal of the burden of proof for the purpose of facilitating confiscation. To the surprise of many, it is actually quite legal for law enforcement agencies to take property from people who haven't been convicted of a crime yet as civil asset forfeiture, a practice which brings in millions of dollars of revenue each year, disproportionately affecting people without means or access to a lawyer. &lt;ref&gt; {{citeweb|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/11/10/363102433/police-can-seize-and-sell-assets-even-when-the-owner-broke-no-law|title=Police Can Seize And Sell Assets Even When The Owner Broke No Law|author=Laura Sullivan|publisher=NPR|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''culturagram''' is a family assessment tool used in the practice of [[social work]] which was first introduced by [[Fordham University]] professor, Dr.  Elaine Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialworkpodcast.blogspot.com/2008/12/visual-assessment-tools-culturagram.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/tta-system/cultural-linguistic/fcp/docs/exploring-cultural-concepts-the-culturagram.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.fordham.edu/congress/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
In social work and other fields, [[cultural competence]] is  an important skill.  As the number and diversity of immigrants has increased dramatically in the [[United States]] (Camarota, 2007) there is increased need for clinicians to understand the cultural backgrounds of their clients.  A culturagram is a [[family]] assessment tool that provides a graphical representation of various aspects of an individual and family's [[culture]].

It can be helpful in assessment and intervention planning for culturally diverse families.   This tool grew out of the recognition that families are becoming increasingly culturally diverse and social workers must be able to understand cultural differences between and within families. When attempting to understand culturally diverse families, families needed to be understood within a cultural context.   Assessing a family only in terms of a specific cultural identity, however, may lead to overgeneralization and stereotyping (Congress &amp; Kung, 2013). A Puerto Rican family in which all members are American citizens and have lived in the United States for 20 years is very different from an undocumented Mexican family that emigrated last month. Yet both families are considered Hispanic/Latino. Even within the same family group, each member has had a different immigration and acculturation experience, as often family members immigrate at different times and some members may be U.S. citizens, while others are undocumented. Furthermore, family members who regularly work or attend school in the larger community may be more acculturated than those who stay at home.

While the [[eco-map]] (Hartman, 1995) and [[genogram]] (McGoldrick, Gerson, &amp; Perry, 2008) are useful tools in assessing the family, neither emphasize the important role of culture in understanding the family. The culturagram was developed to help in understanding the cultural background of culture in families (Congress, 1994, 1997; Congress &amp; Kung, 2013). This tool has been applied to work with people of color (Lum, 2004), battered women (Congress &amp; Brownell, 2007), children (Congress, 2001), older people (Brownell &amp; Fenley, 2009), families in crisis (Congress, 2000), Mexican families (Congress, 2004a), Latino and Asian families (Congress &amp; Kung, 2005), immigrant families with health problems (Congress, 2004b; Congress, 2013) and in family development theory (Congress, 2008).

==Creation of the culturagram==

The culturagram represents an attempt to individualize culturally diverse families (Congress &amp; Kung, 2013). Completing a culturagram on a family can help a clinician develop a better understanding of the family. First developed in 1994 and then revised in 2000 and again in 2009, the culturagram examines the following areas:

* reasons for relocation
* legal status
* time in community
* language spoken at home and in the community
* health beliefs and access to health care
* impact of trauma and crisis events
* contact with cultural and religious institutions, holidays, food, and clothing
* oppression, discrimination, bias, and racism
* values about education and work
* values about family—structure, power, myths, and rules. Camarota, S. (2007)


The culturagram has been seen as an essential tool in helping social workers work more effectively with families from many different cultures. Not only does it help the social worker achieve greater understanding of the culture of a family, it can also point the way toward future [[therapy|treatment]]. The culturagram can be useful in arriving at decisions about treatment planning and intervention.   While using the culturagram the practitioner is required to look at the family in the here and now. Sometimes it is helpful, however, to construct the culturagram at different points of time, first at the beginning of intervention and then at a future point.  In constructing the culturagram a retrospective approach is also useful.  To truly understand immigrant families learning about an immigrant’s history is important.  For example, the social worker can study what was the  immigrants’ experience in their country of origin and in transit.  Often a developmental approach that looks at three stages of immigration (pre-migration, transit, and current situation) is helpful in  working with immigrants. (Drachman, 2004).  For example, [[refugee]]s may have had particularly traumatic experiences in their country of origin and undocumented immigrants through the transit period that may affect their current psychological well being in the United States.
  
Current practice looks to evidence that specific interventions are effective. Students and practitioners have used the culturagram in their professional practice with families and reported that it is helpful in engaging families in a nonthreatening way. In the use of the culturagram culture is viewed through a multidimensional lens, rather than as a monolithic entity. Initial evaluation of the culturagram has been positive, and there are further plans to assess further its effectiveness in promoting culturally competent practice.

With the increased number of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants in the United States]], there will be greater demand for culturally competent practice with immigrant clients and families. Social workers will need to study what methods and models are the most effective. The culturagram emerges as a useful method to better understand and plan interventions with immigrant families

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2067">'''Double mass analysis''' &lt;ref&gt;Searcy, J.K. and C.H. Hardison (1960). Double-mass curves. U.S. Geological Survey ''Water-Supply Paper ''1541-B''''&lt;/ref&gt; is a commonly used [[data analysis]] approach for investigating the behaviour of records made of [[hydrology|hydrological]] or [[meteorology|meteorological]] data at a number of locations. It is used to determine whether there is a need for corrections to the data - to account for changes in data collection procedures or other local conditions. Such changes may result from a variety of things including changes in [[instrumentation]], changes in observation procedures, or changes in gauge location or surrounding conditions. Double mass analysis for checking consistency of a [[hydrological]] or [[meteorological]] record is considered to be an essential tool before taking it for analysis purpose. This method is based on the hypothesis that each item of the recorded data of a population is consistent.

An example of a double mass analysis is a "double mass plot", or "double mass curve".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.M. (1983) Engineering Hydrology, 3rd edition. Macmillan Press, London. p.27&lt;/ref&gt; For this, points and/or a joining line are plotted where the x- and y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another.
This [[Scientific technique|technique]] is based on the principle that when each recorded data comes from the same [[parent population]], they are consistent.

An '''edge case''' is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating [[parameter]].  For example, a stereo speaker might noticeably distort audio when played at maximum volume, even in the absence of any other extreme setting or condition.

An edge case can be expected or unexpected. In [[engineering]], the process of planning for and gracefully addressing edge cases can be a significant task, and yet this task may be overlooked or underestimated.

Non-trivial edge cases can result in the failure of an object that is being engineered. They may not have been foreseen during the [[design]] phase. And they may not have been thought possible during normal use of the object. For this reason, attempts to formalize good engineering standards often include information about edge cases.

==Software engineering==
In programming, an edge case typically involves input values that require special handling in an [[algorithm]] behind a computer program.  As a measure for validating the behavior of computer programs in such cases, [[Unit testing|unit tests]] are usually created; they are testing [[Boundary case|boundary conditions]] of an [[algorithm]], [[Subroutine|function]] or [[Method (computer programming)|method]]. A series of edge cases around each "boundary" can be used to give reasonable [[Code coverage|coverage]] and confidence using the assumption that if it behaves correctly at the edges, it should behave everywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

For example, a function that divides two numbers might be tested using both very large and very small numbers. This assumes that if it works for both ends of the magnitude spectrum, it should work correctly in between.

An ''English-medium education'' system is one that uses [[English language|English]] as the primary [[medium of instruction]]&amp;mdash;particularly where English is not the mother tongue of the students.

Initially associated with the expansion of English from its homeland in England and the lowlands of [[Scotland]] and its spread to the rest of Great Britain and Ireland, the rise of the British Empire increased the language's spread,&lt;ref name="qub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/imperial.htm |title=The Imperial Archive.

A working knowledge of English is perceived as being valuable; for example, English is very dominant in the [[English in computing|world of computing]]. As a result, many states throughout the world where English is not the predominant language encourage or mandate the use of English as the normal medium of instruction.

==By country==
[[File:British School.jpg|thumb|Public advert on a street hoarding in Livorno, Italy]]

===Canada===
{{main|Education in Canada}}
{{further|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories|Official bilingualism in Canada|Timeline of official languages policy in Canada}}
Education is a provincial matter under the [[Canadian constitution, section 92]].  French language rights have been guaranteed in the province of Quebec since the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]], French outside of Quebec and all other minority languages have faced laws against them at one time or another.  English-only education laws were gradually rolled out across Canada during the nineteenth and twentieth century, culminating in the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] 1896 and [[Regulation 17]] in Ontario in 1912, which both attacked French and other European minority languages, and the [[Indian residential schools system]] which attacked Aboriginal languages.

These policies were gradually abolished in the wake of Canada's adoption of official bilingualism (French/English) in 1969 and multiculturalism in 1971, but English remains the predominant language of education outside of Quebec and New Brunswick.

===Wales===
{{see|Welsh medium education}}
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], passed by the [[Parliament of England]], annexing [[Wales]] to the [[Kingdom of England]] are sometimes known as the "Acts of Union."

An often quoted example of the effects on the [[Welsh language]] is the first section of the 1535 Act, which states: "the people of the same dominion have and do daily use a speche nothing like ne consonant to the naturall mother tonge used within this Realme" and then declares the intention "utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs" belonging to Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApknBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44|title=Centres and Peripheries: Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Journalism in the Twenty First Century|year=2014|isbn=978-1443827577|editor= David Hutchison and Hugh O'Donnell|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 20 of the 1535 Act makes English the only language of the law courts and that those who used Welsh would not be appointed to any public office in Wales: 
{{quote|Also be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Justices, Commissioners, Sheriffs, Coroners, Escheators, Stewards, and their Lieutenants, and all other Officers and Ministers of the Law, shall proclaim and keep the Sessions Courts, Hundreds, Leets, Sheriffs Courts, and all other Courts in the English Tongue;
(2) and all Oaths of Officers, Juries and Inquests, and all other Affidavits, Verdicts and [[Wager of Law]], to be given and done in the English Tongue;
(3) and also that from henceforth no Person or Persons that use the Welsh Speech or Language, shall have or enjoy any manner Office or Fees within this Realm of England, Wales, or other the King's Dominion, upon Pain of forfeiting the same Offices or Fees, unless he or they use and exercise the English Speech or Language.}}

An effect of this language clause was to lay the foundation for creating a thoroughly Anglicised ruling class of landed gentry in Wales, which would have many consequences.

The parts of the 1535 Act relating to language were definitively repealed only in 1993, by the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]], though annotations on the [[Statute Law Database]] copy of the act reads that sections 18–21 were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1887]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1846, the British Government appointed three commissioners to enquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all monoglot English-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CGN/CommsEnq.html |title=Report of Commission of Enquiry into the State of Education in Wales, 1847 |publisher=GENUKI |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners reported to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (The [[Treachery of the Blue Books]]) as, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, Non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as "the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/glencoe-of-welsh-history-is-published-online-6112711.html|title='Glencoe of Welsh history' is published online|date=4 January 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/common.htm |title=CAIN: CSC: The Common School |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=5 May 1993 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in (1596) a recommendation that "the Irish ... be educated in English, in grammar and in science ... for learning hath that wonderful power of itself that it can soften and temper the most stern and savage nature."

The setting up of 'Royal Schools' in Ireland, was proclaimed in 1608 by [[James I]], with the intended purpose "that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion."

These schools provided an English-medium education to the sons of landed settlers in Ireland, most of whom were of Scottish or English descent.

However, only five such schools were actually set up; [[The Royal School, Armagh]] in County Armagh, [[Portora Royal School]] in County Fermanagh, The Cavan Royal School in County Cavan, The [[Royal School Dungannon]] in Tyrone and The Royal and Prior School in County Donegal.

The ''National Education System''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229124833/http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sic) was founded in 1831, by the British Government, under the direction of the Chief Secretary, E.G. Stanley. Some 2,500 national schools were established in Ulster in the period 1832–1870, built with the aid of the Commissioners of National Education and local trustees.

Prof. S. Ó Buachalla states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the first four decades of their existence, there is no mention of the Irish language in the programme of regulations of the Commissioners of National Education; furthermore no provision whatsoever was made in 1831 when the original scheme was drawn up for education of those children who spoke Irish only. According to the official opinion of later Commissioners, expressed in a formal reply to the Chief Secretary in 1884, " the anxiety of the promoters of the National Scheme was to encourage the cultivation of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=European Journal of Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=1984 |page=75 |title=Educational Policy and the Role of the Irish Language from 1831 to 1981 |author=Séamas Ó Buachalla |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=1503260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 April 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Irish patriot [[P.H. Pearse]] published a series of studies of the English-medium education system in Ireland. His article entitled The Murder Machine&lt;ref&gt;The Murder Machine http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900007-001/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; embodies an article which appeared in the Irish Review for February 1913.

Pearse wrote in his pamphlet the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And English education in Ireland has seemed: to some like the bed of [[Procustes]], the bed on which all men that passed that way must lie, be it never so big for them, be it never so small for them: the traveller for whom it was too large had his limbs stretched until he filled it; the traveller for whom it was too small had his limbs chopped off until he fitted into it—comfortably. It was a grim jest to play upon travellers. The English have done it to Irish children not by way of jest, but with a purpose. Our English-Irish systems took, and take, absolutely no cognisance of the differences between individuals, of the differences between localities, of the: differences between urban and rural communities, of the differences springing from a different ancestry, Gaelic or Anglo-Saxon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scotland===
{{see|Gaelic medium education in Scotland}}
Attempts were made by legislation, in the later medieval and early modern period, to establish English at first among the aristocracy and increasingly amongst all ranks by education acts and parish schools. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed some ten such acts between 1494 and 1698.

In 1609 nine Gaelic [[tribal chief|chieftains]] were abducted and forced to sign the [[Statutes of Iona]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040718082847/http://www.saorsamedia.com/library/gaelicinscotland.html Gaelic in Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem to have been designed specifically to [[Anglicize]] leaders and institutions of Gaelic society, in order to bring it under control of central government.

Among the items listed in this agreement was the "planting of the gospell among these rude, barbarous, and uncivill people" by Protestant churches; the outlawing of bards who were traditionally on circuit between the houses of noblemen; the requirement that all men of wealth send their heirs to be educated in Lowland schools where they would be taught to "speik, reid, and wryte Inglische."

The then King [[James VI]], followed this by the [[School Establishment Act 1616]], which sought to establish schools in every parish in the [[Scottish Highlands]] so that "the youth be exercised and trayned up in civilitie, godlines, knawledge, and learning, that the vulgar Inglische toung be universallie plantit, and the Irische language, whilk is one of the chief and principall causes of the continewance of barbaritie and incivilitie amongis the inhabitantis of the Ilis and Heylandis, may be abolisheit and removeit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqE0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95&amp;lpg=PT95|title=Gaelic Scotland: The Transformation of a Culture Region|author=Charles W. J. Withers|date=July 1990|journal=[[Geographical Review]]|volume=80|number=3|pages=327–329|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1709 the [[Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge]] (SSPCK) was established in order to further funding sources for Highland church schools. All manner of incentives and punishments were used to stop children from speaking [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending. At first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic-English vocabulary, then in 1766 brought in a [[New Testament]] with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. After a number of years of unsuccessful attempts at English-only teaching methods, it was realized that literacy in Gaelic was a much more effective means of teaching and a bridge towards fluency in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkX2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61|page=61|title=National Literacy Campaigns: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|first1=R.F.|last1=Arnove|first2=H.J.|last2=Graff|isbn=978-0-306-42458-8|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1918 education acts have provided for teaching Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, but development was very slow until Gaelic
became an initial teaching medium in the Gaelic areas of [[Inverness-shire]] and [[Ross-shire]] from 1958. In 1975 the newly created [[Western Isles]] education authority introduced bilingual [[primary education]] shortly followed by [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] Region in [[Skye]]. Gaelic-medium primary education commenced with two schools in 1985, growing to 42 units by 1993/94.

In [[secondary education]], Gaelic has long been taught as a subject—often through the medium of English, even to native speakers. A move towards bilingual secondary education in the [[Western Isles]] was frustrated by a change of government in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 United Kingdom general election]]. Gaelic-medium secondary education has developed less satisfactorily. [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic-medium streams]] followed on from primary in [[Glasgow]] and [[Inverness]], with some experimentation in the Western Isles, but the sector is hampered by acute teacher shortage, and an [[Ofsted]] inspectorate report of 1994 regarded Gaelic-medium secondary education as divisive and inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/gaelic/an/i1/i1.html#2.3(Glasgow) |title=Euromosaic – Gaelic in Scotland (United Kingdom) |publisher=Uoc.es |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third level provision through Gaelic is provided by [[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]] (literally: "the great barn at Ostaig") a Gaelic-medium college based in [[Sleat]], on the Isle of Skye in north west Scotland. It is part of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]], and also has a campus on [[Islay]] known as [[Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle]].

In 2004, [[Prince Charles]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], (who is patron of the College) stated  that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The beauty of Gaelic music and song is inescapable. But without the living language, it risks becoming an empty shell. That is why an education system, up to the level represented by the college here in Skye, is so important – to ensure fluency and literacy which will continue to renew the health and creativity of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/speeches/speech-hrh-the-prince-charles-duke-of-rothesay-sabhal-mor-ostaig-isle-of-skye|title=A speech by HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, at Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Isle of Skye|work=princeofwales.gov.uk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]] is the first piece of legislation to give formal recognition to the Gaelic language in Scotland.  It recognises Gaelic as an official language of Scotland, commanding "equal respect" with English.

Education Minister [[Peter Peacock]], who has ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: "This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=4560&amp;i=34453|title=Official Report|date=2 February 2005|publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]]|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall===
[[File:DSCN1948PenrynPrayerBookRebellionMemorial.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], Prayer Book Rebellion Memorial, near the site of [[Glasney College]].]] In the [[Prayer Book rebellion]] of 1549, where the English state sought to suppress [[Cornish language]] speaking with the introduction of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which was made available only in English. In replacing [[Latin]] with English, and under the guise of suppressing Catholicism, English was effectively imposed as the language of the Church, with the intent of it becoming the language of the people. At the time people in many areas of [[Cornwall]] did not speak or understand English.

The forced introduction of English to church services in Cornwall  provided a major reason for the rebellion. The articles of the rebels states: "and we the cornyshe men (whereof certen of vs vnderstande no Englysh) vtterly refuse thys new English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Looking at the Mermaid: A Reader in Cornish Literature 900-1900|page=267|editor=[[Alan M. Kent]], [[Tim Saunders]]|publisher=Francis Boutle Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-1903427019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Raj===

British records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_goyal_education.htm |title=Education in Pre-British India |publisher=Infinityfoundation.com |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. Subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students from all classes of society. Gandhi is said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed by British rule.

The [[Charter Act]] of 1813 decreed that English would be taught in the Indian education system although not as a replacement for indigenous languages. Instead, it was anticipated that English would co-exist with Oriental studies as a means by which moral law could be reinforced.

The 1817 publication of James Mill's ''History of British India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0sITK8fQAK-wEdh_22v1sG6&amp;id=4c8NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |title=The history of British India, Volume 6 |author=James Mill, Horace Hayman Wilson |publisher=James Madden |year=1847 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved to be a defining text in the theories of how education policies should be formed (ed. Horace Hayman Wilson: London, Piper, Stephenson and Spence, 1858). Mill advocated the introduction of European knowledge to counter balance Indian traits judged to be irrational. Instilling ideals of reason would accordingly 'reform' Indians by the example of Western systems of thought and outlook. His ideas discredited Indian culture, language and literature even as its assumptions of moral superiority authorised and justified the presence of the British in India.

The current system of education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |title=Western Education in Nineteenth-Century India |publisher=Qub.ac.uk |date=4 June 1998 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415132111/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced and funded by the British in the 19th century, following recommendations by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.

Thomas MacAulay's infamous 'Minute On Indian Education' (1835) encapsulates both the overt and covert agendas for such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Macaulay's Children'  is used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle. It is usually used in a derogatory fashion, and the connotation is one of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage.

The passage to which the term refers is from his 'Minute on Indian Education' delivered in 1835. It reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1835 Lord William Bentninck revitalised the earlier Charter Act with his New Education Policy which determined that English should be the official language of the courts, diplomacy and administration. Prior to this Persian had been the accepted language of diplomacy. Bentninck's motive was ostensibly to "regenerate" society, but the ramifications were boundless. From this moment on only those with Western style education and a knowledge of English were eligible for government employment or for a career in public life.

In 1854 Sir Charles Wood published his Education Dispatch which was aimed at widening the availability of Western oriented knowledge. Universities were established under the London examining model in [[Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and [[Madras]].

Lord Ripon's Hunter Commission of 1882 somewhat belatedly advocated that there should be increased provision of education at primary level and for women. The theory was that there would be a subsequent rise in the calibre of applicants for third level entry.

The inevitable result was that an Indian-based education was viewed as being second rate in comparison to an English-medium education.

===India===
Private English medium schools are gaining popularity throughout India as urban middle class Indians who feel that English is  the global language send their children to these schools. Increasingly, many poor families too are sending their children to English medium schools due the poor quality of education in Government run vernacular medium schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Malaysia===
{{main|Education in Malaysia}}
Up until 1981 in [[West Malaysia]] (and some years later in [[East Malaysia]]), there were English-medium schools set up by the former British colonial government and Christian missionaries. However, following the implementation of the 1967 National Language Act which stipulated the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay-medium schools; all English-medium schools were definitely phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Hickey|title=Standards of English: Codified Varieties around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2kgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85121-3|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has now caused many newly graduates to become unemployed as they cannot find jobs especially in the [[private sector]] due to the lack of English proficiency; with the graduates can only depends on [[public sector]] jobs provided by the government.

===Indonesia===
English medium school in Indonesia consists of [[International school]] and [[National Plus school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian National "Plus" and International Schools|url=http://www.expat.or.id/orgs/plusschools.html|work=Living in Indonesia|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A National Plus school in Indonesia refers to a school that offers education beyond the minimum requirements of the national Indonesian accreditation authorities. National Plus school offers some subjects taught in English  and may provide some native English speakers on staff or may offer international curriculum such as from [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) or the [[International Baccalaureate Organisation]] (IBO).
National Plus schools can typically be differentiated from international schools by their core market. International schools tend to primarily exist to serve the needs of expatriate students and national plus schools for Indonesian students; however there is significant overlap on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guides for Foreign Residents &amp; Expats|url=http://livinginindonesia.info/item/national-plus-schools/|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

The Government of [[Pakistan]] has recently{{when|date=February 2018}} announced the introduction of English lessons on a phased basis to all schools across the country. This new policy states that "English language has been made compulsory from Class-1 onwards" and the "Introduction of English as medium of instruction for science, mathematics, computer science and other selected subjects like economics and geography in all schools in a graduated manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.pk/  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208235230/http://www.moe.gov.pk/ |date=8 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caretaker Minister for Education Mr. Shujaat Ali Beg declared 25 January 2008 that 18 colleges of the city of Karachi would be made ''"Model English Medium Colleges,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interface.edu.pk/students/Jan-08/English-medium-colleges.asp|title=18 colleges declared 'English medium'|work=interface.edu.pk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===

In [[Bangladesh]] the system of education is divided into three different branches. Students are free to choose anyone of them provided that they have the means. These branches are: The English Medium, The Bengali Medium, and The Religious Branch. In the English Medium system, courses are all taught in English using English books with the exception for Bengali and Arabic. English medium schools are mainly private and thus traditionally were reserved for the upper and upper middle class. However huge demand in urban areas has resulted in large number of English-medium schools mushrooming. This has caused a fall in quality. O and A level exams are arranged through the [[British Council]] in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307131603/http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 March 2001 |title=Education in Bangladesh |publisher=Sanisoft.tripod.com |accessdate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Union of Myanmar===

In the [[Burma|Union of Myanmar]], the education system is based on the British Colonial model, due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences. Nearly all schools are government-operated, and also there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools.

===The Philippines===
The United States of America won the [[Philippine–American War]] (1898–1901), and declared the Philippines a US colony. US imperial rule followed. [[Tomás Mac Síomóin|Mac Síomóin]] quotes the Filipino scholar [[E. San Juan]] who made the following comment regarding the use made by the US administration of the English language to rule his country:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its conquest of hegemony or consensual rule was literally accomplished through the deployment of English as the official medium of business, schooling and government. This pedagogical strategy was designed to cultivate an intelligencia, a middle stratum divorced from its roots in the plebeian masses, who would service the ideological apparatus of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Americanization was mediated through English, sanctioned as the language of prestige and aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;'Ó Mhársa go Magla' by Tomás Mac Síomóin. First published in 2006. ISSN 1649-3079&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English is used for instruction at the [[University of the Philippines]].

===Slovenia===
[[University of Ljubljana]] teaches at least 100 courses in English.  In ''[[Where to Invade Next]]'', Michael Moore interviews several American citizens studying at the university who were taking courses taught in English.

===South Africa===

====Colonial education====
The earliest European schools in South Africa were established in the Cape Colony in the late seventeenth century by Dutch Reformed Church elders committed to biblical instruction, which was necessary for church confirmation. In rural areas, itinerant teachers (meesters) taught basic literacy and math skills. British mission schools proliferated after 1799, when the first members of the London Missionary Society arrived in the Cape Colony.[8]

Language soon became a sensitive issue in education. At least two dozen English-language schools operated in rural areas of the Cape Colony by 1827, but their presence rankled among devout Afrikaners, who considered the English language and curriculum irrelevant to rural life and Afrikaner values. Throughout the nineteenth century, Afrikaners resisted government policies aimed at the spread of the English language and British values, and many educated their children at home or in the churches.

====Milner Schools====
In order to anglicize the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] area during the [[Anglo Boer war]], [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] set out to influence British Education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the "Milner Schools" in South Africa. These schools consist of modern day [[Pretoria High School for Girls]], [[Pretoria Boys High School]], [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], Hamilton Primary School, and St. Marys DSG.

===China===
{{main|Education in China}}
A number of universities are involved English-medium education by International Scholarly Exchange Curriculum program (ISEC program). ISEC program establishes a platform for those universities to communicate with other international institutions who use English-medium education. Other famous universities that offer English-medium education (China-Foreign cooperative universities), such as [[University of Nottingham Ningbo, China]], [[United International College]], [[Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University]], Shanghai Newyork University and Wenzhou-Kean University.

'''Equality of sacrifice''' is a term used in [[political theory]] and [[political philosophy]] to refer to the perceived fairness of a coercive policy.

[[John Stuart Mill]] noticed that citizens often view [[tax]]ation laws as being fair, as long as taxation is also applied equally to everyone else in society.&lt;ref&gt;"As a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it, whatever sacrifices it requires from them should be made to bear as nearly as possible with the same pressure upon all [...] Equality of taxation, therefore, as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacrifice." [[John Stuart Mill]]. 1848. ''[[Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]]'', p. 804 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2006747]&lt;/ref&gt; Political theorist [[Margaret Levi]] applied the term to the perceived fairness of [[conscription]] in democracies, to which citizens may consent as long as conscription is enforced as a universal duty &amp;ndash; as opposed to elitist and exceptionalist policies, as it will sometimes occur in partial [[mobilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret. 1997. ''Consent, Dissent and Patriotism''. Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|052159961X}}) p. 26 &lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also adopted by [[Lee Iacocca]]&lt;ref&gt;Iacocca and Novak. 1984. ''[[Iacocca: An Autobiography]]''. New York: Bantam Books. Chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who, as the president of [[Chrysler]], lowered his salary to less than a dollar a year before asking union members for radical wage cuts in order to deal with the company's financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Yeon and Mai-Dalton, Renate R. 1999. "The Model of Follower's Responses To Self-Sacrificial Leadership: An Empirical Test". ''The Leadership Quarterly'', Volume 10, Issue 3 (November 18) p. 398 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W5N-3XX6KF9-F&amp;_user=789722&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000043357&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=789722&amp;md5=634ac86977034115cf258410ce309fd1]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Iacocca's example has often been mentioned in opposition to "unconditional" government bail-out of failing companies. In a letter to the leaders of the big three U.S. automakers, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] said that before receiving a government bailout executives should follow the example of former Chrysler head Lee Iacocca and cut their own pay:

{{cquote|Lee Iacocca essentially worked for pennies to demonstrate leadership and forcefully prove to his colleagues that he was ready to make sacrifices to reinvigorate Chrysler [...] Today’s executives could learn a lot from this example. They should take every step possible, including cutting executive salaries and bonuses, and exhaust all alternatives before coming to the taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in help.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Jason. Nov. 14, 2008. "Grassley calls on automakers to cut executive salaries". ''The Iowa Independent'' [http://iowaindependent.com/8496/grassley-calls-on-automakers-to-cut-executive-salaries] (Retrieved May 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some economists believe that the minimum wage laws in the United States lead to less equality because young black males are less likely to be able to get a job when the minimum wage is increased; this inequality exists primarily because young black workers typically live in urban areas where the food and drink industry, who mainly pay their workers minimum wage, are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Even |first=William |title=Unequal Harm: Racial Disparities in the Employment Consequences of Minimum Wage Increases |url=http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |publisher=Employment Policies Institute |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184058/http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''estimated sign''', '''℮''', also referred to as the '''e-mark or "quantité estimée"''' (Unicode [[Letterlike Symbols#Symbols|U+212E]]), is a mark that can be found on some pre-packed goods in Europe. The estimated sign indicates that the packaging fulfils [[European Union Directive]] 2009/34/EC.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009L0034&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the directive is limited to packaging that has a predetermined nominal quantity of {{convert|5|g}} to {{convert|10|kg}} or {{convert|5|ml}} to {{convert|10|l}}, is filled without the purchaser present and of which the quantity cannot be altered without opening or destroying the packing material.

The estimated sign indicates that:
* the [[average]] quantity of product in a batch of packages shall not be less than the nominal quantity stated on the label;
* the proportion of packages having a negative error greater than the tolerable negative error shall be sufficiently small for batches of packages to satisfy the requirements of the official reference test as specified in legislation;
* none of the packages marked have a negative error greater than twice the tolerable negative error (since no such package may bear the estimated sign).

The tolerable negative error is related to the nominal quantity and varies between 9% on packages nominally {{convert|50|g|abbr=on}} or {{convert|50|ml|abbr=on}} or less, to 1.5% on packages nominally {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or {{convert|1|l}} or more. The tolerable error decreases as nominal quantity increases, and is done by alternating intervals where there is a percentage error and intervals where there is a fixed error (and thus over those intervals the ''percentage'' error decreases).

The mark looks like a stylised lowercase "e" and its shape, &lt;big&gt;℮&lt;/big&gt;, is precisely defined by an EU directive. It must be placed in the same field of vision as the nominal quantity. The sign has been added to the [[Unicode]] list of characters at position U+212E.

The estimated sign may be printed on a package if:
* the quantity of product in the package and its labelling meet the requirements, and
* the packer either measures the content of each package or carries out production checks in accordance with procedures recognized by the competent departments in the [[Member state of the European Union|member state]], and
* the packer holds at the disposal of those departments the documents containing the results of such checks and corrections and adjustments that have been shown to be necessary.

== Tolerable negative error ==
[[File:Eu-estimation-tolerance-absolute.svg|thumb|300px|Absolute error tolerances.]]
[[File:Eu-estimation-tolerance-relative.svg|thumb|300px|Relative error tolerances.]]

Error tolerance decreases as nominal quantity increases, by alternating intervals of a given ''percentage'' error with intervals of a given ''amount'' error: these interpolate between the stepwise decreases in percentage error.

The estimated sign indicates that the average quantity of product in a batch of packages shall not be less than the nominal quantity stated on the label.

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

== Argument for free migration ==
{{Expand section||date=September 2016}}
Although the two are not the same issue, free migration is similar in spirit to the concept of [[free trade]], and both are advocated by [[free market]] economists on the grounds that [[economics]] is not a [[zero-sum game]] and that free markets are, in their opinion, the best way to create a fairer and balanced economic system, thereby increasing the overall economic benefits to all concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens|first=Michael|date=2011|title=Economics and Immigration: Trillion Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume= 25|issue= 3|pages=83–106|doi=10.1257/jep.25.3.83|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Khadria The movement of people and goods is linked], Binod Khadria, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding noteworthy differences among these political ideologies, many [[Libertarianism|libertarians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libertarianism - What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Brennan|first=Jason|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=42, 50, 119, 125|quote=Libertarians also support free immigration. [...] They believe everyone has the right to take employment in any other country, regardless of citizenship. They hold that, except in special circumstances, governments may not forbid citizens from leaving a country, nor may governments forbid foreigners from entering. (Page 42)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] advocate open immigration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf Immigration Control: What about the workers?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707041531/http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf |date=2007-07-07 }}, Paul Marks, Free Life No. 19, Page 12, November, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; as do [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-spring/immigration-individual-rights/|title = Immigration and Individual Rights|date = Spring 2008|accessdate = May 14, 2015|website = [[The Objective Standard]]|publisher = |last = Biddle|first = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[free market]] economists believe that competition is the essence of a healthy economic system, and that any short-term negative impact on individual economic factors that is caused by free migration is more than justified by the prospects of long-term growth for the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/defense-free-migration/ In Defense of Free Migration], Richard M. Ebeling, The Future of Freedom Foundation, June 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights perspective ===
From a [[Human rights|human-rights]] perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]:
# Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
# Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=PecoudMigration Antoine Pécoud and Paul de Guchteneire (Eds): ''MIGRATION WITHOUT BORDERS, Essays on the Free Movement of People ''(Berghahn Books, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against free migration ==
Arguments against free immigration are usually economical, cultural or security-related. Some arguments are [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] or what some critics claim to be "[[xenophobia|xenophobic]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Krikorian Borders are the line between 'us' and 'them'], Mark Krikorian, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or ones similar to arguments against [[free trade]], favouring [[protectionism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Free migration of war/political refugees ==
War-related chaos can lead to the breakdown of borders and allow for ''de facto'' free immigration. The natural attempts to flee strife, or escape a conquering enemy, can quickly lead to millions of [[refugees]]. Even where border controls are in place they can be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people. Once settled into [[refugee camp]]s, these reluctant [[immigrants]] may take decades to be either repatriated back or naturalized into their new country. This has been the situation with the [[Palestinian refugees#Jordan|Palestinians in Jordan]].

During the [[Cold War]], a migration paradox arose in which some of the [[communist state]]s forbade emigration, while the "[[Free World]]" would freely accept the [[defector]]s. This policy persists for [[Cuba]]ns&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration-usa.com/cuban_refugee.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], who are both allowed particular forms of free immigration to the [[United States]] based on their automatic refugee status.

== Areas with free external migration ==
{{Main|Visa policy of Svalbard}}

All people regardless of citizenship are allowed to live and work in [[Svalbard]] without a visa or residence permit, as long as they demonstrate they are able to support themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sysselmannen.no/en/Visitors/Entry-and-residence/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual perspectives on migration ==
Through numerous situations and encounters, immigration can be a test of mental fortitude rather than physical ability. In [[Buddhism]], a [[bodhisattva]] is considered to be a guide to awakening and to the Pure Lands. "The Buddha declares that we are all bodhisattvas destined to attain full Awakening. It seems that each of us, then, is engaged in 'spiritual immigration'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World|last=Thompson|first=John|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=31–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha asserts that everyone is a bodhisattva, or a 'spiritual immigrant', who must attain various virtues which ultimately leads to ''[[prajnaparamita]]'', or 'transcendent wisdom'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The existence of Buddhas and [[Mahasattva]]s{{mdash}}'great beings' who have achieved a high level on the path to awakening{{mdash}}have created various branches of belief like [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which is a form of 'spiritual immigration'. "Buddhism is a type of immigration from the world of suffering to nirvana....We are all immigrants who, paradoxically, are seeking to and the land in which we already dwell".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of 'spiritual immigration', the path of the bodhisattva is a change of mental capacity rather than cosmic location.

According to Buddhist teaching, the purpose of a 'spiritual immigration' is to help guide the individual onto their future path.  The Pure Land is the state of untainted mind: reaching this land of purity requires persistent effort and practice. Along the journey, individuals learn to envision their future as a land of opportunity. The intention of the pure land is to assure that the individual achieves their personal goals in life{{mdash}}the betterment of oneself in order to reach nirvana. Alongside these goals, practitioners also learn about the relationship of 'self' and 'others', resulting in the renewal of all beings. The concept of the pure lands enforces the idea of 'spiritual immigration' as a form of mental encouragement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Migration is a spiritual journey that establishes a point of communication between the human and divine. Religious figures migrate from one place to another as immigrants: "In Christianity, God migrated to this world in the form of human Jesus; the Hindu God [[Krishna]] descended to earth to become a charioteer, a human being ([[Bhagavad Gita]] 1:20-47); and the Buddha 'becomes Awakened' when he became a wanderer and a stranger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World: Multi-religious Reflections on Immigration|last=Hussam S. , and Jorgenson, Allen G. , and Hwang, Alexander Y..|first=|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=111–128|chapter=The Islamic Doctrine of Hijra (Migration)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents believe that religious figures have travelled from an unpurified state to a purified state: Buddha traveled from his privileged life to a life of poverty to gain divinity and knowledge; therefore divine figures like [[Gautama Buddha|Gautam Buddha]] viewed migration as purification. The Qur’an states that "they could migrate from their oppressed positions to another land of God".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The doctrine of ''[[Hejira|Hijrah]]'' suggest that freedom of movement is a human right as well as a duty to God. [[Globalization]] affects religious perspectives on migration which seek to prevent the "destruction to the sanctity of human life and dignity".  Religious figures like Buddha and Jesus practised "a theology of migration".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to adherents, immigrants should have the same rights as legal residents because world religions believe everyone is divine. It is also mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur’an]] that "strangers are entitled to the equal distribution of wealth".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;!-- please give Sura and Ayat --&gt; Despite the acquisition of wealth in verse 8:41, the Qur’an states that "know that one-fifth of your battle gains belongs to the God and the messenger, to close relatives and orphans or to the needy and travellers (strangers).”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to Collier and Strain, the Roman Catholic Church has been helping migrants for decades.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious and Ethical Perspectives on Global Migration|last=Elizabeth W. Collier, and Charles R. Strain|first=|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lexington|pages=|chapter=7: Migration in The Light of Scripture and Catholic Social Teaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian faith receives a sense of justice for migrants from Abrahamic faith traditions. Catholics follow these guidelines to help immigrants: "for all persons on the move". The reasons to help those on the move were established in 1952 when leaders of the Roman Catholic Church published written material that reinforced the teachings of the church. One of the quotes from the Bible used to justify hospitality is "when an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God" (Leviticus 19:33).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Strangers or those on the move should be treated equally, no less than anyone else. The modern nation state should open its borders because people may be migrating due to unfavorable circumstances. The Catholic Church believes everyone has a right to migrate to support their families; this idea of free migration allows "the human person [to precede] the state".”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some circumstances, the Church provides assistance to migrants and refugees. Some Catholic organizations offer educational activities on the legal process of immigration to the United States. Other types of aid include spiritual companionship, ESL classes for those who want to learn to speak better English, basic hygiene, and food. The Roman Catholic Church believes that helping those in need enables the growth of the human spirit.

Before the [[Columbian exchange]], there was an open border policy in the Americas that gave Native Americans access to travel freely and have open trade with other cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was widespread trade among many [[First Nations]] that created free movement and travel for many foreigners. At the time, there was little border control which allowed migrants to travel to various areas to settle. Immigration policy shifted towards control and nationalism after 1492. In the 20th century, immigration policy solidified borders in America, but many Native Americans advocated free movement and hospitality towards strangers. Native Americans historically have welcomed strangers with hospitality, sometimes making them relatives through an informal adoption system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Migration in America can be understood through the religious and cultural perspectives of Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Native American Hospitality and Generosity". Strangers in This World: Multireligious Reflections on Immigration.|last=Woodley, Randy|first=|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Native American groups have shown hospitality towards strangers, and guests are given gifts from the host, which are known as 'give-aways'. Hospitality to visitors and other members of one's community is a value of many Native Americans groups, and they consider their belongings and other possessions as blessings. The concept of borders and walls (both artificial and real) were not practised in [[pre-Columbian]] times when Native Americans inhabited present day Canada, Central Amaerica, Mexico, and the U.S. Instead, hospitality and gift giving were the traditions that were honored and shared among visitors and other people.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Law and ethics ==
{{sources|section|date=April 2018}}
Many nation states have agreed and disagreed on the topic of open borders and free migration, with some countries allowing people to travel freely from country to country and state to state without the risk of deportation or punishment. The consensus within the open borders debate is to “establish a view of migration that reflects the liberal commitment to the equal moral worth of all people which applies to a truly global view of migration.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MORAL CONSENSUS IN THE OPEN BORDERS DEBATE|last=Askren|first=Wayne|publisher=University of Utah Graduate School. Proquest.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Sal Lake City|pages=37–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various ideas have been applied to a global view of migration, such as the ideas of other journalists such as Johnathan Wolff and Avnir De-Shalit to migration. Wolff and De-Shalit’s state that the use of law and ethics is a positive factor in the debate over free migration.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The debate of free migration does not apply to a specific country but extends beyond, and continues on to a broader spectrum for introducing a freedom of movement amongst all people, for all countries. However, this concept is especially significant to the places that experience the most migration-including both host and receiving countries or states. Free migration is not limited to a certain time period, but has been more relevant and controversial in recent years, especially in the United States. In the U.S., it has become a more controversial topic since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].

Free migration is a concept to consider when comparing basic [[human rights]] and migration. "Constraining movement in most cases is therefore, unjustified and immoral".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The topic of free migration is not a matter to be only exclusively debated amongst national governments of varying nations, but a worldwide discussion for all people of all nations on the debate of open borders and free migration. In that case, nations and people from all over the world can learn from each other where everyone is involved in the attempt to come to a just conclusion and solution to the problems surrounding both immigration and free migration alike. Free Migration has been slowly restricted throughout recent history due to the inevitable progression of society, causing more independent societies to create tighter laws, policies, and regulations concerning immigration. With nations closing themselves off and shutting their borders from non-residents, it is difficult for free migration to become secure, as well as having members of society prioritize an institutional issue such as this.

Immigration officers and agents must maintain a code of conduct based on policy to provide equal treatment to any and all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bader|first=Veit|date=2012|title=Moral, Ethical, and Realist Dilemmas of Transnational Governance of Migration|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=56 | issue = 9 |pages=1165–1182|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764212443819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers must put their political views behind them and revert to policy law; leaving behind their personal moral conflicts and ethics to abide by law and policy. Political philosophers focus on free movement as a human right and aid for those in poverty or serious global inequality. Although there is not a necessary definition for something considered to be morally, ethically, or legally accepted in a society, everyone has an individual connection to what may be considered good for society and what may be considered bad for society. The United States government has placed many strict laws on immigration that it proposes will produce a better immigration system. Other countries, through United Nations consensus, allow a minimum two year system for refugee relocation, with other countries such as Canada and Switzerland operating within a four year system.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Economic considerations ==
According to John Kennan’s (2012) data simulations (collected in multiple countries to simulate the effects of open borders), there would be large economic gains between Mexico and the United States of America through the implementation of open borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennan|first=John|date=2013|title=Open borders|url=|journal=Review of Economic Dynamics 16|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison|volume=16|pages=1–13|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal economic reasoning advocates for open borders to prevent economic inequality between countries where country A is more efficient than country B due to restrictions on immigration creating production efficiency gaps between the two countries. Labor share data estimates that there would be more economic gains through free migration between countries. These gains are expressed through the economic and labor growth in the country along with economic gain for foreign and resident workers in that country. Economic simulations show that migration lowers the [[Real wages|real wage]] for both countries receiving and sending immigrants; however, the effect of this decrease is based on the goods and services consumed by an individual. According to Kennan “these gains are associated with a relatively small reduction in the real wage in developed countries, and even this effect disappears as the capital–labor ratio adjusts over time.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, the number of workers in both receiving and sending countries would double by the current population of workers.

== Alleged discrimination ==
According to Mirko Bagaric and John Morss (2005), nations discriminate against immigrants through certain immigration policies like the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Naturalization Act]] (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, which provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirko Bagaric and Dr John Morss|first=|date=2005|title=State Sovereignty and Migration Control: The Ultimate Act of Discrimination|url=|journal=J. Migration &amp; Refugee Issues|volume=25|pages=25–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nations such as: North/South America, Europe and Australia use their power to regulate migration control by selecting individuals and placing them where they may not be able to succeed. “Nation states have the right to determine which people are permitted to enter within their geographical borders.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This causes people to choose places they did not want to go, making them displaced persons. Over the past decade, there have been 12-18 million displaced persons. Countries usually put restrictions on migrants because they could be a security risk. “The most persuasive argument in favour of strict immigration controls is expressed by the view that ‘we made it and own it and don’t want it ruined by others.’”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Some nations discriminate against immigrants wanting to come in because many citizens have a preconceived notion that the ones coming in are criminals who want to abuse government funding. “Unless we radically loosen migration controls we must accept that we are endorsing a racist policy.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Multiple nations spend billions of dollars every year on border security. Many nations do not realize how much immigrants can benefit their nation. They perform tasks that most individuals may not want to do, such as low paying jobs that involve hard labor. Ultimately, immigrants can benefit every nation, if they were given the chance to prove themselves and really show who they are. Free migration means migrants can choose whatever country they wish to go to. If strict migration laws and border security shut people out, then they do not have a chance for a new life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''Hamstringing''' is a method of crippling a person or animal so that they cannot walk properly by severing the [[hamstring]] [[tendons]] in the thigh of the individual. It is used as a method of [[torture]], or to incapacitate the victim.

==Use==
Hamstringing is used primarily to incapacitate a [[human]] or [[animal]] and render them incapable of effective movement. The severing of the hamstring muscles results not only in the crippling of the leg, but also in tremendous pain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamstringinjury.net/hamstring_injury_signs_and_symptoms.html Hamstring Injury.net, Hamstring Injury Relief and Help Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; common to heavy laceration.

==Method==
In humans, the [[hamstring]] extends between the hip and knee joints. The hamstring muscle group is made up of the [[biceps femoris]], [[semitendinosus muscle]], and the [[semimembranosus]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Wayne|last1=Hoskins|first2=Henry|last2=Pollard|title=Hamstring injury management—Part 2: Treatment|journal=Manual Therapy|volume=10|year=2005|pages=180–190|doi=10.1016/j.math.2005.05.001|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitates both the flexing of the knee and hip extension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestrong.com/article/151904-what-is-the-purpose-function-of-the-hamstring/ Brughelli, Matt. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; making it a vital contributor to normal leg movement.  By severing these muscles or the tendons involved in this process, normal leg movement is disrupted. In addition to sustaining massive bleeding, the injured leg becomes useless and the victim is rendered lame. The severing of the hamstring is usually accomplished through use of a blade such as a knife or [[sword]].

==Medical treatment==
Due to a lack of research in the field of critical hamstring injuries, the current injury management is quite limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23288753 | doi=10.1055/s-0032-1324811 | volume=26 | title=Hamstring pain and muscle strains following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective, randomized trial comparing hamstring graft harvest techniques | journal=J Knee Surg | pages=139-44 | last1 = D'Alessandro | first1 = P | last2 = Wake | first2 = G | last3 = Annear | first3 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the injury is based solely "on clinical experience, anecdotal evidence and the knowledge of the biological basis of tissue repair."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  These injuries are difficult to control or repair, leading often to permanent injury or even death by [[exsanguination]].

==Historical usage==

Sources from [[late antiquity]] indicate that hamstringing was commonly used to incapacitate combatants and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28587/28587-h/28587-h.htm|title=The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus|author=Ammianus Marcellinus|authorlink=Ammianus Marcellinus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as metaphor==
Literally, to "hamstring" an individual is to sever the tissues of their hamstring. As a [[metaphor]] to be "hamstrung" suggests being limited, by external imposition or not, in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hamstring |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==

Rendering [[chariot]] [[horse]]s lame by hamstringing is mentioned in the [[Bible]], called "houghing" in the [[King James Version]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2011:9 Book of Joshua, Chapter 11, Verse 9 (King James Version)]&lt;/ref&gt; from an old spelling of ''[[hock (zoology)|hock]]''. In the Bible, this is seen as a positive{{fact|date=August 2018}} use of hamstringing because it prevents the horses from being used in warfare.

The '''Holzer Permaculture''' is a branch of [[permaculture]] developed independently from the mainstream permaculture in [[Austria]] by [[Sepp Holzer]].  It is particularly noteworthy because it grew out of practical application and was relatively detached from the scientific community.

==Introduction==
Sepp Holzer started reorganising his father's property according to ecological patterns in the early 1960s after he took over the farm. As an adolescent he conducted layman experiments with plants native to the area and learned from his own observations.

Since having taken over his father's property, he has expanded it from 24 to 45 [[hectares]].{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. date=September 2015|date=September 2015}} according to his  [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2670902826_99a2ef98ea_b.jpg methods] together with his wife.

His expanded farm now spans over 45 hectares of [[forest gardening|forest gardens]], including 70 ponds, and is said to be the most consistent example of permaculture worldwide. In the past he has experimented with many different animals. As a result of these experiments, there is a huge role for animals in the Holzer Permaculture.

He has created some of the world's best examples of using ponds as reflectors to increase solar gain for [[passive solar building design|passive solar heating]] of structures, and of using the [[microclimate]] created by rock outcrops to effectively change the [[hardiness zone]] for nearby plants. He has also done original work in the use of [[Hügelkultur]] and natural branch development instead of pruning (see [[Fruit tree pruning]]) to allow fruit trees to survive high altitudes and harsh winters.

==Comparison to regular permaculture==
It is difficult to make out differences between the methods and practices of Sepp Holzer in contrast to the more scientific and theoretical permacultural mainstream. Nevertheless, here are some major points to consider:

* His designs are mostly aimed at raising temperatures and creating micro-climates with rocks, ponds and living wind barriers, in an area with 4&amp;nbsp;°C on the average and -20&amp;nbsp;°C in the winter. The ponds he makes do not contain any pond liner. Instead, he makes the ponds watertight by sifting the fine from the coarse soil in the earth pile dug up with the excavator. The excavator is then used to pile only the coarse soil up into walls which are then tampered down using the excavator's bucket. The bottom of the pond, he makes watertight by vibrating the excavator's bucket when the pond has been filled with 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm of water.
* Another aspect was the necessity of creating terraces on his farm's hillsides leading him to the use of heavy machinery (like excavators). Many of the terraces he construct are also given a humus storage ditch (placed in between the terraces).
* Famous is his [[Hügelkultur]] technique, which is basically the use of raised beds in which he uses bulky material such as tree trunks. On his farm, he made a pick-your-own area where visitors can pick their own produce from the raised beds and then pay for it at a counter upon leaving the area.
* He uses animal labor alongside human labor, working his farm with only two people. He optimizes the natural patterns of animal behavior to reduce human or machine-driven labor. As an example: he uses swine to "plow" new beds for sowing. This is a very effective way of digging, as the only thing he has to do is to throw some corn and fruit on the spot he wants dug up. A couple of days later, he can bring the pigs back to their enclosure and plant new plants in the bed. Holzer is able to successfully grow his plants without using any fertilizer. The animals he uses are all heirloom races, which are hardy and require (almost) no maintenance. Examples of the races of swine he uses are Mangalitza, Swabian Hall swine, Duroc, Turopolje, ... He also keeps quail,  capercaillie, hazel grouse, wisent, scottish highland cattle, hungarian steppe cattle, Dahomey miniature cattle, American bison, yak, water buffalo. He has the animals live outside, in paddocks/shelters and has them share space with orchards and [[Silvopasture|forests]]. Many of the fruit trees in the orchards (especially those on very sloped terrain) are used exclusively to feed the animals. They collect it as it falls to the ground (those trees are hence not being picked/ nor is produce of it sold)
* He also does not prune fruit trees much nor does he cut the lower branches on fruit trees (as this can hurt the tree -due to the lignification not being able to complete before frost and the fact that the unpruned fruit trees survives snow loads that will break pruned trees.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Julia. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090126162306/http://www.krameterhof.at/pdf/the_earth.pdf Ecological farming, permaculture; Alpine Garden of Eden proves Mother Nature knows best.] Reuters. Retrieved August 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;-. He also says that leaving the branches on protects the tree against browsing by animals. He does however makes a point of using deep-rooted pioneer plants such as lupins, sweet clover, lucerne and broom. These crops are said to aerate the soil and make sure no water is left standing near the tree. No use is made of wire meshes as protection against voles, since he states they are not efficient in preventing damage from voles using this technique anyway. He makes no use of contemporary fruit tree cultivars, but only uses (very strong/hardy) old, local (heirloom) cultivars. In addition to (old cultivars of) regular fruit trees, he also plants much fruit tree species that are specific to use in [[phytotherapy]] or which can only function as [[Fodder|animal feed]] (i.e. crab apple, wild pear, wild cherry, blackthorn, rowan, wild service, service tree, cornelian cherry, snowy mespilus, ...). Similar to mainstream permaculture, he makes no use of chemical fertiliser or pesticides, at all.&lt;ref&gt;Sepp Holzer's permaculture by Sepp Holzer]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that due to the altitude he's at, his trees bear fruit later, meaning he can sell it after most (sealevel) farmers sold their produce. Due to this (and the fact that he produces heirloom fruit varieties, and not regular varieties), he is often able to get a better price for it. In some cases, customers (like distilleries) are even willing to pick the fruit themselves, eliminating the labour expense for him.
* He grows many old cereals on his farm, such as einkorn, emmer, black emmer, spelt, fichtelgebirgshafer, wild rye, black oats, naked oats, barley, Siberian grain (secale cereale, russian cultivar), tauernroggen, ...
* He also makes much use of green manure crops (like stinging nettle, phacelia, yellow, white and narrow-leaved lupin, garden pea, grass pea, fodder &amp; Kidney vetch, yellow, subterranean, Crimson, Persian, Egyptian, red &amp; white sweet clover, Birdsfoot trefoil, lucerne, black medick, Sainfoin, Serradella, fiddleneck, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichoke, Gold-of-pleasure, ...)and grows these crops extensively on his farm. He leaves them standing in autumn, rather than digging them in. He instead relies on natural decay of the plants. He often relies on the natural spreading of the seeds of the crops for their re-sowing.
* Another aspect is the abandonment of other horticultural principles such as [[intercropping]] plants with very high and very low pH requirements (for example, Rhododendron with roses).  Instead, Holzer mixes thirty or more different types of seeds in a bucket and tosses the mix richly onto a larger area.

==The Krameterhof==
Situated in [[Ramingstein]] on the slopes of Mount Schwarzenberg his farm (Krameterhof) lies at varying elevations ranging from 1100 to 1500 metres above sea level.
 
The exceptionally harsh climatic conditions in the area are generally considered inappropriate for farming. Nevertheless, he has managed to cultivate a variety of crops and even exotic plants like Kiwis and [[Sweet Chestnut]].

The Krameterhof is less an operational enterprise, in terms of crop-yield (although it does provide numerous sorts of produce for the community), and more a fully functional showcase or research station for permaculture.

Endangered livestock species and rare alpine- and cultural plant species are integrated into the farm.

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Brahma]] is said to have become the Ikshana (eye), in the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth; in the phrase ''Vrishbhekshana'', ''Virishbha'' implies the ''[[Vedas]]'' and ikshana, the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|publisher=Bharata Press|pages=228, 277|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YbZZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalidasa]], in the phrase मदिरेक्षणे appearing in passage II.72 of his [[Shakuntala|Abhigyanashakuntalam]], has also used the word Ikshana to mean the eye, which phrase Sankara explains is – ''madira'' ('wine') as applied to the eye (ikshana), - eye as equivalent to 'beautiful', ''madirekhshane'' means the one whose eyes intoxicate like wine or is the wine-eyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakuntala|author=Kalidasa|pages=123–124|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zXk-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nhvjUoD9IYnR7Ab8i4GwDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikshana is a technical term used in [[Vedanta]] to show how creation took place by the beholding of Para-brahman as an intelligent and a personal act of the creator; it means revelation of the created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Hindu-catholic|publisher=Asian Trading Corporation|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7lPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabrahman is essentially ''citta'' who produces his self as [[Shabda Brahman]] (Logos) by ''ikshana'' ('beholding').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gregorianum Vol.87 Issue 4|author=Bryon Lobo|publisher=Gregorian Biblical Bookshop|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qL4iy-iOCm4C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Am3jUpiCIsKv7Ab-8IHQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]] states:-

:इक्षतिकर्मव्यपदेशात् सः| ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]]) I.iii.13

:"From the mention as the object of the act of seeing, it follows that the supreme Self is meant."

[[Adi Shankara]], in his commentary on this ''sutra'', states that the object of ''ikshana'' ('seeing') is the supreme Self, [[Brahman]], and not [[Hiranyagarbha]], the inferior Brahman. He says that the term ''ikshati-karma'' means the object covered by the act of seeing. The all-pervading entity (Purusa) that is to be seen can be seen to be "higher than the high one" meditated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Swami Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=177–180|url= https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pippalada]] tells Satyakama, son of Sibi, that he by the ''Sama'' hymns is elevated to the ''Brahmaloka'', he from this ''jivanghata'' ('the Macrocosmic Soul') beholds the supreme Being – एतस्माज्जीवघ्नात्परात्परं पुरिशयं पुरुषुमीक्षति - [[Prashna Upanishad]] V.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prasna Upanishad|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=63|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Prashna%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement – ''uho nama vi-tarkoktih pra-vicharekshanatmakah'', the terms ''Vitarka'' and ''Tarka'' are used interchangeably, ''tarka'' occurs after speech, mind and prana have been restrained immediately before Samadhi, vitarka consists of advanced thought and observation (ikshana); it is through discernment (''uha'') that one leaves the lower plane of ''savikalpa'' and gets uplifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga-sutras of Patanjali|author=Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=663–665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBzjUta3MtOO7Qago4H4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedic concept of [[tapas]] and the Upanishadic concept of ikshana to the effect that consciousness and force are ultimately the same and every will has an aspect of force, helped [[Aurobindo|Sri Aurobindo]] to conclude that the fact is only a partial reflection of the Idea which has created it and that it is the idea which expresses itself in matter and takes to itself bodies, and formulate the 'Theory of ideas as forces'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Aurobindo|author=V.P.Verma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=106–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLrp0c0hizAC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was through ''ekacittekshana-samyukta-prajna'' the supreme perfect knowledge was realized (''abhisambodha'') by [[Gautama Buddha]], that converted ''Boddhisattva'' to ''Buddha''; ''ekacittekshana'' refers to ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]'' exercised in unison with 'one-thought-viewing' when there is no separation between 'knower' and the 'known', all are viewed in one thought and enlightenment is the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays in Zen Buddhism|author=Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|publisher=Grove Press|pages=124–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2d7wV4Ttx4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (ε = 1/ω)]]

In [[mathematics]], '''infinitesimals''' are things so small that there is no way to measure them. The insight with exploiting infinitesimals was that entities could still retain certain specific properties, such as [[angle]] or [[slope]], even though these entities were quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/#1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th-century [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[Infinity|infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a sequence.  
Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in the procedures of infinitesimal [[calculus]] as developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], including the [[law of continuity]] and the [[transcendental law of homogeneity]]. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" means "extremely small".  To give it a meaning, it usually must be compared to another infinitesimal object in the same context (as in a [[derivative]]).  Infinitely many infinitesimals are summed to produce an [[integral]].

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either [[Nicolaus Mercator]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

I. SCIAMVS 2 (2001), 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the [[method of exhaustion]].  The 15th century saw the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], further developed in the 17th century by [[Johannes Kepler]], in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. [[Simon Stevin]]'s work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors.  The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of [[codimension]] 1. [[John Wallis]]'s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus.  He exploited an infinitesimal denoted [[1/∞]] in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited infinitesimals both in defining [[continuous function|continuity]] in his ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', and in defining an early form of a [[Dirac delta function]].  As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions.  Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both [[Émile Borel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]].  Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals.  Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934.  A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1961, who developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948 and [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  The [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the [[transfer principle]] implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The [[standard part function]] implements Fermat's [[adequality]].

[[Vladimir Arnold]] wrote in 1990:
:Nowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnolʹd, V. I. ''Huygens and Barrow, Newton and Hooke. Pioneers in mathematical analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals''. Translated from the Russian by Eric J. F. Primrose. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the infinitesimal==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. The [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] (c.287 BC–c.212 BC), in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |''x''|&gt;1, |''x''|&gt;1+1, |''x''|&gt;1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if ''x''≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for ''x'' and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician [[John Wallis]] introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book ''Treatise on the Conic Sections''. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of&amp;nbsp;[[∞]], is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol&amp;nbsp;∞. The concept suggests a [[thought experiment]] of adding an infinite number of [[parallelogram]]s of infinitesimal width to form a finite area.  This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in [[integral calculus]]. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]], whose [[Zeno's dichotomy paradox]] was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]] and [[René Descartes]]' [[method of normals]].  There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature.  When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented the [[Infinitesimal calculus|calculus]], they made use of infinitesimals, Newton's ''[[fluxion (mathematics)|fluxions]]'' and Leibniz' ''[[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]''. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Dedekind]], and others using the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[set theory]].  
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] declared that infinitesimals are ''pseudoconcepts'', [[Hermann Cohen]] and his [[Marburg school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]] sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mormann]]; [[Mikhail Katz]]. Infinitesimals as an issue of neo-Kantian philosophy of science. [[International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science|HOPOS]]: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science 3 (2013), no. 2, 236–280. {{doi|10.1086/671348}}. {{JSTOR|10.1086/671348}}. {{arXiv|1304.1027}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by [[Philip Ehrlich]] (2006).  In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis; see [[hyperreal number]].

==First-order properties==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''."  However, statements of the form "for any ''set''&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;of numbers&amp;nbsp;..." may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]].

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An [[ordered field]] obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' holds.
# A [[real closed field]] has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms.  More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]].
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories&amp;nbsp;2 and&amp;nbsp;3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

==Number systems that include infinitesimals==

===Formal series===

====Laurent series====
An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number&amp;nbsp;1, and the series with only the linear term&amp;nbsp;''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of&amp;nbsp;''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |title=Infinitesimals in Modern Mathematics |publisher=Jonhoyle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115815/http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;''x'' does not have a square root.

====The Levi-Civita field====
The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transseries====
The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a transseries is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered infinite.

===Surreal numbers===
Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot{{fact|date=May 2017}}&lt;!--this seems dubious, see [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91337/uniformizing-the-surcomplex-unit-circle] In any case, to make the assertion clear, one should be make precise what it is to be expected from such extensions --&gt;. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Hyperreals===
{{Main article|Hyperreal number}}
The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural counterpart &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; carries over to the hyperreals as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; .

===Superreals===
The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by [[David O. Tall|David Tall]].

===Dual numbers===
{{Main article|Dual number}}
In [[linear algebra]], the [[dual number]]s extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, ε is [[nilpotent]]). Every dual number has the form ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''ε with ''a'' and ''b'' being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the [[Exterior algebra]] of an n-dimensional vector space.

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===
{{Main article|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}
[[Synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] have roots in [[category theory]]. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the [[law of excluded middle]] – i.e., ''not'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not have to mean ''a'' = ''b''. A ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number ''x'' where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 is true, but ''x'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.  Since the background logic is [[intuitionistic logic]], it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3.  Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

==Infinitesimal delta functions==
[[Cauchy]] used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the [[ultrapower]] construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable [[ultrafilter]]. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains a bibliography on modern [[Dirac delta function]]s in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]].

==Logical properties==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the [[Model theory|model]] and which collection of [[axiom]]s are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 [[Anatoly Maltsev|Maltsev]] proved the [[compactness theorem]]. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer ''n'' there is a positive number ''x'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number ''x'' such that for any positive integer ''n'' we have 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n''. The possibility to switch  "for any" and "there exists" is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] : for any positive integer ''n'' it is possible to find a real number between 1/''n'' and zero, but this real number depends on ''n''. Here, one chooses ''n'' first, then one finds the corresponding ''x''. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an  ''x'' (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/''n'' for any ''n''. In this case ''x'' is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers ('''R''') given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] [[linear order|linearly ordered]] set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

: 1) Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.

: 2) Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard]].

In 1977 [[Edward Nelson]] provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for [[Internal set theory]] or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson's approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are in a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

==Infinitesimals in teaching==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' by [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] (bearing the motto "What one fool can do another can"&lt;ref&gt;Available online at 
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283&lt;/ref&gt;) and the German text ''Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'' by R Neuendorff.&lt;ref&gt;R Neuendorff (1912) ''Lehrbuch der Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'', Verlag Julius Springer, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering works based on [[Abraham Robinson]]'s infinitesimals include texts by [[Stroyan]] (dating from 1972) and [[Howard Jerome Keisler]] ([[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]). Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"[[0.999...]]", where  "0.999..." differs from its standard meaning as the real number 1, and is reinterpreted as an infinite terminating extended decimal that is strictly less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ely |first=Robert |year=2010 |title=Nonstandard student conceptions about infinitesimals |journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=117–146 |jstor=20720128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207075126/http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is ''Infinitesimal Calculus'' by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal Calculus|last=Henle|first=James|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Eugene|publisher=The MIT Press, rereleased by Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduce the language of first order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers.  The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions.  In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the ''hyperhyper''reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

==Functions tending to zero==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of "infinitesimal" as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero.  More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg's ''Advanced Calculus'' defines the function class of infinitesimals, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;, as a subset of functions &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0, 
(\forall \epsilon&gt;0) (\exists \delta&gt;0)
\ \backepsilon\ ||\xi||&lt;\delta\implies
||f(\xi)||&lt;\epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;as well as two related classes &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O},\mathfrak{o}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Big O notation|Big-O notation]]) by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ (\exist r&gt;0,c&gt;0)\ \backepsilon\  
||\xi||&lt; r \implies ||f(\xi)||\leq c||
\xi||\}&lt;/math&gt;, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ \lim_{||\xi||\to 0} ||f(\xi)|| / ||\xi|| = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LoomisL.H.SternbergS.AdvancedCalculusRevisedEditionJonesAndBartlett|title=Advanced Calculus|last=Loomis|first=Lynn Harold|last2=Sternberg|first2=Shlomo|publisher=World Scientific|year=2014|isbn=978-981-4583-92-3|location=Hackensack, N.J.|pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The set inclusions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{O}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{I}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;generally hold.  That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto |x|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g:x\mapsto x &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h:x\mapsto x^2 &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in\mathfrak{I}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\  g,h\in\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\ 
h\in\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f,g\notin\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\notin\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As an application of these definitions, a mapping &lt;math&gt;F:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces is defined to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in V&lt;/math&gt; if there is a &lt;math&gt;T\in\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; [i.e, a bounded linear map &lt;math&gt;V\to W&lt;/math&gt;] such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[F(\alpha+\xi)-F(\alpha)]-T(\xi)\in \mathfrak{o}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the ''differential'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;dF_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;This notation is not to be confused with the many other distinct usages of ''d'' in calculus that are all loosely related to the classical notion of the differential as "taking an infinitesimally small piece of something": ''(1)'' in the expression&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; indicates Riemann-Stieltjes integration with respect to the integrator function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; ''(2)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbolizes Lebesgue integration with respect to a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;; ''(3)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f\; dV&lt;/math&gt;, ''dV'' indicates integration with respect to volume; ''(4)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the letter ''d'' represents the exterior derivative operator, and so on....&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small "piece" of ''F''.  This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

==Array of random variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. An array &lt;math&gt;\{X_{n,k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\mid 1\le k\le k_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[random variable]]s is called infinitesimal if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal |last=Barczyk|first=Adam |last2=Janssen|first2=Arnold |last3=Pauly|first3=Markus |year=2011 |title=The Asymptotics of L-statistics for non-i.i.d. variables with heavy tails|journal=[[Probability and mathematical statistics]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=285–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{1\le k\le k_{n}}\mathbb{P}\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \vert X_{n,k}(\omega)\vert\geq\epsilon\}\to 0\text{ as } n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying [[Lindeberg's condition]] is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem]] (a generalization of the [[central limit theorem]]).

'''Infinitum AS''', former Norsk Resirk AS, is a corporation that operates the national paid recycling scheme for bottles and cans marked with the official "recyclable" or "[[Container deposit legislation|deposit]]" (Pant in Norwegian) logo in Norway. The beverages containers included in the program are the ones made of aluminum, steel and plastic (PET) produced in or imported to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum - Geelmuyden Kiese|url=http://gknordic.com/case/infinitum/|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit scheme for certain one-way containers is mandatory in Norway by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations relating to the recycling of waste in Norway (English-translated title)|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2004-06-01-930|website=lovdata.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was established in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in beverage industry and food trading (giant chain stores). The company aims to ensure the highest possible return in deposit recycling packaging for beverages at the lowest cost and environmental impact, for the time being, Infinitum managed to reach 95% return rate for one-way containers in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More empty bottles and cans are being recycled (English-translated title)|url=http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/no/Nyheter/Nyheter/Old-klif/2013/juni-2013/Flere-tomflasker-og-bokser-gjenvinnes/|website=www.miljodirektoratet.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Anderson Dombrowski''' (January 17, 1897 - May 2, 1983) was a southern white [[Methodist]] minister and intellectual who was active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. He lived in [[New Orleans]] from 1946 until his death but was involved in public affairs across the country.

==Early life and education==
James Dombrowski was born in [[Tampa, Florida]], to William Dombrowski and the former Isabella Skinner. He attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s in Tampa and [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from Methodist-affiliated [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in 1923. Dombrowski also attended [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and [[Columbia University]], both in [[New York City]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] from Columbia in 1933. Dombrowski studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Methodist clergyman [[Harry F. Ward]].

Dombrowski enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War I]], and served from October 1917 to March 1919 as an [[airplane]] [[mechanic]] near [[Paris, France|Paris]]. He obtained the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]].

He was the first secretary of the Emory University Alumni Association and the founding editor of ''Emory Alumnus''. In 1926, he became the assistant [[pastor]] of a Methodist church in [[Berkeley, California]]. He married the former Ellen Krida of New York, the daughter of Arthur Krida and the former Johanna Kunkel. There were no children.

==Activist in South==
Dombrowski was cofounder with [[Myles Horton]] and [[educator]] [[Don West (educator)|Don West]] of the [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]] in [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] in southeastern [[Tennessee]]. He was an administrator at Highlander from 1933 to 1942. This institution took an early lead in the civil rights movement, and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Rosa Parks]] obtained instruction there during the 1950s. So did various southern leaders in [[organized labor]]. Highlander was a particular ''bête noire'' to [[Racial segregation|segregationists]], who claimed that it was a [[communist]]-oriented organization. In 1957, a photograph was taken of an audience at the school, which showed King sitting on the front row next to [[Abner Berry]], the correspondent for the communist [[newspaper]], the ''[[Daily Worker]]''. King's enemies posted the photograph on billboards across the South in an attempt to discredit the civil rights movement.

Dombrowski also founded the Conference of Younger Churchmen of the South, established in 1934. He was executive director of both the Southern Conference for Human Welfare from 1942 to 1946 and the Southern Conference Educational Fund from 1946 to 1966. He edited the liberal journal ''Southern Patriot'' from 1942 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, ''And Promises to Keep'', pp. 104-111, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice from 1975 until his death.

Dombrowski was the primary defendant in a landmark [[civil liberties]] case decided in 1965 by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In ''[[Dombrowski v. Pfister]]'', the court struck down a [[Louisiana]] law that attempted to force members of anti-segregation groups to register as pro-communist [[subversive]]s. Dombrowski briefly joined the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] in the 1930s but then became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] during [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]. He denied charges of being communist, and he had left the Highlander School before segregationists challenged it for loyalty.

Under Dombrowski's leadership, a number of white southerners joined the Southern Conference Educational Fund and labored to end segregation and the disfranchisement of blacks in the South.

Dombrowski wrote ''The Early Days of Christian Socialism in America'' (1937). He was also an engraver and artist. Some of his paintings were donated to the [[University of New Orleans]].

He died in New Orleans. His body was cremated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11775">'''Kröger–Vink notation''' is a set of conventions that are used to describe [[electric charge]] and [[Crystal structure|lattice]] position for [[Crystallographic defect#|point defect]] species in [[crystal]]s. It is primarily used for ionic crystals and is particularly useful for describing various defect reactions. It was proposed by [[F. A. Kröger]] and [[H. J. Vink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=F.

==Schottky and Frenkel defects==

===Schottky pairs===
A [[Schottky defect]] is an intrinsic [[Crystallographic defect|point defect]] that creates vacancies on both the cation and anion sublattices. This defect occurs in ionic crystals when one (positively charged) [[cation]] and one (negatively charged) [[anion]] leave the lattice simultaneously, resulting in two [[Vacancy defect|vacant lattice sites]]. Because the mass, site, and charge must remain balanced, these vacancies always occur in [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric ratios]]. However, due to the loss of ions within the crystal lattice, these Schottky defects tend to lead to a decrease in the density of the material because vacancies have been created.

===Frenkel pairs===
Similarly to a [[Schottky defect]], a [[Frenkel defect]] is an intrinsic point defect that produces a vacancy site on either the cation or anion sublattice along with an [[Interstitial defect|interstitial site]] on that same lattice. In an ionic crystal, this occurs when a cation or anion leaves its site in the sublattice, creating the vacancy, and moves to another location to create an interstitial. These Frenkel defect pairs maintain a balanced mass, site, and charge ratio throughout the relocation of the ions. Since the movement remains within the material's single lattice, the density remains the same.

==Notation==
The notation follows the scheme:
:&lt;big&gt;M{{su|p=C|b=S}}&lt;/big&gt;

*'''''M''''' corresponds to the species. These can be
**[[atom]]s – e.g., Si, Ni, O, Cl,
**[[Vacancy defect|vacancies]] – V or v (since V is also the symbol for vanadium)
**[[interstitial compound|interstitials]] – i
**[[electron]]s – e
**[[electron hole]]s – h
*'''''S''''' indicates the lattice site that the species occupies. For instance, Ni might occupy a Cu site. In this case, M would be replaced by Ni and S would be replaced by Cu. The site may also be a lattice interstice, in this case the symbol "i" is used. A cation site can be represented by the symbols C or M (for metal), and an anion site can be represented by either an A or X.
*'''''C''''' corresponds to the electronic charge of the species relative to the site that it occupies. The charge of the species is calculated by the charge on the current site minus the charge on the original site. To continue the previous example, Ni often has the same valency as Cu, so the relative charge is zero. To indicate null charge, '''×''' is used. A single '''•''' indicates a net single positive charge, while two would represent two net positive charges. Finally, '''′''' signifies a net single negative charge, so two would indicate a net double negative charge.

===Examples===
*Al{{su|p=×|b=Al}} — an aluminum ion sitting on an aluminum lattice site, with neutral charge.
*Ni{{su|p=×|b=Cu}} — a nickel ion sitting on a copper lattice site, with neutral charge.
*v{{su|p=•|b=Cl}} — a chlorine [[Vacancy defect|vacancy]], with single positive charge.
*Ca{{su|p=••|b=i}} — a calcium interstitial ion, with double positive charge.
*Cl{{su|p=′|b=i}} — a chlorine anion on an interstitial site, with single negative charge.
*O{{su|p=′′|b=i}} — an oxygen anion on an interstitial site, with double negative charge.
*e{{su|p=′}} — an electron. No site is normally specified.

==Procedure==
When using Kröger–Vink notation for both intrinsic and extrinsic defects, it is imperative to keep all masses, sites, and charges balanced in each reaction. If any piece is unbalanced, the reactants and the products do not equal the same entity and therefore all quantities are not conserved as they should be. The first step in this process is determining the correct type of defect and reaction that comes along with it; Schottky and Frenkel defects begin with a null reactant (∅) and produce either [[Ion|cation]] and [[Ion|anion]] vacancies (Schottky) or cation/anion vacancies and interstitials (Frenkel). Otherwise, a compound is broken down into its respective cation and anion parts for the process to begin on each lattice. From here, depending on the required steps for the desired outcome, several possibilities occur. For example, the defect may result in an ion on its own ion site or a vacancy on the cation site. To complete the reactions, the proper number of each ion must be present (mass balance), an equal number of sites must exist (site balance), and the charges of the reactants and products must also be equivalent (charge balance).

===Example usage===

*∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′′′|b=Ti}} + 2&amp;nbsp;v{{su|p=••|b=O}}
*:[[Schottky defect]] formation in [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].
*∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=Ba}} + v{{su|p=′′′′|b=Ti}} + 3&amp;nbsp;v{{su|p=••|b=O}}
*:[[Schottky defect]] formation in [[Barium titanate|BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].
*Mg{{su|p=×|b=Mg}} + O{{su|p=×|b=O}} {{eqm}} O{{su|p=′′|b=i}} + v{{su|p=••|b=O}} + Mg{{su|p=×|b=Mg}}
*:[[Frenkel defect]] formation in [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]].
*Mg{{su|p=×|b=Mg}} + O{{su|p=×|b=O}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}} + v{{su|p=••|b=O}} + Mg{{su|p=×|b=surface}} + O{{su|p=×|b=surface}}
*:[[Schottky defect]] formation in [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]].

==Basic types of defect reactions==

Assume that the cation C has +1 charge and anion A has −1 charge.

#Schottky defect – forming a vacancy pair on both anion and cation sites:
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=C}} + v{{su|p=•|b=A}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=M}} + v{{su|p=•|b=X}}
#Schottky defect (charged) – forming an electron–hole pair:
#:∅ {{eqm}} e{{su|p=′}} + h{{su|p=•}}
#Frenkel defect – forming an interstitial and vacancy pair on an anion or cation site:
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=C}} + C{{su|p=•|b=i}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=M}} + M{{su|p=•|b=i}} (cationic [[Frenkel defect]])
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=•|b=A}} + A{{su|p=′|b=i}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=•|b=X}} + X{{su|p=′|b=i}} (anionic [[Frenkel defect]])
#Associates – forming an [[Entropy|entropically]] favored site, usually depending on temperature. For the two equations shown below, the right side is usually at high temperature as this allows for more movement of [[electron]]s. The left side is usually at low temperature as the electrons lose their mobility due to loss in [[kinetic energy]].
#:M{{su|p=×|b=M}} + e{{su|p=′}} → M{{su|p=′|b=M}} (metal site reduced)
#:B{{su|p=×|b=M}} → B{{su|p=•|b=M}} + e{{su|p=′}} (metal site oxidized, where B is an arbitrary cation having one more positive charge than the original site)

==Oxidation–reduction tree==
The following [[Redox|oxidation–reduction]] tree of an ionic species shows the various ways in which a substance can be broken down. Depending on the cation-to-anion ratio, the species can either be reduced and therefore classified as '''n-type''', or if the converse is true, the ionic species is classified as '''p-type'''. Below, the tree is shown for a further explanation of the pathways and results of each breakdown of the substance. (A is a cation and X is an anion.)

[[File:Oxidation-Reduction Tree.jpg|thumb|center|621px|Tree diagram representation of the oxidation and reduction of intrinsic defects in ionic substances.]]

===Schematic examples===
From the chart above, there are total of four possible chemical reactions using Kröger–Vink Notation depending on the intrinsic deficiency of atoms within the material. Assume the chemical composition is AX, with A being the cation and X being the anion. (The following assumes that X is a diatomic gas, namely, oxygen and therefore A has a +2 charge as a cation. Note that this could be used to make an [[oxygen sensor]].)

#For the reduced n-type, with the cation in excess on the interstitial sites:
#:A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} {{eqm}} A{{su|p=••|b=i}} + {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[gas|g]]) + 2&amp;nbsp;e{{su|p=′}}
#For the reduced n-type, with the anion in deficiency on the lattice sites:
#:A([[solid|s]]) {{eqm}} A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + v{{su|p=••|b=X}} + 2&amp;nbsp;e{{su|p=′}}
#For the oxidized p-type, with the cation in deficiency on the lattice site:
#:{{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[gas|g]]) {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} + 2&amp;nbsp;h{{su|p=•}}
#For the oxidized p-type, with the anion in excess on the interstitial site:
#:A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} {{eqm}} A([[solid|s]]) + X{{su|p=′′|b=i}} + 2&amp;nbsp;h{{su|p=•}}

==Relating chemical reactions to the equilibrium constant==
Using the [[law of mass action]], defect [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] can be related to its [[Gibbs free energy]] of formation, and the energy terms ([[enthalpy of formation]]) can be calculated given the defect concentration or vice versa.

===Examples===
For a Schottky reaction in [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]], the Kröger–Vink defect reaction can be written as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}} + v{{su|p=••|b=O}} |{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Note that the vacancy on the Mg sublattice site has a −2 effective charge, and the vacancy on the oxygen sublattice site has a +2 effective charge. Using the [[law of mass action]], the reaction [[equilibrium constant]] can be written as ([[square bracket]]s indicating concentration):

{{NumBlk|:|2=''k'' = [v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}][v{{su|p=••|b=O}}] |3={{EquationRef|2}}}}

According to the reaction, the stoichiometric relation is as follows,

{{NumBlk|:|2=[v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}] = [v{{su|p=••|b=O}}] |3={{EquationRef|3}}}}

Also, the equilibrium constant can be related to the Gibbs free energy of formation Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; according to the following relations,

{{NumBlk|:|2=''k'' = [[Exponential function|exp]]{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}}, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] |3={{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|2=Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; − ''T''Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; |3={{EquationRef|5}}}}

Relating equations {{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|4}}, we get:

:exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}} = [v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Using equation {{EquationNote|5}}, the formula can be simplified into the following form where the enthalpy of formation can be directly calculated:

:[v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}] = exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} + {{sfrac|Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}{{big|)}} = ''A'' exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}}, where ''A'' is a constant containing the [[entropy|entropic]] term.

Therefore, given a temperature and the formation energy of Schottky defect, the intrinsic Schottky defect concentration can be calculated from the above equation.

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

===The Weimar children murders===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Karola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, Gerhard. [http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020808-9999_1n8feldman.html “Lawyer says case against defendant is 'guesswork',"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 8 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Harriet. [http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html “Experts: Girl's prints found in Westerfield's RV,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211022/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html |date=4 February 2009 }} Court TV, 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One orange fiber with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibers with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV).

{{Uncommon Unicode notice}}
'''Lydian script''' was used to write the [[Lydian language]]. Like other scripts of [[Anatolia]] in the [[Iron Age]], the Lydian alphabet is related to the East Greek alphabet, but it has unique features.

The first modern codification of the Lydian alphabet was made by [[Roberto Gusmani]] in 1964, in a combined [[lexicon]], grammar, and text collection.

Early Lydian texts were written either from left to right or from right to left. Later texts all run from right to left. One surviving text is in the bi-directional [[boustrophedon]] manner. Spaces separate words except in one text that uses dots instead. Lydian uniquely features a [[quotation mark]] in the shape of a [[right triangle]].

==Alphabet==
The Lydian alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Adiego (2007) page 769.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Everson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the other [[alphabets of Asia Minor]] as well as to the [[Greek alphabet]]. It contains letters for 26 sounds. Some are represented by more than one symbol, which is considered one "letter." Unlike the [[Carian script|Carian alphabet]], which had an ''f'' derived from [[Φ]], the Lydian ''f'' has the peculiar ''8'' shape also found in the [[Etruscan alphabet]].

The concept of the '''metaphysics of presence''' is an important consideration in [[deconstruction]]. Deconstructive [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] holds that the entire [[history of philosophy|history]] of [[Western philosophy]] with its language and traditions has emphasized the desire for immediate access to [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], and thus built a [[metaphysics]] or [[ontotheology]] based on privileging presence over [[Nonexistence|absence]].

==Overview==
In ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927; transl. 1962), [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the concept of time prevalent in all Western thought has largely remained unchanged since the definition offered by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''. Heidegger says, "[[Aristotle]]'s essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this phenomenon [time] which has come down to us. Every subsequent account of time, including [[Henri Bergson]]'s, has been [[essentialism|essentially]] determined by it."&lt;ref name=:0&gt;''Being and Time'' (1962), §6, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle defined time as "the number of movement in respect of before and after".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', Book IV, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; By defining time in this way Aristotle privileges what is [[Heideggerian terminology|present-at-hand]], namely the "presence" of time. Heidegger argues in response that "entities are grasped in their Being as 'presence'; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time – the 'Present'".&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; Central to Heidegger's own philosophical project is the attempt to gain a more authentic understanding of time. Heidegger considers time to be the unity of three [[Ecstasy (philosophy)#Existential philosophy|ecstases]]: the past, the present, and the future. 

Deconstructive thinkers, like [[Jacques Derrida]], describe their task as the questioning or ''deconstruction'' of this metaphysical tendency in Western philosophy. Derrida writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of [[Ousia#Philosophy|ousia]] as [[parousia]], on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite."&lt;ref&gt;"Ousia and Grammē: Note on a Note from 'Being and Time,'" in ''Margins of Philosophy'' (1972), 29–67: 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who in ''Being and Time'' claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as the [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]].

The presence to which Heidegger refers is both a presence as in a "now" and also a presence as in an eternal present, as one might associate with God or the "eternal" [[Physical law|laws of science]]. This [[hypostatized]] (underlying) belief in presence is undermined by novel [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] ideas, such that presence itself does not subsist, but comes about primordially through the action of our futural projection, our realization of [[finitude]] and the reception or rejection of the traditions of our time.

{{Contract law}}

In the law of [[contract]]s, the '''mirror image rule,''' also referred to as an unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement, states that an [[offer and acceptance|offer]] must be accepted exactly with no modifications. The offeror is the master of one's own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a [[counter-offer]], and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.&lt;ref&gt;(Restatement(2d) Contracts §59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
The [[English common law]] established the concepts of ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', offer, acceptance and counter-offer.  The leading case on counter-offer is ''[[Hyde v Wrench]]'' [1840].&lt;ref&gt; Hyde v Wrench [1840] EWHC Ch J90&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase "Mirror-Image Rule" is rarely (if at all) used by English lawyers; but the concept remains valid, as in ''[[Gibson v Manchester City Council]]'' [1979],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] UKHL 6|&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd|Butler Machine Tool v Excello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-cello Cpn (England) Ltd 1979 1 WLR 401 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
This position is adhered to in [[Australia]] ([[New South Wales]]). If a person were to accept an offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: ''Masters v Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the original offeror is now the one who has to accept.

==United States==
{{See also|United States contract law#UCC .C2.A7 2-207|Uniform Commercial Code#Section 2-207: Battle of the forms|Offer and acceptance#Battle of the forms}}

In the [[United States]], this rule still exists at common law.  However, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] ("UCC") dispenses with it in § 2-207. (but it can also be argued that § 2-207(1) enforces the mirror image rule)&lt;ref&gt;Text of § 2-207: https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-207&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, its applicability depends upon what law governs.  Most states have adopted the UCC, which governs transactions in goods.  Contracts for services or land, for example, would not be governed by the UCC.  The 2nd restatement of contracts also provides that when parties have not agreed to an essential term, "a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court."  However, it may not be possible for a reasonable term to be supplied by the court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">[[File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|thumb|The [[Sphere|2-sphere]] is usually considered as a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], so its natural topology is inherited from the [[Euclidean topology]].]]
In any domain of [[mathematics]], a space has a '''natural topology''' if there is a [[topology]] on the space which is "best adapted" to its study within the domain in question. In many cases this imprecise definition means little more than the assertion that the topology in question arises ''naturally'' or ''canonically'' (see [[mathematical jargon]]) in the given context.
 
Note that in some cases multiple topologies seem "natural". For example, if ''Y'' is a subset of a [[total order|totally ordered]] set ''X'', then the [[Order_topology#Induced_order_topology|induced order topology]], i.e. the [[order topology]] of the totally ordered ''Y'', where this order is inherited from ''X'', is coarser than the [[subspace topology]] of the order topology of ''X''.

"Natural topology" does quite often have a more specific meaning, at least given some prior contextual information: the natural topology is a topology which makes a natural map or collection of maps [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. This is still imprecise, even once one has specified what the natural maps are, because there may be many topologies with the required property. However, there is often a [[finest topology|finest]] or [[coarsest topology|coarsest]] topology which makes the given maps continuous, in which case these are obvious candidates for ''the'' natural topology.

The simplest cases (which nevertheless cover ''many'' examples) are the [[initial topology]] and the [[final topology]] (Willard (1970)). The initial topology is the coarsest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from ''X'' to topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; continuous. The final topology is the finest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' continuous.

Two of the simplest examples are the natural topologies of subspaces and quotient spaces.
* The natural topology on a [[subset]] of a topological space is the [[subspace topology]]. This is the coarsest topology which makes the [[inclusion map]] continuous.
* The natural topology on a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of a topological space is the [[quotient topology]]. This is the finest topology which makes the [[quotient map]] continuous.

Another example is that any metric space has a natural topology [[Metric_space#Open_and_closed_sets,_topology_and_convergence|induced by its metric]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The notion of '''non-malleable codes''' was introduced in 2010 by Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dziembowski|first=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|date=2009-01-01|title=Non-Malleable Codes|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608}}&lt;/ref&gt; for relaxing the notion of [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]]. Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a modified [[code-word]] is either the original message, or a completely unrelated value. Non-malleable codes provide a useful and meaningful security guarantee in situations where traditional [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]] is impossible; for example, when the [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] can completely overwrite the encoded message. Although such codes do not exist if the family of "[[Tampering (crime)|tampering]] functions" F is completely unrestricted, they are known to exist for many broad tampering families F.

== Background Knowledge ==

=== Tampering Experiment ===
To know the operation schema of non-malleable code, we have to have a knowledge of the basic experiment it based on. The following is the three step method of [[Tampering with evidence|tampering]] experiment.
# A ''source message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is [[Encode/Decode|encoded]] via a (possibly randomized) procedure &lt;math&gt;Enc&lt;/math&gt;, yielding a ''[[code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;Enc(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The code-word is modified under some ''tampering-function'' &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; to an erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt; is decoded using a procedure &lt;math&gt; Dec &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in a decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;Dec(c^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

The tampering experiment can be used to model several interesting real-world settings, such as data transmitted over a [[Noisy channel model|noisy channel]], or adversarial tampering of data stored in the memory of a physical device. Having this experimental base, we would like to build special encoding/decoding procedures &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt;, which give us some meaningful guarantees about the results of the above tampering experiment, for large and interesting families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of tampering functions. The following are several possibilities for the type of guarantees that we may hope for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=Sebastian|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Pratyay|last3=Venturi|first3=Daniele|last4=Wichs|first4=Daniel|title=Efficient Non-Malleable Codes and Key-Derivation for Poly-Size Tampering Circuits|journal=Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2014|volume= 8441|pages=111–128|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/198993/files/Efficient_Non-Malleable_Codes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error correction ===
One very natural guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-correction]], would be to require that for any tampering function and any ''source-message s'', the tampering experiment always produces the correct decoded message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication theory of secrecy systems|last = E. Shannon|first = Claude|date = 1949|journal = Bell System Technical Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error detection ===
A weaker guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-detection]], requires that the tampering-experiment always results in either the correct value &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; or a special symbol &lt;math&gt;s^* = \perp &lt;/math&gt; indicating that tampering has been detected. This notion of error-detection is a weaker guarantee than error-correction, and achievable for larger F of tampering functions.

== Algorithm description==
A non-malleable code ensures that either the tampering experiment results in a correct decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;, or the decoded-message &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; is completely independent of and unrelated to the ''source-message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. In other word, the notion of non-malleability for codes is similar, in spirit, to notions of non-malleability for cryptographic primitives (such as encryption2, commitments and zero-knowledge proofs), introduced by the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolev|first1=Danny|last2=Dwork|first2=Cynthia|last3=Moni|first3=Naor|title=Non-Malleable Cryptography|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|date=Mar 24, 2000|page=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=9A853A59C3A45DD1B67690F10232D635?doi=10.1.1.26.8267&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1137/s0097539795291562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[Error correction and detection|error correction or error detection]], the "right" formalization of non-malleable codes is somewhat harder to define. Let &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; be a random variable for the value of the decoded-message, which results when we run the tampering experiment with source-message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, over the randomness of the encoding procedure. Intuitively, we wish to say that the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the encoded message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, we also want to allow for the case where the tampering experiment results in &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; (for example, if the tampering function is identity), which clearly depends on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, we require that for every tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; which outputs either concrete values &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; or a special same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol, and faithfully models the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the following sense: for every source message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the distributions of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; are statistically close when the &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; correctly simulates the "outcome" of the tampering-experiment with a function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; without knowing the source-messages &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, but it is allowed some ambiguity by outputting a same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol to indicate that the decoded-message should be the same as the source-message, without specifying what the exact value is. The fact that &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; depends on only &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and not on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, shows that the outcome of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, exempting equality.

== Relation to error correction/detection ==
Notice that [[Ductility|non-malleability]] is a weaker guarantee than error correction/detection; the latter ensure that any change in the code-word can be corrected or at least detected by the decoding procedure, whereas the former does allow the message to be modified, but only to an unrelated value. However, when studying [[Error detection and correction|error correction/detection]] we usually restrict ourselves to limited forms of tampering which preserve some notion of distance (e.g., usually [[hamming distance]]) between the original and tampered code-word. 
For example, it is already impossible to achieve error correction/detection for the simple family of functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; which, for every constant &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;, includes a "[[Mathematical constant|constant]]" function &lt;math&gt;f_{c^*}&lt;/math&gt; that maps all inputs to &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. There is always some function in &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; that maps everything to a valid code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, it is trivial to construct codes that are non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt;, as the output of a constant function is clearly independent of its input. The prior works on non-malleable codes show that one can construct non-malleable codes for highly complex tampering function families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; for which error correction/detection can not be achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dziembowski|first1=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|title=Non-Malleable Codes|journal=ICS, 2010|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application over tampering functions ==

=== Bit-wise independent tampering ===
As one very concrete example, we study [[Non-malleable codes|non-malleability]] with respect to the family of functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; which specify, for each bit of the [[Code word|code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, whether to keep it as is, flip it, set it to 0, set it to 1. That is, each bit of the code-word is modified arbitrarily but independently of the value of the other bits of the code-word. We call this the “bit-wise independent tampering” family &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this family contains constant functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; and constant-error functions &lt;math&gt;F_{err}&lt;/math&gt; as subsets. Therefore, as we have mentioned, error-correction and error-detection cannot be achieved w.r.t. this family. Nevertheless, the following can show an efficient non-malleable code for this powerful family.

With &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt; we denote the family which contains all tampering functions that tamper every bit independently. Formally, this family contains all functions &lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;  that are defined by n functions&lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\} \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (for i=1...n) as &lt;math&gt;f(c_1..c_n)=f_1(c_1)..f_n(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that there are only 4 possible choices for each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. how to modify a particular bit) and we name these “set to 0”, “set to 1”, “flip”, “keep” where the meanings should be intuitive. We call the above family the bit-wise independent tampering family.

=== All families of bounded size ===
* [[Probabilistic]] Method Approach 
For any "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a (possibly inefficient) coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t. F. Moreover, for a fixed "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a random coding scheme is likely to be non-malleable w.r.t. F with overwhelming probability. Unfortunately, random coding schemes cannot be efficiently represented, nor is the encoding/decoding function likely to be efficient. Therefore, this result should merely be thought of as showing "possibility" and providing a target that we should then strive to match constructively. Moreover, this result also highlights the difference between "error-correction/detection" and "non-malleability" since a result of this form could not be true for the former notions.
 
* [[Random oracle|Random Oracle]] Model Approach
It is not clear what the bound from the theorem&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; of this type actually implies. For example, it does tell us that non-malleable codes exist with respect to all efficient functions, but this is misleading as we know that efficient non-malleable codes (and ultimately we are only interested in such) cannot be non-malleable w.r.t. this class. Nevertheless, the result by the probabilistic method does give us codes which are non-malleable w.r.t. very general classes of functions in the random oracle model.

=== Model of tamper-resilient security ===
In this model, we consider two ways of interacting with the system:

''Execute(''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;''):'' A user can provide the system with Execute(x) queries, for &lt;math&gt;x\in \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^u&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the system computes &lt;math&gt;(y,s^') \gets G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, updates the state of the system to &lt;math&gt;s :=s^'&lt;/math&gt; and outputs &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

''Tamper(''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'')'': We also consider tampering attacks against the system, modeled by Tamper(&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) commands, for functions &lt;math&gt;f: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Upon receiving such command, the system state is set to &lt;math&gt;s := f(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

An attacker that can also interact with the system via Tamper queries can potentially learn significantly more about the secret state, even recover it entirely. Therefore, we would like to have a general method for securing systems against tampering attacks, so that the ability to issue Tamper queries (at least for functions f in some large family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) cannot provide the attacker with additional information. By using non-malleable code for this purpose we have the conclusion: Let &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; be any coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; can also be tamper-simulate w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

== Capacity of non-malleable codes ==
# For every family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|F|\leq 2^{2^{\alpha n}}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist non-malleable codes against &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with rate arbitrarily close to 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (this is achieved w.h.p. by a randomized construction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes|arxiv= 1309.0458|date = 2013-09-02|first = Mahdi|last = Cheraghchi|first2 = Venkatesan|last2 = Guruswami}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# For families of size &lt;math&gt;exp( n^{O(1)}2^{\alpha n})&lt;/math&gt; against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size).
# 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the best achievable rate for the family of functions which are only allowed to tamper the first &lt;math&gt;\alpha n&lt;/math&gt; bits of the code-word, which is of special interest.

The '''Nuremberg International Human Rights Award''' is a German award founded on September 17, 1995. The date chosen is significant; 60 years earlier, the [[Nuremberg Race Laws]] were adopted. Also, on September 17, 1939, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by the [[Soviet Union]], soon after the [[invasion of Poland|German invasion]] that marked the beginning of World War II

The winner is endowed with 15,000 euros (20,235 USD).

{{short description|Parable used in early Buddhism}}
The '''parable of the arrow''' (or 'Parable of the poisoned arrow') is a Buddhist [[parable]] that illustrates the [[skeptic]] and pragmatic themes of the ''Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta'' (The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya) which is part of the middle length discourses ([[Majjhima Nikaya]]), one of the five sections of the [[Sutta Pitaka]]. The Pāli text contains a number of ''[[Hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]]'' or otherwise obscure archery terms and these are generally poorly dealt with in English translations.

==Narrative==
The [[sutra|sutta]] begins at [[Jetavana]] where the monk Malunkyaputta is troubled by [[Gautama Buddha]]'s silence on the [[fourteen unanswerable questions]], which include queries about the nature of the cosmos and life after the death of a Buddha. Malunkyaputta then meets with Gautama Buddha and asks him for the answers to these questions, he says that if he fails to respond, Malunkya will renounce his teachings. Gautama responds by first stating that he never promised to reveal ultimate [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths such as those and then uses the story of a man who has been shot with a [[poisoned arrow]] to illustrate that those questions are irrelevant to his teachings. 

{{quote|It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends &amp; companions, kinsmen &amp; relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker.' He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name &amp; clan name of the man who wounded me... until I know whether he was tall, medium, or short... until I know whether he was dark, ruddy-brown, or golden-colored... until I know his home village, town, or city... until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow... until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber, bamboo threads, sinew, hemp, or bark... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated... until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a peacock, or another bird... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox, a water buffalo, a langur, or a monkey.' He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barbed, a calf-toothed, or an oleander arrow.' The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta: The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya (MN 63)|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Commentary==

[[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] comments on the way the parable of the poisoned arrow illustrates Gautama Buddha's anti-metaphysical views:

{{quote|The Buddha always told his disciples not to waste their time and energy in metaphysical speculation. Whenever he was asked a metaphysical question, he remained silent. Instead, he directed his disciples toward practical efforts. Questioned one day about the problem of the infinity of the world, the Buddha said, "Whether the world is finite or infinite, limited or unlimited, the problem of your liberation remains the same." Another time he said, "Suppose a man is struck by a poisoned arrow and the doctor wishes to take out the arrow immediately. Suppose the man does not want the arrow removed until he knows who shot it, his age, his parents, and why he shot it. What would happen? If he were to wait until all these questions have been answered, the man might die first." Life is so short. It must not be spent in endless metaphysical speculation that does not bring us any closer to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nhất Hạnh|first1=Thích|first2=Philip|last2=Kapleau|authorlink1=Thích Nhất Hạnh|authorlink2=Philip Kapleau| title=Zen Keys|publisher= Three Leaves Press|year= 2005|page= 42|ISBN=9780385475617}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Sangharakshita notes that "The important thing is to get rid of the arrow, not to enquire where it came from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=|title=The Drama of Cosmic Enlightenment: Parables, Myths, and Symbols of the White Lotus Sutra|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|page=97|ISBN=9780904766592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable is considered a teaching on being practical and dealing with the situation at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Dale Stuart|title=The Six Perfections: Buddhism and the Cultivation of Character|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|page=200|ISBN=9780195382013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Chris|title=Buddhism for Today|page=14|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|ISBN=9780199172412}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese sources==
The story is also preserved in two Chinese translations of Prakrit sources. 
* 箭喻經 ''Jiàn yù jīng'' (''Arrow Metaphor Sūtra''), T 1.26 (p0804a21), （二二一）中阿含例品 (Èr èr yī) Zhōng ā hán, Lì pǐn. Madhyāgama 221, Chapter on Examples. Translated from an Indic language (possibly Gāndārī) into Chinese by a Sarvāstivāda Tripiṭaka master, Gautama Saṅghadeva, from Kashmir in the Eastern Jin Dynasty ca. Dec 397 – Jan 398 CE. 
* 佛說箭喻經 ''Fú shuō jiàn yù jīng''&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddha’s Talk on the Arrow Metaphor Sūtra'') T 1.94 (p.0917c21). Translator unknown, dated only to the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317–420 CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these uses different translation strategies. T 1.26 transposes the various archery terms into items and materials familiar to a Chinese audience; while T 1.94 uses transliterated Indic terms that do not match the Pāli in most cases. Thus the obscure Pāli terms remain largely obscure for now. A third Chinese text, ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' (T 1509 at T XXV 170a8-b1) contains a paraphrase of this text.

{{About|the idea of harmony and the absence of hostility}}
{{POV lead|date=September 2018}}
[[File:2008. Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|The Kind Angel of Peace monument in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine, by Russian artist Peter Stronsky]]
'''Peace''' is the concept of [[friendship|harmonious]] [[well-being]] and freedom from [[hostility|hostile]] [[aggression]]. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of [[social conflict|conflict]] (such as [[war]]) and freedom from [[fear]] of [[violence]] between individuals or [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] (relatively foreign or distinct) [[social group|groups]].

Throughout history some of the most extraordinary and benevolent leaders have used peace talks to establish a certain type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of [[List of periods of regional peace|regional peace]] or economic growth through various forms of agreements or [[peace treaty|peace treaties]].  Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in de-escalation of rhetorical and physical conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.  The avoidance of [[war]] or violent [[hostility]] can be the result of thoughtful active listening and communication that enables greater genuine mutual understanding and therefore compromise.  Leaders often benefit tremendously from the prestige of peace talks and treaties that can result in substantially enhanced popularity.

“Psychological peace” (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioral peace."  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition."  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not Dalai Lama XIV: Quotable Quotes] Goodreads. Downloaded Sep 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition of such a "peaceful internal disposition" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests.

Because psychological peace can be important to Behavioral peace, leaders sometimes de-escalate conflicts through compliments and generosity.  Small gestures of rhetorical and actual generosity have been shown in psychological research to often result in larger levels of reciprocal generosity (and even virtuous circles of generosity).  Such benevolent selfless behavior can eventually become a pattern that may become a lasting basis for improved relations between individuals and groups of people.  Peace talks often start without preconditions and preconceived notions, because they are more than just negotiating opportunities.  They place attention on peace itself over and above what may have been previously perceived as the competing needs or interests of separate individuals or parties to elicit peaceful feelings and therefore produce benevolent behavioral results.  Peace talks are sometimes also uniquely important learning opportunities for the individuals or parties involved.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Beowulf - frithu sibb.jpg|thumb|Before the word 'peace' came into English lexicon, Anglo-Saxons used a phrase "friðu sibb" for '[[Peace treaty|pledge of peace]]']]
The term-'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French ''pes,'' and the Old French ''pais'', meaning "peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement" (11th century).&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peace&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 "Peace"].&lt;/ref&gt; But, ''Pes'' itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''pax'', meaning "peace, compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony." The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word [[shalom]], which, according to Jewish theology, comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete, whole'.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research centre: http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_peace.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although 'peace' is the usual translation, however, it is an incomplete one, because 'shalom,' which is also cognate with the Arabic ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'', has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness, as well as simply the greetings, "hello" and "goodbye".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} At a personal level, peaceful behaviors are kind, considerate, [[respect]]ful, just, and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest [[good faith|goodwill]].

This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being "at peace" in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of "[[Silence|quiet]]", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] — an absence of disturbance or agitation.

In many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[aloha]], as well as the Arabic word ''salaam''. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase ''[[rest in peace]]''.

[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] in his research project which led to the book ''The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies'' (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his ''Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture'' (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families and the society.

==Religious beliefs {{anchor|Religion}}==
[[File:Eiréné et Ploutos.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], goddess of peace in ancient Greek religion, with her son Pluto.]]
Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies. In ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek-speaking areas]] the virtue of peace was [[personification|personified]] as the goddess [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], and in [[ancient Roman religion|Latin-speaking areas]] as the goddess [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]]. Her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors as that of a full-grown woman, usually with a [[cornucopia|horn of plenty]] and [[scepter]] and sometimes with a [[torch]] or [[olive branch|olive leaves]].

===Christianity===
[[Christians]], who believe [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] to be the [[Jewish Messiah]] called [[Christ (title)|Christ]] (meaning Anointed One),&lt;ref&gt;Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research Center:http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_messiah.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; interpret Isaiah 9:6 as a [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecy]] of Jesus in which he is called the "[[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|Prince of Peace]]."&lt;ref&gt;"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, 'Prince of Peace'." [New International Version]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]: And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.

Numerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy [[Rosary]] as a means to foster peace. Subsequently, to the Encyclical Mense maio,1965, in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary, "the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs," and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri, 1966, to implore peace, Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis, October 1969, that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace.

===Islam===
[[Islam]] derived from the root word salam which literally means peace. Muslims are called followers of Islam. [[Quran]] clearly stated "Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah, hearts are assured" and stated "O you who have believed, when you are told, "Space yourselves" in assemblies, then make space; Allah will make space for you. And when you are told, "Arise," then arise; Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/13/28|title=peaceful quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/58/11|title=peaceful quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhist]]s believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends. They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the [[Buddha]] adhere to a set of teachings called the [[Four Noble Truths]] — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts contain the following passages:
{{quote|May there be peace in the heavens, peace in the atmosphere, peace on the earth. Let there be coolness in the water, healing in the herbs and peace radiating from the trees. Let there be harmony in the planets and in the stars, and perfection in eternal knowledge. May everything in the universe be at peace. Let peace pervade everywhere, at all times. May I experience that peace within my own heart.|[[Yajur Veda]] 36.17)}}

{{quote|Let us not concord with our own people, and concord with people who are strangers to us. Celestial Twins, create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts. May we unite in our minds, unite in our purposes, and not fight against the heavenly spirit within us. Let not the battle-cry rise amidst many slain, nor the arrows of the war-god fall with the break of day|Yajur Veda 7.52}}

{{quote|A superior being does not render evil for evil. This is a maxim one should observe... One should never harm the wicked or the good or even animals meriting death. A noble soul will exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or cruel deeds... Who is without fault?|[[Valmiki]]|[[Ramayana]]}}

{{quote|The chariot that leads to victory is of another kind. 
:Valour and fortitude are its wheels;
:Truthfulness and virtuous conduct are its banner; 
:Strength, discretion, self-restraint and benevolence are its four horses,
:Harnessed with the cords of forgiveness, compassion and equanimity... 
:Whoever has this righteous chariot, has no enemy to conquer anywhere.|Valmiki|Ramayana}}

==Inner peace, meditation and prayerfulness==
{{main|Inner peace}}
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddhist monk during meditation near Phu Soidao Nationalpark.]]
Psychological or inner peace (i.e. peace of mind) refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace, with sufficient [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself calm in the face of apparent discord or stress. Being internally "at peace" is considered by many to be a healthy mental state, or [[homeostasis]] and to be the opposite of feeling stressful, mentally anxious, or emotionally unstable. Within the meditative traditions, the psychological or inward achievement of "peace of mind" is often associated with bliss and happiness.

Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, t'ai chi ch'uan ([[T'ai chi ch'uan|太极拳, tàijíquán]]), yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and some traditional [[Christian]] contemplative practices such as [[monasticism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essential+writings+of+christian+mysticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjju8O3gOTWAhUm0IMKHZa0DnMQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sighed%20for%20ecstatic%20peace&amp;f=false Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism] Page 163. 2006. By Bernard McGinn.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the [[New Age]] movement.

==Satyagraha==
{{Main|Satyagraha}}
Satyagraha ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}} {{IAST|''satyāgraha''}}) is a philosophy and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].

The word ''satyagraha'' itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.

[[File:Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at a civil rights march on Washington D.C. in 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interrracial Justice, at a civil rights march on Washington, D.C.]]
Satyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: "They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end..."&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm "The Gospel Of Sarvodaya"], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to [[A. J. Muste]], sums it up: 'There is no way to peace; peace is the way.'

==Justice and injustice==
Since classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).

Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (''just peace'').&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 129, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A peace must be seen at least in two forms: 
* A simple silence of arms, absence of [[war]].
* Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.

More recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|title=The Theory of Active Peace|work=internationalpeaceandconflict.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725235108/http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.

==Long periods==
{{See also|List of periods of regional peace}}
The longest continuing period of neutrality among currently existing states is observed in [[Switzerland]], which has had an official policy of neutrality and general peace since 1815 (for {{age|1815|11|20}} years as of 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}).  This was made possible partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as [[Pax Britannica]] (1815-1914), [[Pax Europaea]]/[[Pax Americana]] (since 1950s), and [[Pax Atomica]] (also since the 1950s).

Other examples of long periods of peace are:
* the [[isolationism|isolationistic]] [[Edo period]] (also known as [[Tokugawa shogunate]]) in Japan 1603 to 1868 (250 years)
* [[Pax Khazarica]] in [[Khazar Khanate]] (south-east Turkey) about 700-950 AD (250 years)
* [[Pax Romana]] in the Roman empire (for 190 or 206 years).

==Movements and activism==

===Pacifism===
{{Main|Pacifism}}

[[File:Peace sign.svg|thumb|upright|A [[peace sign]], which is widely associated with pacifism]]
Pacifism is the categorical opposition to the behaviors of [[war]] or [[violence]] as a means of settling disputes or of gaining advantage. Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force.  Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchist]]s and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]s.  Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.

Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict, and are morally wrong.  Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists in general reject theories of [[Just War]].  Pacifism tends to place its initial focus on the need for a "peaceful behavior" ahead of any focus on the need for a "peaceful inner disposition."

===Organizations===

==== United Nations ====
[[File:United Nations peacekeeping missions 2009.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[List of UN peacekeeping missions|UN peacekeeping missions]]. Dark blue regions indicate current missions, while light blue regions represent former missions.]]
{{Main|United Nations}}{{See also|List of United Nations peacekeeping missions}}
The United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achieving [[world peace]]. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.

The UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the "Blue Helmets", who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.

====League of Nations====
The principal forerunner of the United Nations was the [[League of Nations]]. It was created at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and emerged from the advocacy of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and the League was based in [[Geneva]] until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the [[League of Nations Union]], gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan.

One of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]]. Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League, such as [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Florence Stawell]] - the so-called "Greece and peace" set - he came to this from the study of the [[classics]].

The creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the [[Union for Democratic Control]] during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] at [[Chatham House]] in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalize, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales, in 1919.

====Olympic Games====
The late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and ultimately the [[League of Nations]], also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal. Led by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern [[Olympic Games]].

====Nobel Peace Prize====
{{Main|Nobel Peace Prize}}
[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Dunant]] was awarded the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his role in founding the [[International Red Cross]].]]
The highest honour awarded to peace maker is the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]], awarded since 1901 by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. It is awarded annually to internationally notable persons following the prize's creation in the will of [[Alfred Nobel]]. According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who "...shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html |accessdate=2008-03-31 |title=Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033111/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html |archivedate=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhodes Scholarships and other fellowships====
In creating the [[Rhodes Scholarships]] for outstanding students from the United States, Germany and much of the British Empire, [[Cecil Rhodes]] wrote in 1901 that 'the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.rhodes.gethifi.com/Ottawa_September_2011_To_render_war_impossible.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609195112/http://files.rhodes.gethifi.com/Ottawa_September_2011_To_render_war_impossible.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century, and became prominent again in recent years under Warden of the Rhodes House [[Donald Markwell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/cecil-rhodess-vision-of-peace-highlighted Cecil Rhodes's goal of Scholarships promoting peace highlighted - The Rhodes Scholarships] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922131706/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/cecil-rhodess-vision-of-peace-highlighted |date=22 September 2013 }}.

==Theories==
{{see also|Peace and conflict studies#Conceptions of peace}}
Many different theories of "peace" exist in the world of [[peace studies]], which involves the study of de-escalation, conflict transformation, disarmament, and cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/peaceprogram/ einaudi.cornell.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022225012/http://einaudi.cornell.edu/PeaceProgram/ |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "peace" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.

One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Game theory ===
{{Main|Peace war game}}

The ''Peace &amp; War Game'' is an approach in [[game theory]] to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts.

The [[iterated game]] hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and [[computer simulation]]s to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. One of the well studied [[strategy|strategies]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on [[Genghis Khan]], i.e. a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led, in contrast, to the development of what's known as the "provokable nice guy [[strategy]]", a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked.

There exists a strategy of multiple players who can continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Balance of power theories===
{{Main|Balance of power (international relations)}}
The classical "realist" position is that the key to promoting order between states, and so of increasing the chances of peace, is the maintenance of a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] between states - a situation where no state is so dominant that it can "lay down the law to the rest". Exponents of this view have included [[Metternich]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. A related approach - more in the tradition of [[Hugo Grotius]] than [[Thomas Hobbes]] - was articulated by the so-called "[[English school of international relations theory]]" such as [[Martin Wight]] in his book ''Power Politics'' (1946, 1978) and [[Hedley Bull]] in ''The Anarchical Society'' (1977).

As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for [[hegemony]].

In the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the [[cold war]],  a particular form of balance of power - mutual nuclear deterrence - emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the "nuclear umbrella" made it "safe" for smaller wars (e.g. the [[Vietnam war]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring]]), so making such wars more likely.

===Democratic peace theory===
{{Main|Democratic peace theory}}
The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another.

===Free trade, interdependence and globalization===
It was a central tenet of [[classical liberalism]], for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) said that he was "brought up" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[economic globalization]] in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as [[Norman Angell]] argued that the growth 
of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1914.

These ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;For sources, see articles on [[liberalism]] and [[classical liberalism]].&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have seen [[capitalism]] as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.

===Socialism and managed capitalism===
Socialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., [[Lenin]], [[J.A. Hobson]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.

However, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] at [[Breton Woods, New Jersey|Bretton Woods]] in 1944, and later of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (subsequently the [[World Trade Organization]]).&lt;ref&gt;. See [[Donald Markwell]]. ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of 'active peace'===
Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the writings of Maine Quaker [[Gray Cox]], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [[John Woolman College]] initiative have arrived at a theory of "active peace". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word ''shalom''.  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into ''active peace'', dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping or peace building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url = http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 7 February 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620023950/http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | archivedate = 20 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organization and law===
One of the most influential theories of peace, especially since [[Woodrow Wilson]] led the creation of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of [[international law]] promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the [[United Nations]], and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], for example in his 1936 book ''The League of Nations and the Rule of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trans-national solidarity===
Many "idealist" thinkers about international relations - e.g. in the traditions of [[Kant]] and [[Karl Marx]] - have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sir [[Harry Hinsley]]. ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], and his successors such as [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Discussed above. See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]]. ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU|title=Publications - Strategic Foresight Group, Think Tank, Global Policy, Global affairs research, Water Conflict studies, global policy strategies, strategic policy group, global future studies|website=strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyotard post-modernism===
Following [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Wolfgang Sützl&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang Sützl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT Münster, Vienna, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of ''many peaces''. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.

In 2008 Dietrich enlarged his approach of the ''many peaces'' to the so-called ''five families'' of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies. A Cultural Approach; Palgrave MacMillan London, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation, the so-called elicitive approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Paul Lederach]]: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar day===
*[[Peace day]] was founded as a day of peace, to recognize and honor and promote peace. Peace Day is commemorated each year at the United Nations, and by every organization that is associated with the United Nations.

{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
''Peace and conflict studies'' is an [[academic field]] which identifies and analyses [[Violence|violent]] and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours, as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent [[social conflict]]s.  This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, 1989: 74&lt;/ref&gt; One variation,
''Peace studies'' ([[irenology]]), is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, [[de-escalation]], and solution of conflicts. This contrasts with [[war studies]] (polemology), directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts. Disciplines involved may include [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of other disciplines.

==Measurement and ranking==

Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible, various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it. [[Global Peace Index|The Global Peace Index]] produced by [[Institute for Economics and Peace|the Institute for Economics and Peace]] is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the absence of violence and absence of the fear of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-gpi-findings|title=Vision of Humanity|work=visionofhumanity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last edition of the Index ranks 163 countries on their internal and external levels of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/25/world/global-peace-index-iceland-syria/|title=Study: Iceland is the most peaceful nation in the world - CNN.com|author=Jethro Mullen, CNN|date=25 June 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2017 [[Global Peace Index]], Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/these-are-the-most-peaceful-countries-in-the-world/|title=These are the most peaceful countries in the world|website=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragile States Index]] (formerly known as the Failed States Index) created by the [[Fund for Peace]] focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/fragile-states-2014/|title=Fragile States 2014 - Foreign Policy|work=foreignpolicy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan, and the least fragile one is Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-fragile-states-index-hunger-idps/2827703.html|title=South Sudan Tops List of World's Fragile States - Again|work=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations including George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.

In [[television]] and [[film]], a '''plot point''' is a significant event within a plot that spins the action around in another direction. 

Noted screenwriting teacher [[Syd Field]] discusses plot points in his [[paradigm]], popularized in his book ''[[Screenplay (book)|Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]].''  There he proposes that a well-structured movie has two plot points within a three-act structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=William|title=Syd Field, Author of the Definitive Work On Writing Screenplays, Is Dead at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/syd-field-author-of-the-definitive-work-on-writing-screenplays-is-dead-at-77.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first plot point occurs 20 to 30 minutes into the film (assuming a standard 120-minute running time), and the second one occurs 80 to 90 minutes into the film. The first plot point ends Act I and propels the story into Act II; likewise, the second plot point ends Act II and propels the story into Act III.

[[File:Rosa Peace 1945.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland' (Peace)]]

The '''Peace''' [[rose]], formally '''''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland'''', is a well-known and successful [[garden rose]]. By 1992, over one&amp;nbsp;hundred&amp;nbsp;million plants of this [[hybrid tea rose|hybrid tea]] had been sold. The [[cultivar]] has large flowers of a light yellow to cream color, slightly flushed at the petal edges with crimson-pink. It is hardy and vigorous and relatively resistant to disease, making it popular in gardens as well as in the floral trade.

It was developed by [[France|French]] horticulturist [[Francis Meilland]] in the years 1935 to 1939. When Meilland foresaw the German invasion of France, he sent cuttings to friends in Italy, Turkey, Germany, and the United States to protect the new rose. It is said that it was sent to the US on the last plane available before the German invasion, where it was safely propagated by the [[Conard Pyle Co.]] during the war.&lt;ref name=meilland&gt;{{cite book|title=Meilland, a Life in Roses |last1=Meilland |first1=Alain |last2=Lambert |first2=Gilles |pages=65–71 |date=April 1984 |publisher=Southern Illinois Univ Pr |isbn=0809311119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultivar was hybridized in 1935, receiving the number 3-35-40 (the third hybridization in 1935, and the 40th cultivar selected for test proliferation). As those first tests produced beautiful flowers in autumn of 1936, the first no. 3-35-40 were grown in Meilland's rose fields in June 1939. That summer, cuttings were sent to partners in other countries. According to Meilland's records, 'Madame A. Meilland' was hybridized from the hybrid tea 'Margaret McGredy' and an unnamed seedling.&lt;ref name=blv&gt;{{cite book |title=Die BLV Rosen Enzyklopädie |publisher= BLV |author= Robert Markley |page=27 |ISBN= 978-3-8354-0272-0 |language= German |trans-title=The BLV Encyclopedia of Roses|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==
Because Meilland had sent out his cuttings just before the war, communication between the cultivators was not possible, which is why the rose received different names. In France, Francis and Alain Meilland decided to call the cultivar 'Madame A. Meilland', in honor of Francis' deceased mother, Alain Meilland's wife Claudia.&lt;ref name=blv /&gt; This is the formal cultivar name. Other names are considered by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as trade or [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants#Trade designations|selling name]]s. In Italy it was called {{tdes|Gioia}} (Italian for "joy"), in Germany {{tdes|Gloria Dei}} (Latin for "glory of God") and in the US, Sweden, and Norway {{tdes|Peace}}.

The rose eventually became known as {{tdes|Peace}}. In early 1945 rose grower Meilland wrote to Field Marshal Alan Brooke (later Viscount [[Alanbrooke]]) to thank him for his key part in the liberation of France and to ask if Brooke would give his name to the rose. Brooke declined saying that, though he was honored to be asked, his name would soon be forgotten and a much better and more enduring name would be "Peace".

The adoption of the trade name "Peace" was publicly announced in the [[United States]] on 29 April 1945 by the introducers, [[Conard Pyle Co.]] This was the very day that Berlin fell, a day considered a turning point in the [[Second World War]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=meilland /&gt; Later that year Peace roses were given to each of the delegations at the inaugural meeting of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], each with a note that read:

:"We hope the 'Peace' rose will influence men’s thoughts for everlasting [[world peace]]".

[[Peter Beales]], English rose grower and expert, said in his book ''Roses'':

:"'Peace', without doubt, is the finest Hybrid Tea ever raised and it will remain a standard variety forever".

[[File:Gloria Dei bud.JPG|thumb|left|'Mme A. Meilland' bud]]

== Description ==
'Mme A. Meilland' forms elegant buds that open to large, cupped flowers with a high-centered form and an average diameter of {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}}. Their color is a combination of pale yellow and crimson edges that depends on the location, the weather and changes as the flower fades. The durable flowers are very full, with 40 to 43 petals, survive rainy periods, and have a sweet and fruity fragrance that varies in its strength from mild to strong.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen - die große Enzyklopädie |publisher= Dorling Kindersley |author= Charles and Brigid Quest-Ritson |page=263 |ISBN=978-3-8310-1734-8 |language=German |trans-title=RHS Encyclopedia of Roses |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultivar flowers continuously throughout the season up to the first frost.

The vigorous shrub grows {{convert|120|to|200|cm|ft|abbr=on|frac=2}} high and {{convert|90|to|125|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, is winter hardy down to {{convert|−23|C|abbr=on|disp=or}} ([[USDA zone]] 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile—it is used as cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as standard rose to {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high, or in containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alles über Rosen |publisher= Eugen Ulmer KG |author= Klaus-Jürgen Strobel |page=208 |ISBN= 3-8001-4471-9 |language= German |trans-title=Everything about Roses|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
'Mme A. Meilland' has been granted numerous awards, starting with the selection as ''Most Beautiful French Rose'' in Lyon in 1942, gold medals in Lyon (1942), Portland (1944), The Hague (1965) and from the [[Royal National Rose Society]] in 1947. In 1944, it was included in the All-America Rose Selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/pl.php?n=2203&amp;tab=18 |title='Peace' rose Awards |publisher=HelpMeFind |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, it was the first cultivar to be granted the highest award a rose can be granted when it was selected as ''World's Favorite Rose'' and included into the [[Rose Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrose.org/awards/hof/hof.asp |title=Rose Hall of Fame |publisher=World Federation of Rose Societies |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports and hybrid offspring ==
As an often cultivated plant, several [[sport (botany)|sports]] of 'Mme A. Meilland' are known. 'Climbing Peace' ([[W. Kordes' Söhne|Kordes]] 1951) has slightly bigger flowers but flowers less well, 'Chicago Peace' (Johnston 1962) differs mainly in its richer colors with a mixture of crimson and apricot, while 'Kronenbourg' (syn. 'Flaming Peace', McGredy 1966) has red petals with yellow backs, creating an interesting contrast.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia /&gt;

It is also used in the hybridization of new cultivars, and played a role in the development of well known cultivars such as [[Rosa 'Garden Party'|'Garden Party']] (Swim, 1959), [[Rosa 'Super Star'|'Super Star']] (Tantau, 1960), and 'Pullman Orient Express' (Lim &amp; Twomey, 1991).

In the study of [[complex systems]] and [[hierarchy theory]], the concept of scale refers to the combination of (1) the level of analysis (for example, analyzing the whole or a specific component of the system); and (2) the level of observation (for example, observing a system as an external viewer or as an internal participant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahl |first1=Valerie |last2=Allen |first2=Timothy F.

For example, on at the scale of analysis of a given population of zebras, the number of predators (e.g. lions) determines the number of preys that survives after hunting, while at the scale of analysis of the ecosystem, the availability of preys determines how many predators can survive in a given area. The semantic categories of "prey" and "predator" are not given, but are defined by the observer.

'''Secular arm''', in [[ecclesiastical law]], refers to the legal authority of the civil power, the State, or any [[Laity|lay]] authority, invoked by the Church to punish offenders in cases properly belonging to the jurisdiction of the Church. In the [[Middle Ages]] especially in Inquisition trials for [[heresy]], or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]] to the secular arm" was used by the [[Spanish Inquistion]] to describe the handover of the condemned heretic.

The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Introduced circa 1180–1250 at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the church inquisitors delivered a [[Cathar]] heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. 
Under [[canon law]] church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Catholic Church|Church]] by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22938">'''Sex-limited genes''' are [[gene]]s that are present in both sexes of [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] [[species]] but are expressed in only one sex and remain 'turned off' in the other. In other words, sex-limited genes cause the two sexes to show different [[Trait (biology)|traits]] or [[phenotype]]s, despite having the same [[genotype]]. This term is restricted to [[autosomal]] traits, and should not be confused with [[sex-linked]] characteristics, which have to do with genetic differences on the sex chromosomes (see [[sex-determination system]]). Sex-limited genes are also distinguished from [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sex-influenced sex-influenced] genes, where the same gene will show differential expression in each sex. Sex-influenced genes commonly show a dominant/recessive relationship, where the same gene will have a dominant effect in one sex and a recessive effect in the other (for example, [[male pattern baldness]]).

Sex-limited genes are responsible for  [[sexual dimorphism]], which is a phenotypic (directly observable) difference between males and females of the same species. These differences can be reflected in size, color, behavior (ex: levels of aggression), and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. An example of sex-limited genes are genes which instruct the male [[elephant seal]]s to grow big and fight, at the same time instructing female seals to grow small and avoid fights.&lt;ref name="Ancestors_Tale"&gt;{{cite book

The overall point of sex-limited genes is to resolve intralocus [[sexual conflict]]. In other words, these genes try to resolve the "push-pull" between males and females over trait values for optimal phenotype. Without these genes, organisms would be forced to settle on an ''average ''trait value, incurring costs on both sexes. With these genes, it is possible to 'turn off' the [[genes]] in one sex, allowing both sexes to attain (or at least, approach very closely) their optimal phenotypes.

== A brief history ==
Unsurprisingly, the idea of sex-limited genes was initially developed by [[Charles Darwin]] himself in 1871 in his book ''The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|publisher=A. L. Burt|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not distinguish between sex-limited, sex-linked, and sex-influenced genes, but refers to any gene that expresses differently between sexes as sex-limited. While this concept was still in its infancy, Darwin catalyzed the further development of sex-related selection. [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], fully aware of this confusing terminology, published an article in ''The American Naturalist ''in 1914 titled "Sex-Linked and Sex-Limited Inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|title=Sex-Limited and Sex-Linked Inheritance|journal=The American Naturalist|date=October 1914|volume=48|issue=574|pages=577–583|doi=10.1086/279432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This article directly acknowledges that Darwin applied the term sex-limited whenever a characteristic seemed specific to one sex. Morgan proposes the definitions for sex-linked genes and sex-limited genes that we still use today (and that were defined in the introduction above). This paper helped to distinguish between these two similar concepts and clarify much confusion in the scientific community at the time. Morgan's paper was followed by several others involving sex-limited genes and their expression as traits. One of the more notable examples is John H. Gerould's "Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies," published in ''Genetics ''in 1923 (and edited slightly in 1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerould|first=John H.|title=Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies|journal=Genetics|date=November 1923|volume=8|issue=6|pages=495–551|pmid=17246025|pmc=1200764}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerould observed that in this species of butterfly, females naturally occur as yellow or white, while males only occur with yellow coloration. He extensively explores this apparently sex-limited trait from a genetic perspective in this ground-breaking 50 page paper. To conclude the notable advancements in the early stages of the development of sex-limited genes, a brief discussion of [[R. A. Fisher]] is necessary. Commonly hailed as one of the best evolutionary biologists of his time, Fisher was also a talented geneticist. His book ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'', published in 1930, over 20 years before the double-helix shape of DNA was discovered, was the first attempt to explain Darwin's theories within the foundation of [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=R. A.|title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection|year=1930|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 6 of this book is titled "Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection" and includes a genetic interpretation of Darwin's initial idea of sex-limited genes. After these groundbreaking works, papers continue to be published further exploring the causes, mechanisms, evolutionary advantages, and more of sex-limited genes.

== Genetics ==

Many studies have been published exploring the genetic basis of sex-limited genes. One paper, published in ''Evolution'', evaluates the hypothesis that sex-limited traits can arise in two ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Jerry|author2=Emily H. Kay |author3=Stephen Pruett-Jones |title=The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds|journal=Evolution|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|pages=214–219|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e0633a8f-63ff-4144-87f2-56e7da405b85%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=113|accessdate=14 October 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00254.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alleles]] responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are ''completely dominant'' in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of ''cis''-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the [[chromosome]]. (This is in contrast to ''trans''-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of [[Promoter regions (genetics)|promoter regions]], which can be either be suppressed or activated by [[hormones]]. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the ''very next ''generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels - the absence of [[estrogen]] or the presence of [[testosterone]].

== Fitness consequences ==

===Storage effect===
Because sex-limited genes are present in both sexes but only expressed in one, this allows the unexpressed genes to be hidden from selection. On a short-term scale, this means that during one generation, only the sex that expresses the sex-limited trait(s) of interest will be affected by selection. The remaining half of the gene pool for these traits will be unaffected by selection because they are hidden (unexpressed) in the genes of the other sex. Since a portion of the alleles for these sex-limited traits are hidden from selection, this occurrence has been termed 'storage-effect'. On a long-term scale, this storage effect can have significant effects on selection, especially if selection is fluctuating over a long period of time. It is inarguable that selection will fluctuate over time with varying levels of environmental stability. For example, fluctuations in population density can drive selection on sex-limited traits. In less dense populations, females will have less opportunity to choose between males for reproduction. In this case, attractive males may experience both reduced reproductive success and increased predation pressure. Thus, selection on males for sex-limited traits such as increased size (elephant seals) and weaponry (claws on fiddler crabs, horns on rhinoceros beetles) will change direction with fluctuation in population density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=K|title=Evolutionary Genetics Of Sex-Limited Traits Under Fluctuating Selection|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=897–902|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid evolution===
John Parsch and Hans Ellegren defined "genes that differ in expression between females and males" as sex-biased genes. While this definition is more broad, sex-limited genes are certainly included in this category. One of the key principles of sex-biased gene expression that Parsch and Ellegren stressed in their paper in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsch|first=J|author2=Ellegren, H |title=The Evolutionary Causes and Consequences of Sex-Biased Gene Expression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2013|volume=14|issue=2|pages=83–87|doi=10.1038/nrg3376|pmid=23329110}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that of rapid evolution. They assert that a gene's sex bias can vary among different types of tissues throughout the body or throughout development, making the level of sex bias a fluid, rather than static, property. This makes it possible, then, that the rapid evolution seen in sex-biased genes is not an inherent property of their sex bias, but a property of some other feature. The paper offers expression breadth, the number of tissue types in which the genes are expressed, as an example of a feature correlated to sex-biased genes. It is known that genes with limited expression (in only one type of tissue) generally evolve faster than those with a higher expression breadth, and sex-biased genes are often restricted in their expression, such as to only the testes or ovaries. Thus, it is likely that sex-biased (including sex-limited) genes will evolve faster than the average genetic information. Parsch and Ellegren also assert that "sex-biased genes expressed only in sex-limited reproductive tissues evolve faster than unbiased genes that are expressed only in a single, non-reproductive tissue." That is, genes that have a bias toward any kind of reproductive tissue (testes or ovaries) seem to show faster evolution than genes expressed in non-gonadal tissues, despite the number of tissues in which they are expressed. This makes sense in the context of genes with reproductive function evolving more quickly, a generally observed pattern in [[evolutionary biology]].

===Effects of sexual antagonism===
Sexual antagonism occurs when two species have conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction (see link in introduction paragraph). Multiple matings is a classic example of competing optimal strategies. Males, who typically have a much lower overall investment in reproduction, may benefit from more frequent matings. Females, however, invest much more in reproduction and can be endangered, harmed, or even killed by multiple matings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhardt|first=Klaus|author2=Richard Naylor |author3=Michael Siva-Jothy |title=Reducing a cost of traumatic insemination: female bedbugs evolve a unique organ.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|date=22 November 2003|volume=270|issue=1531|pages=2371–2375|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2515|pmid=14667353|pmc=1691512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hosken et al. completed an important study exploring the effects of [[sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic selection]] on sex-limited trait expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They asked if sex-specific trait selection always resolved intralocus conflict, as it was believed to do. By using a species of flour beetle, ''Gnatocerus cornutus'', exhibiting sex-limited traits in the form of exaggerated [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]] size, they were able to test this hypothesis. Exaggerated mandibles are ''only ''developed in males; females never develop exaggerated mandibles. The point of this experiment was to determine how mandibles affect fitness. If these sex-limited genes are truly quelling intralocus sexual conflict, male mandible size should have no effect on female fitness. After selecting for males with exaggerated mandibles (full materials and methods can be found within the paper), it was experimentally determined that males with exaggerated mandibles had a higher fitness - they experienced increased fighting and mating success. It was also found, however, that females found in the populations of males with exaggerated mandibles had lower fitness (as determined by lifetime reproductive success, LRS) relative to the fitness of females in populations with males with smaller mandibles. Since this male sex-limited trait affects female fitness, intralocus sexual conflict has ''not ''been resolved. This highlights the importance of sexual conflict to [[evolution]], because it cannot simply be defused by sex-limited trait expression.

Later the same year, a paper in ''Evolution ''also came to the same conclusions about sexual antagonism in relation to sex-limited genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connallon|first=Tim|author2=Robert M. Cox |author3=Ryan Calsbeek |title=Fitness Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection|journal=Evolution|year=2010|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1671–1682|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x|pmid=20050912}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a mathematical model to show that the fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when sex-limited gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.

=== Effects on animal behavior  ===
Animal behavior (see [[ethology]]) encompasses so many disciplines that it is impossible not to see it in some capacity in almost all primary literature involving live animals. While the examples above certainly contain aspects of animal behavior, a more overt example of it in relation to sex-limited traits is detailed in a Teplitsky et al. paper (2010) centering on breeding time in red-billed gulls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teplitsky|first=C|author2=JA Mills |author3=JW Yarrall |author4=J Merila |title=Indirect genetic effects in a sex-limited trait: the case of breeding time in red-billed gulls|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|volume=23|issue=5|pages=935–944|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01959.x|pmid=20345824}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment deals with breeding time, an aspect of reproductive biology. Reproduction and sexual behavior are two key aspects of animal behavior, as they are universally expressed in some way throughout the animal kingdom.

Breeding time in red-billed gulls  is expressed only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female breeding performance substantially. This qualifies breeding time as a sex-limited trait because it is expressed only in one sex but can be affected by both (similarly to Hosken's beetle experiment above). By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because sex-limited traits are almost always heritable within the sex in which they are expressed.

For this species, the timing of egg-laying has much to do with male behavior. Males can affect female reproductive success so strongly because for the 20 days up to egg-laying, females spend up to 80% of their time in the nest. This leaves males with the responsibility of providing food regularly and securing (and maintaining) a high-quality territory for nesting. This phenomenon of the genetics of one individual affecting those of another individual is known as ''indirect genetic effects''. For this population, at least, possible explanations for this atypical heritability pattern exist. While controlling female health and safety, males are responsible for the timing of the start of courtship feeding, as well. These populations also typically have excesses of females, allowing males to exert even further choice in the form of mate choice. These factors in combination give males a great opportunity to express their "laying date genotype". In spite of the presence of directional selection and significant male heritability for breeding time, no advancement of breeding time was seen during the 46 years of this experiment. This does not discount the significance of the paper's other results however - one of the most significant being that here a "female trait (laying date) is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Epigenetics==
[[Epigenetics]] is the inheritance of additional marks to the genome without changes in its sequence. These factors epigenetic factors may also be sex-limited. [[Genomic imprinting]] for example, silencing of one parental allele by [[DNA methylation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reik|first1=Wolf|last2=Walter|first2=Jörn|title=Genomic imprinting: parental influence on the genome|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21–32|doi=10.1038/35047554|pmid=11253064}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which sex-limited imprinting has been proposed to resolve [[Intralocus sexual conflict|intralocus conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=T.|last2=Bonduriansky|first2=R.|title=Intralocus Sexual Conflict Can Drive the Evolution of Genomic Imprinting|journal=Genetics|date=1 August 2004|volume=167|issue=4|pages=1537–1546|doi=10.1534/genetics.103.026211|pmid=15342496|pmc=1470977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic imprinting has been shown to be indistinguishable from non-imprinted systems at the [[Population genetics|population]] level in some cases, having equivalent evolutionary models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=Gavin P.|last2=Spencer|first2=Hamish G.|title=Population genetic models of genomic imprinting.|journal=Genetics|date=April 1992|volume=130|issue=4|pages=899–907|pmid=1582564|pmc=1204938}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not hold for sex-limited models of sex-limited imprinting which behave differently depending on which sex imprinting occurs and the parental sex of imprinted allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=S. Thomas|last2=Spencer|first2=Hamish G.|title=Population-genetic models of sex-limited genomic imprinting|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=115|date=April 2017|pages=35-44|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2017.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, this affects whether alleles are imprinted in consecutive generations with different evolutionary trajectories (under the same selection fitnesses) arising purely due to sex-limited epigenetics. Thus sex-limited epigenetic traits may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of mammals and other species, particularly as a mechanism to ameliorate intralocus conflict between the sexes.

==Conclusions==
Overall, sex-limited genes carry with them several complex cost to benefit ratios which call for further analysis. For example, while they allow for greater opportunities of sexual dimorphism so both sexes can reach much closer to their optimal phenotypes, they also incur fitness costs on sexually reproducing species. Since Charles Darwin's revolutionary book was published in 1871, there have been many studies done on the nature of these genes. The scientific literature dealing with the concepts of sexual dimorphism and sex-limited genes extends far past what has been listed here. The genetic and mechanistic details of these genes are still being discovered through ongoing research today. It is becoming apparent that a deeper understanding sex-limited genes will be increasingly important as the fields of evolutionary biology and genetics advance.

[[Image:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|Henri Tajfel suggests that soldiers of opposing armies, fighting outside of view, is an illustrative example of behaviour at the extreme intergroup end of the intergroup-interpersonal continuum.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1978)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1978 | title = Interindividual and intergroup behaviour | journal = Differentiation between groups: Studies in the social psychology of intergroup relations | pages = 27–60 | location = London | publisher = Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===The interpersonal-intergroup continuum===
Social identity theory states that social behavior will vary along a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] between [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] behavior and intergroup behaviour. Completely interpersonal behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the individual characteristics and interpersonal relationships that exists between only two people. Completely intergroup behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the social category memberships that apply to more than two people.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;

The authors of social identity theory state that purely interpersonal or purely intergroup behaviour is unlikely to be found in realistic social situations. Rather, behaviour is expected to be driven by a compromise between the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1978)"/&gt; The [[Cognition|cognitive]] nature of personal vs. social identities, and the relationship between them, is more fully developed in self-categorization theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes et al.

S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;

===Positive distinctiveness===
A key assumption in social identity theory is that individuals are intrinsically [[motivation|motivated]] to achieve positive distinctiveness. That is, individuals "strive for a positive self-concept".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; As individuals to varying degrees may be defined and informed by their respective social identities (as per the interpersonal-intergroup continuum) it is further derived in social identity theory that "individuals strive to achieve or to maintain positive social identity".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt; It should be noted that the precise nature of this strive for positive self-concept is a matter of debate (see [[Social identity theory#The self-esteem hypothesis|the self-esteem hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Long &amp; Spears (1997)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | last3 = Jetten | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Low status groups show in-group favoritism to compensate for their low status and to compete for higher status | url = | journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 563–576 | doi = 10.1177/1368430213514122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the interpersonal-intergroup continuum and the assumption of positive distinctiveness motivation arose as outcomes of the findings of [[minimal group paradigm|minimal group studies]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010)."/&gt; In particular, it was found that under certain conditions individuals would endorse resource distributions that would maximize the positive distinctiveness of an ingroup in contrast to an outgroup at the expense of personal self-interest.&lt;ref name="Turner (1978)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Turner|first1= J.

===Positive distinctiveness strategies===
Building on the above components, social identity theory details a variety of strategies that may be invoked in order to achieve positive distinctiveness. The individual's choice of behaviour is posited to be dictated largely by the perceived intergroup relationship. In particular the choice of strategy is an outcome of the perceived permeability of group boundaries (e.g., whether a group member may pass from a low status group into a high status group), as well as the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; The self-enhancing strategies detailed in social identity theory are detailed below. Importantly, although these are viewed from the perspective of a low status group member, comparable behaviours may also be adopted by high status group members.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;

====Individual mobility====
It is predicted that under conditions where the group boundaries are considered permeable individuals are more likely to engage in [[Social mobility|individual mobility]] strategies.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; That is, individuals "disassociate from the group and pursue individual goals designed to improve their personal lot rather than that of their ingroup".&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p. 38."&gt;Haslam, A. S. (2001). Psychology in Organizations. London, SAGE Publications. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social creativity====
Where group boundaries are considered impermeable, and where status relations are considered reasonably stable, individuals are predicted to engage in social creativity behaviours. Here, low-status ingroup members are still able to increase their positive distinctiveness without necessarily changing the objective resources of the ingroup or the outgroup. This may be achieved by comparing the ingroup to the outgroup on some new dimension, changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, and choosing an alternative outgroup by which to compare the ingroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;

====Social competition====
Here an ingroup seeks positive distinctiveness via direct competition with the outgroup in the form of [[Social identity theory#Ingroup favoritism|ingroup favoritism]]. It is considered competitive in that in this case favoritism for the ingroup occurs on a value dimension that is shared by all relevant social groups (in contrast to social creativity scenarios). Social competition is predicted to occur when group boundaries are considered impermeable, and when status relations are considered to be reasonably unstable.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; Although not privileged in the theory, it is this positive distinctiveness strategy that has received the greatest amount of attention.&lt;ref name="Ouwerkerk et al.

===Historical background===
The term 'social identity theory' achieved academic currency only in the late 1970s, but the basic underlying concepts associated with it had emerged by the early twentieth century.  [[William G. Sumner]], writing in 1906, captures the primary dynamics in this excerpt from his influential work ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals'':   

:"Loyalty to the group, sacrifice for it, hatred and contempt for outsiders, brotherhood within, warlikeness without,—all grow together, common products of the same situation. [...] Men of an others-group are outsiders with whose ancestors the ancestors of the we-group waged war. [...]  Each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exalts its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders. Each group thinks its own folkways the only right ones, and if it observes that other groups have other folkways, these excite its scorn." &lt;ref&gt;Sumner, W. G. ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. New York: Ginn, 1906. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1920s the [[Collectivism|collectivist]] perspective had all but disappeared from mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|author2=Williams, Kipling D. |title=From I to we: Social identity and the collective self|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice|date=1 January 2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=81–97|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty years later, around the time of the first formal use of the term 'social identity theory,' Tajfel wrote this on the state of social psychology:

:"Thus, social categorization is still conceived as a haphazardly floating '[[independent variable]]' which strikes at random as the spirit moves it. No links are made or attempted, between the conditions determining its presence and mode of operation, and its outcomes in widely diffused commonalities of social behaviour. Why, when and how is social categorisation salient or not salient? What kind of shared constructions of social reality, mediated through social categorization, lead to a social climate in which large masses of people feel they are in long-term conflict with other masses? What, for example, are the ''psychological'' transitions from a stable to an unstable social system?" (Original emphasis, p. 188)&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1979)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tajfel|first1= H.| year= 1979 |title= Individuals and groups in social psychology| journal= British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology| volume = 18| pages= 183–190 |doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00324.x |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, social identity theory in part reflects a desire to reestablish a more collectivist approach to social psychology of the self and social groups.&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"/&gt;

==Implications==

===Ingroup favoritism===
{{Main|In-group favoritism}}
In-group favoritism (also known as "ingroup bias", despite Turner's objections to the term&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;) is an effect where people give preferential treatment to others when they are perceived to be in the same ingroup. Social identity attributes the cause of ingroup favoritism to a psychological need for positive distinctiveness and describes the situations where ingroup favoritism is likely to occur (as a function of perceived group status, legitimacy, stability, and permeability).&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellemers | first1 = N. | last2 = Barreto | first2 = M. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S.

Continued study into the relationship between social categorization and ingroup favoritism has explored the relative prevalences of the ingroup favoritism vs. outgroup discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Ali M.|title=Group identity, social distance and intergroup bias|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|date=1 June 2007|volume=28|issue=3|pages=324–337|doi=10.1016/j.joep.2007.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored different manifestations of ingroup favoritism,&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumm |first= Angela J. |author2=Corning, Alexandra F. |title=Who Believes Us When We Try to Conceal Our Prejudices?

=== Reluctance to bet against identity-relevant outcomes ===
Social identities are a valued aspect of the self, and people will sacrifice their pecuniary self-interest to maintain the self-perception that they belong to a given social group. Political partisans and fans of sports teams (e.g., Republicans and Democrats, or MLB, NFL, NCAA fans) are reluctant to bet against the success of their party or team because of the diagnostic cost such a bet would incur to their identification with it. As a result, partisans and fans will reject even very favorable bets against identity-relevant desired outcomes. More than 45% of N.C.A.A. basketball and hockey fans, for example, turned down a free, real chance to earn $5 if their team lost its upcoming game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Tang|first2=Simone|last3=Larrick|first3=Richard P.|date=2016-10-12|title=Betting Your Favorite to Win: Costly Reluctance to Hedge Desired Outcomes|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|journal=Management Science|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|issn=0025-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Self-esteem hypothesis===
Social identity theory proposes that people are motivated to achieve and maintain positive concepts of themselves. Some researchers, including [[Michael Hogg]] and [[Dominic Abrams]], thus propose a fairly direct relationship between positive social identity and [[self-esteem]]. In what has become known as the "self-esteem hypothesis", self-esteem is predicted to relate to in-group bias in two ways. Firstly, successful intergroup discrimination elevates self-esteem. Secondly, depressed or threatened self-esteem promotes intergroup discrimination.&lt;ref name="Hogg &amp; Abrams (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = M.

Some social identity theorists, including John Turner, consider the self-esteem hypothesis as not canonical to social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Long &amp; Spears (1997)"/&gt; In fact, the self-esteem hypothesis is argued to be conflictual with the tenets of the theory.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | editor1-last = McGarty | editor1-first = C. | editor2-last = Haslam | editor2-first = S. A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The message of social psychology | pages = 355–373 | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis misunderstands the distinction between a social identity and a personal identity. Along those lines, John Turner and [[Penny Oakes]] argue against an interpretation of positive distinctiveness as a straightforward need for self-esteem or "quasi-biological drive toward prejudice".&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"/&gt; They instead favour a somewhat more complex conception of positive self-concept as a reflection of the ideologies and social values of the perceiver. Additionally, it is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis neglects the alternative strategies to maintaining a positive self-concept that are articulated in social identity theory (i.e., individual mobility and social creativity).&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"/&gt;

===Positive-negative asymmetry===
In what has been dubbed the Positive-Negative Asymmetry Phenomenon, researchers have shown that punishing the out-group benefits self-esteem less than rewarding the in-group.&lt;ref name="Bourhis &amp; Gagnon (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R. Y. | last2 = Gagnon | first2 = A. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S. L. | editor2-last = Gaertner | year = 2001 | title = Social Orientations in the Minimal Group Paradigm | journal = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup processes | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 133–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this finding it has been extrapolated that social identity theory is therefore unable to deal with bias on negative dimensions. Social identity theorists, however, point out that for ingroup favouritism to occur a social identity "must be psychologically salient", and that negative dimensions may be experienced as a "less fitting basis for self-definition".&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010). p142"&gt;Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010). The story of social identity. In T. Postmes &amp; N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; This important qualification is subtly present in social identity theory, but is further developed in self-categorization theory. Empirical support for this perspective exist. It has been shown that when experiment participants can self-select negative dimensions that define the ingroup no positive–negative asymmetry is found.&lt;ref name="Reynolds et al. (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Turner | first2 = J. C. |  last3 = Haslam | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Ryan | first4 = M.

===Intergroup similarity===
It has been posited that social identity theory suggests that similar groups should have an increased motivation to differentiate themselves from each other.&lt;ref name="brown2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown (1984)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R.

===Predictive power===
Social identity theory has been criticised for having far greater [[explanatory power]] than [[predictive power]].&lt;ref name="Miller (1983)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt (1992)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duckitt|first=John|title=The social psychology of prejudice|year=1992|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=London|pages=84–90|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, while the relationship between independent variables and the resulting intergroup behaviour may be consistent with the theory in retrospect, that particular outcome is often not that which was predicted at the outset. A rebuttal to this charge is that the theory was never advertised as the definitive answer to understanding intergroup relationships. Instead it is stated that social identity theory must go hand in hand with sufficient understanding of the specific social context under consideration.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1984)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1984 | title = Intergroup relations, social myths and social justice in social psychology | journal = The social dimension | volume = 2 | pages = 695–715 | location = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511759154.016 | isbn = 9780511759154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter argument is consistent with the explicit importance that the authors of social identity theory placed on the role of "objective" factors, stating that in any particular situation "the effects of [social identity theory] variables are powerfully determined by the previous social, economic, and political processes".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;

[[Christopher Strachey]] wrote a combinatory '''love letter algorithm''' for the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer in 1952. The poems it generated have been seen as the first piece of [[digital literature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wardrip-Fruin|first1=Noah|title=Christopher Strachey: The first digital artist?|url=https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/01/christopher-strachey-first-digital-artist/|website=Grand Text Auto|publisher=School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=1 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a queer critique of heteronormative expressions of love.&lt;ref name="queer-history"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaboury|first1=Jacob|title=[Christopher Strachey]|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/apr/9/queer-history-computing-part-three/|website=A Queer History of Computing|publisher=Rhizome|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==

Rather than modeling writing as a creative process, the love letter algorithm represents the writing of love letters as formulaic and ''without'' creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|first2=Natalia|last2=Fedorova|conference=International Conference on Computational Creativity|title=Small-Scale Systems and Computational Creativity|date=2012|url=http://nickm.com/if/montfort_fedorova__iccc_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The algorithm has the following structure:

# Print two words taken from a list of salutations
# Do the following 5 times:
## Choose one of two sentence structures depending on a random value Rand
## Fill the sentence structure from lists of adjectives, adverbs, substantives, and verbs.
# Print the letter's closing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Link|first1=David|title=There Must Be an Angel: On the Beginnings of the Arithmetics of Rays|url=http://www.alpha60.de/research/there_must_be_an_angel/DavidLink_MustBeAnAngel_2006.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2016|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lists of words were compiled by Strachey from a [[Roget's Thesaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Sample|first1=Mark|title=An Account of Randomness in Literary Computing|url=http://de.hypotheses.org/72951|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=2013|conference=Modern Language Association Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the list of words included several variations on the word ''love'', none of these variations made it into any of the widely circulated letters generated by Strachey's procedure.&lt;ref name="queer-history" /&gt;

A '''system''' is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.&lt;ref name=merriam-webster-system&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Definition of ''system''
 | website = Merriam-Webster
 | location = Springfield, MA, USA
 | accessdate = 2016-10-09
 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/system
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in  its functioning.

==Etymology==
The term "system" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''systēma'', in turn from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σύστημα}} ''systēma'': "whole concept made of several parts or members, system", literary "composition".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsu%2Fsthma "σύστημα"], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'', on Perseus Digital Library.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to [[Marshall McLuhan]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"System" means "something to look at". You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. But in philosophy, prior to Descartes, there was no "system". Plato had no "system". Aristotle had no "system".&lt;ref name ="Marshall1967"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], who studied [[thermodynamics]], pioneered the development of the concept of a "system" in the [[natural science]]s. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the ''working substance'' (typically a body of water vapor) in [[steam engine]]s, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (to which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] generalized this picture to include the concept of the [[environment (systems)|surroundings]] and began to use the term "working body" when referring to the system.

The biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901–1972) became one of the pioneers of the [[Systems theory|general systems theory]]. In 1945 he introduced ''models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relation or 'forces' between them.''&lt;ref name="Bertalanfy1945"&gt;1945, ''Zu einer allgemeinen Systemlehre,'' Blätter für deutsche Philosophie, 3/4. (Extract in: Biologia Generalis, 19 (1949), 139–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Wiener]] (1894–1964) and [[William Ross Ashby|Ross Ashby]] (1903–1972), who pioneered the use of mathematics to study systems, carried out significant development in the concept of a ''system''.&lt;ref name="Wiener1948"&gt;
1948, ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.'' Paris, France: Librairie Hermann &amp; Cie, and Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashby1950"&gt;
1956. ''[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASHBBOOK.html An Introduction to Cybernetics]'', Chapman &amp; Hall.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Henry Holland]] (1929–2015), [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1929–) and others coined the term "[[complex adaptive system]]" at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]].

==Concepts==
;Environment and boundaries
:[[Systems theory]] views the world as a complex system of interconnected parts. One scopes a system by defining its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]; this means choosing which entities are inside the system and which are outside—part of the [[environment (systems)|environment]]. One can make simplified representations ([[Scientific modelling|models]]) of the system in order to understand it and to predict or impact its future behavior. These models may define the [[structure]] and [[behavior]] of the system.

;Natural and human-made systems
:There are natural and human-made (designed) systems. Natural systems may not have an apparent objective but their behavior can be interpreted{{by whom?|date=April 2016}} as purposeful by an observer. Human-made systems are made to satisfy an identified and stated need with purposes that are achieved by the delivery of wanted outputs. Their parts must be related; they must be "designed to work as a coherent entity"—otherwise they would be two or more distinct systems.

[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|''Open systems'' have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.]]
;Theoretical framework
:Most systems are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]], exchanging matter and energy with its surroundings; like a car, a [[coffeemaker]], or [[Earth]]. A [[closed system]] exchanges energy, but not matter, with its environment; like a computer or the project [[Biosphere 2]]. An [[isolated system]] exchanges neither matter nor energy with its environment. A theoretical example of such system is the [[Universe]].

;Process and transformation process
:An [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] can also be viewed as a bounded transformation process, that is, a [[black box]] that is a process or collection of processes that transforms inputs into outputs.{{cn|date=April 2016}} Inputs are consumed; outputs are produced. The concept of input and output here is very broad. For example, an output of a passenger ship is the movement of people from departure to destination.

;System model
:A system comprises [[view model|multiple views]]. Man-made systems may have such views as [[concept]], [[systems analysis|analysis]], [[Systems design|design]], [[implementation]], deployment, structure, behavior, input data, and output data views. A [[system model]] is required to describe and represent all these views.

;Systems architecture
:A [[systems architecture]], using one single integrated model for the description of [[view model|multiple views]], is a kind of [[system model]].

===Subsystem===
A ''subsystem'' is a set of elements, which is a system itself, and a component of a larger system.

A subsystem description is a system object that contains information defining the characteristics of an operating environment controlled by the system.&lt;ref&gt;IBM's definition @ http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_i5_54/rzaks/rzakssbsd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Evidently, there are many kinds of systems that can be analyzed both [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitatively]]. For example, in an analysis of urban [[System dynamics|systems dynamics]], A .W. Steiss&lt;ref&gt;Steiss, 1967, pp. 8–18.&lt;/ref&gt; defined five intersecting systems, including the physical subsystem and behavioral system. For sociological models influenced by systems theory, where [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; defined systems in terms of [[conceptual system|conceptual]], [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], and abstract systems, either [[Isolated system|isolated]], [[Closed system|closed]], or [[Open system (systems theory)|open]]. [[Walter F. Buckley]]&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; defined systems in sociology in terms of [[Mechanics|mechanical]], [[organic (model)|organic]], and [[process modeling|process]] models. [[Bela H. Banathy]]&lt;ref&gt;Banathy, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; cautioned that for any inquiry into a system understanding its kind is crucial, and defined "natural" and "designed", i. e. artificial, systems.

Artificial systems inherently have a major defect: they must be premised on one or more fundamental assumptions upon which additional knowledge is built. These fundamental assumptions are not inherently deleterious, but they must by definition be assumed as true, and if they are actually false then the system is not as structurally integral as is assumed. For example, in [[geometry]] this is very evident in the postulation of [[theorem|theorems]] and extrapolation of proofs from them.

It is important not to confuse these abstract definitions. Theorists include in natural systems subatomic systems, [[living systems theory|living systems]], the [[solar system]], [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and the [[Universe]]. Artificial systems include our physical structures, hybrids of natural and artificial systems, and conceptual knowledge. The human elements of organization and functions are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations. A cardinal consideration in making distinctions among systems is to determine how much freedom the system has to select its purpose, goals, methods, tools, etc. and how wide is the freedom to select itself as distributed or concentrated.

[[George J. Klir]]&lt;ref&gt;Klir, 1969, pp. 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that no "classification is complete and perfect for all purposes", and defined systems as abstract, [[The Real|real]], and [[conceptual system|conceptual]] [[physical systems]], bounded and [[unbounded system]]s, discrete to continuous, pulse to [[hybrid system]]s, etc. The interactions between systems and their environments are categorized as relatively closed and [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]]. It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by man. Important distinctions have also been made&lt;ref&gt;Checkland, 1997; Flood, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; between ''hard'' systems – technical in nature and amenable to methods such as [[systems engineering]], operations research, and quantitative systems analysis – and ''soft'' systems that involve people and organisations, commonly associated with concepts developed by [[Peter Checkland]] and [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]] through [[Soft systems methodology|Soft Systems Methodology]] (SSM) involving methods such as [[action research]] and emphasis of participatory designs. Where hard systems might be identified as more "scientific", the distinction between them is often elusive.

===Cultural system===
A cultural system may be defined as the interaction of different elements of [[culture]]. While a cultural system is quite different from a [[social system]], sometimes both together are referred to as a "sociocultural system". A major concern of the social sciences is the [[Social order|problem of order]].

===Economic system===
{{Main article|Economic system}}
An economic system is a mechanism ([[social institution]]) which deals with the [[Economic production|production]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] in a particular [[society]]. The economic system is composed of [[person|people]], [[institutions]] and their relationships to resources, such as the [[Convention (norm)|convention]] of [[property]]. It addresses the problems of [[economics]], like the allocation and scarcity of resources.

The international sphere of interacting states is described and analysed in systems terms by several international relations scholars, most notably in the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist school.]] This systems mode of international analysis has however been challenged by other schools of international relations thought, most notably the [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist school]], which argues that an over-large focus on systems and structures can obscure the role of individual agency in social interactions. Systems-based models of international relations also underlies the vision of the international sphere held by the [[Institutional liberalism|liberal institutionalist]] school of thought, which places more emphasis on systems generated by rules and interaction governance, particularly economic governance.

==Application of the system concept==
Systems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences. The system is the representation of the entities under concern. Hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent on the intention of the modeler.

No model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern, and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern.

===In information and computer science===
In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], '''system''' is a [[software system]] which has [[Component (UML)|components]] as its structure and observable [[inter-process communication]]s as its behavior. Again, an example will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with [[Roman numerals]], and various systems for filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together (in this case to facilitate the flow of information).

System can also refer to a framework, aka [[platform (computing)|platform]], be it software or hardware, designed to allow software programs to run.

===In engineering and physics===
In [[engineering]] and [[physics]], a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied (of which a [[thermodynamic system]] is one major example). Engineering also has the concept of a system referring to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project. [[Systems engineering]] is the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned, designed, implemented, built, and maintained.

===In social and cognitive sciences and management research===
Social and [[Cognitive science|cognitive sciences]] recognize systems in human person models and in human societies. They include human brain functions and mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and social/cultural behavioral patterns.

In [[management science]], [[operations research]] and [[organizational development]] (OD), human organizations are viewed as '''systems''' (conceptual systems) of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates, which are carriers of numerous complex [[business processes]] ([[organizational behavior]]s) and organizational structures. Organizational development theorist [[Peter Senge]] developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book ''The Fifth Discipline''.

[[Systems thinking]] is a style of thinking/[[reasoning]] and problem solving. It starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem. It can be a leadership competency. Some people can ''think globally while acting locally''. Such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems. This is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology.

[[Organizational studies|Organizational theorists]] such as [[Margaret Wheatley]] have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts, such as [[quantum physics]], [[chaos theory]], and the [[self-organizing systems|self-organization of systems]].

===Pure logical systems===

There is also such a thing as a logical system. The most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by [[Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Another example is [[George Boole]]'s Boolean operators. Other examples have related specifically to philosophy, biology, or cognitive science. [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] applies psychology to biology by using pure logic. Numerous psychologists, including [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains, such as personalities, motivations, or intellect and desire. Often these domains consist of general categories following a [[corollary]] such as a [[theorem]]. Logic has been applied to categories such as [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[ontology]], [[educational assessment|assessment]], and [[hierarchies]].

===Applied to strategic thinking===
In 1988, military strategist, [[John A. Warden III]] introduced the [[Warden's Five Rings|Five Ring System]] model in his book, ''The Air Campaign'', contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings. Each ring—Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units—could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warden |first=John A.

'''''The Myth of Sisyphus''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Mythe de Sisyphe}}) is a 1942 philosophical essay by [[Albert Camus]]. The English translation by Justin O'Brien was first published in 1955.

In the essay Camus introduces his philosophy of the [[absurdism|absurd]], man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers, "No. It requires revolt." He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of [[Sisyphus]], a figure of [[Greek mythology]] who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes, "The struggle itself ... is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy".

The work can be seen in relation to other absurdist works by Camus: the novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942), the plays  ''[[The Misunderstanding]]'' (1942) and ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' (1944), and especially the essay ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' (1951).

==Summary==
The essay is dedicated to [[Pascal Pia]] and is organized in four chapters and one appendix.

===Chapter 1: An Absurd Reasoning===
Camus undertakes the task of answering what he considers to be the only question of [[philosophy]] that matters: Does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide?

He begins by describing the absurd condition: we build our life on the hope for tomorrow, yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy; people live their lives as if they weren't aware of the certainty of death. Once stripped of its common romanticism, the world is a foreign, strange and inhuman place; true knowledge is impossible and rationality and science cannot explain the world: their stories ultimately end in meaningless abstractions, in metaphors. This is the absurd condition and "from the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all."

It is not the world that is absurd, nor human thought: the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world, when "my appetite for the absolute and for unity" meets "the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle."

He then characterizes a number of philosophies that describe and attempt to deal with this feeling of the absurd, by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]], [[Lev Shestov|Shestov]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. All of these, he claims, commit "philosophical suicide" by reaching conclusions that contradict the original absurd position, either by abandoning reason and turning to God, as in the case of Kierkegaard and Shestov, or by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous [[Theory of forms|Platonic forms]] and an abstract god, as in the case of Husserl.

For Camus, who set out to take the absurd seriously and follow it to its final conclusions, these "leaps" cannot convince. Taking the absurd seriously means acknowledging the contradiction between the desire of human reason and the unreasonable world. Suicide, then, also must be rejected: without man, the absurd cannot exist. The contradiction must be lived; reason and its limits must be acknowledged, without false hope. However, the absurd can never be accepted: it requires constant confrontation, constant revolt.

While the question of human [[free will|freedom in the metaphysical sense]] loses interest to the absurd man, he gains freedom in a very concrete sense: no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity, without a need to pursue life's purpose or to create meaning, "he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules".

To embrace the absurd implies embracing all that the unreasonable world has to offer. Without a meaning in life, there is no scale of values. "What counts is not the best living but the most living."

Thus, Camus arrives at three consequences from fully acknowledging the absurd: revolt, freedom, and passion.

===Chapter 2: The Absurd Man===
How should the absurd man live? Clearly, no ethical rules apply, as they are all based on higher powers or on justification. "Integrity has no need of rules." 'Everything is permitted' "is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact."

Camus then goes on to present examples of the absurd life. He begins with [[Don Juan]], the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest. "There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional."

The next example is the [[actor]], who depicts ephemeral lives for ephemeral fame. "He demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being." "In those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead-end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover."

Camus's third example of the absurd man is the conqueror, the warrior who forgoes all promises of eternity to affect and engage fully in human history. He chooses action over contemplation, aware of the fact that nothing can last and no victory is final.

===Chapter 3: Absurd Creation===
Here Camus explores the absurd creator or artist.  Since explanation is impossible, absurd art is restricted to a description of the myriad experiences in the world. "If the world were clear, art would not exist." Absurd creation, of course, also must refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of hope.

He then analyzes the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] in this light, especially ''[[The Diary of a Writer]]'',  ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'' and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. All these works start from the absurd position, and the first two explore the theme of philosophical suicide. However, both ''The Diary'' and his last novel, ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ultimately find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as truly absurd creations.

===Chapter 4: The Myth of Sisyphus===
In the last chapter, Camus outlines the legend of Sisyphus who defied the gods and put Death in chains so that no human needed to die. When Death was eventually liberated and it came time for Sisyphus himself to die, he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld. After finally capturing Sisyphus, the gods decided that his punishment would last for all eternity. He would have to push a rock up a mountain; upon reaching the top, the rock would roll down again, leaving Sisyphus to start over. Camus sees Sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest, hates death, and is condemned to a meaningless task.

Camus presents Sisyphus's ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices. "The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious."

Camus is interested in Sisyphus' thoughts when marching down the mountain, to start anew. After the stone falls back down the mountain Camus states that "It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end." This is the truly tragic moment, when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition. He does not have hope, but "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Acknowledging the truth will conquer it; Sisyphus, just like the absurd man, keeps pushing. Camus claims that when Sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate, he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance.  With a nod to the similarly cursed Greek hero [[Oedipus]], Camus concludes that "all is well," indeed, that "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

===Appendix===
The essay contains an appendix titled "Hope and the Absurd in the work of [[Franz Kafka]]". While Camus acknowledges that Kafka's work represents an exquisite description of the absurd condition, he maintains that Kafka fails as an absurd writer because his work retains a glimmer of hope.

'''Threatcasting''' is a conceptual framework used to help multidisciplinary groups envision future scenarios. It is also a process that enables systematic planning against threats ten years in the future. Utilizing the threatcasting process, groups explore possible future threats and how to transform the future they desire into reality while avoiding undesired futures. Threatcasting is a continuous, multiple-step process with inputs from social science, technical research, cultural history, economics, trends, expert interviews, and science fiction storytelling. These inputs inform the exploration of potential visions of the future.

Once inputs are explored for impact and application, participants create a science fiction story ([[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]]) based ten years in the future to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about a person in a place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working toward the ten year future scenario. These actions will help participants understand how to empower or disrupt the target future scenario. Flags (warning events) are also determined in order to map societal indicators onto the recommended path toward the targeted future. When identified flags appear in society, threatcasting participants map these back to the original forecast to see whether or not they are on track toward the target future scenario.

== Origins ==
{{see also|Science fiction prototyping}}

The notion of threatcasting can be traced back to Brian David Johnson, an applied futurist, who first began using threatcasting, also referred to as futurecasting, in 2011 and to George Hemingway of the Stratalis Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/MMStratalisFuturecasting1.pdf|title=Futurecasting the Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=January 2013|website=Stratalis Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who pioneered notion of futurecasting for corporate strategy and innovation industrial markets, including mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/futurecasting-the-power-of-foresight/|title=The Stratalis Group {{!}}   Futurecasting: The Power of Foresight – The Final in a Six Part Series|website=www.stratalisgroup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. Early adopters of threatcasting include the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Government of California]], and the Army Cyber Institute at [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]]. Official use of the term threatcasting is attributed to Brian David Johnson in a 2014 Gazette article “Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/drones-smart-hydrants-considered-by-experts-looking-at-future-of-firefighting/article/1515148|title=Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between Threatcasting and Strategic Planning ==
Threatcasting is fundamentally different from traditional [[strategic planning]] and [[Scenario analysis|scenario building]] processes due to the identification of specific actions, indicators and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate and recover from future threats.

== Applications ==
The Army Cyber Institute at West Point in conjunction with [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Arizona State University's]] Global Securities Initiative and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society have established a Threatcasting Lab to host and manage a Cyber Threatcasting Project which looks to envision future cyber threats ten years in the future. The first session of this collaborative group was held at West Point, NY in August 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">[[File:Upper Ten Thousand, 1845.jpg|thumb|A reprint of the paragraph in which [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] coined the term, 1845]]
'''Upper Ten Thousand''', or simply, ''The Upper Ten'', is a 19th-century phrase referring to wealthiest 10,000 residents of [[New York City]]. The phrase was coined in 1844 by American poet and author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Irving Lewis. ''The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993: 222. {{ISBN|0-19-507591-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the term came to be used to describe the upper circles not only of New York, but also those of other major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bartlett|first=John Russell|year=1859|title=Dictionary of Americanisms, 2nd ed. enlarged|place=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usages==
In 1852, [[Charles Astor Bristed]] published a collection of sketches on New York Society entitled "The Upper Ten Thousand" in ''Fraser Magazine''. In 1854, [[George Lippard]] serialized his book ''New York: Its Upper Ten and Lower Million''. The phrase also appeared in British fiction in ''[[The Adventures of Philip]]'' (1861–62) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]], whose eponymous hero contributed weekly to a fashionable New York journal entitled “The Gazette of the Upper Ten Thousand”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tillotson|first=Geoffrey|year=1995|title=William Thackeray: The Critical Heritage|place=New York|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The general acceptance of the term seems to be attested by its use in the title of Edward Abbott's 1864 cookery book, ''[[The English and Australian Cookery Book]]: Cookery for the Many as Well as the 'Upper Ten Thousand'''.

In 1875, both Adam Bissett Thom and Kelly's Directory published books entitled ''The Upper Ten Thousand'', which listed members of the aristocracy, the gentry, officers in the British Army and Navy, members of Parliament, Colonial administrators, and members of the [[Church of England]]. The usage of this term was a response to the broadening of the British [[ruling class]] which had been caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Most of the people listed in ''Kelly's Handbook to the Upper Ten Thousand'' were among the 30,000 descendants of [[Edward III, King of England]], tabulated in the [[Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval]]'s ''Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal''.&lt;ref&gt;London: T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Most also appeared in Walford's ''[[Walford's County Families|County Families]]'' and Burke's ''[[landed gentry#Burke's Landed Gentry|Landed Gentry]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13641">'''Workplace deviance''', in [[group psychology]], may be described as the deliberate (or intentional) desire to cause harm to an organization – more specifically, a workplace. The concept has become an instrumental component in the field of [[organizational communication]]. More accurately, it can be seen as "voluntary behavior that violates institutionalized [[Norm (social)|norms]] and in doing so threatens the well-being of the organization".&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin and O'Leary-Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

=== Psychological contract ===
{{Main|Psychological contract}}
Employees often create a set of expectations about their workplace; people tend to make psychological contracts with their organizations. When his or her expectations are not met, the employee may "perceive a psychological contract breach by their employers".&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;Chiu and Peng&lt;/ref&gt; This "breach" of the psychological contract then presents potential problems, particularly in the workplace.

Workplace deviance may arise from the worker's perception that their organization has mistreated him or her in some manner. Employees then resort to misbehaving (or acting out) as a means of avenging their organization for the perceived wrongdoing. Workplace deviance may be viewed as a form of negative reciprocity. "A negative reciprocity orientation is the tendency for an individual to return negative treatment for negative treatment".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell and Ambrose&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the maxim "an eye for an eye" is a concept that some employees strongly feel is a suitable approach to their problem. However, what is critical in understanding employee deviance is that the employee perceives being wronged, whether or not mistreatment actually occurred.

=== Abusive supervision ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Workplace deviance is also closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;Bolin and Heatherly&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;Benner and Robinson&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves. The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Types==
Workplace deviance may be expressed in various ways. Employees can engage in minor, extreme, nonviolent or violent behavior, which ultimately leads to an organization's decline in productivity. Interpersonal and organizational deviance are two forms of workplace deviance which are directed differently; however, both cause harm to an organization.

=== Interpersonal deviance ===
Interpersonal deviance can occur when misconduct "target(s) specific stakeholders such as coworkers".&lt;ref name="Pulich"&gt;Pulich and Tourigny&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior falling within this subgroup of employee deviance includes gossiping about coworkers and assigning blame to them. These minor (but unhealthy) behaviors, directed at others, are believed to occur as some employees perceive "a sense of entitlement often associated with exploitation".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; In other words, they feel the need to misbehave in ways that will benefit them.

=== Organizational deviance ===
Deviant behavior typically aimed directly at the organization is often referred to as organizational deviance.&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; Organizational deviance encompasses production and property deviance. Workplace-deviant behavior may be expressed as tardiness or excessive absenteeism.&lt;ref name="Everton"&gt;Everton et al&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors have been cited by some researchers as "withdraw(al) behaviors…such behaviors allow employees to withdraw physically and emotionally from the organization".&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Silence ===
{{Main|Employee silence}}
Employee silence is also considered a deviant behavior in the workplace, falling into the realms of both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Silence becomes employee deviance when "an employee intentionally or unintentionally withholds any kind of information that might be useful to the organization".&lt;ref&gt;Tangirala and Ramanujam&lt;/ref&gt; The problem occurs if an employee fails to disclose important information, which detrimentally affects the effectiveness of the organization due to poor communication.

=== Coworker backstabbing ===
{{See also|Office politics}}
Coworker [[backstabbing]] occurs to some degree in many workplaces. It consists of an employee's doing something to another employee to get a "leg up" on the other employee. Strategies used for backstabbing include [[dishonesty]], [[blame]] (or [[false accusation]]), [[discrediting]] others and taking credit for another's work. Motives for backstabbing include disregarding others' rights in favor of one's own gain, [[self-image]] management, [[revenge]], [[jealousy]], and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Malone&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber loafing ===
{{Main|Cyber loafing}}
A novel form of workplace deviance has emerged in recent years, as technology becomes a bigger part of people's work lives. Internet workplace deviance (or "cyber loafing") has become another way for employees to avoid the tasks at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Zoghbi&lt;/ref&gt; This includes surfing the web and doing non-work-related tasks on the internet such as chatting on social-networking sites, online shopping and other activities.

=== Production deviance ===
All behaviors in which deviant employees partake ultimately have a negative impact on the overall productivity of the organization. For this reason, all are considered production deviance. Production deviance is "behavior that violates formally prescribed organizational norms with respect to minimal quality and quantity of work to be accomplished as part of one's job".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt;

=== Property deviance ===
More serious cases of deviant behavior harmful to an organization concern property deviance. Property deviance is "where employees either damage or acquire tangible assets…without authorization".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; This type of deviance typically involves theft but may include "sabotage, intentional errors in work, misusing expense accounts", among other examples.&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Other types ===
Deviant behavior can be much more extreme, involving [[sexual harassment]] and even [[workplace violence|violence]]. All these deviant behaviors create problems for the organization. It is costly for an organization to pay employees who are not working efficiently.

==Reducing==

The relationships employees have with their organization are crucial, as they can play an important role in the development of workplace deviance. Employees who perceive their organization or supervisor(s) as more caring (or supportive) have been shown to have a reduced incidence of workplace-deviant behaviors. Supervisors, managers and organizations are aware of this, and "assess their own behaviors and interactions with their employees and understand while they may not intend to abuse their employees they may be perceived as doing so…".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

'''[[Organizational justice]]''' and the organizational climate are also critical, since the quality of the work experience can impact employee behavior in the workplace. Organizational justice may be organized into three subcategories: procedural, distributive and interactional justice.

* [[Procedural justice]] is concerned with how the decision-making process was made.
* [[Distributive justice]], on the other hand, considers the actual decision.
* [[Interactional justice]] involves the interpersonal relationship and sense of fairness which employees have with supervisors and other authority figures within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Ogbonna&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that procedural justice (combined with interactional justice) is beneficial in reducing workplace-deviant behavior. Employees who are consulted (and given an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making processes at their organization) are less likely to act out, since their voices are valued.

Workplace deviance is a phenomenon which occurs frequently within an organization. Ultimately, it is the managers' and the organization's responsibility to uphold the norms to which the organization wishes to adhere; it is the organization's job to create an ethical climate.&lt;ref name="Litzky"&gt;Litzky et al&lt;/ref&gt; If organizations have authority figures who demonstrate their ethical values, a healthier workplace environment is created. "Research has suggested that managers' behavior influences employee ethical decision-making".&lt;ref name="Litzky"/&gt; Employees who perceive themselves as being treated respectfully and valued are those less likely to engage in workplace deviance.
