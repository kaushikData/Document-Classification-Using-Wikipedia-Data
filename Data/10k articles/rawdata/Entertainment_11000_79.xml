'''The Arden School of Theatre''', also known as '''The Arden''', is a [[Drama school]] and is part of the Performing Arts faculty at [[Ucen manchester|UCEN Manchester]] located in [[Manchester]], [[England]].

The Arden School of Theatre was founded jointly by the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester]] and [[City College Manchester|South Manchester College]] in 1991 by the Senior Curriculum Manager Robert S Ely, to provide [[vocational degree]] level theatrical education in the North of England, one of the first to provide theatrical degrees in the [[United Kingdom]]. The School wanted to expand to provide other theatrical professions, but today only provides courses for actors and musical theatre performers. The Arden name came from the original City College Arden Campus where the drama school was based between 1991 and 2004, in Northenden, South Manchester. It has never been a member of the [[Conference of Drama Schools]].

The school now provides four BA (Hons) programmes, validated by [[Sheffield Hallam University]] in Acting for Live and Recorded Media (Marie Mair), Dance and Performance (Belinda Grantham), Musical Theatre (Andrew Stephenson), and Theatre and Performance ([[Wayne Steven Jackson]]).

The College is a founder member of the  National Skills Academy for Creative &amp; Cultural Skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa-ccskills.co.uk|title=National Skills Academy Homepage|website=Nsa-ccskills.co.uk|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a wide range of relationships locally with the Contact Theatre and the Royal Exchange theatre. Graduates Showcases are presented each year both in the region and in London with a number of casting agents for Acting, Dance, and Musical Theatre.  Theatre and Performance present the annual unTaPped festival each year in May.

In 2006, The Arden moved into new premises located over three floors at Universal Square, a development by Frogmore Northern who had renovated the former [[Great Universal Stores]] headquarters offices. In September 2010 The Arden moved into [[Ellen Wilkinson High School|Nicholls House]], Ardwick, Manchester; a renovated Victorian building with additional rehearsal space, production rooms and voice and singing rooms. The programmes utilise a dedicated theatre space at The Waterside Theatre, attached to the Manchester College Shena Simon Campus, [[Whitworth Street]] in central Manchester. Collaboration with other College degree programmes allows access to other specialist facilities including music recording studios and radio studio and film and television production equipment.

The Arden teaching faculty boasts a wealth of industry experience with Theatre professionals such as West End Musical Director ''Robert Purvis'' and broadway leading man and director [[Tim Flavin]], TV and Screen Actors Marie Critchley,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|nm2174363|Marie Critchley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul Broughton&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|nm0112701|Paul Broughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;, dancers Belinda Grantham and Tomas Simon, as well as performance makers [[Wayne Steven Jackson]] and Graham Hicks.

The '''Artist-scientist''' is one of the [[Jungian archetypes]] in mythology.  Like all of these [[archetypes]], the artist-scientist is an abstraction of life and the human mind.  While never as common as archetypes like the [[child (archetype)|child]] or the [[Hero]], the artist-scientist is immediately recognizable.  They are a builder, an inventor, a seeker, a dreamer, and a thinker.  Distracted by their own thoughts, they frequently have to be pulled in out of the rain.  They are simultaneously vastly knowledgeable and yet innocent, impulsive yet cautious.  They represent the wonder to be found in curiosity, and the dangers.&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;{{cite book |author1=Segal, Robert Alan |author2=Jung, C. G. |title=On mythology |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-691-01736-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
The name references the idea that they are both a creator and a discoverer, and that they are not a fount of information like the [[Bard]] or an adviser like the [[wise old man]], but a source of change.  The frequent obliviousness of the Artist-scientist to the aspects of reality that do not fit with their plans (the stereotype being that they devise an elaborate plan to scale the walls of a fortress as the hero opens the back door and walks in) symbolizes the occasionally underwhelming nature of reality as opposed to our idealized vision of it.  It also references the frequent futility of attempting to control one's fate.  Their naivety symbolizes the gap between knowledge and wisdom, but in the face of their successes it can symbolize the futility of trying to stop a dreamer from changing the world.

The artist-scientist is recognizable by: 
*His or her ability to focus on a single item or idea, in spite of the surrounding activity, often at inopportune times for a hero he or she accompanies.
*Ability to improvise novel solutions to problems, which while they may not turn out as intended somehow are made to work anyway.
*Distaste for simple solutions in favor of [[Rube Goldberg Machine|Rube Goldberg]]ian methods.
*A self-confidence masking an inner fear of failure.
*Naivety about the world and their fellow man in spite of their vast understanding of the academic and philosophical world.
*An inner childlike emotional side intertwined with a staggering logical mind.

==What they symbolize==
The artist-scientist represents many things, including:
*The power of the mind
*Infinite creativity
*Childlike wonder at the world
*Boundless curiosity
*The finding of solutions in unexpected ways
*Intuitive improvisation

==Legendary figures==
Legend has taken numerous real people and applied the archetypal status to them, for example:
*[[Su Song]]
*[[Archimedes]]
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]
*[[Benjamin Franklin]]
*[[Nikola Tesla]]

The '''Writers' Movement '50''' ('''Angkatan Sasterawan 1950'''), better known as '''Asas '50''', is the first and oldest [[literary association]] in post-war [[Malaysia|Malaya]] and the Malay region.{{where?|date=August 2013}} Founded on 6 August 1950, Asas '50 represented the voice of the Malay community and used literature as the ideal thrust towards the independence of Malaya in 1957.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{clarify|date=August 2013}} The association's philosophy of "Art for Society" (Seni untuk Masyarakat) formed the main shaping force in the development of Modern Malay literature. The literary body was pioneered by Muhammad Ariff Ahmad (MAS), Kamaluddin Muhammad ([[Keris Mas]]), Abdul Wahab Muhammad (Awam-il Sarkam), Abdul Jalil Haji Nor (Merayu Rawan), Munir Ali (Rosmera), Kumasi Haji Dainuri (Teruna Jaya), Abdul Majid Husain (Hamzah), Masuri Salikun (Masuri S.N), Abu Yamin Kasun, Ahmad Ramli Abdul Karim (Ramlimah), Muhammad Daud, Abu Yazid Abidin (Wijaya Mala) and Muhammad Yusof Yaacob (Jim).

Asas '50 was dedicated in the development of literature. It held the belief that literature is an integral part of the society. Asas '50 currently works to promote and propagate literature through [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, forums, dialogues, courses etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

One of the landmark events in the early history of ASAS 50 was the debate on the purpose of literature. The debate was between two groups, the ''Utusan Melayu'' group, headed by Asraf and the ''Majalah Hiburan'' group headed by Hamzah Hussien. The crux of the debate was whether to follow "Art for Society" (Seni untuk Masyarakat) or "Art for Art's Sake" (Seni untuk Seni). According to a researcher, Athi Sivan (1997), Hamzah propagated the Gautierian call for purity of art to distance Asas 50 from the left wing ideologies prevalent at that time in Singapore, especially in ''Utusan Melayu''. This ensued the debate and it lasted more than a year before slowly fading away with Hamzah leaving Asas 50 to form a new literary organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Athi Sivan (1997) Hamzah Hussien: Sekitar Pemikiran Seni untuk Seni&lt;/ref&gt; After this debate, ASAS 50 became less active after 1955, when several of its main members (Keris Mas, Usman Awang, etc.) left to reside back in Malaya, while several loyal members remained in Singapore and continued to spearhead the association to this day.

The philosophy held by Asas '50 was described by Keris Mas as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the field of literature, the proponents of ASAS 50 adopted a new breathe of style, employing a mode of [[language]] that is fresh, departing from the preceding genre of writers, propounding the themes of societal awareness, politics and culture with the aim of revitalising the spirit of freedom, the spirit of independence of a people (bangsa) of its own unique sense of [[honour]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]], upholding [[justice]] and combating [[oppression]]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;.... We criticised societal backwardness and those whom we regard as the instruments responsible for the birth of such backwardness. We criticised [[colonialism]] and its instruments, that is, the elite class, those whose consciousness have been frozen by the influence of [[feudalism]] and [[myth]]s, and [[superstition]] that has been enmeshed with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Keris Mas, ''30 Tahun Sekitar Sastera'', (Kuala Lumpur: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, 1979), p. 131. Quoted and translated in [http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/hist/doc/New_Insights_160805/2A-Syed%20Muhd%20Khairuddin.doc Ibid]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asas '50 plays a role in the development of literature and language in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.gwnews.net/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=182 The Development of the Malay Language: Contemporary Challenges] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20110723142501/http://english.gwnews.net/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=182 |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are led by Mohamed Pitchay Gani (President), Mohamed Latiff Mohamed (Deputy President), Yazid Hussein (Vice-President), Abdul Samad Ali (Secretary), Hoirull Amri Tahiran (Secretary 2), Muhammad Herwanto Johari (Head of Youth and Head of Programmes), Namira Mazlan (Head of IT) and Irwan Jamal (Head of Publications).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Seni Untuk Masyarakat==
With the motto ''Seni Untuk Masyarakat'' (Arts for the People), it was inspired by the Indonesian writers movement, ''[[Angkatan 45]]'', and has been described{{who|date=August 2013}} as a watershed moment for the development of Malay literature in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030824134934/http://www.kampungnet.com.sg/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Subjects&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewpage&amp;pageid=26 Malay – Our National Language]&lt;/ref&gt; Seen as an angry young men movement,{{who|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030508004839/http://www.kampungnet.com.sg/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Subjects&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;pageid=70&amp;scope=all Modern Malay Literature in Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt; it promoted several aims:
* To free Malay society from those elements of its culture which was obstructing or negating the pursuit of modernity and progress;

An attempt initiated by Asas '50 to absorb the [[Splinter group|splinter]] literary groups such as Grup Gelorasa and Pass into Asas '50 was carried out in 1974. A new [[slogan]] "Literature for the Community" was coined to provide a mutual understanding and mission amongst the new members of Asas '50. The slogan was generic and did not have any ideological leanings of any the other previous associations. Thus, the slogan is accepted by all the new members of Asas '50.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} However, the battleground has changed for Asas '50 as it was no longer fighting for the independence and physical extrication of the community. This time, Asas '50 stated aim is to free the community from psychological and intellectual oppression left behind during the reign of the colonial masters and the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese Occupation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 'Independence' was superficial as the community still glorified the masters to the point of diminishing and trivialising their very own identity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{who|date=August 2013}} Asas '50's mission is still schooled in the concept of "Literature for the Community" even though it has since changed its slogan.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Language==
Asas '50's contributed significantly towards the development of the [[Malay language]] and was described by kakiseni.com as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the movement that championed the use and development of the Malay language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kakiseni.com/articles/colums/MTAzNw.html Kakiseni, Malaysia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319050207/http://www.kakiseni.com/articles/colums/MTAzNw.html |date=19 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
It was described by Kakiseni.com as The thousands of literary works written in Malay exhibited a diverse form of writing styles as well as the use of contemporary terms to explain a certain phenomena experienced by the community at that point in time lay as a testament of Asas '50's success.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In addition, a number of Asas '50 members are teachers and journalists.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

A significant and historic contribution made by Asas '50 was the introduction of the [[Latin script|Roman script]] to Malay.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The [[Jawi script|Jawi writing]] was initially the modus operandi. However, since the 3rd Malay Language Congress (Kongres Bahasa ke-3) in 1956 and under the initiation of Asas '50, [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] saw a reformation and revolution in the Malay language arena.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As a result, Roman spelling was integrated into Malay and this has remained till today. This change simplifies the learning as Roman spelling is also used in the English language. Research and study of materials and sources from the West to be used by the locals were thus made more accessible and decipherable. Roman spelling has since eclipsed the use of Jawi in daily matters and in education. Only [[Brunei]] still practices the use of Jawi.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Trends==
Asas '50 is the first registered Malay literary association and it is also the first to begin a literary culture rooted as the social protest or the social critic.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The association is also responsible in the push towards independence for Malaya in the 1950s{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and the changes made to the Malay language via the 3rd Malay Language Congress (Kongres Bahasa ke-3). In the 1970s, Asas '50 initiated the Malay Literary Prize (Hadiah Sastera) which is now known as the Malay Literary Award (Anugerah Persuratan). This enabled the works and efforts of writers to be recognised and appreciated. Asas'50 was also recognised as the first Malay literary body in the region to hold the Regional Malay Literati Conference (Pertemuan Sasterawan Nusantara) in 1977. This has since been integrated and adopted as bi-annual event for the Malay literary scene in this region.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The association is the first Malay association to have sealed a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[National Library Board]] (NLB). In addition, Asas '50 has also published "Leksikon", a comprehensive directory, complete with detailed descriptions, of 70 reputed writers in Singapore from 1965 to 2005. The launch of "Leksikon" also immortalised Asas '50 as the first association to have held an event at the new NLB building at Victoria Street.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Asas '50 has been the country's official representative in learning the development of the Malay literature in the region. The association works arm in arm with regional literary associations such as Gapena ([[Malaysia]]), Asterawani (Brunei), Horisons ([[Indonesia]]) and others. Many of its members are also involved in activities organised and held by the [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] (DBP), Mastera and Mabbim.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Youth wing==
{{POV|section|date=August 2013}}
Since its inception, the crux of Asas '50 has always been formed by a group of young and dedicated writers who are passionate in understanding the struggles of the community.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{who|date=August 2013}} These young writers are usually at their most productive and prolific as they continue their search for their own identities and self. The Asas '50 youth wing was started in 2002 to shape the next generation of leaders and activists in the Malay literary scene. This aim was strongly advocated by Masuri S.N, who believed that the strength of an association is reliant on the youths, who will eventually receive the baton to carry the association into the next phase of its mission. The younger members Asas '50 mainly comprises the trainee teachers of the [[National Institute of Education]] Townsville Campus. Today, a number of these members are appointment holders in the association's [[executive committee]].

==Publications==

To date, Asas '50 publishes a variety of books. A number of these publications however were only produced in the early 2000s. However, there were already books published independently by members of Asas '50. Among the publications was the 2005 release of Abdul Ghani Hamid's ''Petikan Rasa/Extracts of Feelings''. Funded by [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]] via the Singapore [[Cultural Medallion]] Grant, the book was a bilingual compilation of Abdul Ghani Hamid's poems and paintings. Another book published by Asas '50 was "Memoir Perjalanan Mas" in 2004.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This historical biography of Muhammad Ariff Ahmad depicted the life and struggles of Mas.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The importance of this book lies in the involvement of Muhammad Ariff Ahmad in the Malay culture, language and literary arena. Inadvertently, this book has become the unofficial documentation of the Malay literary movement history in Singapore.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The publishing of the first Malay writer's directory called Leksikon was a collaborative effort with the NLB, and it was the first of its kind in the Singapore Malay literature.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Detailed information of the [[Creative writing|creative writers]] in Singapore since 1965, is available in this book.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Another one for the history books is the association's publication of an anthology of poems and [[Short story|short stories]] called "Menyongsong Pelangi" in 2005. This anthology comprises literary works contributed by young writers alike and is released in commemoration of Asas '50's 55&amp;nbsp;years celebration.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Impact on Malay film industry==
Asas '50 has played a part in the early Malay film industry. Films by [[P. Ramlee]] were influenced by Asas '50 as the objectives of those films mirrored those of the association's. There were also connections and friendships linking P.Ramlee to Asas '50.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} For example, Asraf's wife, Fatimah Murad, was the editor of P.Ramlee's film magazine called the "Majalah Bintang." Thus, Asraf capitalised on this avenue and network to inject the ideologies held by Asas '50 as well as to trade views and opinions with P.Ramlee. Historical film enthusiasts and observers have recognised the film "[[Bujang Lapok]]" to breathe the same ideologies as that of Asas '50.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The film is said to contain [[Satire|satirical]] stabs at the community at that point in time. An obvious trait prevalent in these films was the use of the actors' real name such as "Ramlee", "Sudin" and "Aziz." This was P.Ramlee's method of highlighting the emotional aspect and the reality that shrouded the community of yesteryear.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Impact on local media and newspaper==
The local newspaper has also held the principle of "Literature for the Community" by publishing literary works that speak of the latest phenomena and dilemma faced by the community all through the years.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} These poems, shorts stories, essays etc. unearthed the ills of the community from the social, religious, political and economical perspectives.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In fact, the number of literary works published in the local newspaper totalled 3,200 from 1,600 writers as of 1965. This reception has made Singapore Malay literature synonymous with the term "newspaper literature (sastera akhbar)." Inadvertently, Asas '50's mission was propagated and proliferated by the local newspaper which had the same ideologies as the literary association.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==The Resource and Reference Compass==
The NLB has recognised Asas '50 as the ideal resource and reference pool for its "Singapore Literary Pioneers Gallery" and NLB Online Repository of Artistic Works (NORA) projects. This includes a [[database]] collection of Malay writers and [[manuscript]]s. Another project piloted by NLB and Asas '50 was the "Potret Tun Seri Lanang." In this project, Asas '50 acted as the middleman in obtaining the literary works of the [[Tun Sri Lanang]] award winners, which included books, publications, private collections and others. These will then be displayed at the special collections section of the NLB.

The part played by Asas '50 in the growth, development and progress of the Malay literature span a wide scope and has impacted the community intrinsically. The association has consistently upheld its mission and vision of "Literature for the Community" with utmost integrity and responsibility. Asas '50 has spearheaded a myriad of initiatives to preserve the image of the community, country and that of the writer himself. From its battle towards independence for Malaya to its inexorable aim of uniting the splinter Malay literary groups, Asas '50 has managed to form a united front under the manifesto "Literature Develops Humanity." The climax of Asas '50 achievements is manifested in the installation of the Malay Literary Prize (Hadiah Sastera), which inevitably raised the status and stature of writers in our societal mould.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">[[Argentine comics]] creators formed the '''Asociación de Historietistas Independientes''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for '''Association of Independent Comic Creators''') at [[Buenos Aires]] convention [[Fantabaires]] in 1996, to collectively address the challenges of independent publishing. Soon, more than 100 magazines throughout [[Argentina]] sported the AHI logo. AHI’s first major accomplishment was ''Historieta Bajo Tierra'' (Underground Comics), a convention that brought together the entire Argentine indie comics community. Building on the success of this event, AHI bought a stand at Fantabaires in 1998 to nurture the previously nonexistent indie comics market. Other accomplishments included putting a common logo on the covers of member comics and organizing events to display and disseminate good new works.&lt;ref name="product"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laproductora.ahiros.com.ar/productora.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211131936/http://www.laproductora.ahiros.com.ar/productora.htm |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }} Productora website (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

AHI kept growing in 1998 as new offices popped up throughout the country. AHI held its first national meeting in the ''Che'' Plaza of [[Rosario, Argentina]]. At this event, members reaffirmed their commitment to collectively producing independent comics. Furthermore, many participants said that for the first time, they felt truly Argentine.&lt;ref name="product" /&gt;

In 1999, irreconcilable differences emerged between certain constituents. One group split from AHI and formed independent publishing collective [[La Productora]].&lt;ref name="product"/&gt; Maintaining informal connections throughout the country and putting national aspirations of earlier years on the backburner, AHI-Rosario emerged as the strongest group to continue the AHI tradition. Entrance into AHI-Rosario is open to all dedicated to publishing independent comics and related materials. In self-publishing, AHI celebrates the freedom of expression, complete individual creator control over material and the close relationship of the creator to the final product. Their goals include supporting indie creators in producing and distributing their works. Working with a large local comics shop, AHI organizes the annual [[Leyendas]] convention that includes comics, RPG’s and sci-fi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahiros.com.ar/ahi.htm] AHI-Rosario website (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] for  [[PlayStation Portable]], part of the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' franchise, taking place in between the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clayman |first=David |title=Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/18/assassins-creed-bloodlines-review |date=November 18, 2009 |access-date=December 13, 2017 |journal=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nguyen |first=Thierry |title=Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines Review |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/assassin-creed-bloodlines-review |date=November 17, 2009 |access-date=December 13, 2017 |journal=[[1UP.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011172357/http://www.1up.com/reviews/assassin-creed-bloodlines-review |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] in conjunction with [[Griptonite Games]] and published by [[Ubisoft]], it was released on November 17, 2009 in North America and November 20, 2009 in Europe, concurrently with ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''.

On June 2, 2009, at their [[E3 2009|E3 Conference]], Sony announced ''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] with a release date of November 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/989/989506p1.html |title=E3 2009: Assassin's Creed PSP Gets Official Name and Date |newspaper=[[IGN]] |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |last=Devries |first=Jack |date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]], [[stealth game]] set in an [[open world]] environment. Contains similar, almost the same, gameplay to ''Assassin's Creed'' in terms of control style, although there were minor modifications to the control scheme, due to the lack of specific keys and buttons. Some features from the previous game, such as Eagle Vision, were removed for the improvement of the controls. Due to the system platform, the AI has been seen as somewhat inferior when compared to the first game, making combat easier and simpler. A minor addition was featured in the combat aspect of the game, allowing players to instantly assassinate a target when they are downed in combat.

Another difference between the two games is the amount of civilians present on the street. While the first game was filled with random civilians, Bloodlines has little to no civilians, explained in-game that the civilians were in a constant state of insecurity due to the new system of governance. Still, civilians will react to Altaïr's improper behavior, such as scaling buildings, and running around the streets.

Stealth in Bloodlines was downgraded, again for the reason of controls. Blending was downgraded, due to the system platform. Although scholars are still present in-game, Altaïr can no longer use them as a way to hide. Although Altaïr can still blend, it only acts as a way to safely bypass guards without raising suspicion. Scaling the side of buildings was made easier and faster, resulting in simpler animations, again, due to the system's inferiority. High and Low profile movements were still present in-game, though they were downgraded as well.

Taking the place of flags, a new collectible featured in the game are Templar Coins that can be used to upgrade health bars, and the amount of damage a weapon can inflict. Three types of coins are present in game: Bronze, Silver and Gold, with Gold holding the highest value. Similar to the previous game, Side-missions are available to players, such as saving civilians from Templar soldiers and performing specific tasks for allies of the resistance. The variety of tasks has been expanded, such as delivering letters, and intercepting couriers. In return, Altaïr will receive coins as a reward, instead of assistance from previous groups, such as scholars and vigilantes.

The setting of this game was based on two areas: [[Limassol]] and [[Kyrenia]]. The look of the area is very similar to some of the cities in the first game, going as far as having the same atmosphere. Due to the small setting, Horseback riding was removed in Bloodlines. Like in the previous game, Altaïr can synchronize from high vantage points around the city in order to map out the city. Although the map itself is already drawn out, synchronizing will provide the locations of various side-missions.

New assassination techniques were featured in Bloodlines. Weapons from the previous game return in Bloodlines, such as Altaïr's sword, his hidden blade, throwing knives, and his fists. His usage of each of the weapons is very similar to the first Assassin's Creed. Assassinations are also similar to the first game, although the animation has been toned down to better fit the system. A new, yet very minor assassination technique has been added to the game, allowing Altaïr to pull opponents off of ledges, similar to ''Assassin's Creed II''.

In ''Bloodlines'', cut-scenes are played through preset dialogue, with the character models acting in preset motions and gestures. Unique gestures were only present in confrontations between boss characters, such as Moloch and the Dark Oracle. Subtitles were also added to the game. This enabled easier understanding of the game plot

Story missions and assassinations were simplified and straightforward. As a replacement for eaves-dropping and pick-pocketing, missions were played in the same structure as ''Assassin's Creed II'', with Altaïr handling one task after another and slowly gathering vital information from both his allies and enemies as each mission was cleared.

An in-game achievement system is featured in Bloodlines, which rewards players with Templar coins. Achievements can be earned after performing specific tasks, such as killing a set number of soldiers in a specified order, and also collecting all of the Templar coins located throughout the game world. Despite all the downgrades, a new feature is also in this game that doesn't apply to the other games: Altaïr can now regain throwing knives by walking over his used ones. Since pick-pocketing was removed and was the only way to regain throwing knives in the first game, Altaïr can now re-use his throwing knives provided that: the knife he threw landed on the ground or an enemy; if the knife lands on water, Altaïr cannot retrieve them. Throwing knives may also be regained by interacting with the newly added knife box in the safehouses.

==Plot==
Beginning shortly after the end of [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|the first game]], [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] learns of a plan of the remaining Templars to escape to [[Cyprus]], and so infiltrates one of their strongholds in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to stop them from doing so. Although he does not succeed in this regard, he does defeat and capture [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Medieval Era (500-1300)|Maria Thorpe]], who attempted to avenge her former master, [[Robert IV de Sablé|Robert de Sablé]], who died at Altaïr's hands. Managing to charter a ship, Altaïr also heads to Cyprus in pursuit of the apple, with Maria in tow.

Once there, he learns of the presence of [[Armand Bouchart]], who has succeeded Robert de Sablé, as Grand Master of the Templar Order. Altaïr also learns, and gains the assistance, of a resistance movement in the city opposed to the presence of the Templars, who, after purchasing the island from [[Richard I of England|King Richard]], have formed a repressive government to control the land and its people. He also learns of a Templar "archive", a trove of Templar knowledge and artifacts, hidden somewhere on the island. True to the way of the Assassins, Altaïr makes to both locate the archive and free Cyprus from Bouchart's grip, firstly by slaying his underlings: Frederick "the Red"; Moloch "the Bull"; Shalim and Shahar "the Twins", and the Dark Oracle "the Witch," eventually confronting and defeating Bouchart at the archive, whose contents have been evacuated and relocated by Templar soldiers. Following Bouchart's death, the archive begins to collapse, but Altaïr manages to escape.

The game also details the relationship between Altaïr and Maria. At first, Maria is hostile and sarcastic towards Altaïr (in her own words, "the man who spared my neck but ruined my life"), but as the story develops, she gradually warms to the assassin who, despite her repeated escape attempts, repeatedly rescues her from harm and does not punish her. Eventually, she decides to assist Altaïr by killing a Templar mole in the resistance when he attempts to kill Altaïr and confronting Bouchart alongside him in the final battle, at this point having fallen in love with the assassin. After their escape from the Templar archive, the two of them decide to head east towards [[India]].

==Connectivity==
''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines'' features exclusive connectivity with the [[PlayStation 3]]'s version of ''Assassin's Creed II''. It was revealed at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009|E3 2009]] that by connecting a PSP to the PlayStation 3, six exclusive and unique weapons can be unlocked on ''Assassin's Creed II'' as well as on ''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines''.

There are six unique weapons that are unlocked for use in ''Assassin's Creed II'' once each boss in ''Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines'' is defeated. Coins acquired in ''Bloodlines'' can be transferred over as Florins to ''Assassin's Creed II''. Vice versa, in ''Bloodlines'', extra health, the ability to block with the hidden blade, and the ability to shoot daggers can be unlocked from acquiring codex pages in ''Assassin's Creed II''.

'''Athens – Epidaurus Festival''' is an annual arts festival that takes place in [[Athens]] and [[Epidaurus]], from May to October. It is one of the most famous festivals in Greece. The festival includes musical, theatrical and other cultural events.

==History==
It was founded in 1955 with actions of [[Georgios Rallis]] (then ''Minister to the Prime Minister''). Its purpose was to promote the artistic and theatrical creation. The director Dinos Giannopoulos undertook the organization of the first Athens Festival, on commission by then-Minister of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greekfestival.gr/en/content/page/history|title=History {{!}} Athens &amp; Epidaurus Festival 2018|website=Athens &amp; Epidaurus Festival 2018|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the festival is organised by the "Hellenic Festival S.A." company.&lt;ref name="HELLENIC FESTIVAL S.A."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekfestival.gr/show_static?page=about_company&amp;lang=en |title=The Vision |work=Athens - Epidaurus Festival |publisher=greekfestival.gr |accessdate=2009-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073854/http://www.greekfestival.gr/show_static?page=about_company&amp;lang=en |archivedate=March 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016 to date, [[Vangelis Theodoropoulos]] is serving as the [[artistic director]] following the resignation of [[Jan Fabre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/207595/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-director-vangelis-theodoropoulos-to-head-festival-after-fabre-resignation|title=Greek director Vangelis Theodoropoulos to head festival after Fabre resignation {{!}} Kathimerini|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/205877/article/ekathimerini/life/jan-fabre-appointed-greek-festival-artistic-director&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

The '''Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters''', also known as the '''Television Code''', was a set of ethical standards adopted by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) for television programming from 1952 to 1983. The code was created to self-regulate the industry in hopes of avoiding a proposed government Advisory Board&lt;ref&gt;The “National Citizens Advisory Board for Radio and Television”, proposed by Senator William Benton, to oversee programming and to submit an annual report to Congress on the extent to which broadcasting served the public interest; see ''Liquor Advertising over Radio and Television: Hearings on S. 2444 Before the Senate Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce'', 82d Cong. 227-28 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt; and satisfying parental concerns over violence and other matters.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto&gt;Vincent LoBrutto, “The Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters”, in ''TV in the USA: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'', vol. 1 (Santa Barbara, Cal.: Greenwood, 2018), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Television Code, the 1935 NAB Code of Ethics for radio was applied to television but fewer than half of television stations subscribed to it; when the Television Code was first issued, two-thirds of stations became subscribers.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dee Pridgen &amp; Eric Engel, “Advertising and Marketing on Cable Television: Whither the Public Interest?”, ''Catholic University Law Review'' 31, no. 2 (Winter 1982): 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The code was first issued on December 6, 1951, and amended multiple times, especially in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals, Congressional hearings into violence (1952, 1954), and concern over the possible blurring of fact and fiction in early docudrama.

The code prohibited the use of [[profanity]], the negative portrayal of family life, irreverence for [[God]] and [[religion]], illicit sex, [[drunkenness]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]], presentation of cruelty, detailed techniques of crime, the use of horror for its own sake, and the negative portrayal of law enforcement officials, among others.  The code regulated how performers should dress and move to be within the "bounds of decency".  Further, news reporting was to be "factual, fair and without bias" and commentary and analysis should be "clearly defined as such". Broadcasters were to make time available for religious broadcasting and were discouraged from charging religious bodies for access. Most importantly, it limited the commercial minutes per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Television History - The First 75 Years: [http://www.tvhistory.tv/SEAL-Good-Practice.htm Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, responding to concerns raised by [[Action for Children's Television]], the NAB revised the code to limit commercial time in children's programming to twelve minutes per hour. Additionally, the hosts of children's television programs were prohibited from appearing in commercials aimed at children. This became Section XIV “Time Standards for Non-Program Material”.

==Enforcement==
The Television Code rules were interpreted, monitored, and enforced by the Code Authority Director, who was appointed by the President of the NAB. The Code Authority interpreted the code by providing advice, publishing guidelines and amendments to clarify code provisions, and issuing rulings on specific programs or commercials, although most cases were resolved through negotiation rather than rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Linton, ''Self-Regulation in Broadcasting'' (Washington, D.C.: National Association of Broadcasters, 1967), 34–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern of code staff was commercials, not program content.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, ''Self-Regulation in Broadcasting'', 39, note 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code Authority had three offices in New York, Hollywood, and Washington D.C. and published a monthly newsletter, ''Code News''.

The Television Code provided for suspension and expulsion of subscribers as determined by the NAB Television Code Review Board whose members were subscribers to the Code and appointed by the NAB President. The Board checked compliance through a system of biannual monitoring backed up by complaint letters coming mostly from competing stations. Appeals of the Review Board’s decisions could be taken to the NAB Television Board of Directors. Compliance with the code was indicated by the "Seal of Good Practice", displayed during [[closing credits]] on most [[United States]] television programs, and on some US TV station sign-on and sign-offs from 1952 to the early 1970s.

==The End==
In 1976, the code's program standards were suspended after a Los Angeles federal judge ruled that the [[Family Viewing Hour]] violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Dessart&gt;George Dessart, “Standards and Practices”, in ''Encyclopedia of Television'', 2nd edn. Ed. by Horace Newcomb (NY–London: Routledge, 2013), 2187.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter]] [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] challenged the code's Section XIV time standards limiting advertising on children's programming, alleging that they “represented an unlawful effort to restrict supply of commercial availabilities and hence drive up prices for these spots.”&lt;ref&gt;“Testimony of Prestion R. Padden, President, Association of Independent Television Stations, INC.”, in ''[https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/933746/download Commercialization of Children's Television.

House Committee on Energy and Commerce, No. 100-93 (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; They then brought an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] action against the NAB. After a summary judgment was handed down against the NAB in 1982 partially striking down Section XIV,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/933611/download US v. National Association of Broadcasters]'', US Dist. Ct. (DC), Nov. 23 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; the NAB and the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Justice Department entered into a [[consent decree]] abolishing the time standards and the industry-wide limitations on the number and length of commercials.&lt;ref name=Dessart /&gt; Under further threats of legal action by the Justice Department on the grounds the code violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[FCC fairness doctrine|Fairness Doctrine]],&lt;ref name=LoBrutto /&gt; the NAB decided to eliminate the remainder of the Television Code as well as the Radio Code in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

==Legacy==
The code paved the way for the development of the [[Broadcast Standards and Practices]] (BS&amp;P) departments of the terrestrial broadcast networks ([[NBC]], CBS, ABC) and most cable networks. After the Television Code’s demise and with the burden of self-regulation now falling to networks, the BS&amp;P offices were forced to produce their own written codes which integrated some of the code’s concepts, recommendations, and rules.

In October 1990, the NAB Board of Directors issued a brief, simplistic “Statement of Principles of Radio and Television Broadcasters” that encourages broadcasters to “exercise responsible and careful judgment in the selection of material for broadcast.”

A scholarly discussion titled "Self-Regulation and the Media" by Angela J. Campbell (1999) examines media self-regulation and concludes that "Applying these five factors to digital television public interest responsibilities and privacy on the Internet, it concludes that self-regulation is not likely to be successful in these contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v51/no3/CAMMAC15.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105122617/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v51/no3/CAMMAC15.PDF |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11567">In [[mathematics]], a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the [[combinatorics]] of the problem is affected by the input, constraints, and bounds of the problem. Combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems.&lt;ref name="Krippendorff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krippendorff|first=Klaus|title=Combinatorial Explosion|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/Combin_explo.html|work=Web Dictionary of Cybernetics and Systems|publisher=PRINCIPIA CYBERNETICA WEB|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woc"&gt;[http://intelligence.worldofcomputing.net/ai-search/combinatorial-explosion.html#.WPUxSIWcEiQ http://intelligence.worldofcomputing/combinatorial-explosion] Combinatorial Explosion.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such problems include certain mathematical [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], the analysis of some puzzles and games, and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the [[Ackermann function]].

== Examples ==

===Latin squares===
{{main|Latin square}}
A [[Latin square]] of order {{mvar|n}} is an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} array with entries from a set of {{mvar|n}} elements with the property that each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and each column of the array. An example of a Latin square of order three is given by,
:{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;"
|-
| 1|| 2 || 3
|-
| 2 || 3 || 1
|-
| 3 || 1 || 2
|}
A common example of a Latin square would be a completed [[Sudoku]] puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;All completed puzzles are Latin squares, but not all Latin squares can be completed puzzles since there is additional structure in a Sudoku puzzle.&lt;/ref&gt; A Latin square is a combinatorial object (as opposed to an algebraic object) since only the arrangement of entries matters and not what the entries actually are. The number of Latin squares as a function of the order (independent of the set from which the entries are drawn) {{OEIS|id=A002860}} provides an example of combinatorial explosion as illustrated by the following table.

===Sudoku===
{{main|Mathematics of Sudoku}}
A combinatorial explosion can also occur in some puzzles played on a grid, such as Sudoku.&lt;ref name="woc"/&gt; A Sudoku is a type of Latin square with the additional property that each element occurs exactly once in sub-sections of size {{math|{{radical|{{mvar|n}}}}×{{radical|{{mvar|n}}}}}} (called ''boxes''). Combinatorial explosion occurs as {{mvar|n}} increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved, as illustrated in the following table.

===Games===

One example in a game where combinatorial complexity leads to a solvability limit is in [[solving chess]] (a game with 64 squares and 32 pieces). Chess is not a [[solved game]]. In 2005 all chess game endings with six pieces or fewer were solved, showing the result of each position if played perfectly. It took ten more years to complete the tablebase with one more chess piece added, thus completing a 7-piece tablebase. Adding one more piece to a chess ending (thus making an 8-piece tablebase) is considered intractable due to the added combinatorial complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966 http://chessok.com/Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases] Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/5253/is-there-a-freely-available-online-7-piece-endgame-tablebase http://chess.stackexchange.com/7-piece-endgame-tablebase (chess)] 7-piece-endgame-tablebase (chess)&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the prospect of solving larger chess-like games becomes more difficult as the board-size is increased, such as in large [[List of chess variants|chess variants]], and [[infinite chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Aviezri Fraenkel |author2=D. Lichtenstein | title = Computing a perfect strategy for n×n chess requires time exponential in n | journal = J. Combin. Theory Ser. A | volume = 31 | year = 1981 | pages = 199–214 | doi = 10.1016/0097-3165(81)90016-9 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computing ===
Combinatorial explosion can occur in computing environments in a way analogous to communications and [[multi-dimensional space]]. Imagine a simple system with only one variable, a [[boolean data type|boolean]] called A. The system has two possible states, ''A'' = true or ''A'' = false. Adding another boolean variable ''B'' will give the system four possible states, ''A'' = true and ''B'' = true, ''A'' = true and ''B'' = false, ''A'' = false and ''B'' = true, ''A'' = false and ''B'' = false. A system with ''n'' booleans has 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; possible states, while a system of ''n'' variables each with Z allowed values (rather than just the 2 (true and false) of booleans) will have ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; possible states.

The possible states can be thought of as the leaf nodes of a tree of height ''n'', where each node has ''Z'' children. This rapid increase of leaf nodes can be useful in areas like [[search engine technology|searching]], since many results can be accessed without having to descend very far. It can also be a hindrance when manipulating such structures.

A [[class hierarchy]] in an [[object-oriented language]] can be thought of as a tree, with different types of object inheriting from their parents. If different classes need to be combined, such as in a comparison (like ''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''B'') then the number of possible combinations which may occur explodes. If each type of comparison needs to be programmed then this soon becomes intractable for even small numbers of classes. [[Multiple inheritance]] can solve this, by allowing subclasses to have multiple parents, and thus a few parent classes can be considered rather than every child, without disrupting any existing hierarchy.

An example is a taxonomy where different vegetables inherit from their ancestor species. Attempting to compare the tastiness of each vegetable with the others becomes intractable since the hierarchy only contains information about genetics and makes no mention of tastiness. However, instead of having to write comparisons for carrot/carrot, carrot/potato, carrot/sprout, potato/potato, potato/sprout, sprout/sprout, they can all [[multiple inheritance|multiply inherit]] from a separate class of tasty whilst keeping their current ancestor-based hierarchy, then all of the above can be implemented with only a tasty/tasty comparison.

===Arithmetics===
Suppose we take the [[factorial]] for ''n'':

&lt;math&gt;n! = (n)(n-1)...(2)(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Then 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, and 4! = 24.  However, we quickly get to extremely large numbers, even for relatively small ''n''.  For example, 100! = 9.33262154 × 10&lt;sup&gt;157&lt;/sup&gt;, a number so large that it cannot be displayed on most calculators, and vastly larger than the estimated number of fundamental particles in the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/numbers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Image:4x2.svg|thumb|125px|Using separate lines of communication, four organizations require six channels]]
|[[Image:4xn.svg|thumb|125px|Using an intermediary, only one channel per organization is required]]
|}

===Communication===
In administration and [[computing]], a '''combinatorial explosion''' is the rapidly accelerating increase in communication lines as organizations are added in a process.  (This growth is often casually described as "exponential" but is actually [[polynomial]].)

If two organizations need to communicate about a particular topic, it may be easiest to communicate directly in an ad hoc manner&amp;mdash;only one [[communication channel|channel of communication]] is required.  However, if a third organization is added, three separate channels are required.  Adding a fourth organization requires six channels; five, ten; six, fifteen; etc.&lt;!-- This is obviously polynomial rather than exponential growth; that's why I deleted the reference to exponential growth. [[User:Michael Hardy]] --&gt;

In general, going on like that, it will take
&lt;math&gt;
l=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = {n \choose 2}
&lt;/math&gt;
communication lines for ''n'' organizations, which is just the number of 2-[[combination]]s of ''n'' elements (see also [[binomial coefficient]]).

The alternative approach is to realize when this communication will not be a one-off requirement, and produce a generic or intermediate way of passing information.  The drawback is that this requires more work for the first pair, since each must convert its internal approach to the common one, rather than the superficially easier approach of just understanding the other.

[[File:Charles Ricketts03.jpg|thumb|right|Costume design for ''Gianetta - The Gondoliers'']]
{{costume}}
'''Costume design''' is the investing of [[clothing]] and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character.&lt;ref name=Eubank&gt;{{cite book|last=Eubank, Tortora|first=Keith, Phyllis G.|title=Survey of Historic Costume|year=2005|publisher=Fairchild Publications|location=New York|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costume]]s may be for a [[theater]], [[film|cinema]], or musical performance but may not be limited to such. Costume design should not be confused with [[costume coordination]] which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both create [[stage clothes]].

Four types of costumes are used in theatrical design: historical, fantastical, dance, and modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Costuming a Play: Inter-Theatre Arts Handbook| last=Grimball and Wells| first=Elizabeth B. and Rhea | publisher = The Century Co.|year =1925| pages = 6| asin=B0000D5ITV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Village festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus (See also: [[Dionysia]]) amongst the ancient Greeks, are believed to be the origin of theatre, and therefore theatre costume. The sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of this costume.&lt;ref name="Eubank"/&gt; Because of their ritualized style of theatre many masks were used giving each character a specific look and they varied depending if they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes. Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true for the Romans, who continued the mask tradition, which made the doubling of roles easier.

During the late Middle Ages in Europe, dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent, therefore actual Christian vestments, stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress, were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible.&lt;ref name="Eubank"/&gt; Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre. In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in Elizabethan performance during the 1500-1600s in England, costume became the most important visual element. Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used. The majority of characters were clothed in Elizabethan fashion, otherwise the costumes could be divided into five categories; 
"Ancient", which was out of style clothing used to represent another period; "Antique", older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters; Dreamlike, "fanciful" garments for supernatural or allegorical characters; "Traditional" clothing which represented only a few specific people, such as Robin Hood, or "National or Racial" costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ordinarily, fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727, when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy. Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major actors began to compete with one another as to who would have the most lavish stage dress. This practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again. Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century. For example, Georg the second, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes. He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period, therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes. He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific, using real chain mail, armor, swords, etc. No cheap substitutes would be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1823, in an issue of ''The Album'', [[James Planché]] published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare's plays, especially when it comes to costumes.  In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to [[Charles Kemble]], the manager of Covent Garden, that "while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters."&lt;ref name="obituary-nyt"&gt;Obituary, ''The New York Times'', 15 June 1880, p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, ''The Costume Designs of James Robinson Planché'', argues that a letter published in ''The Album'', August 1823, pp298–304, signed only 'P', which called for more attention to be paid to the costuming of Shakespeare's plays, and proposed a wardrobe system whereby all locations and periods could be accommodated, was in fact written by Planché.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemble "saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town" and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The New York Times''.  The [[:Image:King John playbill 1823.jpg|playbill]] for ''King John'' states that if the play meets with "approbation and patronage" more of Shakespeare's plays will be performed "Dressed in the same splendid, novel, and interesting style".&lt;/ref&gt; Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as [[Francis Douce]] and [[Samuel Meyrick|Sir Samuel Meyrick]]. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.&lt;ref name="reinhardt526"&gt;Reinhardt, ''The Costume Designs of James Robinson Planché'', p526–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the actors' reservations, ''King John'' was a success and led to a number of similarly-costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (''[[Henry IV, Part I]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'').&lt;ref name="reinhardt526"/&gt; The designs and renderings of ''King John'', ''Henry IV'', ''As You Like It'', ''Othello'', ''Hamlet'' and ''Merchant of Venice'' were published, though there is no evidence that ''Hamlet'' and ''Merchant of Venice'' were ever produced with Planché’s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (''Cortez'', ''The Woman Never Vext'', ''The Merchant's Wedding'', ''Charles XII'', ''The Partisans'', ''The Brigand Chief'', and ''Hofer'').&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Roy, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in ''King John'' had brought about a "revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice"&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; which lasted for almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;Granville-Barker, ''Exit Planché—Enter Gilbert'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 the first of a series of innovative [[modern dress]] productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays, ''[[Cymbeline]]'', directed by [[H. K. Ayliff]], opened at [[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]]'s [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sylvia|last=Morris|title=Innovating in Birmingham: Barry Jackson and modern dress Shakespeare|url=http://theshakespeareblog.com/2012/01/innovating-in-birmingham-barry-jackson-and-modern-dress-shakespeare/|work=The Shakespeare blog|date=2012-01-13|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costumes in Chinese theatre are very important, especially in Beijing Opera. They are usually heavily patterned and loud in color. The standard items consist of at least 300 pieces and describe the actors character type, age and social status through ornament, design, color and accessories. "Color is always used symbolically: red for loyalty and high position, yellow for royalty, and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems. For example, the tiger stands for power and masculine strength. A majority of the clothing, regardless of rank, is made out of rich and luxurious materials. Makeup is also used symbolically and very important to the overall look.

In Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume. They are made of wood and usually used for generations. There are five basic types; male, female, aged, deities and monsters, all with many variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masks are changed often throughout the play. 
In Kabuki, another form of Japanese theatre, actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the overall look. Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern. Traditional costumes are used for each role, based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect. "Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds, and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design process ==
[[File:Costume workshop at a theatre, Prague - 8581.jpg|thumb|A woman creating in a costume workshop in [[Prague]] theater.]]
The costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used.

1.) '''Analysis''':
The first step is an analysis of the script, musical composition, choreography, etc. Costume Parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created. A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene, when the actors change, and what costumes are mentioned in the script.

2.) '''Design Collaboration''':
An important phase in the process where all of the designers meet with the director. There must be a clear understanding of where the show is headed. The designers get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what message they want the audience to get from the show.

3.) '''Costume Research''':
Once the director and designers are on the same page, the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research. Costume designers usually begin with world of the play research where they find research to establish the world where the play takes place. This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better. The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume.

4.) '''Preliminary Sketching and Color Layout''':
Once enough information is obtained, Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches. beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained. The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character. Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them.

5.) '''Final Sketches''':
Once the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out, the designer will create final sketches. These are called rendering and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints. These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Covey, Ingham|first=Liz, Rosemary|title=The Costume Designer's Handbook|year=1992|publisher=Heinemann|location=Portsmouth, NH|pages=15–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==

[[File:Draping example by Jeanette Aultz 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Example of draping muslin fabric onto a dress form]]
Once the show is designed, it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced. There are four options. Garments can be: 
*	Pulled, which refers to searching through a costume shops stock
*	Rented
*	Shopped
*	Constructed, or also known as made to order.

There are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed; either pattern drafted or draped, and many times both methods will be used together.
'''Pattern drafting''' begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor’s measurements. They are drawn out on paper first, then transferred to fabric, and sewn together to test fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Covey, Ingham|first=Liz, Rosemary|title=The Costume Technician's Handbook|year=2003|publisher=Heinemann|location=Portsmouth, NH|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Draping''' involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that have measurements closely related to the actors. It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three-dimensional body by cutting and pinning.

Once constructed, however, the costume has not finished "working." A most important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors' performances and function within their settings. The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lugli |first1=Emanuele |title="Costume as Appearance: A Study in the Modalities of Existence of Film Costumes |url=https://www.academia.edu/26091504/Costume_as_Appearance_A_Study_in_the_Modalities_of_Existence_of_Film_Costumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cruel Jaws''''', also known as '''''The Beast''''', is a 1995  [[direct-to-video]] Italian thriller film shot in Florida including the [[Theater of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoexploito.com/?p=10922 |title=An interview with Jay Colligan, star of Cruel Jaws |publisher=Mondo Exploito |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars Richard Dew and David Luther and was directed by [[Bruno Mattei]] (under the name of William Snyder). It was released on VHS and DVD in relative obscurity, mostly outside of the United States. While marketed in many areas as '''''Jaws 5: Cruel Jaws''''', it is actually not part of the [[Jaws (franchise)|''Jaws'' franchise]].&lt;ref name="Jabootu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jabootu.net/?p=8455|title=Cruel Jaws (1995)|author=Begg, Ken|date=2012-08-27|publisher=Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension| accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The coastal town of Hampton Bay is threatened when a 25-foot [[great white shark]] starts chomping up their vacationers. Days before the annual Regatta celebration, the townspeople are faced with financial ruin if something is not done about their new-found shark problem. If that was not enough, the owners of the local amusement park have been subject to a hostile takeover from a prospective businessman looking to cash in on their prized property. It is then up to the sheriff, the park's owner, and a shark expert to head out and kill the shark before the summer economy is slashed and the park is demolished.

==Production==
The film utilizes footage from the [[Jaws (franchise)|''Jaws'' film series]], ''[[Deep Blood]]'' and ''[[Great White (film)|Great White]]''.&lt;ref name="Jabootu"/&gt;

[[File:BolexH16.jpg|right|thumb|This [[16 mm film|16 mm]] spring-wound [[Bolex]] "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in [[film school]]s.]]
A '''documentary film''' is a [[non-fiction|nonfiction]]al [[film|motion picture]] intended to [[document]] some aspect of [[reality]], primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a [[Recorded history|historical record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=D17BEB75B4625B02AC28B5B9C051D98D?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F56332|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=oed.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234317/http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=D17BEB75B4625B02AC28B5B9C051D98D?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F56332|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such films were originally shot on [[film stock]]—the only medium available—but now include [[video]] and [[new media|digital]] productions that can be either [[direct-to-video]], made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas. "Documentary" has been described as a "filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 'Foreword', in [[Barry Keith Grant]] and Jeannette Sloniowski (eds.) ''Documenting The Documentary: Close Readings of Documentary Film and Video''. Detroit: [[Wayne State University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Documentary film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were originally called '[[Actuality film|actuality]]' films and were only a minute or less in length. Over time documentaries have evolved to be longer in length and to include more categories, such as educational, observational, and even '[[docufiction]]'. Documentaries are also educational and often used in schools to teach various principles. Social media platforms such as [[YouTube]], have allowed documentary films to improve the ways the films are distributed and able to educate and broaden the reach of people who receive the information.

==Definition==
[[File:Unenouvellesourc00matu 0005.jpg|thumb|The cover of [[Bolesław Matuszewski|Matuszewski]] book ''Une nouvelle source de l'histoire. (A New Source of History)'' from 1898 the first publication about documentary function of cinematography.]]
Polish writer and filmmaker [[Bolesław Matuszewski]] was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema ''Une nouvelle source de l'histoire'' (eng. A New Source of History) and ''La photographie animée'' (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in [[French language|French]] and among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacKenzie, Film Manifestos and Global Cinema Cultures: A Critical Anthology, Univ of California Press 2014, {{ISBN|9780520957411}}, p.520&lt;/ref&gt; Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers  to propose the creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.&lt;ref&gt;James Chapman, "Film and History. Theory and History" part "Film as historical source" p.73-75, Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, {{ISBN|9781137367327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular myth, the word ''documentary'' was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker [[John Grierson]] in his review of [[Robert Flaherty]]'s film ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' (1926), published in the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' on 8 February 1926, written by "The Moviegoer" (a pen name for Grierson).&lt;ref name=RFL&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]], [[Marilyn Lake]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=JE6YM8jcRucC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20grierson%20documentary%201926 Connected worlds: history in transnational perspective, Volume 2004] p.151. Australian National University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Grierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the "original" actor and "original" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials "thus taken from the raw" can be more real than the acted article.

[[Documentary practice]] is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.

Documentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.

==History==

===Pre-1900===

Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called "actuality" films; the term "documentary" was not coined until 1926.  Many of the first films, such as those made by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations.

Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]''. Using pioneering film-looping technology, [[Enoch J. Rector]] presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.

In May 1896, [[Bolesław Matuszewski]] recorded on film few surigical operations in [[Warsaw]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon [[Eugène-Louis Doyen]] invited Bolesław Matuszewski and [[Clément Maurice]] and proposed them to recorded his surigical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ford, Robert Hammond: Polish Film: A Twentieth Century History. McFarland, 2005. {{ISBN|9781476608037}}, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series ''Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées'' (1906), and the four-film ''Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne'' (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = “Il faut voir le maître”: A Recent Restoration of Surgical Films by E.-L. Doyen, 1859-1916|last = Baptista|first = Tiago|journal = Journal of Film Preservation|issue = 70|date = November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gheorghe Marinescu - Science films.jpg|thumb|right|Frame from one of [[Gheorghe Marinescu|Marinescu's]] science films (1899).]]
Between July 1898 and 1901, the [[Romania]]n professor [[Gheorghe Marinescu]] made several science films in his [[neurology]] clinic in [[Bucharest]]:&lt;ref name="marin1"&gt;[[Mircea Dumitrescu]], ''O privire critică asupra filmului românesc'', [[Brașov]], 2005, {{ISBN|978-973-9153-93-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy]]'' (1898), ''The Walking Troubles of Organic Paraplegies'' (1899), ''A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis'' (1899), ''The Walking Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy'' (1900), and ''Illnesses of the Muscles'' (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works "studies with the help of the cinematograph," and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of "La Semaine Médicale" magazine from [[Paris]], between 1899 and 1902.&lt;ref name="marin2"&gt;Rîpeanu, Bujor T. ''Filmul documentar 1897–1948'', Bucharest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-973-7839-40-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: "I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving "La Semaine Médicale," but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way."&lt;ref name="marin3"&gt;Ţuţui, Marian, ''[http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Documents/fls-258.doc A short history of the Romanian films]'' at the Romanian National Cinematographic Center. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411014620/http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Documents/fls-258.doc |date=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marinescupathe"&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=71342 The Works of Gheorghe Marinescu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525185831/http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=71342 |date=2010-05-25 }}, 1967 report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marinescuanf"&gt;[http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Movies/fls-271.avi Excerpts of prof. dr.

===1900–1920===
[[File:George malins z aeroskopem St Eloi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Geoffrey Malins]] with an [[aeroscope]] camera during World War I.]]
[[Travelogue (films)|Travelogue films]] were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. They were often referred to by distributors as "scenics." Scenics were among the most popular sort of films at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miriam Hansen]], ''Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; An important early film to move beyond the concept of the scenic was ''[[In the Land of the Head Hunters]]'' (1914), which embraced [[primitivism]] and [[exoticism]] in a staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of [[First Nations|Native Americans]].

Contemplation is a separate area. [[Pathé]] is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is ''[[Moscow Clad in Snow]]'' (1909).

Biographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature ''[[Eminescu-Veronica-Creangă]]'' (1914) on the relationship between the writers [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Veronica Micle]] and [[Ion Creangă]] (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the [[Bucharest]] chapter of [[Pathé]].

Early color motion picture processes such as [[Kinemacolor]]—known for the feature ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (1912)—and [[Prizma]]color—known for ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and the five-reel feature ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921)—used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, [[Technicolor]] concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.

Also during this period, [[Frank Hurley]]'s feature documentary film, ''South'' (1919), about the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1914.

===1920s===

====Romanticism====
[[File:Nanook of the north.jpg|thumb|''[[Nanook of the North]]'' poster.]]
With [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in 1922, documentary film embraced [[romanticism]]; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in ''Nanook of the North'', Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless [[igloo]] for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.

[[Paramount Pictures]] tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's ''Nanook'' and ''Moana'' with two romanticized documentaries, ''[[Grass (1925 film)|Grass]]'' (1925) and ''[[Chang (film)|Chang]]'' (1927), both directed by [[Merian Cooper]] and [[Ernest Schoedsack]].

====The city symphony====
City symphony films were avant-garde films made during the 1920s to 1930s. These films were particularly influenced by modern art: namely Cubism, Constructivism, and Impressionism. (See A.L Rees, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Experimental Film and Video (2nd Edition)|last = Rees|first = A.L.|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-84457-436-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott Macdonald (2010), city symphony film can be located as an intersection between documentary and avant-garde film: "avant-doc". However, A.L. Rees suggest to see them as avant-garde films. (Rees, 2011: 35)

City symphony films include ''[[Manhatta]]'' (dir. Paul Strand, 1921), ''[[Rien que les heures|Paris Nothing but the Hours]]'' (dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926), ''Twenty Four Dollar Island'' (dir. Robert Flaherty, 1927), ''Études sur Paris'' (dir. André Sauvage, 1928), ''The Bridge'' (1928), and ''[[Joris Ivens|Rain]]'' (1929), both by Joris Ivens.

But the most famous city symphony films are ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis|Berlin, Symphony of a Great City]]'' (dir. Walter Ruttman, 1927) and ''[[Man with a Movie Camera|The Man with a Movie Camera]]'' (dir. Dziga Vertov, 1929).
[[File:Berlin Ruttmann.png|thumb|In this shot from Walter Ruttmann's ''Berlin, Symphony of a Great City'' (1927), cyclists race indoors. The film is shot and edited like a visual-poem.
]]
A city symphony film, as the name suggests, is usually based around a major metropolitan city area and seek to capture the lives, events and activities of the city. It can be abstract and cinematographic (see Walter Ruttmann's ''Berlin'') or utilise Russian Montage theory (See Dziga Vertov's ''Man with a Movie Camera''). But most importantly, a city symphony film is like a cine-poem and is shot and edited like a "symphony".  [[File:Mikhail kaufman on train.jpg|thumb|In this shot from ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'', [[Mikhail Kaufman]] acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot]]
The continental, or realist, tradition focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called "city symphony" films such as [[Walter Ruttmann]]'s ''[[Berlin, Symphony of a City]]'' (of which Grierson noted in an article&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, John. 'First Principles of Documentary', in Kevin Macdonald &amp; Mark Cousins (eds.) Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary. London: Faber and Faber, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Berlin'' represented what a documentary should '''not''' be), [[Alberto Cavalcanti]]'s ''[[Rien que les heures]]'', and [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''. These films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean towards the avant-garde.

====''Kino-Pravda''====
[[Dziga Vertov]] was central to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' (literally, "cinematic truth") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera—with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion—could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.

====Newsreel tradition====
The [[newsreel]] tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.

===1920s–1940s===
The propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial [[propaganda film]]s is [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), which chronicled the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Congress]] and was commissioned by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Leftist filmmakers [[Joris Ivens]] and [[Henri Storck]] directed ''[[Borinage]]'' (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. [[Luis Buñuel]] directed a "[[surrealism|surrealist]]" documentary ''[[Land Without Bread|Las Hurdes]]'' (1933).

[[Pare Lorentz]]'s ''[[The Plow That Broke the Plains]]'' (1936) and ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' (1938) and [[Willard Van Dyke]]'s ''[[The City (1939 film)|The City]]'' (1939) are notable [[New Deal]] productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' (1942–1944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. [[Constance Bennett]] and her husband [[Henri de la Falaise]] produced two feature-length documentaries, ''[[Legong: Dance of the Virgins]]'' (1935) filmed in [[Bali]], and ''Kilou the Killer Tiger'' (1936) filmed in [[Indochina]].

In Canada, the [[National Film Board of Canada|Film Board]], set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of [[Nazi]] Germany (orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]).

[[File:Basil Wright, Joris Ivens, Elmar Klos i Jerzy Toeplitz - Film nr 55-56 - 1948-12-23.JPG|thumb|Conference of "World Union of documentary films" in 1948 Warsaw featured famous directors of the era: [[Basil Wright]] (on the left), [[Elmar Klos]], [[Joris Ivens]] (2nd from the right), and [[Jerzy Toeplitz]].]]
In Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the [[Documentary Film Movement]]. Grierson, [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], [[Basil Wright]], and [[Humphrey Jennings]] amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include ''Drifters'' ([[John Grierson]]), ''[[Song of Ceylon]]'' ([[Basil Wright]]), ''[[Fires Were Started]]'', and ''[[A Diary for Timothy]]'' ([[Humphrey Jennings]]). Their work involved poets such as [[W. H. Auden]], composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]], and writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]]. Among the best known films of the movement are ''[[Night Mail]]'' and ''[[Coal Face]]''.

Smith'' (1943) was anti-nazi color film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|title=Calling Mr. Smith - LUX|author=|date=|website=lux.org.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234317/https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|title=Calling Mr Smith - Centre Pompidou|author=|date=|website=centrepompidou.fr|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024033/https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|archivedate=31 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|title=Franciszka and Stefan Themerson: Calling Mr. Smith (1943) - artincinema|author=|date=21 June 2015|website=artincinema.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024247/http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|archivedate=31 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[Stefan Themerson]] and being both documentary and avant-garde film against war. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history.

===1950s–1970s===

====Cinéma-vérité====
[[Cinéma vérité]] (or the closely related [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]]) was dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.

Cinéma vérité and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the [[French New Wave]], the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.

Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité ([[Jean Rouch]]) and the North American "[[Direct Cinema]]" (or more accurately "[[:fr:Cinéma direct|Cinéma direct]]"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians [[Allan King]], [[:fr:Michel Brault|Michel Brault]], and [[Pierre Perrault]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and Americans [[Robert Drew]], [[Richard Leacock]], [[Frederick Wiseman]], and [[Albert and David Maysles]].

The directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.

The films ''[[Chronicle of a Summer]]'' ([[Jean Rouch]]), ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' ([[D. A. Pennebaker]]), ''[[Grey Gardens]]'' ([[Albert and David Maysles]]), ''[[Titicut Follies]]'' ([[Frederick Wiseman]]), ''[[Primary (film)|Primary]]'' and ''[[Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment]]'' (both produced by [[Robert Drew]]), ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (directed by [[Barbara Kopple]]), ''[[Lonely Boy (film)|Lonely Boy]]'' ([[Wolf Koenig]] and [[Roman Kroitor]]) are all frequently deemed [[cinéma vérité]] films.

The fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the [[shooting ratio]] (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement—such as [[Werner Nold]], Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, [[Susan Froemke]], and Ellen Hovde—are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.

Famous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include ''[[Les Raquetteurs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/our-collection/?idfilm=54008 |title = Les raquetteurs |website =National Film Board of Canada|date = 15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Showman'', ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]'', ''Near Death'', and ''The Children Were Watching''.

====Political weapons====
In the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against [[neocolonialism]] and [[capitalism]] in general, especially in [[Latin America]], but also in a changing [[Quebec]] society. ''La Hora de los hornos'' (''[[The Hour of the Furnaces]]'', from 1968), directed by [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr.]], influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was "Chile: A Special Report," public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the [[Salvador Allende]] government in [[Chile]] by military leaders under [[Augusto Pinochet]], produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and José Garcia.

===Modern documentaries===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VoicesOfIraq.jpg|thumb|One of 150 DV cameras used by Iraqis to film themselves and create the 2004  film ''[[Voices of Iraq]]''.]] --&gt;
[[Box office]] analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[Food, Inc.]]'', ''[[Earth (2009 film)|Earth]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Religulous]]'', and ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.

The nature of documentary films has expanded in the past 20 years from the cinema verité style introduced in the 1960s in which the use of portable camera and sound equipment allowed an intimate relationship between filmmaker and subject. The line blurs between documentary and narrative and some works are very personal, such as the late [[Marlon Riggs]]'s ''Tongues Untied'' (1989) and ''Black Is...Black Ain't'' (1995), which mix expressive, poetic, and rhetorical elements and stresses subjectivities rather than historical materials.&lt;ref&gt;Struggles for Representation African American Documentary Film and Video, edited by Phyllis R. Klotman and Janet K. Cutler,&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical documentaries, such as the landmark 14-hour ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]: America's Civil Rights Years'' (1986—Part 1 and 1989—Part 2) by Henry Hampton, ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997) by [[Spike Lee]], and ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery [[500 Years Later]], expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' by [[Errol Morris]] incorporated stylized re-enactments, and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'' placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as "[[mondo films]]" or "docu-ganda."&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.

Documentary filmmakers are increasingly utilizing social impact campaigns with their films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/afi-docs-fueling-social-change-1201524000/|title=AFI Docs: Filmmakers Get Savvier About Fueling Social Change|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=2015-06-19|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604032728/http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/afi-docs-fueling-social-change-1201524000/|archivedate=2016-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social impact campaigns seek to leverage media projects by converting public awareness of social issues and causes into engagement and action, largely by offering the audience a way to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azuremedia.org/azuremedia.org/social_impact_campaigns.html|title=social impact campaigns|website=www.azuremedia.org|access-date=2016-06-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331001043/http://www.azuremedia.org/azuremedia.org/social_impact_campaigns.html|archivedate=2016-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such documentaries include ''[[Kony 2012]]'', ''[[Salam Neighbor]], [[Gasland]]'', ''[[Living on One Dollar]]'', and ''[[Girl Rising]]''.

Although documentaries are financially more viable with the increasing popularity of the genre and the advent of the [[DVD]], funding for documentary film production remains elusive. Within the past decade, the largest exhibition opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters who have become their largest funding source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070519040840/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/fes_01Sund_010208_Docs.html indiewire.com], "Festivals: Post-Sundance 2001; Docs Still Face Financing and Distribution Challenges." February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the development of "[[reality television]]" that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The ''making-of'' documentary shows how a [[Film|movie]] or a [[video game|computer game]] was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an advertisement than a classic documentary.

Modern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change was [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', where 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to Iraqis to record themselves.

====Documentaries without words====
Films in the documentary form without words have been made. From 1982, the [[Qatsi trilogy]] and the similar ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' could be described as visual tone poems, with music related to the images, but no spoken content. ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' (part of the Qatsi trilogy) consists primarily of [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse photography]] of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. ''Baraka'' tries to capture the great pulse of humanity as it flocks and swarms in daily activity and religious ceremonies.

''[[Bodysong]]'' was made in 2003 and won a British Independent Film Award for "Best British Documentary."

The 2004 film ''[[Genesis (2004 film)|Genesis]]'' shows animal and plant life in states of expansion, decay, sex, and death, with some, but little, narration.

====Narration styles====
; Voice-over narrator
The traditional style for narration is to have a dedicated narrator read a script which is dubbed onto the audio track.   The narrator never appears on camera and may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject matter or involvement in the writing of the script.
; Silent narration
This style of narration uses title screens to visually narrate the documentary.  The screens are held for about 5–10 seconds to allow adequate time for the viewer to read them.  They are similar to the ones shown at the end of movies based on true stories, but they are shown throughout, typically between scenes.
; Hosted narrator
In this style, there is a host who appears on camera, conducts interviews, and who also does voice-overs.

==Other forms==

===Docufiction===
[[Docufiction]] is a [[Wiktionary:hybrid|hybrid]] [[genre]] from two basic ones, [[fictional film|fiction film]] and [[documentary]], practiced since the first documentary films were made.

=== Fake-fiction ===
{{See also|Pseudo-documentary#Film}}
Fake-fiction is a genre which deliberately presents real, unscripted events in the form of a fiction film, making them appear as staged. The concept was introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/11/where-is-rocky-ii-ed-ruscha-mojave-desert-film-pierre-bismuth|title=Where is Rocky II?

===DVD documentary===
A DVD documentary is a documentary film of indeterminate length that has been produced with the sole intent of releasing it for direct sale to the public on [[DVD]](s), as different from a documentary being made and released first on [[television]] or on a cinema screen (a.k.a. [[Film release|theatrical release]]) and subsequently on DVD for public consumption.

This form of documentary release is becoming more popular and accepted as costs and difficulty with finding TV or theatrical release slots increases.  It is also commonly used for more 'specialist' documentaries, which might not have general interest to a wider TV audience.  Examples are military, cultural arts, transport, sports, etc..

===Compilation films===
Compilation films were pioneered in 1927 by [[Esfir Shub|Esfir Schub]] with ''The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty''. More recent examples include ''[[Point of Order (film)|Point of Order]]'' (1964), directed by [[Emile de Antonio]] about the McCarthy hearings. Similarly, ''[[The Last Cigarette]]'' combines the testimony of various [[tobacco]] company executives before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.

Poetic documentaries, which first appeared in the 1920s, were a sort of reaction against both the content and the rapidly crystallizing grammar of the early fiction film. The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters—"lifelike people"—were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and space—a coherence favored by the fiction films of the day—can also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The "real world"—Nichols calls it the "historical world"—was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens' ''Rain'' (1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; [[László Moholy-Nagy]]'s ''Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)'', in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; [[Oskar Fischinger]]'s abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's ''[[N.Y., N.Y. (film)|N.Y., N.Y.]]'' (1957), a city symphony film; and [[Chris Marker]]'s ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' (1982).

Expository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds 'objective' and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and 'objective' account and interpretation of past events.

Examples: TV shows and films like ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', many science and nature documentaries, [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Civil War (miniseries)|The Civil War]]'' (1990), [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]' ''[[The Shock of the New]]'' (1980), [[John Berger]]'s ''[[Ways Of Seeing]]'' (1974), [[Frank Capra]]'s wartime ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series, and [[Pare Lorentz]]'s ''[[The Plow That Broke The Plains]]'' (1936).

===Observational===
[[File:Creating documentary 01.jpg|thumb|film team at [[Port of Dar es Salaam]] with two ferries]] 
Observational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lightweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.

===Types===

'''Participatory documentaries''' believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by their presence. Nichols: "The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)" The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinéma vérité, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the "truth" refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.

'''Reflexive documentaries''' do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead, they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to "question the authenticity of documentary in general." It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of 'realism'. It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to 'defamiliarize' what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.

'''Performative documentaries''' stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's ''Tongues Untied'' (1989) or Jenny Livingston's ''Paris Is Burning'' (1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to 'speak about themselves.' Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.

=== Educational Films ===
Documentaries are shown in schools around the world in order to educate students. Used to introduce various topics to children, they are often used with a school lesson or shown many times to reinforce an idea.

==== Pros Of Educational Films in Schools ====
A 2007 study from the German Research Foundation found that, "participants in the Film Repetition condition and in the School Lesson plus Film condition performed equally well and significantly better than those in the Film once condition and School Lesson once condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 April 2007|title=Educational films in the classroom: Increasing the benefit|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475207000072|journal=Learning and Instruction|publisher=|volume=17|issue=2|pages=172–183|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.01.005|via=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;The pattern of repetition has been shown to boost memory performance. Likewise, students perform better when they are taught with a school lesson which is reinforced by an educational film. An educational film also provides a sense of entertainment for students and increases their interest in the topic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2016/12/8-1|title=Benefits and Perils of Using Movies in Education — The Learning Scientists|website=www.learningscientists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cons of Educational Films in Schools ====
The negative side of educational films in school is the director's creative license. As seen before, "some popular historical movies contain major factual errors."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2016/12/8-1|title=Benefits and Perils of Using Movies in Education — The Learning Scientists|website=www.learningscientists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;When a film introduces incorrect facts, "it enhances the likelihood that incorrect details from the movie are stored in memory."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;Educational film if presented accurately as well as reviewed for this accuracy can be used to reinforce topics. However, educational film can also mislead the student indirectly, causing a problem for this tool of learning.

=== Youtube ===
Because YouTube is a global social media platform for videos, it is also used in classrooms as an educational resource. YouTube has the potential to, "dramatically accelerate scientific advance," and that, "certain public school systems, non-profits, and charter schools use YouTube videos of outstanding educators n the training and professional development of teachers." The versatility of YouTube has allowed for the proliferation of knowledge to millions of students around the world as, "the short, easy to understand videos available can explain difficult concepts."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inkind.life/blog-1/2018/5/4/how-youtube-is-changing-the-face-of-education|title=How YouTube is Changing the Face of Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Many teachers use the video platform to introduce real examples of topics. Another useful side of YouTube is one of its most important and, "is changing how we learn because it is free to use."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;This is especially important for students in developing countries as they have limited opportunities for education. With YouTube these students are able to receive the education they deserve in a way that is mare enjoyable. YouTube continues to change lives and change the future of generations to come. YouTube will be a major factor in years to come in the educational system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Translation==

There are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries. The main two are working conditions and problems with terminology.

===Working conditions===

Documentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary, translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.&lt;ref&gt;Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by "the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names".&lt;ref name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120"&gt;Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessarily difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: "Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen, and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley".&lt;ref name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120"/&gt;

===Terminology===

The process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field. Therefore, they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The documentary ''Beetles, Record Breakers'' makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devil’s coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case, they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FlexBook''' is a [[textbook]] authoring platform offered by the [[CK-12 Foundation]]. Launched in 2008, FlexBooks reduce the cost of textbooks for the [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] market both in U.S and worldwide. Derived from the words "flexibility" and "textbook," a FlexBook allows users to produce and customize content by re-purposing educational content using different modules. FlexBooks can be designed to suit a learner’s learning style, region, language, or level of skill, while adhering to the local education standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9378/ Creative Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
FlexBooks are designed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional textbooks. Anyone – including teachers, students, and parents - can adapt, create, and configure a FlexBook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck12.org/about/about-us About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some FlexBooks features include:
* Web-based collaborative model, where the user can create and edit content to produce a custom textbook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20090907monday.html NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open Educational Resource([[Open educational resources|OER]]) which allows for easy remixing of content
* Available in PDF, HTML, ePub (for iPad) and AZW (for Kindle)

== Licensing ==
Each CK-12 FlexBook is created under Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) License,&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Licenses]&lt;/ref&gt; giving its author/user a right to share (i.e., right to copy, distribute and transmit the work) a right to remix (i.e., right to adapt the work). However, conditions of [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] and [[Non-commercial]] apply.

== Examples of use and collaboration ==
In March 2009, FlexBook was lauded as “an adaptive, web-based set of instructional materials” by Virginia officials when members from Virginia’s K-12 physics community along with university and industry volunteers developed an eleven chapter FlexBook titled “21st Century Physics FlexBook: A Compilation of Contemporary and Modern Technologies” in just 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oerconsortium.org/tag/FlexBook/ OER Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2010, NASA teamed up with CK-12 to add a chapter on “[[modeling and simulation]]” to the existing Physics FlexBook created earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/releases/2010/10-086.html NASA News, NASA teams with ‘CK 12’ Foundation on Physics FlexBook (2010). Retrieved November 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;   In November 2011, teachers from a school district, Anoka-Hennepin, Minnesota, reportedly, saved the district $175,000 by writing their own online textbook instead of buying $65 textbooks – earlier, costing the district to the tune of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/minnesota-teachers-write-_n_1084972.html HuffingtonPost]&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram has teamed up with CK-12 to produce interactive FlexBooks with Wolfram demonstrations embedded into the FlexBooks.

It offers more than 700 different tours in more than 100 countries, and carries 200,000 travellers from 160 countries each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ttgmedia.com/news/features/g-adventures-setting-responsible-travel-standards-14004|title=G Adventures: Setting responsible travel standards|website=TTG|language=En|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 28 offices around the world and employs more than 2,200 people globally. G Adventures is known for its responsible approach to travel, and has a non-profit partner, [https://planeterra.org/about-us/ Planeterra], which was founded in 2003. Together, G Adventures and Planeterra have built more than [https://planeterra.org/what-we-do/our-projects/ 50] social enterprise projects into G Adventures itineraries with the aim of supporting local people and economies in the destinations they travel to.

== History ==
[[Bruce Poon Tip]] founded Gap Adventures in 1990 after returning from a backpacking tour of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gadventures.com.au/about-us/ |title=About Us - G Adventures |accessdate=2015-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was originally named Gap Adventures - Gap being an double-entendre with the letters standing for "Great Adventure People" and the company 'bridging the gap' between backpacking and all-inclusive beach holidays. Gap's first tour visited Ecuador in February 1991 with six travellers.

In 2008, Gap Adventures was sued by American clothing company, [[Gap Inc.]], over the name. G Adventures was required to change its name by the U.S. District court that deemed the brand was an infringement on GAP Inc. clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Tour-Operators/Gap-Adventures-changes-name-to-G-Adventures/ |title=Gap Adventures changes name to G Adventures |accessdate=2015-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling stated that the name and brand Gap Adventures caused legitimate confusion and dilution of the brand for the clothing company. Therefore, G Adventures was required to change its name by October 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kunopaski|first=Terrilyn|title=GAP Adventure Loses in Trademark Suit from The Gap, Inc|url=http://www.travelhotnews.com/reportages.php?sequence_no=34985|publisher=Travel Hot News|accessdate=Sep 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, G Adventures acquired British travel brands Travelsphere and Just You,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/271217/travelsphere-and-just-you-to-court-trade-under-new-ownership|title=Travel Weekly|last=Dennis|first=Juliet|date=January 18, 2017|website=Travel Weekly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are based in Market Harborough, United Kingdom.

In 2018, G Adventures was recognized as one of the [https://www.fastcompany.com/company/g-adventures World's Most Innovative Companies] by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] and was honoured with an [[Edison Awards|Edison Award]] for Social Impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edisonawards.com/winners2018.php|title=Edison Awards™ - Honoring the Best in Innovation and Innovators|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
In 2011 G Adventures partnered with the non-profit organization Global Exploration for Educators Organization (GEEO) with the goal of helping more teachers explore the world and then bring their experiences back into their classrooms. Since then, over 2,000 teachers have traveled through the GEEO/G Adventures program.

In 2013, G Adventures entered into a $1.3 million partnership with the [[Multilateral Investment Fund]], a member of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB/MIF). IDB/MIF is the leading source of development funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. G Adventures built five new long-term, sustainable tourism projects over the following 3 years in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanleigh|first=Sean|title=Tourism Program for Latin America|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-tools/small-business-briefing/article10778520.ece|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, G Adventures announced a partnership with National Geographic &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trb-national-geographic-g-adventures-20160122-story.html|title=National Geographic and G Adventures partner to keep experiences high, prices low|last=Gardner|first=Terry|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sees the two companies join forces to create a programme of 80 tours called ''National Geographic Journeys with G Adventures''.

In 2016 on World Tourism Day, G Adventures announced a partnership with the [[Jane Goodall Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/tour-operators/g-adventures-partners-jane-goodall-institute-offer-new-wildlife-trips/|title=G Adventures partners with The Jane Goodall Institute to offer new wildlife trips - Travelweek|last=Group|first=Travelweek|date=2016-09-28|newspaper=Travelweek|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jane Goodall Collection by G Adventures'' is a programme of 20 itineraries aimed at raising the awareness of animal welfare and wildlife-friendly tourism, endorsed by primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall.

The following article gives a list of '''[[association football]] confederations, sub-confederations and associations around the world'''. The sport's international governing body is [[FIFA]], but those associations not affiliated to FIFA are also included in this article.

Most [[Europe]]an, [[Africa]]n, and [[Asia]]n countries have two principal competitions: a more prestigious league which is typically a double [[round-robin tournament]] restricted to the elite clubs, and a cup which is a [[single-elimination tournament]] open to both the elite and lesser clubs.  In the [[Americas]], leagues are often organised as either [[Tournament#Multi-stage tournaments|multi-stage tournaments]] or separate [[Apertura and Clausura]] stages.

{{For|the video game developer|Hangar 13 (company)}}
'''Hangar 13''' was a Scottish hardcore [[rave]] venue in [[Ayr]], [[Scotland]]. Situated in the former Pavilion dance hall situated on Ayr's Low Green.  During the early 1990s, raves situated at this old Pavilion became the target of much [[police]] and [[Mass media|media]] interest after three alleged [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy-related]] deaths occurred.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960501/debtext/60501-44.htm | title = Licensing (Amendment)(Scotland) ACT 1996 | work = Hansard | publisher = UK Parliament | date = 1 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was eventually shut down, although there was a "unity campaign" to keep the venue open. The deaths may have been due to the use of more dangerous [[dance drug]]s such as [[para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]] rather than [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.obsolete.com/ecstasy/scotland.html | title=Raving in Scotland | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722222225/http://www.obsolete.com/ecstasy/scotland.html | archivedate=22 July 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other factors included overheating, lack of drinking water and other amenities at these often ''ad hoc'', unlicensed events. The tragic events that happened at Hangar 13 precipitated an amendment to the [[Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 1996|law]] that licences were required for the safeguarding of the health and safety of those attending similar events.&lt;ref name="misuse"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/research/pdf_res_notes/rn00-106.pdf | title = National Alcohol Misuse Strategy | work = Research Notes | publisher = Scottish Parliament | pages = 4 | date = 4 December 2000 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061026204936/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/research/pdf_res_notes/rn00-106.pdf | archivedate = 26 October 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heiner Müller''' ({{IPA-de|haɪnɐ mʏlɐ|lang}}; 9 January 1929 – 30 December 1995) was a German (formerly [[German Democratic Republic|East German]]) [[dramatist]], poet, writer, essayist and theatre director. His "enigmatic, fragmentary pieces" are a significant contribution to [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] drama and [[postdramatic theatre]].&lt;ref name="gush"&gt;"With Beckett's death Müller becomes the theatre's greatest living poet." ''[[The Village Voice]]'', quoted on the backcover of Müller's ''Theatremachine'' (1995). The phrase "enigmatic and fragmentary pieces" comes from the article on Müller in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' (Banham 1995, 765). Among others, Elizabeth Wright assesses Müller's contribution to a postmodern drama in ''Postmodern Brecht'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Müller was born in [[Eppendorf, Saxony]]. He joined the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) in 1947 and began serving for the German Writers' Association (Deutscher Schriftsteller-Verband, DSV) in 1954. Müller became one of the most important dramatists of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and won the [[Heinrich Mann Prize]] in 1959 and the [[Kleist Prize]] in 1990.

His relationship with the East German state began to deteriorate, however, with his drama ''Die Umsiedlerin'' (''The Resettler Woman'') which was censored in 1961 after only one performance. Müller was banned from the Writers' Association in the same year. The East German government remained wary of Müller in subsequent years, preventing the premiere of ''Der Bau'' (''Construction Site'') in 1965 and censoring his ''[[Mauser (play)|Mauser]]'' in the early 1970s. Yet despite these hardships, Müller's work began to gain popularity both in West Germany and internationally at this time. Many of his best-known plays from this period were premiered in the West: this includes ''Germania Death in Berlin'', which was first performed in 1978 at the [[Munich]] ''Kammerspiele''. Heiner Müller himself directed a production of ''[[The Mission (play)|The Mission]]'' (''Der Auftrag'') in [[Bochum]] in 1982. In Paris, [[Jean Jourdheuil]] directed the world premiere of ''[[Hamletmachine]]'' (''Die Hamletmaschine'') in 1979. English translations, first by [[Helen Fehervary]] and [[Marc Silberman]], then by [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], introduced Müller to the English speaking world in the mid- and late 1970s; Müller's controversial play ''Mauser'' was first performed in 1975 in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;The history of Müller's plays in production can be found in the ''Heiner Müller Handbuch'', edited by [[Hans-Thies Lehmann]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his growing worldwide fame, Müller was able to regain acceptance in East Germany. He was admitted to the DDR [[Academy of Arts, Berlin]] in 1984 – only two years before he became a member of parallel West Berlin academy.  Despite earlier honors, Müller was not readmitted to the East German Writers' Association until 1988, shortly before the end of the GDR. After the fall of the Wall, Müller became final president of the DDR Academy of the Arts from 1990 until its 1993 merger with the western academy.  

In 1992, he was invited to join the directorate of the [[Berliner Ensemble]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]'s former company at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]], as one of its five members along with [[Peter Zadek]], [[Peter Palitzsch]], [[Fritz Marquardt]] and [[Matthias Langhoff]]. In 1995, shortly before his death, Müller was appointed as the theatre's sole artistic director.&lt;ref name="readerchrono"&gt;Weber (2001, 243–244).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tombstone Heiner Mueller.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Heiner Müller's grave in Berlin]]
During the last five years of his life, Müller continued to live in Berlin and work all over Germany and Europe, mostly directing productions of his own works. He wrote few new dramatic texts in this time, though, like Brecht, he did produce much poetry in his final years. In the last half-decade of his life, Müller also worked towards transforming the interview into a literary genre. Müller died in Berlin of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] in 1995. Müller is buried at Berlin's [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]]. Müller's grave was designed by his last stage designer [[Mark Lammert]].

Among his better known works, other than those already mentioned, are ''Der Lohndrücker'' (''The Scab''), ''Wolokolamsker Chaussee'' (''Volokolamsk Highway'') Parts I–V, ''Verkommenes Ufer Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten'' (''Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts''), ''Philoktet'' (''Philoctetes''), ''Zement'' (''Cement''), ''Bildbeschreibung'' (''Description of a Picture'' aka ''Explosion of a memory'') and ''Quartett''.

==Legacy==
Over a decade after his death, Müller continues to have an enormous influence on European playwriting, dramaturgy, and performance. In 1998, the journal [[New German Critique]] devoted a special issue to his work. He is the only playwright to have ever received such an honor.&lt;ref name="thelocal.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/opinion/20090109-16655.html |title=Happy birthday Heiner Müller – The Local |publisher=Thelocal.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, one of Europe’s leading intellectual publishing houses, [[Suhrkamp]], issued the final three volumes in a twelve-volume edition of Müller's collected works.

Müller has also paved the way for a new generation of directors, playwrights, and [[dramaturgs]] who regard themselves as "samplers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/the/thm/idd/en4080155.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422090207/http://www.goethe.de/kue/the/thm/idd/en4080155.htm |date=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Müller adopted Brecht's notion of ''Kopien'' (German for "copying"), the practice of regarding texts by others as material to be used, imitated, and rewritten. In regards to Brecht's own oeuvre, Müller stated "To use Brecht without criticizing him is treason."&lt;ref name="thelocal.de"/&gt; For Müller, the work of other writers and artists was not seen as private property; it was to be used as raw material for his own work. Thus, Müller's work in the theater marks the beginning of a tradition of densely poetic dramaturgy based in the logic of association, rather than linear "dramatic" narrative.

[[Jonathan Kalb]], theater critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', describes Müller's legacy on theatre as replacing the "closed" didactical form of the Brechtian [[parable]] with "open" dramatic forms offering multiple meanings based, in Hans-Thies Lehmann's words, on a [[Surrealism|surreal]] "montage dramaturg . . . in which the reality-level of characters and events vacillates hazily between life and dream and the stage becomes a hotbed of spirits and quotes outside any homogeneous notion of space and time."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kalb's ''The Theater of Heiner Müller'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Müller's breakthrough work "Hamletmachine," [[Giannina Braschi]], a leading force of the [[Nuyorican]] poetry movement, wrote "[[United States of Banana]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giannina Braschi |url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.com/2012/september/what-read-now-mixed-genre-literature-giannina-braschi |title="What to Read Now: Mixed-Genre Literature," Giannina Braschi |publisher=World Literature Today |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to Müller, [[Tony Kushner]] declares, "Write into the void, learn to embrace isolation, in which we may commence undistractedly our dreadful but all-important dialogue with the dead. Forget about love and turn your face to history."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kushner's foreword to ''A Heiner Müller Reader"&lt;/ref&gt; With Müller's work, theater is a forum for examining history; it is "a dialogue with the dead."

'''Jonathan Young''' (born September 29, 1944) is a [[psychologist]] who became the founding curator of the [[Joseph Campbell]] Archives.

==Background==
Young developed an interest in the teaching functions of stories through early exposure to folklore. He was one of six children in a much-traveled family. His parents read and discussed the lore of each place they visited, such as the [[Little Mermaid]] in Copenhagen, the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] in Hamelin, the [[Arabian Nights]] in Baghdad, and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in India and Japan.&lt;ref name="folkstorybio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkstory.com/bio.html|title=Jonathan Young, Biographical Sketch|publisher=The Center for Story &amp; Symbol|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His graduate studies focused on the psychology of stories, and included work with [[Viktor Frankl]], [[Rollo May]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;ref name="folkstorybio" /&gt; He earned his Ph.D in Clinical Psychology from [[Alliant International University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty: University of Philosophical Research|url=http://www.uprs.edu/graduate-academics/faculty/|website=University of Philosophical Research|accessdate=27 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231040714/http://www.uprs.edu/graduate-academics/faculty/|archive-date=2014-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:JosephCampbell JonathanYoung.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Campbell with Jonathan Young, 1985.]]

Young is best known for his series of books, ''Saga: Best New Writings on Mythology.''&lt;ref name="sagafwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkstory.com/articles/sagafwd.html|title=SAGA - Best New Writing on Mythology|publisher=The Center for Story &amp; Symbol|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assisted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] for several years at seminars. In addition to the Campbell archives, he organized the collections of psychologist [[James Hillman]], and archeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]]. As a professor, Young created and chaired the Mythological Studies Department at the [[Pacifica Graduate Institute]],&lt;ref name=FolkstoryLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=A Letter from Stephen Aizenstat|url=http://www.folkstory.com/stephen_aizenstat_pacifica.html|website=Folkstory|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with Jungian theorists such as [[Robert Bly]], [[Marion Woodman]], [[Robert A. Johnson (psychotherapist)|Robert A. Johnson]], [[Jean Houston]], and [[Thomas Moore]].&lt;ref name="folkstorybio" /&gt;

In 1995, Dr. Young launched the Center for Story and Symbol in [[Santa Barbara, California]] to continue the work of [[Joseph Campbell]]. Through the center's programs, he presents seminars internationally on  the uses of mythic stories for therapists, writers, clergy, and teachers. He also teaches the [[Monomyth|hero's journey]] in screenwriting programs. He lectures occasionally at universities, such as [[UCLA]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], as well as ongoing courses in Mythopoetics at [[Pacifica Graduate Institute]].&lt;ref name="pacificafaculty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacifica.edu/11-pages/700-depth-psychology-faculty-bios-dja-2|title=Faculty - Pacifica Graduate Institute|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is featured in the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]]''. He also frequently appears on the History Channel and [[H2 (TV network)|H2]] television series [[Ancient Aliens]].&lt;ref name="PsychTodayDiamond"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diamond|first1=Stephen A.|title=Ancient Aliens, the Collective Unconscious, and the Quest for Meaning|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evil-deeds/201205/ancient-aliens-the-collective-unconscious-and-the-quest-meaning|accessdate=14 February 2017|publisher=Psychology Today|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magic''', along with its subgenres of, and sometimes referred to as '''illusion''', '''stage magic''' or '''close up magic''' is a [[performing art]] in which audiences are [[entertainment|entertained]] by staged tricks or [[illusion]]s of seemingly impossible feats using natural means.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Elise (3 May 2016).

It is one of the oldest [[performing arts]] in the world.

Modern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], has become a popular theatrical art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure|type=H.Res|number=642|date=March 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/642/text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne]] and [[David Devant|Devant]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Harry Kellar]], and [[Harry Houdini]] achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as "The Golden Age of Magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinmeyer|first=Jim|title=Hiding the Elephant|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, performance magic became a staple of [[Broadway theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]s. Magic retained its popularity in the [[Television|television age]], with magicians such as [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and [[David Blaine]] transitioning away from traditional venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Colin|date=2002|title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre|publisher=Continuum|page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "magic" etymologically derives from the Greek word ''mageia'' (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika''—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.
Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=THE ART OF DECEPTION or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[money]] games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and [[cult]]s from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Magic tricks===
{{See also|List of magic tricks}}
Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then "restore" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.

[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the "Decollation of John Baptist" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]
One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their "magic tricks" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were [[sleight-of-hand]] manipulations with rope, paper and coins.  At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians – Andi Gladwin&amp;nbsp;– Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209–213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).

[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]
Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]]. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, [[Isaac Fawkes]], who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:
{{quote|He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Christopher | first = Milbourne | title = Magic: A Picture History | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1991| location=New York|isbn=0-486-26373-8|page=16| origyear=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1756 to 1781, [[Jacob Philadelphia]] performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].

===Modern stage magic===
[[File:roberthoudin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], pioneer of modern magic entertainment]]
A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].

[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.

[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]
Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.
Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].&lt;ref name="Dawes_2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (February 10, 1844&amp;nbsp;– December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great.  Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the "first-family of magic".

The escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].

[[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905  to promote and advance the art of stage magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]] and [[Derren Brown]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].

Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.

==Types of magic performance==
Magic is often described according to various specialities or genres.
[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience]]
*'''[[Stage illusions]]''' are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]
*'''[[Parlor magic]]'''  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." Also, many magicians consider the term "parlor" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be "platform", "club" or "cabaret". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. 
*'''[[Micromagic]]''' (also known as '''close-up magic''' or '''table magic''') is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called "table magic", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.
*'''[[Escapology]]''' is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.
*'''[[Pickpocket]]''' magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].
*'''[[Mentalism]]''' creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].
*'''[[Theatrical séances]]''' simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.
*'''[[Children's magic]]''' is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.
*'''Online magic tricks''' were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]]''' is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].
*'''Corporate magic''' or '''trade show magic''' uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock&lt;ref name="Herz1991"&gt;Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive''(New York, NY: Avon Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guy Bavli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli – Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Gospel magic]]''' uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. Don Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.
*'''[[Street magic]]''' is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term "street magic" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].
*'''[[Bizarre magic]]''' uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the "godfather of bizarre magic". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.
*'''Shock magic''' is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as "geek magic", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,
*'''Comedy magic''' is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn &amp; Teller]].
*'''Quick change magic''' is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos &amp; Victoria Petrosyan.
*'''Camera magic''' (or "video magic") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.
*'''Classical Magic''' is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.

==Categories of effects==
Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider "penetrations" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Guy. "Waiting For Inspiration." Genii Magazine. January 2008 – December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Tom. "Lodestones." Genii Magazine. February 2009 -&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.

*'''Production''': The magician produces something from nothing—a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage—all of these effects are ''productions''.
*'''Vanish''': The magician makes something disappear—a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.
*'''Transformation''': The magician transforms something from one state into another—a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]
*'''Restoration''': The magician destroys an object—a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces—then restores it to its original state.
*'''Transposition''': This is whereby two or more objects are used in play. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. 
*'''Transportation''': The magician causes something to move from one place to another—a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.
*'''Escape''':  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.
*'''[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]''': The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few inches off the floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], and [[King levitation]]. The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and more recently by [[Peter Marvey]].  [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.
*'''Penetration''': The magician makes a solid object pass through another—a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as "solid-through-solid".
*'''Prediction''': The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event—a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate—under seemingly impossible circumstances.

Many magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in "[[cups and balls]]" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.

The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.

The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.

From the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.

Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.

The world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers.

Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. 
[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.

==Misuse of magic==

Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term "magician" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of "illusionist" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an "honest liar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.

Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.

Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[séance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;  Magician [[James Randi]], magic duo [[Penn and Teller|Penn &amp; Teller]], and the mentalist [[Derren Brown]] have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |work=SWIFT Newsletter |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ One-Million-Dollar Challenge] from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent [[faith healers]] have also been shown to employ [[sleight of hand]] to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet "tumors" from patients' abdomens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Skeptic's Dictionary |url= http://skepdic.com/psurgery.html |title= Psychic 'surgery' |author= Robert T. Carroll |date= 2009-02-23 |accessdate= 2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidence trick|Con men]] and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as "Find the Lady" or "[[Three-card Monte]]" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankenstein. "8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation," [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researching magic==

Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Magic &amp; magicians http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic&lt;/ref&gt; Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magicol.magicana.com/ |title=Magic Collectors |publisher=Magicana |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the [[Conjuring Arts Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conjuringarts.org/ |title=conjuringarts.org |publisher=conjuringarts.org |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.

Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=83646&amp;sid=620815#1981235 |title=Magicians – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the time.

Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author&lt;ref&gt;Bart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.

Several notable public research collections on magic are the ''WG Alma Conjuring Collection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic |title=Get started – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the State Library of Victoria; the ''R.

{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}
'''Max M. Leon''' (1904 &amp;ndash; November 2, 1984) was an [[impresario]], [[radio producer]], [[Conducting|conductor]], [[musicologist]], [[opera|opera manager]], [[referee]], and [[businessman]]. He had a wide array of talents and interests which led him towards a highly diversified career in many fields from running and owning [[WDAS (AM)]] from 1950 to 1979, refereeing for [[Polo]] sporting events, and owning and operating [[Whole-Sum Products]], a candy factory, for more than four decades. He also was a highly accomplished musician, serving as the founder and conductor of the [[Philadelphia Pops Orchestra]] and working as the General Manager of the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]].

==Biography==
Born in Poland to Jewish parents, Leon came to the United States at the age of 16. He began his career working for the [[Whole-Sum Products]] candy factory in [[Philadelphia]] in the 1920s during which time he also played a variety of instruments in "Max Leon and his Musical Eagles", a local dance band. Leon eventually became the General Manager of Whole-Sum Products and later bought the company in 1934, which he kept going into the 1970s. He notably forged a partnership with [[Breyers Ice Cream]], and the company invented their marshmallow ice cream flavor along with making other products for Breyers.

Leon continued to be active with several amateur musical groups in Philadelphia during the 1930s. He eventually ended up studying conducting with [[Paul Breisach]], a conductor at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Martin Rich]] at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]], and [[Eugene Ormandy]], famed director of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Leon financed and founded the [[Philadelphia Pops Orchestra]] in 1943 and became the principal conductor.  The orchestra was made up of musicians primarily from the Philadelphia Orchestra. He conducted concerts with the orchestra for many years. From 1963&amp;ndash;1975 he served as President of the Board for the [[Philadelphia Grand Opera Company]], also serving as general manager from 1972&amp;ndash;1975 after the departure of [[Anthony Terracciano]]. He oversaw that company's merger with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] (OCP) in 1975. From 1975&amp;ndash;1978 he served as OCP's first General Director.

On October 19, 1950, Leon bought WDAS-AM from William Goldman, moving the station from [[Ocean City, New Jersey]] to Philadelphia. He ran the station, which was marketed towards the black community, for almost three decades. In October 1979 he sold the station to the [[National Black Network]].

Leon died in Philadelphia in 1984. He was inducted posthumously into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame [http://www.broadcastpioneers.com] in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">{{Distinguish|Non-sequitur (logic)}}

A '''non-sequitur''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|n|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|ɛ|k|w|ᵻ|t|ər}}; {{IPA-la|noːn ˈsɛkᶣɪtʊr|classical}} "it does not follow") is a conversational [[Literary technique|literary device]], often used for comedic purposes. It is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; seems [[Absurdity|absurd]] to the point of being humorous or confusing.

This use of the term is distinct from the [[Non-sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur in logic]], where it is a [[fallacy]].

==Etymology==
The expression is [[Latin]] for "it does not follow."&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary. http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/non%20sequitur&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from the words "non" meaning not, and the [[Deponent verb|deponent]] verb ''sequor'', ''sequi'', ''secutus sum'' meaning 'to follow'. Deponent verbs have passive forms but active meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/Deponent.pdf|title=The Latin Library "Deponent Verbs"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
A non-sequitur can denote an abrupt, illogical, or unexpected turn in plot or dialogue by including a relatively inappropriate change in manner. A non-sequitur joke sincerely has no explanation, but it reflects the idiosyncrasies, mental frames and alternative world of the particular [[comic persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first1=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThJJP4b21DwC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Parody: The Art that Plays with Art |publisher=Peter Lang Publishers |year=2010 |page=75 |isbn= 978-1433108693 |accessdate=2014-09-17 |quote=Along with a rhythmic pattern, these jokes, however absurd they may be, build dual frames of reference, if not alternative worlds entirely reflecting the idiosyncrasies of the individual stand-up artist. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuntii Latini''' is a news service based in [[Finland]] that broadcasts in [[Latin]]. It has been broadcast since September 1989 by the Finnish national broadcaster [[Yle]] ''(Radiophonia Finnica Generalis)'' on the Yle Radio 1-channel.

== Station output ==
There is a weekly broadcast of recent world news and human interest. Articles are usually alternately read by a male and female announcer, in Latin. Pronunciation is, for the most part, "classical" and listeners can follow a written transcript of news items. A "Glossarium programmatis" is provided for each program translating 6 to 10 of the key Latin terms into Finnish, English, and German.

'''Oobi''' was a toy, invented by Larry Reiner and [[test market]]ed by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Philip E. Orbanes, ''The Game Makers: The Story of Parker Brothers, from Tiddledy Winks to Trivial Pursuit'', Harvard Business School Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59139-269-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was intended to pass a message to a recipient relying on "the kindness of strangers"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deuceofclubs.com/oobi/3pack.htm Oobiland's picture of the 3-pack]&lt;/ref&gt; as transport.

Physically, an Oobi is a bright orange oblong [[spheroid]] with a slit, an addressing area, and big painted-on eyes. They were sold in packs of three. The original purchaser was to write an address on the address area, place a folded message inside, and leave the toy somewhere public to be found. Instructions to the finder were written on the Oobi's top: "I'm oobi. I contain a message to another human being. Please further my journey an inch, a foot, or a mile. Add a note, if you wish. Then help me to the next nice person like yourself! I'm on my way to ... Please don't confine me to a mailbox."&lt;ref&gt;[http://deuceofclubs.com/oobi/who3.htm Oobiland's top view of an oobi.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of television advertisements and its slogan "oobi means love" it never caught on during trials on the [[West Coast of the United_States|West Coast]] and the Northeast, and has been described as the toy company's "wildest failure".&lt;ref&gt;Parker Brothers, ''90 Years of Fun: The History of the Parker Brothers'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peter Jackson's King Kong''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]], based on the [[2005 in film|2005]] film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''. The game was created in collaboration between the film's director [[Peter Jackson]], and game designer [[Michel Ancel]].

The game allows players to play as both Jack Driscoll and King Kong. The King Kong segments are played from a [[third-person perspective]], while human levels are played from a first-person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]], with the developers explaining that this conceivably would help players to get further immersed into the game.

It was released on PC and [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation]] platforms and a [[Nintendo DS]] version on November 21, 2005, while it was released on November 22, 2005 on the [[Xbox 360]] as a launch title, as well as a [[Game Boy Advance]] version titled ''Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World''; also, a [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released December 20, 2005. The film's cast members reprise their roles. 

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with critics praising the game's immersive environments, action sequences and ability to switch through two protagonists throughout the game. However, the DS version was panned due to the bugs featured in these versions. The PSP version received a mixed reception due to the shorter length and parts cut out from the console and PC versions.

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player assumes the roles of both New York scriptwriter [[Jack Driscoll]] and the giant gorilla, [[King Kong|Kong]] as they struggle to survive the threats of [[Skull Island]] in 1933.

Human levels are controlled from a first person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]]: it lacks a [[life bar]], aiming reticule, and ammunition readout (the ammo readout and aiming reticule can be turned on and off at the player's will, but will be disabled by default.), further adding to the challenge and encouraging the player to find alternate weapons and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/18/king-kongs-immersive-style|title=King Kong's Immersive Style|first=Matt|last=Casamassina|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 18, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspersed with human adventure are levels in which the player controls Kong himself, traversing Skull Island's unique geography, battling various giant monsters while defending Ann. The Kong levels take place in a third person view, as the player directs Kong to punch, grab and use objects/corpses as weapons. He can also bite, climb, charge, hurl enemies and even pound his chest to go into fury mode.&lt;ref name="EuroGRev"/&gt; When Kong is sent into fury mode, the sky becomes tinted with a golden hue and Kong becomes more powerful and less vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/peter_jackson_s_king_kong_ps2_review|title=Peter Jackson's King Kong - PS2 - Review|work=GameZone|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Kong sequences fulfill the role of boss fights, as the giant ape is able to effectively battle the gigantic creatures that Jack's weapons cannot harm.&lt;ref name="EuroGRev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_kingkong_x|title=Peter Jackson's King Kong: How Movie Games Should Be Done|first=Kristan|last=Reed|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=November 18, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{plot|date=December 2014}}
In 1933, film director [[Carl Denham]] ([[Jack Black]]), has gotten hold of a mysterious map, which reveals the secret location of a large island known as [[Skull Island]], a place located in the far reaches of the [[Indian Ocean]] (correctly the Pacific Ocean in the game). Carl hires playwright [[Jack Driscoll]] ([[Adrien Brody]]) to write his script and plucks a starving, out-of-work actress Ann Darrow ([[Naomi Watts]]) to play the part of leading lady and a tramp steamer called the ''Venture'' to take them to the island. The ship, controlled by [[Captain Englehorn]] ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]) arrives at the island on October 12, 1933. But due to the stormy seas and huge rocks, it can't get close enough to land so the crew orders the captain to send three [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s containing the cast, crew and a few sailors to the island and he does. However, the lifeboat containing Jack, Carl, Ann, Hayes ([[Evan Parke]]), and Briggs gets hit by a chunk of rock which falls from a large stone structure, tossing the party out into the sea.

Jack is horrified to find out that one of the sailors, Briggs is dead and the lifeboat completely wrecked. Hayes shoots out a distress signal, informing everyone that if Englehorn sees it, he'll come looking for them via the ship's plane. The group head upwards to a cave entrance leading into a dark, flooded cave. After fighting off several giant crabs with their 9mm Luger P08 pistols, they head towards the exit and move out onto a rocky outcrop, to the left there is a rocky slope leading down to a stony beach. Carl suggest shooting some test shots for his movie, he asks Ann to scream and her classic damsel-in-distress style wailing is answered by a loud roar. The director and his men are suddenly attacked by huge crabs that crawl out from the shore, rifles raised, the men shoot the miniature tanks down, but a huge bellow erupts from the water. A 30-foot crab emerges from the murk and knocks over a wooden platform supported by wooden beams which is standing next to the slope. After much man-made commotion the creature is defeated, and they move on through a gigantic wooden door. Jack has the option of swapping his Luger for a Winchester Model 1897 pump-action shotgun.

The party progress forward, meeting up with the second lifeboat containing Preston ([[Colin Hanks]]), Jimmy ([[Jamie Bell]]) and Lumpy ([[Andy Serkis]]), although it cannot land because of the strong current of the sea. The team continue traversing the island, battling with many vicious [[Animal|creature]]s, and are eventually forced to split up. Jack crosses a wooden bridge, but after he crosses it, it breaks. Ann insists on going with him and climbs up to the cliff above Jack. After a huge battle with Megapedes and Scorpiopedes through a seemingly abandoned [[village]], Jack and Ann are captured by the island Natives. Jack gets to use a Mauser Gewehr 98 sniper rifle, but loses it.

When Jack wakes up tied to a stake, he can only watch as Ann is taken by Kong, a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} gorilla during a native sacrifice. Carl eventually rescues Jack and the two give chase. During the dangerous journey through the jungle, they have an encounter with ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Venatosaurus]]'' who are feasting on a dead ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Ferrucutus]]''. Jack and Carl reunite with Hayes after defeating a pack of ''Venatosaurus'' with the last weapon, a .45 caliber [[Thompson submachine gun]] with a 50-round drum magazine. Soon after, they meet up with Preston, Lumpy, Jimmy and Baxter, who are crossing a bridge, but they are attacked by a ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Vastatosaurus rex]]''. Lumpy is torn apart, Jimmy and Baxter fall down into the crevasse, but Preston got to the other side. Jack is separated from Carl and Hayes, who tell him to continue look for Ann. Jack eventually finds Ann, but she is kidnapped by a ''Terapusmordax''. Kong comes to the rescue and saves Ann. Jack continues on into the canyon, where he sees a migrating herd of ''[[Skull Island#2005 remake|Brontosaurus]]'', and also battles Megapedes and Scorpio-Pedes. A ''V. rex'' attacks the sauropods and Jack meets up with Carl and Hayes, and continue on their path. In the jungle, they come across Jimmy, who is being attacked by the "Venatosaurs". They eventually meet up on a raft, where Jimmy tells the group that everyone is dead. After escaping the Skull Islanders the team are pursued by two "V.rexes". Kong comes to the rescue and kills them. As the teams continue their journey, they enter a swamp, and fight against strange-looking Udusaurs. After leaving the swamp, Kong interrupts their log crossing and tips them into a huge ravine. Carl's camera is broken and he gives up, heading downstream towards the Venture. Jack, Jimmy and Hayes continue their pursuit of Ann. 

Jack eventually saves Ann from a ''V. rex'', and the party continue the adventure to find a long stretch of water of which the seaplane can land on. After fighting off some ''Venatosaurus'' and a juvenile ''V. rex'' in a cave, and leaving a swamp, they finally come across a long stretch of water. Captain Englehorn, in his seaplane, lands on the water. However, he takes flight as a ''V. rex'' follows them into a large area cluttered with ancient stone ruins. The monster breaks through the barricade and begins smashing down their shelter. Ann signals for Kong to come. Eventually, Kong comes to save them while Jack shoots some ''Terapusmordax'' to distract the carnivore. As Hayes tries to stop the fight, opening fire on Kong, the ''V. rex'' charges at Kong and inadvertently steps on Hayes, injuring him. Jack and Jimmy stand over Hayes, who tells Jimmy before he dies to get back to the ship. Jack and Jimmy fight many raptors and head back to the stretch of water and find the seaplane. Jimmy climbs in (there is only one passenger seat) and Jack climbs up into the mountains to save Ann.

Jack discovers Kong's lair and kills two juvenile ''V. rex'' and the [[Skull Island#2005 remake|Skin-Birds]] roosting above the entrance. He rescues Ann while Kong fights several cave serpents. After leaving the jungle, Jack and Ann arrive at The Wall, Ann is captured by the natives once again until Kong comes to get her. He saves her then heads for the shore. Kong gets gassed by sailors once he reaches the shore. He eventually passes out and is taken to [[New York City]], where he is put on display on Broadway. Kong isn't held captive for long and wanders New York in search of Ann. He eventually finds her and, after destroying many army trucks and making a tip of Manhattan, he takes her up the Empire State Building. He tries to destroy a swarm of biplanes but is eventually shot down. Carl stands beside Kong's body and says "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty that killed the Beast."

The alternate ending occurs if the player defeats enough biplanes as Kong, and then destroys the army's searchlights, Kong will climb down the Empire State Building and a cut scene will play of Kong roaring on the top of his homeland, having been safely returned. To unlock the alternate ending, players must complete the entire game and then go back and play through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points. It can also be accessed by using the cheat codes.

==Release==
The Xbox 360 release featured improved graphics and audio over the sixth generation console releases. The second PC version, known as the "Gamer's Edition", (originally only available with select graphics cards and later offered on game download services) also included these improved features.

The "Special Edition" version of the game was available for a limited time. Along with the two standard game discs, included are: A [[bonus disc]], containing concept art and a screensaver; and a [[making-of]] disc, containing a featurette with Peter Jackson. There was an error in the printing of the discs and the disc labelled "Making of" was actually the "Bonus" disc and vice versa. The signature edition also comes with a [[Topps]] trading card of King Kong, a code for a downloadable [[ringtone]], and a cover signed by Peter Jackson.

===Technical issues===
Symptomatic of early seventh generation console games, the Xbox 360 version was only correctly set up for [[HDTV]], leaving the image on standard-definition TVs very dark and unsatisfactory for gameplay. As a result, Ubisoft recommended fans buy the Xbox version until a fix for the problem was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4525318.stm|title=TV glitch mars Xbox 360 Kong game | work=BBC News | date=December 14, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch was eventually released. The Xbox version is not backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 and the Xbox 360 version is not currently backwards compatible with the Xbox One.

The retail PC version is also known to utilize the StarForce copy protection system, which may cause unforeseen difficulties for players, especially those using Microsoft Windows 7. No patch has been released by the publisher to remedy this problem. However, the Gamer's Edition of the game is still playable on Windows 7 and in Windows 10 with no issues.

The Xbox 360 version of the game also had poorly coded shaders, allowing homebrew and unsigned code to run on the Xbox 360 through modified disc images of the game, which exploited the shader engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox 360 King Kong Exploit|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson%27s_King_Kong#Xbox_360_King_Kong_Exploit|website=Wikipedia|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

The PC and console versions received critical acclaim, with critics praising the game's immersive environments, action sequences and ability to switch through two protagonists throughout the game. However, the Nintendo DS version was widely panned by reviewers because of [[software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es, poor level design and enemy [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]].&lt;ref name=GRDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/926306-peter-jacksons-king-kong-the-official-game-of-the-movie/index.html|title=Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie for DS|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGNDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/03/peter-jacksons-king-kong-2|title=Peter Jackson's King Kong (DS)|last=Nix|first=Marc|publisher=IGN|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DS version was listed in the 'Flat-Out Worst Game' list of [[GameSpot]]'s Best &amp; Worst of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=3&amp;page=10|title=Best of 2005 - Flat-Out Worst Game}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP version received mixed reception, mainly for a shorter length, as well as cut down features from the console and PC versions.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Non-video game publications gave the game generally positive reviews as well. ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a favorable review and stated, "The sense of immersion is increased by the game's first-person perspective and an absence of on-screen clutter. There is no health gauge blocking your view; if a dinosaur bites you, your vision blurs, indicating that one more bite will kill you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/sports/othersports/10vide.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0|title=Chasing a Girl on Kong's Island, and Other Pursuits|last=Herold|first=Charles|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

== Predecessor Promotion History ==

The World Series of Fighting (WSOF) formed in 2012, having signed a broadcast deal with the [[NBC Sports Network]].

==2018 PFL inaugural season==

=== Season Format ===
The PFL 2018 season has 72 fighters in six weight-classes, competing in seven regular season events on Thursday nights in June, July, and August. The top eight in each weight-class will face-off in bracket-style, single elimination playoff fights on Saturday nights in October. The PFL 2018 season will conclude on December 31 with six championship bouts back-to-back with a $10 million prize pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2018/04/16/professional-fighters-league-pfl-mma-format-roster-schedule-and-free-tv-model-revealed/)|title=Professional Fighters League's MMA Format, Roster, Schedule And Free-TV Model Revealed|last=Mazique|first=Brian|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fight Format and Point System ===
PFL uses the [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] regulated by the [[Nevada Athletic Commission|Nevada State Athletic Commission]]. The League uses a unique ten-sided (decagon) cage for their events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pflmma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rules-and-Regulations-v12.pdf|title=PFL Rules and Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=PFL MMA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight fighters with the most points in each weight class advance will advance to the playoff rounds. The point system consists of outcome-based scoring and bonuses for an early win. Under the outcome-based scoring system, the winner of a fight receives three points and the loser receives zero points. If the fight ends in a draw, both fighters will receive one point. The bonus for winning a fight in the first, second, or third round is three points, two points, and one point, respectively. For example, if a fighter wins a fight in the first round, the fighter will receive six total points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsday.com/sports/mixed-martial-arts/a-look-at-how-the-professional-fighters-league-points-system-works-1.19033262|title=A look at how the PFL’s points system works|work=Newsday|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released on October 9, 2012 by [[Full Moon Features]].

==Plot==
Ozu, the villain from the previous film, walks down a dark alley only to be stopped by Kommandant Moebius, the Nazi general. Ozu offers him the puppet Tunneler, in exchange for her freedom. Moebius gladly takes the prize, which immediately kills SS Soldier #1. Moebius "sets her free" by shooting her in the head. While this takes place, the puppet Blade watches from the shadows. The next morning, Danny and Beth are recovering at Danny's house. Danny tells the rest of the puppets that he couldn't revive Ninja, but they will get back Tunneler. Blade appears and informs them of Ozu's death and Tunneler's capture by the Nazis. Danny and Beth respond to a knock at the door only to be grabbed by mysterious men in suits. Meanwhile, in a secret lab in Chinatown, Docter Freuhoffer, a captured Austrian doctor with a fixation on dolls, is working for Moebius to develop a machine that can reanimate the dead. The seductive Uschi, a Nazi, tries to motivate the doctor only to be interrupted by Moebius. He demands a demonstration of the machine. He brings in a Japanese man and slits his throat. The machine makes him walk for a moment only for him to decay and fall down. Freuhoffer promises to fix the machine. Moebius reminds him that if he doesn't, his daughter will be killed. He then presents him with Tunneler to study.

Danny and Beth are revealed to have been taken to a military base. Major Collins commends them for thwarting the bombing of the weapons factory. He also informs Danny that General Porter will be in town and that he will present him with a medal. To protect them, he has Sergeant Stone assigned as their bodyguard. Back at the lab, Moebius and Uschi are discussing the machine and what it will mean for him. A soldier enters and informs him of General Porter's arrival. Back at Beth's house, Stone is settling in and getting on Beth's nerves with his sexist attitude. Back at the lab, Freuhoffer is examining Tunneler when Uschi enters and tries to again seduce him. Moebius enters and in a rage shoots Uschi through the head. Danny, Beth, and Stone eat and discuss how they can help their cause when Danny thinks Stone should be introduced to the puppets. Freuhoffer tries using the fluid he extracted from Tunneler in his machine to revive Uschi but it fails. Danny introduces a dumbfounded Stone to the puppets and tells him that the Nazi's have one of them that needs to be recovered. Freuhoffer shows Moebius his newest creation, Bombshell, a puppet made in Uschi's image with machineguns in her chest. Moebius, while amused, still wants his machine completed.

Danny and the others take Blade and Pinhead to Chinatown to locate the Nazi base. They are ambushed by Bombshell and must retreat. Bombshell returns to the lab and Freuhoffer presents three other puppets Weremacht, a werewolf, Blitzkrieg, a tank, and Kamikaze, a walking bomb. Danny and the others are preparing for the award ceremony when Leech Woman tries to tell them something. During the awards, Freuhoffer's puppets attack, and kill Major Collins. Danny's puppets take them on but are beaten back. Porter, grateful to Danny, allows him to enter the army. Danny and the others ponder how to stop the Nazi puppets when Leech Woman pulls out Six-shooter's head. They locate the lab and take out the Nazi guards. Once inside, they locate and recover Tunneler, but are stopped by Moebius and Freuhoffer's puppets. The puppets fight and this time the Nazi puppets are beaten. Beth holds Freuhoffer at gunpoint, but lets him explain himself. Moebius and Stone fight and just as Stone gets the upper hand, Moebius stabs and kills him. Moebius comes at Danny, but is shot down by Six-shooter. Moebius, still alive, pulls out a gun and plans to shoot Danny, who states "Never screw with America". Blade then comes from behind and stabs Moebius. Beth and Freuhoffer come out and tells Kamikaze to detonate, destroying the lab and Moebius. Danny and Beth let Freuhoffer go but as he leaves the others didn't notice he has a bottle of the puppets' fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puppet Master X: Axis Rising Poster Premiere|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/59585/puppet-master-x-axis-rising-poster-premiere|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randai''' is a folk theater tradition of the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] ethnic group which incorporates music, singing, dance, drama and the martial art of [[silat]]. ''Randai'' is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals, and complex stories may span a number of nights.&lt;ref name="Pauka1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Daughters Take Over?

Stories are delivered by both the acting and the singing and are mostly based upon Minangkabau legends and folktales.&lt;ref name="Pauka1998"/&gt; ''Randai'' originated early in the 20th century out of fusion of local martial arts, story-telling and other performance traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Look at the Clouds: Migration and West Sumatran ‘Popular’ Theatre |last=Cohen |first=Matthew Isaac |journal=New Theatre Quarterly |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=214–229 |year=2003 |doi=10.1017/S0266464X03000125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men originally played both the male and female characters in the story, but since the 1960s women have also participated.&lt;ref name="Pauka1998"/&gt;

'''SW Radio Africa''' was an independent [[Zimbabwe]] [[radio station]] that broadcast from [[London]], [[England]], from 19 December 2001 to 10 August 2014. With the government of [[Robert Mugabe]] keeping a tight rein on the airwaves, the station produced and presented news and current affairs programmes for broadcast in Zimbabwe on [[short wave]] and on the Internet. Staffed and run by Zimbabweans in exile, it aimed to promote democracy and free speech, and to counter the mis-information and [[hate speech]] broadcast by the Zimbabwe state media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The station's website, www.swradioafrica.com, featured live [[online streaming]].

==In popular culture==
In ''The Last Resort: A Memoir of Zimbabwe'' (Chapter 4), journalist [[Douglas Rogers (writer)|Douglas Rogers]] says of two of his parents' employees: "It was only later that I learned the two Johns were fervent MDC supporters and had been for years. It was one of the reasons my father kept them both on. He enjoyed speaking to them about politics, and it was why he had given them his old shortwave radio: so that they could tune into SW Africa, the pro-democracy station that broadcast out of London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogers, Douglas|title=The Last Resort: A Memoir of Zimbabwe|page=28|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Texas Film Hall of Fame''' honors Texans who have made a significant contribution to [[film]] or filmmaking, as well as non-Texans who have made significant strides in the advancement of the Texan film industry. Classic Texas films are also honored, with a member of the cast or crew accepting on behalf of their colleagues. New inductees are announced at the annual Texas Film Awards, organised by the [[Austin Film Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Dani |title=Shirley MacLaine and Producer Sarah Green to Be Honored at 2017 Texas Film Awards |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/shirley-maclaine-sarah-green-texas-film-awards-2017-1201974869/ |accessdate=19 August 2018 |publisher=Variety |date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Fame and associated awards ceremony were co-founded in 2001 by [[Louis Black]], the editor of the [[Austin Chronicle]], and [[Evan Smith (journalist)|Evan Smith]], Editor-In-Chief and CEO of The Texas Tribune and former editor of [[Texas Monthly]].  

==Awards gala==
For its first 11 years, the gala celebration was held at [[Austin Studios]], the site of the city's onetime municipal airport, now converted into film production studios. In 2012, the Awards were held in downtown Austin at ACL Live at The Moody Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Kimberley |title=Team Spirit: The 2012 Texas Film Hall of Fame Awards |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2012-03-02/team-spirit/ |accessdate=19 August 2018 |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2017 the awards were once again held at Austin Studios, before moving to the newly-opened AFS Cinema in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas Film Awards: Overview |url=https://www.austinfilm.org/texas-film-awards/overview/ |website=Austin Film Society |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:TexasFilmHallofFame_Paxton.jpg | thumb|right | Bill Paxton, 2007 Inductee]] --&gt;

From 2002 to 2005 the gala was emceed by [[Ann Richards]], the former governor of Texas, who died on September 13, 2006. The 2007 gala commemorated her death by celebrating her life and her passion for film, emceed by New York columnist and 2001 inductee [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]]. Other galas have been emceed by [[Turk Pipkin]], [[Evan Smith (journalist)|Evan Smith]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Wyatt Cenac]], [[Anjelah Johnson]], [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Mike Judge]] and [[Louis Black]].

As well as inducting new members to the Hall of Fame, the awards ceremonies include various other presentations. The specific awards presented [[#Other awards|differs each year]], but common ones include the Rising Star Award, the Honorary Texan Award and the [[Ann Richards]] Award. The [[Warren Skaaren]] Lifetime Achievement Award has been presented on three occasions:  Mike Simpson (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warren Simpson |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A258669}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Valenti]] (2002) and Michael Nesmith (2010).&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas Film Hall of Fame |url=https://www.austinfilm.org/texas-film-awards/texas-film-hall-of-fame/ |website=Austin Film Society |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Black Rose''''' is a 1950 [[20th Century Fox]] [[Technicolor]] film starring [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Orson Welles]], loosely based on [[Thomas B. Costain]]'s book. It was filmed partly on location in [[England]] and [[Morocco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Rose (1950)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_rose/|publisher=Rotten tomatoes|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which substitutes for the [[Gobi Desert]] of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Rose(1950)|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/the-black-rose/|publisher=Yahoo movies|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reunited the earlier film's two stars.
 
[[Talbot Jennings]]' screenplay was based on a popular [[The Black Rose (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Canada|Canadian]] author [[Thomas B. Costain]], published in 1945, introducing an anachronistic [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] rebellion against the [[Normans|Norman]] aristocracy as a vehicle for launching the protagonists on their journey to the [[Orient]]. 

It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costumes-Color]] at the [[23rd Academy Awards]] ([[Michael Whittaker (costume designer)|Michael Whittaker]]). &lt;ref name="Oscars1951"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1951 |title=The 23rd Academy Awards (1951) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=April 3, 2014|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Image:TheBlackRoseshot.jpg|left|thumb|Tyrone Power and Cécile Aubry]]
The story begins in [[England]] approximately a [[century]] and a half after the [[Norman Conquest]], or around 1300 A.D. [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] scholar Walter of Gurnie is the [[illegitimate son]] of the [[Earl]] of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his father's [[Normans|Norman]] widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into [[exile]] when he is recognized.

Walter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in [[Cathay]] during the times of [[Pax Mongolica]].  Walter seeks the [[patronage]] of Mongol warlord General [[Bayan of the Baarin|Bayan of the Hundred Eyes]] and agrees to fight for him. 

The "Black Rose" of the title is{{why|reason=Why is the rose that she is black? She is blonde, so it's not her hair.|date=July 2018}} the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the [[harem]] Bayan is escorting to China.  Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the [[Camel train|caravan]]. Maryam loves Walter, but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesn't like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him because she wants to go to England.

Bayan sends Walter on a mission to see the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] Empress of China. When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as a "guest" for the rest of his life. Then he finds Tristram and Maryam had also been captured and imprisoned. During this time, Walter realizes he loves Maryam. The three of them decide to escape. Tristram dies. The small boat in which Maryam is waiting for Walter in drifts away before Walter can catch her. Walter returns to England alone. 

Walter is welcomed back by the Norman [[Edward I of England|King Edward]] because of all the cultural and scientific knowledge (including [[gunpowder]]) he has brought back from China. The king [[knight]]s Walter and grants him a [[coat of arms]]. Two Mongol emissaries from Bayan show up. They have brought the Black Rose to England to join Walter there.

==Cast==
* [[Tyrone Power]] as Walter of Gurnie
* [[Orson Welles]] as Bayan
* [[Cécile Aubry]] as Maryam
* [[Jack Hawkins]] as Tristram Griffen
* [[Michael Rennie]] as King Edward
* [[Finlay Currie]] as Alfgar
* [[Herbert Lom]] as Anthemus
* [[Mary Clare]] as Countess Eleanor of Lessford
* [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as Mahmoud

* [[Gibb McLaughlin]] as Wilderkin
* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Simeon Beautrie
* [[Henry Oscar]] as Friar [[Roger Bacon]]
* [[Laurence Harvey]] as Edmond

==Production==
It was the first movie Henry Hathaway directed after an operation for cancer. He had a doctor with him on set. Hathaway later said he felt the movie was badly cast, saying Jack Hawkins was "too old" for his role ("it should have been played by someone like [[Van Johnson]]") and that [[Cecile Aubry]] "didn't have a lick of sense. I tried to get [[Leslie Caron]] but Caron said she loved ballet and didn't want to be in pictures." He also says he and [[Orson Welles]] got along "terrible" because Welles would not follow direction. "It pleased him to outwit people. That was the trouble with him throughout his career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.|page=148|title=Just Making Movies|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reception==
Trade papers called the film a "notable box office attraction" in British cinemas in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xtGIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=hungry+hill+film+box+office&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MTsQXadYDw&amp;sig=2h-5aG3Vy4tT_h1mlC4mfRi18JQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ8b6P1YHMAhVEFqYKHcy9BF8Q6AEIMzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=hungry%20hill%20film%20box%20office&amp;f=false Robert Murphy, ''Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48'' 2003 p213]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
There are unsubstantiated stories regarding a 40 second scene in the movie where the bodies of two Moroccan peasants can be seen hanging from a tree. The two bodies were said to have been offered to the movie director by a French colonel called Louis Morin (or Moran) due to his admiration for actor Orson Welles. The movie was shot in Morocco, which was a French colony at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-scandalous-story-behind-Black-Rose-1950-the-movie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Deadly Tower of Monsters''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[top-down shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[ACE Team]] and published by [[Atlus USA]], which released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 4]] on 19 January 2016.

== Gameplay ==
{{expand-section|date=November 2016}}
''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' is a top-down shooter with twin-stick controls and melee combat elements. A jetpack can be used to reach high areas.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/review-the-deadly-tower-of-monsters-334028.phtml | title = Review: The Deadly Tower of Monsters | last = Carter | first = Chris | date = 19 January 2016 | website = [[Destructoid]] | publisher = [[ModernMethod]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' follows three actors in the movie of the same name. It is inspired by 1950's [[science fiction]] movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2015/12/03/atlus-launches-1970s-sci-fi-game-the-deadly-tower-of-monsters-on-january-19th/ | title = Atlus Launches 1970s Sci-Fi Game The Deadly Tower Of Monsters On January 19th | last = Priestman | first = Chris | date = 3 December 2015 | website = [[Siliconera]] | publisher = [[Curse, Inc.]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's [[framing device]] is that of an early 1970s [[B-movie]] ''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' recently released on DVD, with the director's commentary of its in-universe director Dan Smith serving as a combination of tutorial and meta-commentary on the game, providing an explanation as to why many default elements of shooters would be in what is ostensibly a film (the player being required to break boxes to obtain items, for example, is taken as the lead actor [[ad-libbing]] on Smith's advice to make sure every moment was somewhat exciting). The film itself is a space opera in which astronaut Dick Starspeed (played in-universe by actor Jonathan Digby) being shot down on an alien planet ruled by a tyrannical emperor.

== Development ==
''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' was announced on 12 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/06/12/deadly-tower-of-monsters-zeno-clash-devs/ | title = ACE Team's The Deadly Tower Of Monsters Announced | last = O'Connor | first = Alice | date = 12 June 2015 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer was released on 2 December 2015. The game was released on 19 January 2016.

== Reception ==
''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' received mostly positive reviews. The game has a score of 73/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-deadly-tower-of-monsters/critic-reviews | title = The Deadly Tower of Monsters Critic Reviews for PC | website = [[Metacritic]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destructoid]]'' awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying "''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' is a fleeting experience, but one that no B-movie fan should go without."&lt;ref name="Destructoid" /&gt; [[PlayStation LifeStyle]] awarded it 7.5 out of 10, saying "Just like the movies it tries to emulate, the game is so bad with its special effects, dialogue, and set-pieces that it's rather good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/01/19/the-deadly-tower-of-monsters-review-so-bad-its-good/ | title = The Deadly Tower of Monsters Review – So Bad It's Good (PS4) | last = Honea | first = Keri | date = 19 January 2016 | website = [[PlayStation LifeStyle]] | publisher = [[CraveOnline]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' awarded it a 4 out of 5 saying "Minor issues aside, ''The Deadly Tower of Monsters'' is a pleasant surprise indeed and a particularly impressive budget action game showcasing a lot of creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/01/23/review-the-deadly-tower-of-monsters/188756/ | title = Review: The Deadly Tower of Monsters | last = LeClair | first = Kyle | date = 23 January 2016 | website = [[Hardcore Gamer]] | accessdate = 2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sims 3: Into the Future''''' is the eleventh and final expansion pack for ''[[The Sims 3]]'' series from [[Electronic Arts]] and was released on October 22, 2013 in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 6, 2013|url=http://simsvip.com/2013/05/06/future-themed-ep-last-game-for-sims-3-series/|title="Future Themed" EP, Last Game for Sims 3 Series|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available for both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|OS X]]. In Europe it was released on October 24, 2013 and in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sims 3 goes back ... back to the future|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/23/the-sims-3-goes-back-back-to-the-future/|website=[[Engadget]]|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The expansion is [[futuristic]] themed. Upon installation, players may be visited by a time traveller in their home neighborhood, who gives their sims his time portal for use upon receiving help from the player. Using this portal, sims can travel to the future, into a new sub-neighborhood called "Oasis Landing", a futuristic town built amongst mountainous wastelands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simsvip.com/2013/07/23/sims-3-into-the-future-fact-sheet-official-screens/|title=Sims 3 Into the Future Fact Sheet + Official Screens|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2018|publisher=SimsVIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumbots (similar to simbots and servos in previous sim games) are a major addition to the expansion. They can be built and fully customized with the new "Create-A-Bot" mode, and players can create various trait chips that determines their personality, use and gameplay. Hoverboards, jetpacks, [[monorails]] and hovercars are introduced to the game as new [[transportation]] options. New careers include [[astronomers]] and bot dealers. New objects include [[holographic]] TVs, food synthesizers, build-a-bot workshops and the laser rythimacon, a new instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.thesims3.com/community/blog.html?blogid=513639|title=The Sims 3 Community Blog: Let's go...INTO THE FUTURE!!|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2018|website=thesims3.com|publisher=Electronic Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sims are also able to visit their future [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s during time travel, and can change or eliminate these descendants altogether if the player sends the sim back to the present and changes their lifestyle or fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesims.com/en_GB/the-sims-3-into-the-future|title=The Sims™ 3 Into the Future|accessdate=August 13, 2013|publisher=Electronic Arts|website=thesims.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130814000446/http://thesims.com/en_GB/the-sims-3-into-the-future|archivedate=August 14, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
On January 8, 2013, it was revealed on the live broadcast that [[Electronic Arts]] plans to release a futuristic-themed expansion pack which was still in the early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 8, 2013|url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=732234|title=EA Reveals The Sims 3 Line-Up for 2013 Including New Expansion and Stuff Packs|accessdate=January 7, 2018|publisher=Electronic Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinitron''' is [[Sony]]'s [[brand name]] for its line of [[aperture grille|aperture-grille]]-based [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] used in [[television set]]s and [[computer display]]s. One of the first truly new{{vague|date=December 2017}} television systems to enter the market since the 1950s, the Trinitron was announced in 1968 to wide acclaim for its bright images, about 25% brighter than common [[shadow mask]] televisions of the same era. Constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed Sony to charge a premium for Trinitron devices into the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Patent protection on the basic Trinitron design ran out in 1996, and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices. Sony responded by introducing their flat-screen [[FD Trinitron]] designs (WEGA), which maintained their premier position in the market into the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, these designs were surpassed relatively quickly by [[plasma television|plasma]] and [[LCD television|LCD]] designs. Sony removed the last Trinitron televisions from their product catalogs in 2006, and ceased production in early 2008. Video monitors are the only remaining Trinitron products being produced by Sony, at a low production rate, although the basic technology can still be found in downmarket televisions from third parties.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The name Trinitron was derived from ''[[Trinity (disambiguation)|trinity]]'', meaning the union of three, and ''tron'' from elec''tron'' tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-12/h7.html "You Guys Can Do It!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922033857/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-12/h7.html |date=2008-09-22 }} - Sony Global - Sony History&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Color television===

[[File:Trinitron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 1970s tabletop size Trinitron]]

{{main|Color television}}

Color television had been studied,{{when|date=December 2017}} but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem{{clarify|date=December 2017}} was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most{{which|date=December 2017}} systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or "[[Color gel|gel]]") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the United States Federal Communication Commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from [[CBS]] as their color broadcast in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html "CBS Field Sequential Color System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105183213/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html |date=2010-01-05 }}, 24 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RCA]] worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the "[[luminance]]". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a [[composite video]] signal &amp;ndash; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be extracted, decoded back into RGB, and displayed.

Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the [[Color television#Compatible color|compatible color]] encoding scheme originally developed by [[Georges Valensi]] in 1938, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of [[electron gun]]s of the era, and RCA's early experiments used three-tube projectors, or mirror-based systems known as "[[Triniscope]]".&lt;ref name=rca&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html "RCA Dot Sequential Color System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107142004/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html |date=2010-01-07 }}, 28 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow masks===

{{main|Shadow mask}}

RCA eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the [[shadow mask]]. The shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes [[Photolithography|photo etched]] into it, placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube. Three guns, arranged in a triangle, were all aimed at the holes. Stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask, creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen. Since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle, the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap.

The disadvantage of this approach was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority of the energy. To ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This led to very dim images, requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Gould, "Television in Review: NBC Color", ''The New York Times'', 4 January 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this early start, only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun, consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start. The dim images, constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own. Low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming, further reducing the demand for the sets in a [[supply and demand]] problem. In the United States in 1960, only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total.&lt;ref name=s42&gt;''Sony'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromatron===

{{main|Chromatron}}

Sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white [[TV8-301]], the first non-projection type all-transistor television.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, "A History of Industrial Design", Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983, pg. 208&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of factors, including its small screen size, limited its sales to niche markets. Sony engineers had been studying the color market, but the situation in Japan was even worse than the U.S.; they accounted for only 300 of the 9 million sets sold that year.&lt;ref name=s42/&gt; But by 1961, dealers were asking the Sony sales department when a color set would be available, and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn. [[Masaru Ibuka]], Sony's president and co-founder, steadfastly refused to develop a system based on RCA's shadow mask design, which he considered technically deficient. He insisted on developing a unique solution.&lt;ref&gt;''Sony'', pg. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, a Sony delegation was visiting the [[IEEE]] trade show in [[New York City]], including Ibuka, [[Akio Morita]] (Sony's other co-founder) and [[Nobutoshi Kihara]], who was promoting his new [[CV-2000]] home [[video tape recorder]]. This was Kihara's first trip abroad and he spent much of his time wandering the trade floor, where he came across a small booth by the small company [[Autometric]]. They were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the [[Chromatron]] tube, which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask. The resulting image was far brighter than anything the RCA design could produce, and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments. He quickly brought Morita and Ibuka to see the design, and Morita was "sold" on the spot.&lt;ref name=s44&gt;''Sony'', pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sony Chromatron.jpg|thumb|Sony Chromatron|210x210px]]

Morita arranged a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]], who was paying for Chromatic Labs' development of the Chromatron, taking over the entire project. In early 1963, Senri Miyaoka was sent to Manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic Labs. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as "squalor".&lt;ref name=s44/&gt; The American team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the Chromatron system, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17-inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Sony engineers were unable to make a version of Chromatron that could be reliably mass-produced.&lt;ref name=s44/&gt;

When sets were finally made available in late 1964, they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen (US$550), but cost the company over 400,000 yen (US$1111.11) to produce. Ibuka had bet the company on Chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable. After several thousand sets had shipped, the situation was no better, while [[Panasonic]] and [[Toshiba]] were in the process of introducing sets based on RCA licenses. By 1966, the Chromatron was breaking the company financially.&lt;ref&gt;''Sony'', pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinitron===
[[File:Sony Trinitron logo.svg|150px|thumbnail|right|The Sony Trinitron logo used from 1992 to the 2000s.]]
In the autumn of 1966, Ibuka finally gave in, and announced he would personally lead a search for a replacement for Chromatron. Susumu Yoshida was sent to the U.S. to look for potential licenses, and was impressed with the improvements that RCA had made in overall brightness by introducing new [[Rare earth elements|rare earth]] [[phosphor]]s on the screen. He also saw [[General Electric]]'s "Porta-color" design,  using three guns in a row instead of a triangle, which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit. His report was cause for concern in Japan, where it seemed Sony was falling ever-farther behind the U.S. designs. They might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive.&lt;ref name=s46&gt;''Sony'', pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibuka was not willing to give up entirely, and had his 30 engineers explore a wide variety of approaches to see if they could come up with their own design. At one point, Yoshida asked [[Senri Miyaoka]] if the in-line gun arrangement used by GE could be replaced by a single gun with three [[cathode]]s; this would be more difficult to build, but be lower cost in the long run.{{how|date=December 2017}} Miyaoka built a prototype and was astonished by how well it worked, although it had focusing problems.&lt;ref name=s46/&gt; Later that week{{when|date=December 2017}}, on Saturday, Miyaoka was summoned to Ibuka's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice. Yoshida had just informed Ibuka about his success, and the two asked Miyaoka if they could really develop the gun into a workable product. Miyaoka, anxious to leave, answered yes, excused himself, and left. The following Monday, Ibuka announced that Sony would be developing a new color television tube, based on Miyaoka's prototype.&lt;ref name=s47&gt;''Sony'', pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1967, the focusing problems had been solved, and because there was a single gun, the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil, and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

During development, Sony engineer Akio Ohgoshi introduced another modification. GE's system improved on the RCA shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles. Since the guns were in-line, their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots, about doubling the lit area. Ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead, lighting the entire screen. Although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors, with Miyaoka's new tube, this appeared possible.&lt;ref name=s47/&gt; In practice, this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube &amp;ndash; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped, resulting in shifting colors on the screen. This problem was solved by running several fine [[tungsten]] wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place.

The combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the [[aperture grille]] resulted in a unique and easily patentable product. In spite of Trinitron and Chromatron having no technology in common, the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar, or the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10463866&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 "Sony Trinitron color television receiver, c 1970"] is a common publication claiming that Trinitron and Chromatron are the same. "The History of Television, 1942 to 2000" by Albert Abramson makes the same claim on page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction, early models===
Officially introduced by Ibuka in April 1968, the original 12&amp;nbsp;inch Trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness, color fidelity, and simplicity of operation.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically; this gave it a unique cylindrical look. It was also all [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]], with the exception of the picture tube itself, which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like GE's Porta-color. Some larger models such as the KV-1320UB for the [[United Kingdom]] market were initially fitted with 3AT2 valves for the [[extra high tension]] (high voltage) circuitry, before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s.

Ibuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by October, well beyond what engineering had told him was possible. Ibuka cajoled Yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production, and although Yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible, he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;''Sony'', pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The KV-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in Japan in October as promised, and in the U.S. as the KV-1210U the following year.

Early color sets intended for the UK market had a PAL decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by [[Telefunken]] of [[Germany]], who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an [[NTSC]] decoder adapted for [[PAL]]. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a [[tint control]] knob on the front of the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set.

===Reception===
[[File:Trinitron computer.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Trinitron computer monitor kx-14cp1]]
Reviews of the Trinitron were universally positive, although they all mentioned its high cost. Sony won an [[Emmy Award]] for the Trinitron in 1973.&lt;ref name=shist&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-25/h1.html "Sony History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329093450/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-25/h1.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his 84th birthday in 1992, Ibuka claimed the Trinitron was his proudest product.

New models quickly followed. Larger sizes at 19" and then 27" were introduced, as well as smaller, including a 7" portable. In the mid-1980s, a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets, giving the screens a black color when turned off, as opposed to the earlier light grey. This improved the contrast range of the picture. Early models were generally packaged in silver cases, but with the introduction of the darker screens, Sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color, following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world. This line expanded with 32", 35" and finally 40" units in the 1990s.

In 1980, Sony introduced the "ProFeel" line of prosumer [[component television]]s, consisting of a range of Trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners. The original lineup consisted of the KX-20xx1 20" and KX-27xx1 27" monitors (the "xx" is an identifier, PS for Europe, HF for Japan, etc.) the VTX-100ES tuner and TXT-100G TeleText decoder. They were often used with a set of SS-X1A stereo speakers, which matched the grey boxy styling of the suite.&lt;ref name=profeel&gt;[http://www.thevintageknob.org/VIDEO/KX20PS1/KX20PS1.html "KX-20PS1"]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment, where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system. However, a lack of any major third party components, along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors, meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized. They were popular high-end units, however, and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors. A second series of all-black units followed in 1986, the ProFeel Pro, sporting a space-frame around the back of the trapezoidal enclosure that doubled as a carrying handle and holder for the pop-out speakers. These units were paired with the VT-X5R tuner and optionally the APM-X5A speakers.&lt;ref name=profeelpro&gt;[http://www.thevintageknob.org/VIDEO/PROFEEL/PROFEEL.html "Sony PROFEEL"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony also produced lines of Trinitron professional studio monitors, the PVM (Professional Video Monitor) and BVM (Broadcast Video Monitor) lines. These models were packaged in grey metal cubes with a variety of inputs that accepted practically any analog format. They originally used tubes similar to the ProFeel line, but over time, they gradually increased in resolution until the late 1990s when they offered over 900 lines. When these were cancelled as part of the wider Trinitron shutdown in 2007, professionals forced Sony to re-open two of the lines to produce the 20 and 14&amp;nbsp;inch models.&lt;ref name=profeel/&gt;

Among similar products, Sony produced the KV-1311 monitor/TV combination. It accepted NTSC-compatible video from various devices as well as analog broadcast TV. Along with its other functions, it had video and audio inputs and outputs as well as a wideband sound-IF decoded output. Its exterior looks much like the monitor illustrated here, with added TV controls.

By this time, Sony was well established as a supplier of reliable equipment; it was preferable to have minimal field failures instead of supporting an extensive service network for the entire United States.

Sony started developing the Trinitron for [[computer monitor]] use in the late 1970s. Demand was high, so high that there were examples of third party companies removing Trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors. In response, Sony started development of the GDM (Graphic Display Monitor) in 1983, which offered high resolution and faster refresh rates. Sony aggressively promoted the GDM and it became a standard on high-end monitors by the late 1980s. Particularly common models include the [[Apple Inc.]] 13"  model that was originally sold with the [[Macintosh II]] starting in 1987. Well known users also included [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and others. Demand for a lower cost solution led to the CDP series.&lt;ref name=shist/&gt; In May 1988, the high-end 20&amp;nbsp;inch DDM model (Data Display Monitor) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048, which went on to be used in the [[FAA]]'s [[Advanced Automation System]] [[air traffic control]] system.

These developments meant that Sony was well placed to introduce high-definition televisions (HDTV). In April 1981, they announced the [[Sony HDVS|High Definition Video System]] (HDVS), a suite of [[Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding system|MUSE]] equipment including cameras, recorders, Trinitron monitors and projection TVs.

Sony shipped its 100 millionth Trinitron screen in July 1994, 25 years after it had been introduced. New uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of [[DVD]] when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales, with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.spectrum.ieee.org/tech_talk/2008/03/sony_pulls_plug_on_historic_tr.html "Sony Pulls Plug on Historic Trinitron TV"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131827/http://blogs.spectrum.ieee.org/tech_talk/2008/03/sony_pulls_plug_on_historic_tr.html |date=2008-08-21 }}, ''IEEE Spectrum Online''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wallst&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sony-stop-making-old-style-cathode/story.aspx?guid=%7B097C2A31-1395-41BC-A8B7-6A3A65B27F97%7D "Sony to stop making old-style cathode ray tube TVs"], ''Wall Street Journal MarketWatch', 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of Trinitron===
[[Image:Sony KV-32S42.jpg|thumb|Sony KV-32S42, a typical late-model Trinitron television, manufactured in 2001.]]
[[Image:Sony FD Triniton KV-BZ213N50.jpg|thumb|Sony FD Trinitron flat-screen CRT.]]
Sony's patent on the Trinitron display ran out in 1996, after 20 years. After the expiration of Sony's Trinitron patent, manufacturers like [[Mitsubishi Electric|Mitsubishi]] (whose monitor production is now part of [[NEC Display Solutions]]) were free to use the Trinitron design for their own product line without license from Sony although they could not use the Trinitron name. For example, Mitsubishi's are called ''Diamondtron''. To some degree, the name Trinitron became a generic term referring to any similar set.

Sony responded with the [[FD Trinitron]], which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen. Initially introduced on their 27, 32 and 36&amp;nbsp;inch models in 1998, the new tubes were offered in a variety of resolutions for different uses. The basic [[WEGA]] models supported normal 480i signals, but a larger version offered 16:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]s. The technology was quickly applied to the entire Trinitron range, from 13 to 36&amp;nbsp;inch. High resolution versions, Hi-Scan and Super Fine Pitch, were also produced. With the introduction of the FD Trinitron, Sony also introduced a new industrial style, leaving the charcoal colored sets introduced in the 1980s for a new silver styling.

Sony was not the only company producing flat screen CRTs. Other companies had already introduced high-end brands with flat-screen tubes, like Panasonic's Tau. Many other companies entered the market quickly, widely copying the new silver styling as well. The FD Trinitron was unable to regain the cachet that the Trinitron brand had previously possessed; in the 2004 Christmas season, they increased sales by 5%, but only at the cost of a 75% plunge in profits after being forced to lower costs to compete in the market.&lt;ref&gt;James Brooke and Saul Hansell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/10/business/worldbusiness/10rivals.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position= "Samsung Is Now What Sony Once Was"], ''The New York Times'', 10 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the introduction of plasma televisions, and then LCD-based ones, led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the "thin" sets. Both of these technologies have well known problems, and for some time Sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the Trinitron did on the shadow mask. Among these experiments were [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED) and the [[field emission display]], but in spite of considerable effort, neither of these technologies matured into competitors. Sony also introduced their Plasmatron displays, and later LCD as well, but these had no inherent technical advantages over similar sets from other companies. From 2006, all of Sony's BRAVIA television products are LCD displays, initially based on screens from [[Samsung]], and later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;Shu-Ching Jean Chen, [https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/26/sony-sharp-lcd-markets-equity-cx_jc_0226markets08.html "Sony Jilts Samsung For Sharp In LCD Panel Production"], ''Forbes'', 26 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony eventually "threw in the towel" on Trinitron, ending production in Japan some time in 2004. In 2006, Sony announced that it would no longer market or sell Trinitrons in the United States or Canada, but continue to sell the Trinitron in China, India, and regions of South America using tubes delivered from their [[Singapore]] plant. Production in Singapore finally ended in March 2006, only months after ending production of their rear-projection systems.&lt;ref name=wallst/&gt;  Two lines of the factory were later brought back online to supply the professional market.

==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

===Basic concept===
The Trinitron design incorporates two unique features: the single-gun three-cathode picture tube, and the vertically aligned [[aperture grille]].

The single gun consists of a long-necked tube with a single electrode{{dubious|By definition and electronic gun consists of multiple electrodes|date=December 2017}} at its base, flaring out into a horizontally-aligned rectangular shape with three vertically-aligned rectangular cathodes inside. Each cathode is fed the amplified signal from one of the decoded RGB signals.

The electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille, a steel sheet{{dubious|It has already been ascertained that an array of fine wires is used, not a steel sheet|date=December 2017}} with vertical slots cut in it. Due to the slight separation of the cathodes at the back of the tube, the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles. When they pass through the grille they retain this angle, hitting their individual colored phosphors that are deposited in vertical stripes on the inside of the faceplate. The main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color, much as does a shadow mask. However, unlike a shadow mask, there are essentially no obstructions along each entire phosphor stripe. (Larger CRTs have a few horizontal stabilizing wires part way between top and bottom, but in practice, they are not noticed.{{dubious|Yes, they are|date=December 2017}}

===Advantages===
In comparison to early shadow mask designs, the Trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA tubes built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the electron beam, while the grille cuts off about 25%.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Another advantage of the aperture grille was that the distance between the wires remained constant vertically across the screen. In the shadow mask design, the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen, which was constant. However, the distance from the guns to the holes changed; for dots near the center of the screen, the distance was its shortest, at points in the corners it was at its maximum. To ensure that the guns were focused on the holes, a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen. In the Trinitron design, the problem was greatly simplified,{{how|date=December 2017}} requiring changes only for large screen sizes, and only on a line-by-line basis.

For this reason, Trinitron systems are easier to focus than shadow masks, and generally had a sharper image.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This was a major selling point of the Trinitron design for much of its history. In the 1990s, new computer-controlled real-time feedback focusing systems eliminated this advantage, as well as leading to the introduction of "true flat" designs.

===Disadvantages===
====Visible support wires====
Even small changes in the alignment of the grille over the phosphors can cause the color purity to shift. Since the wires are thin, small bumps can cause the wires to shift alignment if they are not held in place. Monitors using Trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this. Screens 15" and below have one wire located about two thirds of the way down the screen, while monitors greater than 15" have 2 wires at the one-third and two-thirds positions. These wires are less apparent or completely obscured on [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] sets due to wider [[scan lines]] to match the lower resolution of the video being displayed. On computer monitors, where the scan lines are much closer together, the wires are often visible. This is a minor drawback of the Trinitron standard which is not shared by shadow mask CRTs.

====Anti-glare coating====
This is a polyurethane sheet coated to scatter reflections and can be very easily damaged.  The fix is to simply remove the sheet entirely, which one can do on Trinitron and Diamondtron CRT Monitors using a [[Utility knife#Names|Stanley blade]] and a chopstick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcguide.com/vb/showthread.php?t=33373&amp;page=3&lt;/ref&gt; Many users claim that removal of the anti-glare coating increases the overall light output of the display and results in more vivid colors and a sharper picture, but at the expense of reduced contrast and (as expected) increased reflection from light sources in front of the display screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24" Widescreen CRT (FW900) From Ebay arrived, Comments.|url=http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=952788|work=HardForum|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vince Dantona''' (April 2, 1949&amp;nbsp;– February 27, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[ventriloquist]].

==Career==
Dantona began his comedy career in [[Okinawa]] during his time in the [[Marine Corps]], learning ventriloquism through a correspondence course by practicing in front of a mirror. Before long, Vince purchased a wooden dummy and dubbed him "George."

Vince began working on [[Long Island]] with other performers, including [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Rob Bartlett]], and [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] at [[Richard Dixon's White House Inn]] in [[North Massapequa, New York]].&lt;ref name="unclevinniescomedyclub.com"&gt;[http://www.unclevinniescomedyclub.com/booking/comedians/vince_dantona.html Vince Dantona at Uncle Vinny's Comedian Booking]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Vince had wanted to do [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]], but found he did better with a ventriloquist act; Vince has called George his "safety net", saying, "He gets away with everything. Nobody ever gets mad at him."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E6DE133BF937A1575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Vince Dantona] in the [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before finishing the course, he (along with George) hosted a two-hour children's program on [[Armed Forces]] television and radio. Vince was also the first $10,000 winner on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[America's Funniest People]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref name="unclevinniescomedyclub.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.vinceandgeorge.com/aboutus.htm Vince and George website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince toured with the [[USO]], entertaining [[United States]] troops. Vince and George appeared on numerous television shows, including ''[[Comedy Central]], [[Good Morning America]], [[Joan Rivers|The Joan Rivers Show]], [[Joe Franklin|The Joe Franklin Show]],'' and ''[[Comedy Tonight]].''
On occasion they opened for [[Soupy Sales]], [[Henny Youngman]], [[Robert Klein]], [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]], [[Jay and the Americans]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Bobby Rydell]], [[Bobby Vinton]], [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]], and [[Boyz II Men]].&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

Vince regularly performed at such places as Pocono Palace in [[The Poconos|the Pocono mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caesarspoconoresorts.com/all_inclusive/comedians.aspx Vince and George at the Poconos]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's Resorts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainmentli.com/comedians4hire/talent.htm Vince and George at Comedians-4-Hire]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City|The Tropicana in Atlantic City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headlineentertainment.us/comedians/vincedantona.html Vince and George at Headline Entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dantona died on February 27, 2012, at the age of 62.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1011903&amp;l=719f8d4031&amp;id=238053796238304&lt;/ref&gt;
