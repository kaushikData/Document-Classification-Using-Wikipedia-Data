The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] carried out two separate attacks on the same day on 1 May 1988 against British military personnel in the [[Netherlands]] which resulted in the deaths of three [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] members and another three being injured.&lt;ref name="ulst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=1&amp;month=05&amp;year=1988|author=Malcolm Sutton|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the worst attack suffered by the British security forces during [[The Troubles]] from 1969 to 1998 on mainland [[Europe]].

==Background==
1988 was one of the worst years of the [[Troubles]] conflict in terms of violence during the 1980s. It saw an increase in IRA activity, a new campaign of sectarian killings by [[loyalist]] paramilitaries, and a heavy response by the [[British Army]] to IRA attacks. On 6 March the SAS [[Operation Flavius|shot dead 3 unarmed IRA Volunteers in Gibraltar]]. On the 16 March at the funerals of the IRA Volunteers shot in Gibraltar a loyalist UDA member killed 3 people and injured dozens in a  [[Milltown Cemetery attack|grenade and gun attack]] at Milltown cemetery. At the funeral of one of those killed in the Milltown attack two plain clothed British soldiers were cornered by an angry crowd who believed they were under attack and the [[Corporals killings|IRA killed both of them]]. In May the UVF killed 3 Catholic civilians and injured 9 in a gun attack in a Belfast pub.&lt;ref name="ulst2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=15&amp;month=05&amp;year=1988|author=Malcolm Sutton|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 15 June 7 people were killed, first 6 British soldiers were killed in the [[1988 Lisburn van bombing|Lisburn van bombing]] and then the IRA shot dead a UVF member.&lt;ref name="ulst3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=15&amp;month=06&amp;year=1988|author=Malcolm Sutton|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 7 July an IRA Volunteer and 2 civilians were killed ina premature bomb explosion.&lt;ref name="ulst4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=7&amp;month=07&amp;year=1988|author=Malcolm Sutton|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month on the 23 July the IRA killed a family of 3 in a botched operation in Armagh.&lt;ref name="ulst5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=23&amp;month=07&amp;year=1988|author=Malcolm Sutton|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August the IRA killed 8 British soldiers and injured a further 28 in the [[Ballygawley bus bombing]], this was the worst attack suffered from the British army since 1982.

=== Previous attacks in mainland Europe ===
The IRA and other Republican paramilitaries such as the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) had been carrying out attacks against British military personnel and British diplomats on mainland Europe since the late 1970s. Some prominent attacks included:

*'''22 March 1979''': [[Richard Sykes (diplomat)|Richard Sykes]], then British Ambassador to the Netherlands, and his Dutch valet, Krel Straub, were killed in a gun attack in [[Den Haag]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=22&amp;month=03&amp;year=1979|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''28 August 1979''': Four British soldiers were wounded when the IRA detonated a bomb under a bandstand in [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]], as British Army musicians were preparing to perform. ([[1979 Brussels bombing]])
*'''16 February 1980''': a British soldier was shot dead by the IRA outside his home, [[Bielefeld]], West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=16&amp;month=02&amp;year=1980|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''24 November 1981''': the left-wing Republican group INLA claimed responsibility for exploding a bomb outside the British Consulate in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Bulletin. 26 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''25 November 1981''': the INLA claimed responsibility for exploding a bomb at a British Army base in [[Herford]], West Germany; one British soldier was injured.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*'''23 March 1987''': 31 people were injured in a car bomb attack at [[JHQ Rheindahlen|Rheindahlen Military Complex]], near [[Mönchengladbach]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/23/newsid_4287000/4287075.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY {{!}} 23 {{!}} 1987: 30 hurt as car bomb hits Army base|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[1987 Rheindahlen bombing]])

==The attacks==
The first attack took place in the market of [[Roermond]] city, a popular social centre for British military personnel in the southeastern part of the Netherlands on the [[West German]] border. Two enlisted [[Royal Air Force]] members from the [[RAF Regiment]] based at [[RAF Wildenrath]] in Germany were sitting in a parked car near their base at around 01:00 am when IRA [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]] fired shots from an automatic rifle into their car, killing one of the soldiers ([[Senior aircraftman|SAC]] Ian Shinner, 20) and badly injuring his companion. Police on the scene said that at least 23 bullets were fired into the vehicle.

Half an hour later in [[Nieuw-Bergen]], about 30 miles north of Roermond, a booby-trap bomb that was placed under the car of four other RAF soldiers exploded while they were parked outside a disco. The bombing killing two more RAF soldiers (John Miller Reid and John Baxter) and injured two others. "The bodies were in such a condition that they could not immediately be identified," police spokesman Louis Steens told [[The Associated Press]] in Nieuw Bergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=1&amp;month=05&amp;year=1988|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers were based at [[RAF Laarbruch]], about 3 miles away across the border in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/05/02/ira-kills-3-british-servicemen/6a670d57-3318-4c5b-84c6-a3e18e273187/|title=IRA KILLS 3 BRITISH SERVICEMEN|date=2 May 1988|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA were able to identify the British military personnel due to the number plates on the cars. In both attacks, the cars being driven by the RAF members had [[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom#Armed forces vehicles|British military licence plates]].

The IRA issued a statement from [[Belfast]] in relation to the attacks saying: "We have a simple message for [Prime Minister Margaret] [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]. Disengage from Ireland and there will be peace. If not, there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports awaiting your dead." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/05/02/ira-kills-3-british-servicemen/6a670d57-3318-4c5b-84c6-a3e18e273187/|title=IRA KILLS 3 BRITISH SERVICEMEN|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|date=1988-05-02|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the British and Irish governments condemned the attacks.

Many Irish Republicans saw the attacks as revenge for the killings of the three IRA volunteers in [[Gibraltar]] two months before (see [[Operation Flavius]]). In 1990 two Australian tourists were [[Killings of Nick Spanos and Stephen Melrose|shot dead by the IRA]] in Roermond.

The '''Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling''' is the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] given to the best achievement in makeup and hairstyling for film. Usually, only three films are nominated each year rather than five as in most categories. The exception is in the early 1980s as well as 2002, when there were only two nominees; and in 1999, when there were four nominees.

The competitive category was created in 1981 as the '''Academy Award for Best Makeup''', after the Academy received complaints that the make-up work in ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) was not going to be honored. Although no award was given to ''The Elephant Man'', an entire category dedicated to honoring make-up effects in film was created for subsequent ceremonies. Previously, make-up artists were only eligible for special achievement awards for their work.

This is one of the categories with different stages of nominating. A shortlist of titles is chosen by the makeup branch's executive committee and clips are screened by the members of the branch at an annual "bake-off" where nominees are determined. After only two films were shortlisted in 2002, rules were installed requiring that seven finalists be chosen each year.

In 2012, the category was given its current name for use in the [[85th Academy Awards]] and onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilday|first=Greg|title=New Oscar Rules Allow Multiple Songwriters, Incorporate Hair Styling|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-changes-visual-effects-music-foreign-language-rules-343162|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film academy approves new rules for 85th Academy Awards, makes hairstyling eligible for Oscar|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/film-academy-approves-new-rules-for-85th-academy-awards-makes-hairstyling-eligible-for-oscar/2012/06/28/gJQALW8r9V_story.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makeup artist [[Rick Baker]] holds the record for both most wins and most nominations for this award.

==Special Achievement Awards==
Before 1981, Special Achievement Oscars were twice awarded to makeup artists for their work on a specific film:

*1964 – [[William J. Tuttle]] for ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]''
*1968 – [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]] for ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' &lt;ref name=guardian01&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary:John Chambers: Make-up master responsible for Hollywood's finest space-age creatures|author=Brian Pendreigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/07/guardianobituaries.filmnews |work=The Guardian |date=7 September 2001 |accessdate=Feb 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hairstylists==
Starting in 1993, the award is to be shared with hairstylists if hair effects "contribute greatly to the appearance and effect of the characters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule15.html Rule Fifteen: Special Rules for the Music Awards | Rules for the 84th Academy Awards | Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407131246/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule15.html |date=April 7, 2014 }}.

'''Allard Pierson''' (8 April 1831 – 27 May 1896) was a Dutch [[theologian]], historian, and art historian. He was a leading proponent of [[Radical Criticism|radical criticism]] in the Netherlands.

==Life==
Pierson's father was a merchant in Amsterdam, his mother an author of [[Pietism|pietist]] works. The family was prominent in the Christian revival movement of the [[Christian revival#Europe: Le Réveil|Reveil]] and attended the meetings of [[Isaac da Costa]] and [[Nicolaas Beets]]. Pierson studied theology at [[Utrecht University]], where he was influenced by [[Cornelis Willem Opzoomer|Opzoomer]]. He became a Protestant minister in [[Leuven]] in 1854, and in 1857 in the [[Walloon church]] in [[Rotterdam]], where he was highly esteemed. However, in 1865 he resigned because he could not reconcile being a minister with not believing in [[divine revelation]]. He moved to [[Heidelberg]], where he worked on a [[history of Christianity]]. He also started to teach at the university there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arie L. Molendijk |chapter=Abschied vom Christentum. Der Fall Allard Pierson |chapterurl=http://theol.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2009/Abschied/Molendijk-ABSCHIED2000.pdf |year=2009 |title=Post-Theism. Reframing the Judeo-Christian Tradition |isbn=978-90-429-0853-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1877 to 1895 Pierson was  professor in [[history of art]], [[aesthetics]] and [[modern languages]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. Pierson died in 1896 in the village [[Almen]] and he is buried in [[Zutphen]].

==Theology==

In 1878 Pierson published his book about the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and other passages from the [[synoptic gospels]]. He showed that sayings attributed to Jesus could be found in Jewish [[wisdom literature]]. The work also argued that [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], one of the core [[Pauline epistles]], was [[pseudepigraph]]ic. This is seen as the beginning of [[Radical Criticism|Dutch radical school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hermann Detering |url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/van_den_bergh.htm#_ftnref12 |title=Gustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga und die radikale Schule |year=2001 |access-date=2010-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072401/http://www.radikalkritik.de/van_den_bergh.htm#_ftnref12 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drews"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.egodeath.com/drewshistorymythiconlyjesus.htm#_Toc51777080 |author=[[Arthur Drews]] |chapter=Dutch Radicalism |title=The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present (summary in English) |year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierson was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E. Van Voorst|Van Voorst, Robert E]]. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} "Allard Pierson, its leader, flatly denied the existence of Jesus, and A. Loman and W. C. van Manen followed him. Their arguments were stoutly attacked in the Netherlands, especially by other scholars, but largely ignored outside it."&lt;/ref&gt; He held the view that the [[Pauline epistles]] were forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;McCown, Chester Charlton.

The '''Alliance for Securing Democracy''' ('''ASD''') is a bipartisan [[Atlanticism|transatlantic]] national security advocacy group formed in July 2017 with the stated aim of countering efforts by Russia to undermine democratic institutions in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="reuters2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/about-securing-democracy |title=Alliance for Securing Democracy: Mission Statement |accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is chaired and run primarily by former senior [[United States Intelligence Community|United States intelligence]] and [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials.&lt;ref name="WP-31-07-2017"/&gt; Its daily operations are led by Laura Rosenberger, a former senior State Department official who worked in the [[George W.

The ASD publishes a web dashboard called "Hamilton 68" showing the activity of Twitter accounts that the organization claims are linked to Russian propaganda.

==History==
In 2016, the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the Director of National Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jul/06/17-intelligence-organizations-or-four-either-way-r |title=17 intelligence organizations or 4?

The Alliance for Securing Democracy declared that it will develop strategies to "defend against, deter, and raise the costs" on any attempts by Russia or "other state actors" to undermine democracy.&lt;ref name="reuters2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASD"/&gt; Former acting CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] stated that the group will fulfill some of the role that ideally would have been handled by a national investigative commission.&lt;ref name="Launch WaPo Rogin"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rogin |first1=Josh |title=National Security Figures Launch Project to Counter Russian Mischief |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/07/11/national-security-figures-launch-project-to-counter-russian-mischief/ |accessdate=September 28, 2017 |issue=July 11, 2017 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamilton 68==
The "Hamilton 68" Dashboard on the ASD website tracks in real-time 600 [[Twitter]] social media accounts that the ASD asserts are "linked to Russian influence," whether knowingly or unknowingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Sean |title=New Web tool tracks Russian “influence ops” on Twitter |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/08/new-web-tool-tracks-russian-influence-ops-on-twitter/ |date=August 2, 2017 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Twitter"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wakabauyashi |first1=Daisuke |title=Twitter, with accounts linked to Russia, to face Congress over Role in Election |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/twitter-russia-election.html |accessdate=September 28, 2017 |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzfeed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elder |first1=Miriam |last2=Warzel |first2=Charlie |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/stop-blaming-russian-bots-for-everything |title=Stop Blaming Russian Bots For Everything |work=BuzzFeed News |date=February 28, 2018 |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the group launched a similar German-language website focused on possible Russian influence in German politics.&lt;ref name="ToI-24-09-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Masis |first1=Julie |title=Real-time tracking system measures Russian interference in German elections |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/dashboard-measures-how-russian-disinformation-is-interfering-in-german-elections/ |accessdate=September 28, 2017 |issue=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASD's tracking encompasses social media accounts it suspects are related to the Russian government or Russian state media, as well as accounts it believes to be unconnected to Russia, but which repeat what it sees as Russian government views.&lt;ref name="ToI-24-09-2017" /&gt; ASD does not disclose which accounts "Hamilton 68" tracks, citing its desire to "focus on the behavior of the overall network rather than get dragged into hundreds of individual debates over which troll fits which role."&lt;ref name=Meduza&gt;{{cite web |last=Rothrock |first=Kevin |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2017/08/03/tracking-russian-propaganda-in-real-time |title=Tracking Russian propaganda in real time: The trouble with a new automated effort to expose Moscow's 'active measures' against Americans |work=Meduza |date=August 2, 2017 |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt;

The then newly formed ASD said in August 2017 that it was "exploring ways" to similarly analyze [[Facebook]], [[Reddit]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="reuters2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Volz |first1=Dustin |title=New website aims to track Russian-backed propaganda on Twitter |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia/new-website-aims-to-track-russian-backed-propaganda-on-twitter-idUSKBN1AI2RV |accessdate=September 29, 2017 |publisher=Reuters |date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory council and staff==

The ASD is governed by an Advisory Council and an operating staff who are drawn from the American Marshall Fund. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the membership of the advisory council "a who's who of former senior national security officials from both [the Democratic and Republican] parties."&lt;ref name="WP-31-07-2017"/&gt; Members of the advisory council include [[Michael Chertoff]] (a Republican who worked in the [[George W.

== Reception ==
The Hamilton 68 dashboard has been cited by many news outlets, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/twitter-russia-election.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/31/lawmakers-press-social-media-companies-again-on-the-forces-behind-the-releasethememo-campaign/&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NPR]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2018/02/08/584144083/tracking-shows-russian-meddling-efforts-evolving-ahead-of-2018-midterms&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Business Insider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-bots-support-fox-news-host-laura-ingraham-amid-advertiser-exodus-2018-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The dashboard has also received criticism for its "secret methodology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Matt |last=Taibbi |authorlink=Matt Taibbi |title=The new blacklist |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-new-blacklist-202612/ |date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refusal to disclose the Twitter accounts it tracks.&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Intercept]] |first=M.C. |last=McGrath |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |authorlink2=Glenn Greenwald |date=20 April 2018 |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/how-fake-news-and-western-propaganda-about-russian-interference-in-catalonia-coerced-ecuador-to-silence-julian-assange/ |accessdate=6 July 2018 |title=How shoddy reporting and anti-Russian propaganda coerced Ecuador to silence Julian Assange}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASD founders Laura Rosenberger and Jamie Fly say these accounts are not disclosed so to prevent them from getting shut down.&lt;ref name="glasser"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Nation]]'', James Carden questioned the project's characterization of factual news items as Russian propaganda, concluding that the project "seeks to police and narrow the scope of acceptable political discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Our Russia fixation is devolving into an assault on political discourse |first=James |last=Carden |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=7 August 2017 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/our-russia-fixation-is-devolving-into-an-assault-on-political-discourse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]] criticized the group, opining that it represented a political alliance between [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] and establishment Democrats.&lt;ref name="Intercept-17-Jul-2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/ |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |title=With New D.C.

'''Aref al-Aref'''  ({{lang-ar|عارف العارف}},{{lrm}} 1892–1973) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] journalist, historian and politician. Aref al-Aref served as mayor of [[East Jerusalem]] in the 1950s, during the  [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank]].

==Biography==
Aref al-Aref was born as Aref Shehadeh in [[Jerusalem]] in 1892.&lt;ref name=Tamari2&gt;{{cite book | author = Salīm Tamārī and Ihsan Salih Turjman | title = A Soldier's Diary and the Erasure of Palestine's Ottoman Past | publisher = California University Press | isbn = 9780520259553 | year = 2011 | pages = 66–68, 71–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a vegetable vendor. Excelling at his studies in primary school, he was sent to high school in Turkey. He attended the Marjan Preparatory School and Mulkiyya College in Istanbul. During his college studies, he wrote for a Turkish newspaper. Later, he worked as a translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=Tamari2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; He served as an officer in the [[Ottoman Army]] in [[World War I]]. He was captured on the Caucasus front and spent three years in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=Tamari2/&gt; In Krasnoyarsk, he edited a newspaper in handwritten Arabic called ''Nakatullah'' [Camel of God] and translated [[Ernst Haeckel]]’s ''Die Weltraethsel'' ("[[Riddle of the Universe|The Riddles of the Universe]]") into Turkish.&lt;ref name=Tamari2/&gt; After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] he escaped and returned to Palestine.&lt;ref name=Tamari2/&gt;

Aref al-Aref died on July 30, 1973, in [[al-Bireh]].

==Political activism==
[[File:Aref al-Aref as governor of Beersheba.jpg|thumb|300px|Aref al-Aref (seated, center), as District Administrative Officer of [[Beersheba]]]]
[[File:El-aref's-3 BeerSheva.jpg|thumb|150px|Home of Aref al-Aref, Beersheba]]

By 1919, al-Aref was involved in political activism in Palestine, agitating for unity of Palestine with Syria.&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; In October 1919, he became editor of the recently established newspaper [[Suriyya al-Janubiyya (newspaper)|Suriya al-Janubiya]] (Southern Syria), which was the first Arab nationalist newspaper published in Jerusalem and was an organ of the al-Nadi al-'Arabi (The Arab Club).&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; Initially Suriya al-Janubiya supported the British military authorities, but soon became an opponent of the British Mandate.&lt;ref name=Tamari&gt;{{cite book | author = Salīm Tamārī and Ihsan Salih Turjman | title = A Soldier's Diary and the Erasure of Palestine's Ottoman Past | publisher = California University Press | isbn = 9780520259553 | year = 2011 | pages = 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Aref attended the [[Nabi Musa|Nebi Musa]] religious festival in Jerusalem in 1920 riding on his horse, and gave a speech at the [[Jaffa Gate]].&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; The nature of his speech is disputed. According to Benny Morris, he said "If we don't use force against the Zionists and against the Jews, we will never be rid of them",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benny Morris |title=Righteous Victims |page= 95}}, quoting the official history of the [[Haganah]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Bernard Wasserstein wrote "he seems to have co-operated with the police, and there is no evidence that he actively instigated violence".&lt;ref name=Wasserstein&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bernard Wasserstein | title = 'Clipping the Claws of the Colonisers': Arab Officials in the Government of Palestine, 1917-48 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1977 | pages = 171–194 | doi=10.1080/00263207708700343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, "Zionist intelligence reports of
this period are unanimous in stressing that he spoke repeatedly against violence".&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; Soon the festival became a [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|riot]] involving attacks on the local Jews. Al-Aref was arrested for incitement, but when he was let out on bail he escaped to Syria together with co-accused Haj Amin al-Husseini.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; In another version, he was warned and escaped before being arrested.&lt;ref name=Tauber&gt;{{cite book | author = Eliezer Ṭauber | title = The Formation of Modern Syria and Iraq | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | pages = 95,105}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advised Arabs against violence, urging them instead to adopt the "discipline, silence, and courage" of their opponents.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; In his absence, a military court sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;

In Damascus, al-Aref became a deputy to the General Syrian Congress and with Hajj Amin and others formed al-Jam'iyya al-'Arabiyya al-Filastiniyya (Palestinian Arab Society).&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tauber/&gt; He became its Secretary-General and campaigned against the decisions of the [[San Remo conference]].&lt;ref name=Tauber/&gt; After the French invasion of Syria in July 1920 he fled to Transjordan.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; He returned to Jerusalem late in 1920 after being pardoned by the new High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Herbert Samuel]], but the government refused to allow his newspaper to reopen.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;

==Political career==
In 1921, he was appointed as a [[District Officer]] of the British administration by the Civil Secretary Colonel [[Wyndham Deedes]].&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; He served in that capacity in Jenin, Nablus, Beisan, and Jaffa.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;  In 1926 he was seconded to the Government of Transjordan as Chief Secretary, where he served for three years.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; However he continued his political activities on the side to the displeasure of his British superior.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; He returned to Palestine in 1929, where he served as District Officer in [[Beersheba]] and later in [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;  In 1933 he received a special commendation from the High Commissioner for keeping his district quiet during a time of disturbances elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; In 1942 he was promoted and transferred to [[al-Bireh]].&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt; He continued as a Mandate official until 1948.&lt;ref name=Wasserstein/&gt;

Upon Jordanian control of the [[West Bank]], al-Aref was appointed military governor of [[Ramallah]] governorate then from 1949 to 1955 served as mayor of East Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Fishbach&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Fishbach | title = Encyclopedia of the Palestinians | editor = Philip Mattar | chapter = Aref al-Aref | page = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he was appointed director of the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Fishbach/&gt;

'''The Battle of One Tree Hill''' was the best known of a series of conflicts that took place between European settlers and aboriginal inhabitants of the [[Darling Downs]] in the 1840s. 

In September 1843, aboriginal leader Multuggera led an ambush of squatters taking supplies across from [[Moreton Bay]], at One Tree Hill (now known as Tabletop Mountain), near [[Toowoomba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/table-top-mountain/4765242 "Table Top Mountain", ''Big Ideas - National''] accessed 23 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The squatters organised a revenge party and the aborigines retreated up the mountain. They escaped into the [[Lockyer Valley]] but were later tracked down and killed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2011/jun11/a-picture-asks-a-thousand-questions.pdf "A Picture Asks a Thousand Questions", ''National Library of Australia'', 11 June 2011] accessed 19 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/darling-downs-history-national-library-australia/666255/ Louise O'Keefe, "Darling Downs History on Display", ''The Chronicle'', 23 October 2010] accessed 19 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument recording the battle was established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/133629/20120518-1552/monumentaustralia.org.au/monument_display0f65.php Multuggerah at ''Monument Australia''] accessed 23 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; An indigenous land use agreement has been signed over the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntt.gov.au/news-and-communications/media-releases/pages/indigenouslanduseagreementsignedintoowoomba.aspx "Indigenous land use agreement signed in Toowoomba" 27 Feb 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211230619/http://www.nntt.gov.au/news-and-communications/media-releases/pages/indigenouslanduseagreementsignedintoowoomba.aspx |date=February 11, 2014 }} accessed 23 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the [[National Library of Australia]] acquired a sketch by local Thomas John Domville Taylor for $120,000 which is believed to be an eyewitness account of the aftermath of the battle. This made it one of less than ten visual eyewitness accounts of attacks by European settlers on indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/library-acquires-indigenous-attack-account-20101022-16wh7.html "Library acquires indigenous attack account", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 22 October 2010] accessed 23 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/image-of-frontier-battle-comes-to-life/story-e6frg6nf-1225942452434 Sarah Elks, "Image of frontier battle comes to life", ''The Australian'' 23 October 2010] accessed 23 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born of Carl Oskar Cristoffer Montgomery (5 April 1856 - 28 Nov 1920) and Sigrid Sofia Maria Sandell (30 Dec 1874 - 05 Jan 1932), de Montgomery was educated at [[Oxford University]] where he obtained a [[doctorate]] in [[Philosophy]] and also studied at the [[University of Stockholm]].

He was known for his commentary regarding the [[Pax Britannica]] in 1936 when he argued for increased trade and friendly relations between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the United States. He suggested the two nations had a ''"common interest in preserving the international peace"'', and was a lead proponent of the [[Special Relationship]], saying ''"the two Anglo-Saxon nations are of a fundamentally peaceful disposition and prefer to live in peace"''. He held the view that the [[British Empire]] was ''"the principal factor in the development of humanity... It means that the British Empire is primarily responsible for the maintenance of peace in the world"''.&lt;ref name="Parchami2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Count.)1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bo Gabriel De Montgomery (Count.)|title=Pax Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpMuQwAACAAJ|accessdate=11 November 2012|year=1928|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 he invented and patented a unique [[razor]] sharpening device, characterised by the automatic rocking of the blade on the strap.&lt;ref name="Office1933"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

He wrote books on such topics as [[Economics]] and [[Political history]].&lt;ref name="Epistolario"&gt;{{cite book|title=Epistolario|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_lEoF50sWgC&amp;pg=PA1014|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Librairie Droz|isbn=978-2-600-05643-4|pages=1014–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbJIAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=11 November 2012|year=1923|publisher=Survey Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also researched the [[genealogy]] of the [[Montgomery (name)|Montgomery]] family, including the origins of their [[nobility]], and based on this work he claimed the title of Comte de Montgomery.&lt;ref name="släkt"/&gt;

The '''Bukovina Museum''' (''{{Lang-ro|Muzeul Bucovinei}}'') is a museum located in the Romanian city of [[Suceava]], named after the [[Bukovina|historical Bukovina region]]. 

== The Museum ==
The Bukovina Museum consists of several individual museums, objects and memorial houses scattered throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://muzeulbucovinei.ro/en/|title=Acasă|work=Bucovina Museum|access-date=2018-11-19|language=ro-RO}}&lt;/ref&gt; They pursue their own programs and series of events, but are managed together. The headquarter is located in the History Museum (Muzeul de Istorie din Suceava), in the center of the city of Suceava. The History Museum is the oldest part of the Bukovina Museum and essentially the nucleus around which the complex with its various facilities was built. The History Museum was built in 1898 and is now a cultural heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://muzeulbucovinei.ro/en/arhive/12975|title=HISTORY|work=Bucovina Museum|access-date=2018-11-19|language=ro-RO}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Commonscat|Suceava History Museum|Bukovina-Museum}}The Museum's collection includes photographs by German photographer [[Oliver Mark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsbucovina.ro/evenimente/206286/expozitia-de-fotografie-celebritati-l-a-adus-la-suceava-pe-artistul-fotograf-german-oliver-mark-el-a-donat-muzeului-bucovinei-una-dintre-lucrarile-sale|title=Expoziţia de fotografie „Celebrităţi” l-a adus, la Suceava, pe artistul fotograf german Oliver Mark.

'''{{PH wikidata|name}}''', officially the '''{{PH wikidata|official_name}}''', ({{lang-tgl|Lungsod ng Cabanatuan}}; {{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Cabanatuan}}; {{lang-ilo|Siudad ti Cabanatuan}}; {{lang-pam|Lakanbalen ning Cabanatuan}}; {{lang-pag|Siyudad na Cabanatuan}}; also known as '''Cabsy'''), or simply '''Cabanatuan City''' is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[Cities of the Philippines|city]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} making it the most populous city in Nueva Ecija and the 5th populous in Central Luzon.

The city is popular for being home to more than 30,000 [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycles]], thus priding itself as the "Tricycle Capital of the Philippines"&lt;ref&gt;http://philippinetimesofsouthernnevada.com/news/the-philippines/ph-provinces/cabanatuan-city-remains-the-undisputed-tricycle-capital-of-the-philippines/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its strategic location along the Cagayan Valley Road has made the city a major economic, educational, medical, entertainment shopping and transportation center in Nueva Ecija and nearby provinces in the region such as Aurora and Bulacan. It has also earned the moniker "Gateway to the North".

Cabanatuan remained as Nueva Ecija's capital until 1965 when the government created nearby [[Palayan City]] as the new provincial capital. Nueva Ecija's old capitol and other government offices are still used and maintained by the provincial administration.

==History==
[[File:Gen Luna Death Site.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px| Marker of Gen. Antonio Luna's Death Place]]
Cabanatuan was founded as a Barrio of Gapan in 1750 and became a Municipality and capital of La Provincia de Nueva Ecija in 1780. Cabanatuan is the site of the historical "Plaza Lucero" and the Cabanatuan Cathedral, where General [[Antonio Luna]] was assassinated by Captain Pedro Janolino and members of the kawit battalion. Cabanatuan lost the title of provincial capital in 1850 when the capital of Nueva Ecija was moved to San Isidro, another historic town. It was only in 1917, when the Administrative code was enacted, that Cabanatuan was restored as capital of the Province. However, in 1965, Congress created Palayan City, which has been the capital ever since.

[[File:Cabanatuan_Operations_-_Routes_to_and_from_the_Objectives,_January_1945.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Map of the routes taken by the US Rangers in their Raid at Cabanatuan]]
During World War II, the occupying Japanese built Cabanatuan Prison Camp, where many American soldiers were imprisoned, some of whom had been forced to endure the infamous [[Bataan Death March]]. In January 1945, elements of the U.S. Army [[6th Ranger Battalion]] marched {{convert|30|mi}} behind enemy lines to rescue the prisoners in what became known as the [[Raid at Cabanatuan]]. As a result of the raid on January 30, 1945, victorious Filipino guerrillas and American troops of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion celebrated having obtained the freedom of 500 American [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]. Soon thereafter, Philippine and American forces re-established the presence of military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary 2nd Constabulary Regiment, and the United States Army in Cabanatuan from February 1, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the Allied Liberation. Before long, the combined Philippine Commonwealth and American armed forces, in cooperation with local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} had liberated Central Luzon from Japanese Imperial forces, a campaign that lasted from January until August 1945.

In 1957, the barrios of Mataas na Kahoy, Balangkare Norte, Balangkare Sur, Sapang Kawayan, Magasawang Sampaloc, Talabutab Norte, Talabutab Sur, Platero, Belen, Pecaleon, Piñahan, Kabulihan, Pasong-Hari, Balaring, Pulong Singkamas, Panaksak, Bravo, Sapang Bato, Burol, Miller, Tila Patio, Pula, Carinay, and Acacia were separated from Cabanatuan and constituted into a separate and independent municipality known as [[General Mamerto Natividad, Nueva Ecija|General Mamerto Natividad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1863.html|title=An Act to Create the Municipality of General Mamerto Natividad in the Province of Nueva Ecija|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabanatuan was the epicenter of a [[1990 Luzon earthquake|very strong earthquake]] at roughly 3 P.M. on July 16, 1990. It leveled some buildings, including the Christian College of the Philippines (Liwag Colleges) in the midst of class time. At 7.8 on the [[surface wave magnitude]] scale, it killed 1,653 people.

===Conversion from town, component city to highly urbanized city===
Cabanatuan became a city by virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 526, approved on June 16, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra526-cabanatuan-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the City of Cabanatuan|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Cabanatuan was declared by then-president [[Fidel V. Ramos]] as a highly urbanized city however it failed ratification after the majority of votes in the plebiscite was negative.

Cabanatuan was declared as highly urbanized city by President [[Benigno S. Aquino III]] under Presidential Proclamation No. 418 on July 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/issuances/issuances-proc/Proc418.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825101026/http://pcoo.gov.ph/issuances/issuances-proc/Proc418.pdf# |archive-date=2013-08-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plebiscite scheduled on December 2012 was moved by the Commission on Elections to January 25, 2014 so as not to burden the poll body during its preparation for the [[Philippine general election, 2013|2013 local elections]] in the province. Incumbent Governor Aurelio Matias Umali, who had a strong voter base in the city, opposed the conversion and submitted a petition to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on January 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rappler.com/nation/47928-sc-issues-tro-cabanatuan-plebiscite&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 2014, voting 9-5-1, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari filed by Nueva Ecija Gov. Aurelio Umali and declared as null and void Comelec Minute Resolution No. 12-0797 dated September 11, 2012 and Minute Resolution No. 12-0925 dated October 16, 2012 setting a date for the conduct of a plebiscite in which only registered voters of Cabanatuan would be allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/358023/news/regions/sc-all-nueva-ecija-voters-should-take-part-in-plebiscite-for-cabanatuan-as-huc&lt;/ref&gt; The province-wide plebiscite was rescheduled for November 8, 2014, but cancelled again because the Cabanatuan City government couldn't provide the funds needed for the plebiscite. No new date has been set until city government certifies that {{Philippine peso}}101 million is available for the holding of the plebiscite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elmo Roque|title=‘Highly-urbanized’ Cabanatuan still unratified|url=http://punto.com.ph/News/Article/22101/Volume-8-No-55/Headlines/%E2%80%98Highly-urbanized%E2%80%99-Cabanatuan-still-unratified|website=punto.com.ph|publisher=Punto!

Large-scale residential developments are present, such as Lakewood City and Avida Sta. Arcadia Estates. Sta. Lucia Realty's Lakewood City is a medium to high-end project encompassing more than 170 hectares. Its centerpiece is a 64-hectare championship golf course, one of the largest in Central Luzon.
 
[[Ayala Land]]'s 87-hectare Avida Sta. Arcadia Estates is master planned to become a mixed-use development that will include the Avida Sta. Arcadia Residences, Avida Settings, and Avida Town Center.

Also included in the roster of large residential districts are the Kapitan Pepe Subdivision, Grand Victoria Estates, and Acropolis North by Sta. Lucia Realty.

Ayala Land currently has five residential subdivisions while Vista Land has three and Sta. Lucia Realty, three.

Recently, there is active development of residential subdivisions in Sta. Arcadia, Bangad and the stretch of NE-Aurora Road.

Prime lands in Cabanatuan are becoming pricier as demand for residential land props up with the entry of more Manila- and Cebu-based land developers.

Established players are being challenged by newcomers like [[JG Summit Holdings|Robinsons Land]], [[SM Investments Corporation#Subsidiaries|SMDC]], [[Filinvest Land, Inc.|Filinvest]] and AboitizLand. SMDC's first horizontal housing development is currently under construction on a 25-hectare lot in Brgy. Sta. Arcadia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/business/2015/08/03/1483785/sm-prime-allots-p1-b-housing-venture.

Other shopping centers include Savemore supermarkets, Puregold, a chain of NE supermarkets, and many small department stores.

The warehouse club store S&amp;R opened recently, forming a sprawling shopping district with NE Pacific Mall and Robinsons Townville.

[[Vista Malls|Vista Mall]], [[CityMall (Philippines)|CityMall]] and [[Robinsons Malls|Robinsons Place]] are the upcoming malls in the city.

===Hotels and restaurants===

==Transportation==
[[File:FvfCabanatuanCityTerminal7000 37.JPG|thumbnail|right|Buses in Cabanatuan City Central Terminal]]
[[File:Cabanatuancityjf9795 03.JPG|thumb|right|Cabanatuan City Central Terminal]]
The city is a major hub of transportation services in Central Luzon. Cabanatuan City has a large number of bus companies operating provincial and regional routes, with the Cabanatuan Central Transport Terminal serving as the terminus. Jeepney operators serve routes within the province with some reaching as far to Dingalan, Baler and Dilasag in Aurora, Olongapo City, San Fernando and Dau in Pampanga, Mariveles and Balanga in Bataan, Baguio City in Benguet, Dagupan City and Tarlac City. Much of the city's population rely on public transportation such as tricycles and jeeps to get around the city.

[[Maharlika Highway]] (or Pan-Philippine Highway) is the main highway traversing the city where most vehicles going to Cagayan Valley pass through. Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road links Cabanatuan to [[Baler, Aurora]], passing through rural towns in eastern Nueva Ecija. Burgos Avenue and Del Pilar Street serve as the city's main thoroughfare inside the downtown area. Other major roads include the General Tinio and Rizal Streets which run through the city proper in an east-west direction; Mabini Street, where two of the city's three universities are situated and the Circumferential Road that connects the downtown area to the Kapitan Pepe residential district. Two bypass roads were constructed during the early 2000s to decongest the Maharlika Highway and to spur new developments outside the downtown area. The 10.3-kilometer Felipe Vergara Highway provides a direct route to Cagayan Valley, while Emilio Vergara Highway links [[Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija|Santa Rosa]] to Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road, avoiding traffic bottleneck along [[Maharlika Highway]].

Cabanatuan was served by the Manila Railroad Company way back in 1905 through the Balagtas - Cabanatuan line and was later abandoned after the war when scavengers have looted pieces of the rail tracks. Rail service was later resumed in 1969 after the rehabilitation of the rail tracks as mandated by a government order, the service was again abandoned in the 1980s when the route didn't fare much to the commuters. The old Cabanatuan Railway Station is located at Barangay General Luna and is converted to a day care center with the original structure remaining.

Infrastructure improvements are ongoing with projects done by administration. All key intersections in the city are already signalized. Bicycle and tricycle lanes are currently being built while road widening of the Maharlika Highway from the present four lanes to eight lanes is on the drawing board. Road widening of all city and arterial roads from one/two-lane highway to three-lane highway is also being considered.

Two proposed expressways will pass through Cabanatuan City if built. These are the [[North Luzon East Expressway]] ([[Quezon City]] to Cabanatuan) and the [[Central Luzon Link Expressway]] ([[SCTEx]]-[[TPLEx]] to San Jose City).

Intercity/interprovincial buses from Manila serve the city, and are usually operated by [[Baliwag Transit, Inc.]], [[Five Star Bus Company|Five Star]], [[Victory Liner]], [[Genesis Transport Service Inc.]], [[GV Florida Transport]], and Pangasinan Solid North. Jeepneys provide

'''Eva Henriette Sachs''' (13 April 1882 – September 1936)&lt;ref name=Foot01&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Eva-Sachs/6000000013823609895 Eva Henriette Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Germans|German]] [[classical philologist]], whose dissertation reconceptualized the relation between [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] and [[Plato]].

== Life and career ==

Eva Sachs was born in [[Berlin]] on 13 April 1882. Daughter of the Jewish couple Immanuel Sachs and Minna Sachs (Lachmann),&lt;ref name="Foot01"/&gt; she was early orphaned.&lt;ref name=Foot02&gt;Wyles, R; Hall, E. ''Women Classical Scholars Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1898 and 1902 she attended the Victoria-Lyzeum. Then, in 1904, she enrolled at the [[Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], [[Berlin]], studying [[Plato]]. 
She had classes with great classicists such as [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Otto Hirschfeld]], [[Eduard Meyer]] and [[Friedrich Paulsen]]. However, her great mentor was [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who between 1904 and 1914 offered several lectures and seminars on Plato and inspired her to produce her dissertation under his supervision, with [[Hermann Diels]] as second reader.&lt;ref name=Foot03&gt;Calder, W. M. ''Eva Sachs on Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.'', Illinois Classical Studies, 1988, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her dissertation, ''De Theaeteto Atheniensi Mathematico'', promoted in 1914, she re-conceptualized the relation between [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]], the mathematician, and Plato.&lt;ref name="Foot02"/&gt;

Sachs proved with her dissertation that Theaetetus, son of [[Euphronius]] from [[Sounion]], was, at the same time, the mathematician and the friend and student of Plato.&lt;ref name=Foot04&gt;Calder, W. M. ''Eva Sachs on Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.'', Illinois Classical Studies, 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  
In this way, the [[Suda]] is responsible to causing the confusion of transforming the same Theaetetus into two.&lt;ref name=Foot05&gt;[http://stoa.org/sol-entries/theta/93 Theta93 in Adler number]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foot06&gt;[http://stoa.org/sol-entries/theta/94 Theta94 in Adler number]&lt;/ref&gt; She also persuasively argued that the battle of Corinth (Pl. Tht. 142a) in which Theaetetus died was the one on 369 B.C., and not 394 B.C.&lt;ref name="Foot04"/&gt;

Due to the good acceptance of her dissertation conclusions by the highest authorities in the subject, an expanded German version of this work, ''The Five Platonic Solids: On the History of Mathematics and the Theory of Elements in Plato and the Pythagoreans'', was translated from the [[Latin]] and published in 1917.&lt;ref name="Foot04"/&gt;

Despite the good reception of her work, Sachs did not continue her career. Notwithstanding her contribution to Wilamowitz's considerations on his famous study on Plato, published in 1919, she is generally viewed as a source of evidence for Wilamowitz, instead of a scholar in her own right.&lt;ref name="Foot02"/&gt;

Eva Sachs spent her last years in an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]] and died in [[Vienna]] in September 1936.&lt;ref name=Foot07&gt;Calder, W. M. ''Eva Sachs on Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.'', Illinois Classical Studies, 1988, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Magellan''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|g|ɛ|l|ə|n}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/magellan "Magellan"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|l|ə|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/magellan "Magellan"] entry in ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pt|Fernão de Magalhães}}, {{IPA-pt|fɨɾˈnɐ̃w dɨ mɐɣɐˈʎɐ̃jʃ|IPA}}; {{lang-es|link=no|Fernando de Magallanes}}, {{IPA-es|feɾˈnando ðe maɣaˈʎanes|IPA}}; c. 1480 – 27 April 1521) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer who organised the Spanish expedition to the [[East Indies]] from 1519 to 1522, resulting in the first [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth, completed by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]].

Born into a Portuguese noble family in around 1480, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer and was eventually selected by King [[Charles I of Spain]] to search for a westward route to the [[Maluku Islands]] (the "Spice Islands"). Commanding a fleet of five vessels, he headed south through the Atlantic Ocean to Patagonia, passing through the [[Strait of Magellan]] into a body of water he named the "peaceful sea" (the modern [[Pacific Ocean]]). Despite a series of storms and mutinies, the expedition reached the Spice Islands in 1521 and returned home via the [[Indian Ocean]] to complete the first circuit of the globe. Magellan did not complete the entire voyage, as he was killed during the [[Battle of Mactan]] in the Philippines in 1521. His gift, the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] image, remains one of his legacies during his arrival.

Magellan had already reached the [[Malay Archipelago]] in Southeast Asia on previous voyages traveling east (from 1505 to 1511–1512). By visiting this area again but now travelling west, Magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0295991151 Gordon Miller, ''Voyages: To the New World and Beyond''], p. 30, University of Washington Press, First American edition, 2011,{{ISBN|0295991151|978-0295991153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023160813/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }} ''Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800'', Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and travels==
[[File:Fernão de Magalhães - Padrão dos Descobrimentos.png|thumb|upright|Effigy of Ferdinand Magellan in the [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos|Monument of the Discoveries]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]
[[File:Fernão de Magalhães-Ponte da Barca (7).jpg|thumb|Statue in Ponte da Barca, Portugal]]

Magellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at [[Vila Nova de Gaia]], near [[Porto]], in [[Douro Litoral Province]], or at [[Sabrosa Municipality|Sabrosa]], near [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]], in [[Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province]]. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhães, ''Alcaide-Mor'' of Aveiro (1433–1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhães and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhães, wife with issue of João Fernandes Barbosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=68570|title=Fernão de Magalhães, 1478 |publisher=Geneall.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. [[Francisco de Almeida]] as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in [[Goa]], [[Cochin]] and [[Quilon]]. He participated in several battles, including the [[battle of Cannanore]] in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the [[Battle of Diu (1509)|battle of Diu]].&lt;ref&gt;James A. Patrick, ''Renaissance and Reformation'', p. 787, Marshall Cavendish, 2007, {{ISBN|0761476504}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later sailed under [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] in the first Portuguese embassy to [[Malacca]], with [[Francisco Serrão]], his friend and possibly cousin.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Bernstein, ''A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World'', pp. 183–185, Grove Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0802144160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrão, who had landed.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", pp. 44–45, Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1406760064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1511, under the new governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], Magellan and Serrão participated in the [[Portuguese Malacca|conquest of Malacca]]. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had [[indentured servant|indentured]] and baptized, [[Enrique of Malacca]], he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrão departed in the first expedition sent to find the "[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]" in the [[Moluccas]], where he remained. He married a woman from [[Ambon Island|Amboina]] and became a military advisor to the Sultan of [[Ternate]], Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", p. 51, Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1406760064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Donkin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4IFMnssyqgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Between East and West: The Moluccas and the Traffic in Spices up to the Arrival of Europeans"], p. 29, Volume 248 of ''Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society,'' Diane Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|0871692481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in [[Morocco]], he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was  accused of trading illegally with the [[Moors]]. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mervyn D. Kaufman|title=Ferdinand Magellan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNCHmeAtgrYC|date=2004|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-0736824873|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ZNCHmeAtgrYC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he left for Spain. In [[Seville]] he befriended his countryman [[Duarte Barbosa|Diogo Barbosa]] and soon married the daughter of Diogo's second wife, María Caldera Beatriz Barbosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=141275|title=Beatriz Barbosa, 1495 |publisher=Geneall.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhães&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noronha|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Carlos de Magalhães, both of whom died at a young age. His wife died in [[Seville]] around 1521.

Meanwhile, Magellan devoted himself to studying the most recent [[portolan charts|charts]], investigating, in partnership with [[cosmographer]] [[Rui Faleiro]], a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

==Voyage of circumnavigation==
{{see also|Timeline of the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Armada de Molucca}}

===Background: Spanish search for a westward route to Asia===
[[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the West (1492–1503) had the goal of reaching the [[Indies]] and to establish direct commercial relations between Spain and the Asian kingdoms. The Spanish soon realized that the lands of the Americas were not a part of Asia, but a new continent. The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] reserved for Portugal the eastern routes that went around Africa, and [[Vasco da Gama]] and the Portuguese arrived in [[India]] in 1498.

Castile (''Spain'') urgently needed to find a new commercial route to Asia. After the Junta de Toro conference of 1505, the [[Spanish Crown]] commissioned expeditions to discover a route to the west. Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] reached the Pacific Ocean in 1513 after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]], and [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] died in [[Río de la Plata]] in 1516 while exploring South America in the service of Spain.

===Funding and preparation===
In October 1517 in [[Seville]], Magellan contacted Juan de Aranda, [[Factor (agent)|Factor]] of the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]''. Following the arrival of his partner Rui Faleiro, and with the support of Aranda, they presented their project to the Spanish king, Charles I, future Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Magellan's project, if successful, would  realize Columbus' plan of a [[spice trade|spice route]] by sailing west without damaging relations with the Portuguese. The idea was in tune with the times and had already been discussed after Balboa's discovery of the Pacific. On 22 March 1518 the king named Magellan and Faleiro captains so that they could travel in search of the Spice Islands in July. He raised them to the rank of Commander of the [[Order of Santiago]]. The king granted them:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castro|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monopoly of the discovered route for a period of ten years.
* Their appointment as governors of the lands and islands found, with 5% of the resulting net gains.
* A fifth of the gains of the travel.
* The right to levy one thousand ducats on upcoming trips, paying only 5% on the remainder.
* Granting of an island for each one, apart from the six richest, from which they would receive a fifteenth.

The expedition was funded largely by the Spanish Crown, which provided ships carrying supplies for two years of travel. Expert [[cartographer]] [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diego Ribero|Diogo Ribeiro]], a Portuguese who had started working for Charles V in 1518&lt;ref&gt;"Marvellous countries and lands" (Notable Maps of Florida, 1507–1846), Ralph E. Ehrenberg, 2002, webpage: [http://www.co.broward.fl.us/library/bienes/lii14003.htm BLib3]: notes some head mapmakers {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312072818/http://www.co.broward.fl.us/library/bienes/lii14003.htm |date=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cartographer at the ''Casa de Contratación'', took part in the development of the maps to be used in the travel. Several problems arose during the preparation of the trip, including lack of money, the king of Portugal trying to stop them, Magellan and other Portuguese incurring suspicion from the Spanish, and the difficult nature of Faleiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castro|2007|pp=329–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, thanks to the tenacity of Magellan, the expedition was ready. Through the bishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]] they obtained the participation of merchant [[Christopher de Haro]], who provided a quarter of the funds and goods to barter.

===Fleet===
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the sole ship of Magellan's fleet to complete the circumnavigation. Detail from a map by [[Ortelius]], 1590.]]
[[File:ReplicaNaoVictoriaMagallanes.jpg|thumb|The Nao Victoria Replica in the [[Nao Victoria Museum]], [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]]]]

The fleet provided by King Charles V included five ships:
* The [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' (110 tons, crew 55), under Magellan's command
* ''San Antonio'' (120 tons; crew 60) commanded by Juan de Cartagena
* ''Concepción'' (90 tons, crew 45) commanded by Gaspar de Quesada
* ''Santiago'' (75 tons, crew 32) commanded by [[João Serrão]]
* ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' (85 tons, crew 43), named after the church of Santa Maria de la Victoria de Triana, where Magellan took an oath of allegiance to Charles V; commanded by Luis Mendoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Oceaniaweb/factfile/Unique-facts-Oceania9.htm|title=Unique Facts about Oceania:  Ferdinand Magellan|website=www.sheppardsoftware.com|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
The crew of about 270 included men from several nations, including Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Greece, England and France.&lt;ref name="Levinson2001"&gt;{{Citation|author=Nancy Smiler Levinson|title=Magellan and the First Voyage Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PbBzjBuW8IC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=31 July 2010|year=2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0395987735|page=39|quote=Personnel records are imprecise. The most accepted total number is 270.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish authorities were wary of Magellan, so that they almost prevented him from sailing, switching his mostly Portuguese crew to mostly men of Spain. It included about 40 Portuguese, among them Magellan's brother-in-law [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[João Serrão]], a relative of Francisco Serrão, [[Esteban Gómez|Estêvão Gomes]] and Magellan's indentured servant [[Enrique of Malacca]]. Faleiro, who had planned to accompany the voyage, withdrew prior to boarding.
[[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], a Spanish merchant ship captain settled at Seville, embarked seeking the king's pardon for previous misdeeds.  [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller, asked to be on the voyage, accepting the title of "[[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]]" and a modest salary. He became a strict assistant of Magellan and kept an accurate journal. The only other sailor to report the voyage would be Francisco Albo, who kept a formal [[logbook]].
[[Juan de Cartagena]] was named Inspector General of the expedition, responsible for its financial and trading operations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Departure and crossing of the Atlantic===
On 10 August 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command left [[Seville]] and descended the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] to reach the Atlantic Ocean at [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], at the mouth of the river. There they remained more than five weeks. Finally they set sail on 20 September 1519 and left Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1966, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] ordered a Portuguese naval detachment to pursue Magellan, but the explorer evaded them. After stopping at the [[Canary Islands]], Magellan arrived at [[Cape Verde]], where he set course for Cape St. Augustine in [[Brazil]]. On 27 November the expedition crossed the [[equator]]; on 6 December the crew sighted South America.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On 13 December anchored near present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Although in 1500, Pedro Alvares Cabral claimed the eastern most shores of Brazil for Portugal, Portugal did not maintain a permanent settlement there to protect its brazilwood monopoly (the French were able to help themselves to the timber without interference.) Magellan's armada arrived without Portuguese notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Bergreen|title=Over the Edge of the World|publisher=Harper Pereenial, 2004|pages=96–98|isbn=978-0066211732|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the crew was resupplied, but bad conditions caused them to delay. Afterwards, they continued to sail south along South America's east coast, looking for the strait that Magellan believed would lead to the Spice Islands. The fleet reached [[Río de la Plata]] in early February, 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1966, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

For overwintering, Magellan established a temporary settlement called [[Puerto San Julian]] on March 30, 1520. On Easter (April 1 and 2), a mutiny broke out involving three of the five ship captains. Magellan took quick and decisive action. Luis de Mendoza, the captain of ''Victoria'', was killed by a party sent by Magellan, and the ship was recovered. After ''Concepción's'' anchor cable had been secretly cut by his forces, the ship drifted towards the well-armed ''Trinidad'', and ''Concepcion's'' captain de Quesada and his inner circle surrendered. Juan de Cartagena, the head of the mutineers on the ''San Antonio,'' subsequently gave up. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] reported that Gaspar Quesada, the captain of ''Concepción'', and other mutineers were executed, while Juan de Cartagena, the captain of ''San Antonio'', and a priest named Padre Sanchez de la Reina were [[Marooning|marooned]] on the coast. Most of the men, including [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], were needed and forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Bergreen|title=Over the Edge of the World|publisher=Harper Pereenial 2003|pages=134–150|isbn=978-0066211732|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly those killed were [[drawn and quartered]] and [[impalement|impaled]] on the coast; years later, their bones were found by Sir [[Francis Drake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drake|1628}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cliffe|1885}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage into the Pacific===
[[File:Strait of Magellan.jpeg|thumb|The [[Strait of Magellan]] cuts through the southern tip of South America connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean.]]

The journey resumed. The help of Duarte Barbosa was crucial in facing the riot in Puerto San Julian; Magellan appointed him as captain of the ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. The ''Santiago'' was sent down the coast on a scouting expedition and was wrecked in a sudden storm. All of its crew survived and made it safely to shore. Two of them returned overland to inform Magellan of what had happened, and to bring rescue to their comrades. After this experience, Magellan decided to wait for a few weeks more before resuming the voyage with the four remaining ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

At 52°S latitude on 21 October 1520, the fleet reached [[Cape Virgenes]] and concluded they had found the passage, because the waters were [[brine]] and deep inland. Four ships began an arduous trip through the {{convert|373|mi|km|0|adj=on}} long passage that Magellan called the ''Estrecho (Canal) de Todos los Santos'', ("All Saints' Channel"), because the fleet travelled through it on 1 November or [[All Saints' Day]]. The strait is now named the [[Strait of Magellan]]. He first assigned ''Concepcion'' and ''San Antonio'' to explore the strait, but the latter, commanded by [[Esteban Gómez|Gómez]], deserted and headed back to Spain on 20 November. On 28 November, the three remaining ships entered the South Pacific. Magellan named the waters the ''Mar Pacifico'' (Pacific Ocean) because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref name=NewAdvent09526b&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09526b.htm|title=Ferdinand Magellan|publisher=New Advent|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magellan and his crew were the first Europeans to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] just east of the Pacific side of the strait.

===Death in the Philippines===
[[File:MactanShrineTower2.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Lapu-Lapu City]], [[Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]].]]

Heading northwest, the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521. On 6 March they reached the [[Marianas]] and [[Guam]]. Pigafetta described the "lateen sail" used by the inhabitants of Guam, hence the name "Island of Sails", but he also writes the inhabitants "entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on", including "the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship."&lt;ref name=Nowell&gt;Nowell, C.E., 1962, Magellan's Voyage Around the World, Antonio Pigafetta's account, Evanston: NorthwesternUniversity Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} "Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three islands the islands of Ladroni."&lt;ref name=Nowell/&gt;{{rp|131}}

On 16 March Magellan reached the island of [[Homonhon]] in the [[Philippines]], with 150 crew left. Members of his expedition became the first Europeans to reach the Philippine archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suárez|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7ZMAbv_jAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magellan relied on [[Enrique of Malacca|Enrique]], his [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] servant and interpreter, to communicate with the native tribes. He had been [[indentured servitude|indentured]] by Magellan in 1511 after the colonization of [[Melaka#European colonization|Malacca]], and had accompanied him through later adventures. They traded gifts with [[Rajah]] Siaiu of [[Mazaua]]&lt;ref&gt;Thought to be [[Limasawa, Southern Leyte]], though this is [[First mass in the Philippines|disputed]]&lt;/ref&gt; who guided them to [[Cebu Island|Cebu]] on 7 April.

[[Rajah Humabon]] of Cebu was friendly towards Magellan and the Spaniards; both he and his queen Hara Amihan were baptized as Christians and were given the image of the [[Holy Child]] (later known as [[Santo Niño de Cebu]]) which along with a cross ([[Magellan's Cross]]) symbolizes the Christianization of the Philippines. Afterward, Rajah Humabon and his ally Datu Zula convinced Magellan to kill their enemy, Datu [[Lapu-Lapu]], on Mactan. Magellan wanted to convert Lapu-Lapu to Christianity, as he had Humabon, but Lapu-Lapu rejected that. On the morning of 27 April 1521, Magellan sailed to Mactan with a small force. During the [[Battle of Mactan|resulting battle]] against Lapu-Lapu's troops, Magellan was struck by a bamboo spear, and later surrounded and finished off with other weapons.&lt;ref name="eyewitnesstohistory1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/magellan.htm |title=The Death of Magellan, 1521 |publisher=Eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigafetta and Ginés de Mafra provided written documents of the events culminating in Magellan's death:

{{quotation|When morning came, forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than two cross-bow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land, &amp;#91;the natives&amp;#93; had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred people. When they saw us, they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries... The musketeers and crossbow-men shot from a distance for about a half-hour, but uselessly... Recognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice... A native hurled a bamboo spear into the captain's face, but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in the native's body. Then, trying to lay hand on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all hurled themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass, which resembles a scimitar, only being larger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already pulling off.&lt;ref name="eyewitnesstohistory1"/&gt;{{better source|reason=Eyewitness to History series is not high quality|date=March 2015}}}}

Magellan provided in his will that Enrique, his interpreter, was to be freed upon his death. But after the battle, the remaining ships' masters refused to free the Malay. Enrique escaped his indenture on 1 May with the aid of Rajah Humabon, amid the deaths of almost 30 crewmen.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Pigafetta had been jotting down words in both [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]] and [[Cebuano language]]s – which he started at Mazaua on 29 March and his list grew to a total of 145 words. He continued communications with indigenous peoples during the rest of the voyage.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing of Magellan's body survived, that afternoon the grieving rajah-king, hoping to recover his remains, offered Mactan's victorious chief a handsome ransom of copper and iron for them but Datu Lapulapu refused. He intended to keep the body as a war trophy. Since his wife and child died in Seville before any member of the expedition could return to Spain, it seemed that every evidence of Ferdinand Magellan's existence had vanished from the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manchester|first=William|title=A World Lit Only by Fire|date=1993|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316545563|title-link=A World Lit Only by Fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Return===
[[File:Magellan Elcano Circumnavigation-en.svg|800px|thumb|center|&lt;center&gt;The Magellan–Elcano voyage. ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', one of the original five ships, circumnavigated the globe, finishing 16 months after Magellan's death.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The casualties suffered in the Philippines left the expedition with too few men to sail all three of the remaining ships. Consequently, on 2 May they abandoned and burned ''Concepción.'' Reduced to ''Trinidad'' and ''Victoria'', the expedition fled westward to [[Palawan]]. They left that island on 21 June and were guided to [[Brunei]], [[Borneo]], by [[Moro people|Moro]] pilots, who could navigate the shallow seas. They anchored off the Brunei breakwater for 35 days, where Pigafetta, an Italian from [[Vicenza]], recorded the splendour of Rajah Siripada's court (gold, two [[pearl]]s the size of hens' eggs, [[porcelain]] from China, [[Glasses|eyeglasses]] from Europe etc.). In addition, Brunei boasted tame elephants and an armament of 62 cannons, more than five times the armament of Magellan's ships. Brunei people were not interested in the Spanish cargo of [[clove]]s, but these proved more valuable than gold upon the return to Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

When reaching the [[Maluku Islands]] (the Spice Islands) on 6 November, the total crew numbered 115. They traded with the [[Sultanate of Tidore|Sultan of Tidore]], a rival of the [[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan of Ternate]], who was the ally of the Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The two remaining ships, laden with valuable spices, tried to return to Spain by sailing westwards. However, as they left the Spice Islands, the ''Trinidad'' began to take on water. The crew tried to discover and repair the leak, but failed. They concluded that ''Trinidad'' would need to spend considerable time being overhauled, but the small ''Victoria'' was not large enough to accommodate all the surviving crew. As a result, ''Victoria'' with some of the crew sailed west for Spain. Several weeks later, ''Trinidad'' departed and tried to return to Spain via the Pacific route. This attempt failed. ''Trinidad'' was captured by the Portuguese and was eventually wrecked in a storm while at anchor under Portuguese control.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

''Victoria'' set sail via the Indian Ocean route home on 21 December, commanded by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]]. By 6 May 1522 the ''Victoria'' rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], with only rice for rations. Twenty crewmen died of starvation before Elcano put into [[Cape Verde]], a Portuguese holding, where he abandoned 13 more crew on 9 July in fear of losing his cargo of 26 [[ton]]s of spices (cloves and [[cinnamon]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
On 6 September 1522, Elcano and the remaining crew of Magellan's voyage arrived in Spain aboard the ''Victoria'', almost exactly three years after the fleet of five ships had departed. Magellan had not intended to circumnavigate the world, but rather had intended only to find a secure route through which the Spanish ships could navigate to the Spice Islands. After Magellan's death, Elcano decided to push westward, thereby completing the first known voyage around the entire Earth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Maximilianus Transylvanus]] interviewed some of the surviving members of the expedition when they presented themselves to the Spanish court at [[Valladolid]] in the autumn of 1522. He wrote the first account of the voyage, which was published in 1523. Pigafetta's account was not published until 1525, and was not published in its entirety until 1800. This was the Italian transcription by [[Carlo Amoretti]] of what is now called the "Ambrosiana codex." The expedition eked out a small profit, but the crew was not paid full wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stefoff|1990|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four crewmen of the original 55 on ''Trinidad'' finally returned to Spain in 1522; 51 had died in war or from disease. In total, approximately 232 sailors of assorted nationalities died on the expedition around the world with Magellan.

===Survivors===
When ''Victoria'', the one surviving ship and the smallest carrack in the fleet, returned to the harbor of departure after completing the first circumnavigation of the Earth, only 18 men out of the original 237 men were on board. Among the survivors were two Italians, [[Antonio Pigafetta]] and Martino de Judicibus. '''Martino de Judicibus''' ({{lang-es|link=no|'''Martín de Judicibus'''}}) was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] or Savonese&lt;ref&gt;Documents related to the questioning performed by the Spanish [[Maximilianus Transylvanus|authorities]] after the 18 survivors of the voyage returned to Seville in 1522 report that de Judicibus was born in [[Savona]], Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Steward]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Pigafetta, "Il viaggio di Magellano intorno al mondo", review by James Alexander Robertson, Cleveland, 1906, Ed. Arthur Clark&lt;/ref&gt; His history is preserved in the nominative registers at the ''Archivo General de Indias'' in [[Seville]], Spain. The family name is referred to with the exact Latin patronymic, "de Judicibus". Martino de Judicibus, initially assigned to the caravel ''Concepción'', one of five ships of the Spanish fleet of Magellan, had embarked on the expedition with the rank of captain.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Aftermath and legacy==

[[Antonio Pigafetta|Antonio Pigafetta's]] journal is the main source for much of what is known about Magellan and Elcano's voyage. The other direct report of the voyage was that of Francisco Albo, the last ''Victoria'''s pilot, who kept a formal [[logbook]]. Europeans first learned of the circumnavigation through an account written by [[Maximilianus Transylvanus]], a relative of sponsor [[Christopher de Haro]], who interviewed survivors in 1522 and published his account in 1523.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Since there was not a set limit to the east, in 1524 both kingdoms had tried to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal [[Sphere|hemispheres]] and to resolve the "Moluccas issue". A board met several times without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an accurate calculation of [[longitude]], and each gave the islands to their sovereign. An agreement was reached only with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], signed on 1529 between Spain and [[Portugal]]. It assigned the Moluccas to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain. The course that Magellan charted was followed by other navigators, such as [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. In 1565, [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco route]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1525, soon after the return of Magellan's expedition, Charles V sent an expedition led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] to occupy the [[Moluccas]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. This expedition included the most notable Spanish navigators: Juan Sebastián Elcano, who, along with many other sailors, died of [[malnutrition]] during the voyage, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]]. They had difficulty reaching the Moluccas, docking at [[Tidore]]. The Portuguese were already established in nearby [[Ternate]] and the two nations had nearly a decade of skirmishing over the "possession." (occupied by indigenous peoples.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Magellan's expedition was the first to circumnavigate the globe and the first to navigate the strait in South America connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Magellan's name for the Pacific was adopted by other Europeans.

Magellan's crew observed several animals that were entirely new to European science, including a "[[camel]] without humps", which was probably a [[guanaco]], whose range extends to Tierra del Fuego. The [[llama]], [[vicuña]] and [[alpaca]] natural ranges were in the Andes mountains. A black "[[goose]]" that had to be skinned instead of plucked was a penguin.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The full extent of the globe was realized, since their voyage was 14,460 Spanish leagues (60,440&amp;nbsp;km or 37,560&amp;nbsp;mi). The global expedition showed the need for an [[International Date Line]] to be established. Upon returning the expedition found its date was a day behind, although they had faithfully maintained the ship's log. They lost one day because they traveled west during their circumnavigation of the globe, opposite to Earth's daily rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.themaphouse.com/SpecialistCatalogues/FerdinandMagellan.aspx |title=Maps of the Magellan Strait and a brief history of Ferdinand Magellan |location=London |accessdate=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused great excitement at the time, and a special delegation was sent to the [[Pope]] to explain the oddity to him.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The [[Order of Magellan]] was established in 1902 to honour those who complete a circumnavigation and make other contributions to humanity.

Two of the closest [[galaxy|galaxies]], the [[Magellanic Clouds]] in the southern celestial hemisphere, were named for Magellan sometime after 1800. The [[Magellan probe]], which mapped the planet [[Venus]] from 1990 to 1994, was named after Magellan. The [[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|Ferdinand Magellan train rail car]] (also known as U.S. Car. No. 1) is a former Pullman Company observation car that was re-built by the U.S. Government for presidential use from 1943 until 1958.

A replica of the ''Victoria'', the only ship of Magellan's to survive the entire voyage, can be visited in [[Puerto San Julian]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Three craters, two located on the [[Moon]] and one on [[Mars]], have been named after Magellan using the spelling "Magelhaens". The names were adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1935 ([[Magelhaens (lunar crater)|Magelhaens]] on the Moon), 1976 ([[Magelhaens (Martian crater)|Magelhaens]] on Mars), and 2006 (Magelhaens A on the Moon).&lt;ref name="IAU"/&gt; The asteroid [[4055 Magellan]], discovered in 1985, and the [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan probe]] to Venus (1989–1994) were also named after him.

The five hundredth anniversary of Magellan's expedition and circumnavigation will be commemorated in a series of events organised by the municipal council of [[Sanlucar de Barrameda 2019-2022|Sanlucar de Barrameda]] in Spain, and supported by philanthropic organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanlucardebarrameda.tv/drupal/node/1366?q=node/1809 Presentado el logotipo del V Centenario de la primera circunnavegación de la tierra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125193622/http://sanlucardebarrameda.tv/drupal/node/1366?q=node%2F1809 |date=25 January 2016 }}.

"'''First globalization'''" is a phrase used by economists to describe the world's first major period of [[globalization]] of [[trade]] and [[finance]], which took place between 1870 and 1914. The "second globalization" began in 1944 and ended in 1971. This led to the third era of globalization, which began in 1989 and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X|title=Capital in the Twenty First Century|last=Piketty|first=Thomas|date=2014|publisher=Belknap Press: An Imprint of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674430006|location=Cambridge, Mass.|language=English|translator-last=Goldhammer|translator-first=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization revolves around technological and social advances, which further leads to advances in trade and cultural relativism throughout the world. Some economists claim that globalization was first started by the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]]. This assumption is considered false due to the mass discovery of gold and silver in mines. This discovery led to the decrease in value of silver and gold in Europe, causing inflation in the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/09/economic-history-1|title=When did globalisation start?|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discovery of the Americas and the natives gave European traders a new source of labor between the continents, which also increased trade. This stage has not been officially deemed the "first era of globalization" because the world trade numbers were not increasing exponentially. World trade increased by 1% per year from 1500 to 1800, which further led to the first era of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nordregio.se/en/Metameny/About-Nordregio/Journal-of-Nordregio/2008/Journal-of-Nordregio-no-1-2008/The-Three-Waves-of-Globalisation/|title=The Three Waves of Globalisation - Nordregio|website=www.nordregio.se|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering the 18th century, due to new technological breakthroughs world trade started to increase rapidly. The first technological advancement that contributed to this was the [[steam engine]], introduced in the 17th century. This led to major progress in [[international trade]] among the economic powers of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennen|first=Ward|date=2003|title=The Globalisation Timeline|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/136/91|journal=The Globalisation Timeline|volume=Vol. 4,|pages=No. 3, pp. 137–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the [[steamship]] had a great impact on the first wave of globalization. Before its invention, trade routes were reliant on wind patterns, but steamships reduced shipping time and shipping cost. By 1850, nearly 129 countries used steamships for trade, and approximately 5,000 imports and exports were made to 5,000 cities, thus making a great impact on the world's global economy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nephist.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/on-trade-globalization-development-and-steamships/|title=On #Trade, #Globalization, #Development and Steamships|date=2014-10-08|work=The NEP-HIS Blog|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vorläufer-titlepage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Title page of Volume 1, Part 1 of ''Die Vorläufer des neueren Sozialismus'' (Forerunners of Modern Socialism).]]

'''''Forerunners of Modern Socialism''''' (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Die Vorläufer des neueren Sozialismus)'' is a four volume work that documents the history of primitive communist and socialist ideas, edited by [[Karl Kautsky]] and including contributions by a number of prominent intellectuals of the [[Second International]], including [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Paul Lafargue]], [[C. Hugo]], [[Franz Mehring]], and [[Georgi Plekhanov|Georgii Plekhanov]]. The first volume was published in 1895.

Although only partially translated into English as of the middle of the 2010s, this German-language work is regarded as an important pioneering [[Marxism|Marxist]] study of the history of the impact of early [[Christianity]] and various classical philosophical thinkers upon the modern [[socialism|socialist]] movement.

==Publication history==
[[File:Karl Kautsky 01.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Karl Kautsky, called "the dean of German Marxism," was the editor of the four volume ''Die Vorläufer des neueren Sozialismus'' (Forerunners of Modern Socialism).]]

''Forerunners of Modern Socialism'' was a series of volumes published under the general title "The History of Socialism in Individual Treatments" (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Die geschichte des Sozialismus in Einzeldarstellungen),'' initiated under the editorship of Karl Kautsky (1854-1938).&lt;ref name=Title&gt;Title page of  [https://archive.org/details/vorlauferneuerv1pt1kaut ''Die Vorläufer des neueren Sozialismus: Erster Band, erster Theil: Von Plato bis zu den Wiedertäusern''] (Forerunners of Modern Socialism: Volume 1, Part 1: From Plato to the Anabaptists). Stuttgart, Germany: Verlag von J.H.W. Dietz, 1895; pg. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of what was to eventually emerge as a four volume work was published in [[Stuttgart]] by the Dietz publishing house and included topical contributions by Kautsky, [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Paul Lafargue]], [[C. Hugo]], [[Franz Mehring]], and [[Georgi Plekhanov|Georgii Plekhanov]].&lt;ref name=Title /&gt;

Kautsky contributed the chapters on Christianity from the ancient to the Reformation period.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Boer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dHn3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Boer+Kautsky%27s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif9-q3vJXKAhWILmMKHUgkC30Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Boer%20Kautsky's&amp;f=false "Karl Kautsky's ''Forerunners of Modern Socialism,''"] ''Chiasma,'' no. 1, pg. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Bernstein]] contributed a chapter on [[Cromwell]] and Communism. Karl Marx's son in law, [[Paul Lafargue]] added substantial material on the Jesuit communistic community in [[Paraguay]], also called the [[Jesuit reduction]] settlements, as well as [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella's]] ''[[The City of the Sun]].''&lt;ref&gt;Henry W.

It was a major work of [[Second International]], [[Orthodox Marxism]] in analyzing history from ancient times to the early modern period.

Karl Kautsky, the leading theoretician of the Second International began his coverage of [[Thomas More]] with the observation that the two great figures inaugurating the history of socialism are More and Münzer, and that both of them "follow the long line of Socialists, from [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] and [[Pythagoras]] to Plato, the Gracchi, [[Catiline]], Christ..."&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1966/twosouls/1-ancestors.htm ''The Two Souls of Socialism: Some Socialist Ancestors,''] ''New Politics,'' vol. 5, no.1 (Winter 1966), pp.57-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final volume of the four-volume set was written by [[Hugo Lindemann]] and [[Morris Hillquit]], focusing on socialism in France and America.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Boer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lbZfiC1YhBoC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=kautsky+forerunners+Socialism+hillquit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2jrHD5ofKAhVDbSYKHebtCLgQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=kautsky%20forerunners%20Socialism%20hillquit&amp;f=false ''Criticism of Religion: On Marxism and Philosophy: Volume II.''] Leiden, NL: Brill, 2009; pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Grace Simpson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA}} (12 November 1920 &amp;ndash; 8 February 2007) was a British archaeologist and museum curator specialising in the study of Roman ceramics, especially [[Terra sigillata|Samian ware]].&lt;ref name="ARA"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.associationromanarchaeology.org/ARA_Bulletin18_pages16to30.pdf |author1=Bird, J. |date=December 2007 |title=Grace Simpson (1920-2007) |journal=[[Association of Roman Archaeology]] Bulletin |volume=18 |pages=18-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simpson spent her early years in Newcastle, where her father F. G. Simpson was Director of Archaeological Field Research and went to school at [[Penrhos College]]. She served as a nurse during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name='ARA' /&gt;

===Career===
After the war, Simpson studied at [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]], graduating with a Diploma in European Archaeology in 1948. Between 1950 and 1954 she was a research assistant to [[Eric Birley]] at [[Durham University]].&lt;ref name='ARA' /&gt; Between 1950 and 1972 Simpson was the Honorary Curator of the [[John Clayton (town clerk)|Clayton Collection]] of antiquities at [[Cilurnum|Chesters Roman fort]].&lt;ref name='FCM'&gt;{{cite thesis |last=McIntosh |first=Frances C. |date=2017 |title=The Clayton Collection: an archaeological appraisal of a 19th century collection |publisher=Newcastle University |page=3 |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3687/1/McIntosh%2C%20F%202017.pdf |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook postgraduate study at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]] and was awarded her PhD from Oxford in 1960. The subject of this thesis was published in 1964 as ''Britons and the Roman Army: A Study of Wales and the Southern Pennines in the 1st-3rd Centuries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=[[Leslie Alcock|Alcock, L.]] |date=1965 |title=Review.Grace Simpson, Britons and the Roman Army.

Simpson's study of the late [[Joseph Stanfield]]'s investigations into samian ware resulted in the 1958 publication of ''Central Gaulish Potters'', which remains an essential work for the study of the subject more than fifty years on.&lt;ref name='ARA' /&gt; She was one of the early member of the [[Rei cretariae Romanae fautores]], a specialist study group for Roman ceramicists, following its founding 1957 and organised the 14th Congress of the society in Oxford and London in September 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author1=Wells, C.

'''Gyula László''' ([[Kőhalom]], 14 March 1910 – [[Nagyvárad]] (today: [[Oradea]]) 17 July 1998) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[historian]], [[archaeologist]] and [[artist]].

His main work is the disputed theory of "double incoming" of Hungarians to the [[Carpathian Basin]] in 5th and 9th century. The base of the theory is that [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] culture is similar, or sometimes identical to [[Hungarian culture]], so the second incoming in 895, confirmed by all historians, must have been taking part after another 'incoming'. This is documented in all Hungarian [[chronicle]]s, such as [[Chronicon Pictum]].

Palestineremembered.com, November 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;) was [[Professor]] Emeritus of [[History]] and [[Umar al-Mukhtar]] Chair of [[Arab Culture]] at [[Georgetown University]], where he was a specialist in European intellectual history and social thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.georgetown.edu/departments/history/6735.html In Memoriam: Dr. Hisham B. Sharabi] Georgetown Department of History.&lt;/ref&gt; He died of cancer at the [[American University of Beirut]] [[hospital]] on January 13, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12667-2005Jan15.ht Arab Intellectual Hisham Sharabi, 77, Dies]. ''[[The Washington Post]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young Life==
He spent his early years growing up in Jaffa, Palestine and [[Acre, Israel|Acre, Palestine]] before attending American University in Beirut, where he graduated with a B.A. in [[Philosophy]].  He then traveled to study at the [[University of Chicago]], where he completed an M.A. in Philosophy in 1949.  Politically active from a young age, Sharabi then returned to serve as editor of the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]]’s monthly magazine ''[[al-Jil al-Jadid]]'' (''[[The New Generation]]'').  Forced to flee to [[Jordan]] after the parties disbanding in 1949, Sharabi returned to the [[United States]] where he completed a Ph.D. in the history of culture, again at the University at Chicago.  That same year, he began to teach at Georgetown University, where he gained full professorship in eleven years.

==Controversy==
Dr. Sharabi, while an ardent supporter of Palestinian rights, was not beyond criticizing the Palestinian governing bodies. According to a story in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "In 1999, after [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] ordered the arrests of 11 Palestinian academics who had accused his administration of 'tyranny and corruption,' Dr. Sharabi, along with [[Edward Said]] of [[Columbia University]], signed a letter calling the arrests 'a totally unjustifiable attack on the [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].'" Nine of the lawmakers were immune from arrest, but two later accused the Palestinian police of attacking them.[5]

==Legacy==
He worked tirelessly to promote understanding of the [[Arab]] culture, establishing in 1973, along with several other colleagues, the [[Georgetown Center for Contemporary Arab Studies]].  In 1977, Georgetown University “awarded Dr. Sharabi the Umar Al-Mukhtar Chair in Arab Culture in recognition of his distinguished intellectual contributions and his efforts to promote Arab studies.[2]”  Dr. Sharabi formed, later that same year, [[The Jerusalem Fund|the Jerusalem Fund for Education and Community Development]], an organization that worked on educational, cultural and health issues of [[Palestinians]].  He served as Chairman of Board until his death in 2005.  In 1991, he formed what is now known as the [[Palestine Center]], which serves as a [[think tank]] educating the general public on Palestinian Political Issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/sp/i/189/pid/189 About Us]. The Jerusalem Fund. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Author of 18 books and numerous articles and editorials, he is well respected as a foremost 20th-century Arab intellectual, contributing greatly to the study of Arabic culture[3].  Dr. Sharabi also published several books himself on Arabic culture and philosophy. "In honor of his work in both the European and Arab fields, the Department of history at Georgetown convened an international two-day symposium in 2002 titled ‘The Role of the Intellectual in Contemporary Political Life.’ Also named in his honor is the annual Hisham Sharabi graduate essay contest, begun by the Department's graduate students upon Dr. Sharabi's retirement in 1998[2]."&lt;ref&gt;Sharabi, Hisham.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">The '''Jewish history of [[Adamów, Łuków County|Adamów]]''' at the [[Łuków County]] dates back as soon as 1872. By then, more than 100 [[Jews]] lived in town, meaning the Jewish community might existed long before. During the [[holocaust]], the entire Jewish community of the town was annihilated, resulting in the disappearance of any Jewish existence in town ever since.  
[[File:POL gmina Adamów flag.svg|thumb|POL gmina Adamów flag]]

==History==
By the end of the 19th century, more than 500 [[Jews]] lived in Adamów.&lt;ref&gt;Archiwum Państwowe w Lublinie, Urząd Wojewódzki Lubelski 1918–1939, Wydział Społeczno-Polityczny, sygn. 730; 1617.(State Archives in Lublin, Province of Lublin Office 1918–1939, Social and Political Department, catalog no. 730; 1617)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Jewish community kept good ties with the community of [[Łuków]], it was put under the community of [[Kock]].&lt;ref&gt;[1.1] K. Czubaszek, Żydzi Łukowa i okolic, Warszawa 2008, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the community had already owned a synagogue, a cemetery, a slaughterhouse and a [[mikveh]]. By the 1920s the [[Jewish]] community made up to 33% of the total population. During that time, Zionist parties held active branches in town.&lt;ref&gt;K. Czubaszek, op. cit., p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust===
After entering town on September 20, 1939, the German troops formed a [[Ghetto]] and a [[Judenrat]] was established.&lt;ref name="jewishinstitute.org.pl"&gt;Qtd. in: http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/gminy/miasto/414.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first mass execution took place in November 1940, when 40 were shot dead in the local cemetery.&lt;ref name="jewishinstitute.org.pl"/&gt; Shortly after, a group of [[Jews]] from nearby Nasielsk were put in the Adamów Ghetto. On the winter of 1942/1943 a [[Typhoid fever]] stroke the ghetto.&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/he/research/ghettos_encyclopedia/ghetto_details.asp?cid=13|title=המכון הבין-לאומי לחקר השואה|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Adamów Ghetto Jews began in October 1942. Then, around 300 individuals, mostly elders, were shot to death in the suburbs of Adamów, in a meadow situated western to the church. All the rest 1,724 Jews living in the Ghetto were sent to the Lukow Ghetto. On the end of September 1942 a group of survivors from a mass killing of [[Jews]] in the nearby Serokomla and joined the [[Jews]] of the local ghetto. On September 4, 1942, all valuables were taken away from the Jews of the ghetto by [[Gestapo]] soldiers. Three and four days after, Ukarainian and Polish officers were in charge of sending the Jews of the Ghetto to [[Treblinka extermination camp]].&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"/&gt; A small group of laborers stayed in the village until its closing in August 1943. Another group of forty Jews escaped the Adamów ghetto into the nearby forests, forming a partisan group which carried out attacks on local Nazi forces and Polish representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in: K. Czubaszek, op. cit., p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
*1827: 108 Jews lived in Adamów (18.4%).
*1921: 664 Jews lived in Adamów (34.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/adamow/6,demography/|title=Demography - Jewish community before 1989 - Adamów - Virtual Shtetl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==
During the history of the town Jewish community, and especially in the interwar period in the beginning of the 20th century, most of the grocery stores in Adamów were Jewish-owned. As a result, most of the Jews lived at the city center, which is no longer visible as it was back then because it was set on fire in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/adamow/37,trade-industry-services/44061,rozwoj-handlu-w-adamowie/|title=Rozwój handlu w Adamowie - Trade, industry, services - Jewish community before 1989 - Adamów - Virtual Shtetl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places==

===Synagogue===
Because the synagogue was destroyed during [[World War II]], not much is known about it. It is assumed, though, that it was erected during the 1890s. A [[Mikveh]] was also operated at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in: Archiwum Państwowe w Lublinie, Urząd Wojewódzki Lubelski 1918-1939, Wydział Społeczno-Polityczny, sygn. 730; 1617. (State Archives in Lublin, Province of Lublin Office 1918-1939, Social and Political Department, class. No. 730; 1617)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cemetery===
The Jewish cemetery of Adamow is located along the road to Wojcieszków village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/adamow/12,cemeteries/13894,jewish-cemetery-in-adamow/|title=Jewish Cemetery in Adamów - Cemeteries - Heritage Sites - Adamów - Virtual Shtetl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No gravestones remain.&lt;ref name="iajgsjewishcemeteryproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/poland/damow-siedleckie.html|title=ADAMOW: Siedleckie &amp;#124; poland - International Jewish Cemetery Project|publisher=iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction project was held during 2001, clearing and fencing the area of the cemetery. A monument was also erected in its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/poland/damow-siedleckie.html|title=ADAMOW: Siedleckie - poland - International Jewish Cemetery Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass grave===
No memorial was erected over the mass grave site although forty Jews were murdered in the cemetery in November 1940. In October 1942, the Jews were deported to the Lukow ghetto and then to Treblinka Concentration Camp.&lt;ref name="iajgsjewishcemeteryproject"/&gt;

[[File:James Evans.gif|thumb|James Evans]]
'''James Evans''' (January 18, 1801 &amp;ndash; November 23, 1846) was an English-Canadian [[Methodist]] [[missionary]] and amateur [[linguistics|linguist]]. He is best remembered for his creation of the "[[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|syllabic]]" writing system for [[Ojibwe]] and [[Cree_syllabics|Cree]], which was later adapted to other languages such as [[Inuktitut]].

Evans was born in [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] in England, but emigrated with his parents to [[Lower Canada]] in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/evans_james_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as a teacher. He later moved to [[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]] and continued his teaching work.
[[File:Rev. James Evans Teaching Indians His System of Cree Syllabic Writing.jpg|thumb|left|Teaching Indians his system]]
In 1833 he was ordained as a Wesleyan (Methodist) minister, and in 1840 he was given authority over the local district in [[Norway House]] in [[Manitoba]]. During this time Evans did his greatest work - the development of the Ojibwe and Cree scripts. Evans had picked up Ojibwe during his work among the people in [[Upper Canada]]. He created the Ojibwe script after first trying to apply a Roman script to their language. Later, he modified syllabics slightly and applied it to Cree, a related language. The scripts were based on [[Devanagari]] and [[Pitman Shorthand]]. They were easy to learn and led to almost universal literacy among the Canadian Ojibwe and Cree within a few years.

Evans's other missionary work was scarred by turmoil. Evans clashed several times with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], mostly over their treatment of the native population. Evans accidentally shot and killed his friend and co-worker Thomas Hassall in 1844. He was accused of sexual misconduct with native girls under his care. Although he was acquitted, he was sent to London to defend himself again. The stress took a toll on his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1846.

James Evans's grave was found in England. Then Evans's remains were cremated and sent to Norway House, Manitoba.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Kafiristan.gif|thumb|right|250px|Map of Kafiristan prior to its conversion to Islam in 1890s]]

'''Kāfiristān''', or '''Kāfirstān''' ({{lang-prs|کافرستان}}), is a [[historical region]] that covered present-day [[Nuristan Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] and its surroundings. This historic region lies on, and mainly comprises, the basins of the rivers [[Alingar River|Alingar]], [[Pech river|Pech (Kamah)]], [[Landai Sin river|Landai Sin]] and [[Kunar River|Kunar]], and the intervening mountain ranges. It is bounded by the main range of the [[Hindu Kush]] on the north, [[Pakistan|Pakistan's]] [[Chitral District]] to the east, the [[Kunar Valley]] in the south and the [[Alishang River]] in the west. 

Kafiristan took its name because of the enduring pagan [[Nuristanis|Nuristani]] inhabitants of the region who once followed a form of [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hinduism]], mixed with locally-developed accretions, were non-[[Islam|Muslims]] and were thus known to the surrounding Muslim population as [[Kafir]], meaning "[[infidel]]".&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Nuristanis1.html|title=Richard Strand's Nuristân Site: Peoples and Languages of Nuristan|author=[[Richard Strand|Richard F. Strand]]|date=31 December 2005|work=nuristan.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely related to the [[Kalash people]], a fiercely independent people with a distinctive culture, language and religion.

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as "Peristan", a vast area containing host of "Kafir" cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period, but was forced to become Muslim by [[Abdul Rahman Khan]]. The region was earlier surrounded by Buddhist states that temporarily brought literacy and state rule to the mountains, the decline of Buddhism heavily isolated the region. It was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia
|title=Fence of Peristan - The Islamization of the "Kafirs" and Their Domestication|publisher=Società Italiana di Antropologia e Etnologia|author=Alberto M. Cacopardo|year=2016|pages=69, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Kafiristan'' or ''Kafirstan'' is normally taken to mean "land [''[[-stan]]''] of the [[kafir]]s" in [[Persian language]], where the name {{rtl-lang|fa|کافیر}} ''{{transl|fa|kafir}}'' is derived from the Arabic {{rtl-lang|ar|كافر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāfir}}'', literally meaning a person who refuses to accept a principle of any nature and figuratively as a person refusing to accept Islam as his faith and is commonly translated into English as an "[[infidel]]" or "unbeliever". However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name [[Kata people|Kati]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref name=Pellat&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume IV|editor1=C. E. Bosworth|editor1-link=C. E. Bosworth, |editor2=E. Van Donzel|editor3=Bernard Lewis|editor3-link=Bernard Lewis|editor4=Charles Pellat|editor4-link=Charles Pellat|page=409|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kafiristan was inhabited by people who followed a form of [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hinduism]] before their forcible conversion to [[Islam]] in 1895-1896.&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"/&gt;

The word "kafir" has also been suggested to be linked to ''Kapiś'' (= ''Kapish''), the ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of the region that included historic Kafiristan. According to the theory, the name may have then mutated at some point into the word ''Kapir,'' and once again into the word Kafir.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Dr Moti Chandra - India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Census of India, 1961, p 26, published by India Office of the Registrar General.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Kāṭhakasaṅkalanam: Saṃskr̥tagranthebhyaḥ saṅgr̥hītāni Kāṭhakabrāhmaṇa, Kāṭhakaśrautasūtra, 1981, p xii, Surya Kanta; cf: The Contemporary Review, Vol LXXII, July-Dec, 1897, p 869, A. Strahan (etc), London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Levi states that ''Chinese Kipin is a rendering of an Indian word Kapir'' (See quote in: Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Moti Chandra - India; See also: Bhārata-kaumudī; Studies in Indology in Honour of Dr. Radha Kumud Mookerji, 1945, p 916, Radhakumud Mookerji - India).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a reference to Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|emperor Taizong]] being presented with excellent breed of horses in 637 AD by an envoy from Chi-pin (Kapisa).&lt;ref&gt;See:: T'se-fu-yuan-kuei, p 5024; Wen hisen t'ung-k'ao, 337: 45a; Diplomacy and Trade in the Chinese World, 589–1276, 2005, P 345, Hans Bielenstein&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence from Xuanzang shows that Kai-pi-shi produced all kind of cereals, many kinds of fruits, and a scented root called ''yu-kin'', probably of the grass [[Chrysopogon zizanioides|khus, or vetiver]]. The people used woollen and fur clothes and gold,&lt;ref&gt;Corpus II. 1, xxiv; Cambridge History of India, Vol i\I, p 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient references like [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]] etc profusely attest that the [[Kambojas]] produced and made use of woollen, fur and skin clothes and shawls, all embroidered with gold. Ancient Kambojas were noted for their horses, gold, woollen blankets, furry clothing etc (Foundations of Indian Culture, 1990, p 20, Dr Govind Chandra Pande&amp;nbsp;– Spiritualism (Philosophy); Hindu World, Volume I, 1968, p 520, Benjamin Walker etc&lt;/ref&gt; silver and copper coins.

=== Medieval history ===

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as "Peristan", a vast area containing host of "Kafir" cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhist states and societies]] which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilious according to reports of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa-hsien]] and [[Sung Yun]]. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The [[Kalasha people]] of lower [[Chitral]] are the last surviving heirs of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia

=== Ghaznavids era ===
{{quote|Another crusade against idolatry was at length resolved on; and Mahmud led the seventh one against Nardain, the then boundary of India, or the eastern part of the Hindu Kush; separating, as [[Ferishta]] says, the countries of Hindustan and [[Turkistan]] and remarkable for its excellent fruit.

In Nardain there was a temple, which the army of Ghazni destroyed; and brought from thence a stone covered with certain inscriptions, which were according to the Hindus, of great antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=K̲h̲ān̲ |first=ʻAlī Muḥammad |title=The Political and Statistical History of Gujarát|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M58IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=1835 |location=London |publisher=Richard Bentley|page=29|translator-first = James |translator-last = Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Early modern and later history ===
The first European recorded as having visited Kafiristan was the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] [[Bento de Góis]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]. By his account, he visited a city named "Capherstam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=De Land-Reyse, door Benedictus Goes, van Lahor gedaan, door Tartaryen na China|url=http://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/15489?view=print|author=Pieter Vander Aa|publisher=Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1602, during the course of a journey from [[Lahore]] to [[China]].&lt;ref name="newby"&gt;{{cite book|title=A short walk in the Hindukush|first=Eric|last=Newby|chapter=A little bit of protocol|pages=74–93|isbn=978-0-330-46267-9|publisher=Picador India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American adventurer [[Colonel Alexander Gardner]] claimed to have visited Kafiristan twice, in 1826 and 1828.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt; On the first occasion, [[Dost Mohammad Khan|Dost Mohammad]], the [[amir]] of [[Kabul]], killed members of Gardner's delegation in Afghanistan and forced him to flee from Kabul to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through west Kafiristan.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt; On his second visit, Gardner briefly sojourned in northern Kafiristan and the [[Kunar Valley]] while returning from Yarkand.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt;

In 1883, [[William Watts McNair]], a British surveyor on leave, explored the area disguised as a hakim, reporting on the journey later that year to the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

[[George Scott Robertson]], [[medical officer]] during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and later British political officer in the [[princely state]] of [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]], was given permission to explore the country of the Kafirs in 1890–91. He was the last outsider to visit the area and observe these people's polytheistic culture before their conversion to [[Islam]]. Robertson's 1896 account was entitled ''The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush''. Though some sub-groups such as the [[Kom people (Afghanistan)|Kom]] paid tribute to Chitral, the majority of Kafiristan was left on the Afghan side of the frontier in 1893, when large areas of tribal lands between Afghanistan and British India were divided into zones of control by the [[Durand Line]].

The territory between Afghanistan and [[British Raj|British India]] was [[Durand Line|demarcated between 1894 and 1896]]. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in outskirts of [[Mohmand Agency|Mohmand country]] and [[Bashgal Valley]] on outskirts of Kafiristan were demarcated by 1895 with an agreement reached on 9 April 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfrXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjueb-sYDZAhVErY8KHaUfAxQQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=An Historical Geography of Iran|author=[[Vasily Bartold]]|page=85|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdur Rahman wanted to force every community and tribal confederation with his single interpretation of Islam due to it being the only uniting factor. After the subjugation of [[Hazaras]], Kafiristan was the last remaining autonomus part.&lt;ref name=Katib&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWirPmwYPZAhUIu48KHUkJALwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|publisher=University of California Press|pages=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir Abdur Rahman Khan's forces invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895-1896 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through [[Badakhshan]] and from the east through [[Asmar, Afghanistan|Asmar]]. A small column also came from south-west through [[Laghman Province|Laghman]]. The Kafirs were resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans.&lt;ref name=Sykes1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA195&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWx732tIDZAhUGro8KHSkABdQQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=A History of Afghanistan: Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 1|author=[[Percy Sykes]]|publisher=Routledge|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kafirs were forcibly converted and some also converted to avoid the ''[[jizya]]''.&lt;ref name=Katib/&gt;

A few years after Robertson’s visit, in 1895–96, [[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] invaded and converted the Kafirs to Islam as a symbolic climax to his campaigns to bring the country under a centralised Afghan government. He had similarly subjugated the [[Hazara people]] in 1892–93. In 1896 Abdur Rahman Khan, who had thus conquered the region for Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Stephen. Afghanistan: A Military History from Alexander the Great to the Fall of the Taliban. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2002. Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; renamed the people the [[Nuristanis|Nuristani]] ("Enlightened Ones" in [[Persian language|Persian]]) and the land as [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]] ("Land of the Enlightened").

Kafiristan was full of steep and wooded valleys. It was famous for its precise wood carving, especially of cedar-wood pillars, carved doors, furniture (including "[[horn furniture|horn chairs]]") and statuary. Some of these pillars survive, as they were reused in mosques, but temples, shrines, and centers of local cults, with their wooden effigies and multitudes of ancestor figures were torched and burnt to the ground. Only a small fraction brought back to Kabul as spoils of this Islamic victory over infidels. These consisted of various wooden effigies of ancestral heroes and pre-Islamic commemorative chairs. Of the more than thirty wooden figures brought to Kabul in 1896 or shortly thereafter, fourteen went to the [[Kabul Museum]] and four to the [[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]] and the [[Musée de l'Homme]] located in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Edelberg, Lennart. "Statues de bois rapporte‚ es du Kafiristan aà Kabul apreàs la conquête de cette province par l'Emir Abdul Rahman en 1895/96," Arts Asiatiques 7, 1960, pp. 243–286&lt;/ref&gt;
Those in the Kabul Museum were badly damaged under the [[Taliban]] but have since been restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reportages-pictures.com/AFGHANISTAN/R20405%20KAkir%20sculpture%20from%20Nuristan%20destroyed%20by%20the%20talibans%20then%20restored/index.htm|title=R20405 KAkir sculpture from Nuristan destroyed by the talibans then restored|work=reportages-pictures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hundred [[Kata (people)|Kati Kafirs]], known as the "Red Kafirs" of the Bashgal Valley, fled across the border into Chitral but, uprooted from their homeland, they converted by the 1930s. They settled near the frontier in the valleys of [[Rumbur]], [[Bumboret]] and [[Urtsun]], which were then inhabited by the [[Kalash people|Kalasha tribe]] or the Black Kafirs. Only this group in the three valleys of [[Birir]], Bumburet and Rumbur escaped conversion, because they were located east of the Durand line in the [[princely state]] of [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]. After a decline in population caused by forced conversion in the 1970s, this region of Kafiristan in Pakistan, known as Kalasha Desh, has recently shown an increase in its population.

In early 1991, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]] government recognized the ''de facto'' autonomy of Nuristan and created a new province of that name from districts of [[Kunar Province]] and [[Lamghan Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXIRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|title=Afghanistan from the Cold War Through the War on Terror|author=[[Barnett Rubin|Barnett B.

'''Leontii Voitovych''' ({{lang-ua|Войтович Леонтій Вікторович}}, May 16, 1951, [[Yemanzhelinsk]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] now [[Russian Federation]]) is a modern [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scientist-historian and holds a [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Science]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: До́ктор нау́к) degree. He is a [[research fellow]] of the department of Middle Ages history at the Krypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studies ([[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]) as well as an [[academic department]] director of history of Middle Ages and [[Byzantine studies]] in the [[University of Lviv]].

==Biography==
Born in the [[Ural (region)|Ural region]] of the Russian Federation, Voitovych is from the [[Western Ukraine]]. A brother of his grandfather, Petro Voitovych (1862–1938), was a Lviv  sculptor and known for his works of [[Lviv Opera]]. His family was deported across the [[Ural Mountains]] during the Stalin period and he was growing up in small mining town with many other children of Soviet exiles. His father, who finished the [[Prague Polytechnic]] as a bridge engineer, perished in a mine from a [[methane explosion]]. Soon after the Stalin's death, in 1956 Voitovych together with his mother returned to homeland and settled in [[Mykolaiv, Lviv Oblast]]. Because in the Soviet Union Voitovych was recognized as "unreliable element" by state authorities (i.e. a family of former exiles), he was discouraged to even try to enroll in the [[University of Lviv]].

In 1972 he graduated from Lviv Polytechnic Institute, now [[Lviv Polytechnic National University]], specializing in [[Mechanical Engineering]]. After graduation Voitovych worked in [[Berehove]] at a local branch of the All-Union Institute of maintenance and exploitation of vehicle-tractor park.

In 1981 he started to be involved in historical research. His supervisor was doktor of science [[Yaroslav Isayevych]] who was a director of the department of historical landmarks of the Institute of Social Sciences (today Krypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studies).

In 1994 Voitovych defended his dissertation for a candidate of sciences on "Appanage duchies of Riurikids and Gediminids in 12-16th centuries". In 2001 he defended his doctorate dissertation "Princely dynasties of Eastern Europe (9-16th centuries): composition, social and political role".

Since the late 1990s he was a professor of academic department of Ancient History of Ukraine at the [[University of Lviv]] and since 2005 Voitovych is heading academic department of Middle Ages history and Byzantine studies.

He is considered a notable historian of genealogy of [[Rurikids]] and the history of [[Rus' people]] ([[Ruthenians]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dariusz Dąbrowski, O zgonie Daniela Romanowicza i i jego następstwach dla Rusi Halicko-Wołyńskiej [http://dspace.nbuv.gov.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/58360/18-Dąbrowski.pdf?sequence=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64448">This article lists the oldest free-standing buildings constructed in the world, including on each of the continents and within each country.
"[[Building]]" is defined as any human-made structure used or interface  for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous [[occupancy]]. In order to qualify for list a structure must:
* be a recognisable building;
* incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9&amp;nbsp;ft) in height;
* be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.
* contains an enclosed area with at least one entry point.
This consciously excludes ruins of limited height and statues. The list also excludes:
* [[dolmen]]s&amp;mdash;a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone. Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[tumulus]] (which are included in the list). In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone "skeleton" of the burial mound intact. [[Neolithic]] dolmens are extremely numerous, with over 1,000 reported from [[Megaliths in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in Germany alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/1.1.html "Megaliths in Mecklenburg–Vorpommern"]. University of Toronto. Retrieved 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cairn]]s which are simply large piles of loose stones (as opposed to [[chambered cairn]]s.)

Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by [[radiocarbon dating]] and should be considered approximate.

==By age==
The following are amongst the oldest buildings in the world that have maintained the requirements to be such.  Occupation sites with older human made structures such as those in [[Göbekli Tepe]] do exist, but the structures are monuments and do not meet the definition of building (which can be seen above).  Many of the buildings within the list contain primarily bricks, but most importantly maintain their walls and roof. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the [[Orkney]] islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/514/ "Heart of Neolithic Orkney"]. UNESCO. Retrieved 21 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Age of the Pyramids]].

A '''livery collar''' or '''chain of office''' is a [[collar (jewelry)|collar]] or heavy [[Link chain|chain]], usually of [[gold]], worn as insignia of office or a mark of [[fealty]] or other association in [[Europe]] from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.

One of the oldest and best-known livery collars is the [[#Collar of Esses|Collar of Esses]], which has been in continuous use in England since the 14th century.

==History==

===Origins===
Various forms of [[livery]] were used in the [[Middle Ages]] to denote attachment to a great person by friends, servants, and political supporters.  The collar, usually of precious metal, was the grandest form of these, usually given by the person the livery denoted to his closest or most important associates, but should not, in the early period, be seen as separate from the wider phenomenon of livery badges, clothes and other forms.  From the collar hung a [[heraldic badge|badge]] or device indicating the person the livery related to; the most important part of the ensemble for contemporaries.  Equally gold collars that had no livery connotations were worn.

Livery collars seem to be first recorded in the 14th century.  [[Charles V of France]] in 1378 granted to his [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] [[Geoffrey de Belleville]] the right of bearing in all feasts and in all companies the collar of the ''Cosse de Geneste'' or [[Broom (shrub)#Historical uses|Broomcod]], a collar which was accepted and worn even by the English kings, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] sending such collars to [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and to his three uncles.  Although he distributed "genet" badges much more widely, only about twenty collars per year were given out, and it was treated somewhat as the sign of a pseudo-chivalric order, although no such order formally existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2st-PkahafIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Personal+device%22+livery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8jhsTKeAEcPv4AbK24GxAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crane, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The collar of Esses is first recorded earlier than this, as being given by [[John of Gaunt]], and remained in use by the [[House of Lancaster]] throughout the [[Wars of the Roses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dez8trnjfbUC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Personal+device%22+livery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8jhsTKeAEcPv4AbK24GxAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Personal%20device%22%20livery&amp;f=false Collar of Esses]&lt;/ref&gt;

This French type of collar, a chain of couples of broomcods linked by jewels, is seen in the contemporary [[Wilton Diptych]] portrait of Richard II, with Richard's own [[coat of arms|device]] of the white [[Deer|hart]] hanging below (the angels accompanying the Virgin also wear Richard's livery badges). The same collar was worn by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] on the way to his [[coronation|crowning]]. During the sitting of the [[Parliament of England]] in 1394 the complaints of [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]] against Richard II are recorded, one of his grievances being that the king had been wearing the livery collar of his uncle [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]], and that people of the king's following wore the same livery. To which the king answered that soon after the return from [[Spain]] (in 1389) of his uncle, the duke, he himself took the collar from his uncle's neck, putting it on his own, which collar the king would wear and use for a sign of the good and whole-hearted love between them, even as he wore the liveries of his other uncles. Livery collars of the king of France, of [[Anne of Bohemia|Queen Anne]] and of the dukes of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]] and Lancaster are recorded amongst the royal plate and jewels which in the first year of Henry IV had come to the king's hands. The inventory shows that Queen Anne's collar, was made up of sprigs of [[rosemary]] garnished with [[pearl]]s. The York collar had [[falcon]]s and [[fetterlock]]s, and the Lancaster collar was doubtless that '''Collar of Esses''' used by the duke's son, [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]] (Henry IV), as an earl, duke and king.

==Collar of Esses ==
This famous livery collar, which has never passed out of use, takes many forms, its Esses being sometimes linked together chainwise, and sometimes, in early examples, as the ornamental bosses of a garter-shaped strap-collar. The oldest [[effigy]] bearing it is that in Spratton church of Sir [[John Swynford]], who died in 1371. Swynford was a follower of John of Gaunt, and the date of his death easily disposes of the theory that the Esses were devised by Henry IV to stand for his motto or "word" of Soverayne. Many explanations are given of the origin of these letters, but none has as yet been established. During the reigns of Henry IV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7653348.stm "Henry VIII-era chain up for sale"], 5 October 2008, BBC.com&lt;/ref&gt; his son ([[Henry V of England|Henry V]]), and grandson ([[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]), the collar of Esses was a royal badge of the Lancastrian house and party, the white swan, as in the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], usually being its pendant.

In one of Henry VI's own collars the S was joined to the [[Order of the Broom-cod|broomcod]] of the French device, symbolizing the king's claim to the two kingdoms. The kings of the house of York and their chief followers wore the Yorkist collar of [[sun]]s and [[rose]]s, with the white lion of [[Earl of March|March]], the Clare bull, or [[Richard III of England|Richard]]'s white boar for a pendant [[heraldic badge|device]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] brought back the collar of Esses, a [[portcullis]] or a [[Tudor rose]] hanging from it, although in a portrait of him, in the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], he wears the rose [[Rose (heraldry)#Appearance|''en soleil'']] alternating with knots, and his son (later [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]), when young, had a collar of red and white roses.  It was presented to ministers and courtiers, and came to represent more a symbol of office by the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

The term "Collar of SS" was preferred by Victorian antiquaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Charles | last = Boutell | title = Heraldry Historical &amp; Popular | place = London | year = 1863 | page = 298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since World War II, as "SS" is usually associated with the [[Schutzstaffel]], the term is less often used because of its [[Nazi]] connotation.

==Private livery collars==
[[File:BerkeleyMermaidCollar 1417 WottonUnderEdge Gloucestershire.jpg|thumb|200px|Drawing of detail of mermaid collar of [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley]] (d. 1417), from his [[monumental brass]] at [[Wotton-under-Edge]], Gloucestershire]]
Besides these royal collars, the 14th and 15th centuries show many private devices. A [[monumental brass]] at [[Mildenhall, Suffolk|Mildenhall]] shows a knight whose badge of a dog or wolf circled by a crown hangs from a collar with edges suggesting a pruned bough or the ragged staff. [[Thomas of Markenfield]] (d. c. 1415) on his brass at [[Ripon]] has a strange collar of park palings with a badge of a [[deer|hart]] in a park, and [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley]] (d. 1417) wears one set with [[mermaid]]s, the Berkeley family [[heraldic badge]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. T. ''The Monumental Brasses of Gloucestershire'', London, 1899. Davis correctly states the date of death as 1417, yet incorrectly calls him 4th Lord in place of 5th.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance chains==
In the Renaissance, gold chains tended to replace collars, and [[portrait miniature]] of the donor tended to replace the earlier badges with  symbolic devices, although "picture boxes" containing miniatures could be highly extravagant pieces of jewellery.  The Elizabethan artist [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was both a goldsmith and miniaturist, and so produced the whole of pieces like the ''Armada Jewel'', given by [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]] to a courtier.  When the [[Earl of Rutland]] returned from an embassy to Denmark, sixteen members of his party were given chains of gold with the [[James I of England]]'s picture, and others received just a picture.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  During the sixteenth century collars became marks of a specific office or Order, and subsequently remained so.

===Mayoral collars===
[[File:Susan Fennell cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Susan Fennell, then-mayor of [[Brampton, Ontario]], Canada from 2000 to 2014, pictured wearing a modern mayoral collar.]]
Most British and Irish [[mayor]]s wear a collar/chain of office, and new ones are still designed for new municipalities. The mayor's spouse may have a much smaller version. These are worn over normal clothes when on official duties. Following British practice, most [[Canada|Canadian]], Australian and New Zealand mayors also wear chains of office. The custom also spread outside the Commonwealth, to Germany (originally only Prussia) in 1808, to the Netherlands by royal decree in 1852 and to Norway after the mayor of Oslo received one as a gift in 1950, and most Norwegian mayors now have mayoral chains.

===Collars of orders of knighthood===

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Charles-garter-robes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] wearing the collar of the [[Order of the Garter]].]] --&gt;

Collars of various devices are worn by the knights of some of the European [[orders of knighthood]]. The custom was begun by [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]], who gave his knights of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], badges of a golden fleece hung from a collar of flints, steels and sparks. Following this new fashion, [[Louis XI of France]], when instituting his [[order of St. Michael]] in 1469, gave the knights collars of scallop shells linked on a chain.

The chain was doubled by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], and the pattern suffered other changes before the order lapsed in 1830.

At the end of the 18th century most of the European orders had only one rank—that of Knight—and although they usually had collars the cross or badge was now worn on a ribbon around the neck or over the right shoulder. When the orders became more democratic several ranks were introduced and only the highest grade, the Grand Commanders or Grand Crosses, wore collars. The Netherlands never had collars but several Belgian, most of the Austrian and Prussian orders and several Portuguese orders had collars. In Portugal all the members of these orders of knighthood wore a collar but the collars of the Grand-crosses were more elaborate.

In England, until the reign of Henry VIII, the [[Order of the Garter]], most ancient of the great knightly orders, had no collar. But the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] king must needs match in all things with continental sovereigns, and the present collar of the Garter knights, with its golden knots and its buckled garters enclosing white roses set on red roses, has its origin in the Tudor age.

Knights of most of the British orders have collars which are worn on special occasions, but not the Knights Bachelor or holders of decorations such as the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Order of Merit]], The [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] and the [[Imperial Service Order]]. The [[Royal Victorian Chain]] is a collar and there are no other insignia.

In France, Emperor [[Napoleon I]] introduced the "Grand aigle", a collar, as the highest rank in his [[Légion d'honneur]]. It did not survive his downfall.

Sometimes the collar is the insignia of office of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the order; the French president therefore wears the collar of the Order of the Légion d'honneur. In other countries such as Brazil the collar is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved for the president and foreign heads of state.

===Collars of Freemasonry===
Collars also have a long history within [[Freemasonry]].  Collars are often worn by officers of high rank.  Nearly all Grand Lodge officers wear collars as an emblem of their office.  In history, many such collars are quite valuable, featuring gold and precious jewels. 

Collars vary widely among Masonic Grand Lodges. While those Lodges working under the Grand Lodge of England have fairly uniform designs, Grand Lodges in the United States vary widely, employing collars made from metal chains backed by velvet, to those made of velvet and embroidered with gold and silver bullion thread.

Today, Lodge officers wear a cloth or fabric collar with a simple jewel of their office pendant to it. Each jewel represents a skill or virtue which he possesses and instructs the brothers of Masonry in. In some jurisdictions, these jewels are silver-plated for the Craft or Blue Lodges under 100 years old. In cases of Lodges over 100 years, these jewels are gold-plated. The collar shapes are identical which sit on the wearers shoulders and fall over the chest, ending in a point between the breasts. Except the Master's collar which is circular and far more elaborate in design signifying his skills and knowledge in the Craft are of the highest degree.

[[File:Margaret_Manion.jpg|thumb|right|Margaret Manion]]

'''Margaret Mary Manion''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 7 March 1935) is an Australian art historian and curator recognised internationally for her scholarship on the art of the illuminated manuscript.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has published on Medieval and Renaissance liturgical and devotional works, in particular, on Books of Hours – the ''Wharncliffe Hours'', the ''Aspremont-Kievraing Hours'', the ''Très Riches Heures''. She was instrumental in cataloguing Medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts in Australian and New Zealand collections. She was Herald Chair Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne from 1979 to 1995, also serving as Deputy Dean and Acting Dean in the Faculty of Arts, Associate Dean for Research, Pro-Vice-Chancellor from 1985 to 1988, and in 1987, the first woman to chair the University’s Academic Board.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Nowra, New South Wales, Manion was educated at [[Loreto Normanhurst|Loreto Convent]], Normanhurst and subsequently became a member of the [[Loreto Sisters]]. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in Education and Masters degree at the [[University of Melbourne]], writing her thesis on the ''Wharncliffe Hours'' in the National Gallery of Victoria (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Her thesis subsequently was developed into two books.

== Scholarship ==
Together with Vera Vines and [[Christopher de Hamel]], Manion produced the first census of Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in Australia (in 1984)&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Manion and V. F. Vines, ''Medieval and Renaissance Illuminated Manuscripts in Australian Collections'', London: Thames and Hudson, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and in New Zealand (in 1989).&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Manion, V. F. Vines and C. de Hamel, ''Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in New Zealand Collections'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009–2012 Manion led an [[Australian Research Council]] Linkage Project, in conjunction with Shane Carmondy, Bernard Muir and Toby Burrows, to create an on-line catalogue and digitisation of the twenty-seven manuscripts in the [[State Library of Victoria]] and other important collections in Victoria. This material subsequently was incorporated into the ''Europa Inventa'' database.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.arts.uwa.edu.au/about (accessed 14 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 she authored a scholarly study on the development of the illuminated book from the twelfth century to the advent of printing accompanied by detailed visual analysis of the ''Gospel Book of Theophanes'',&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Felton Bequest, 1960 http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/23016/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Aspremont-Kievraing Hours'',&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Felton Bequest, 1922 http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/28920/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Melbourne Livy'', the ''Wharncliffe Hours'',&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Felton Bequest, 1920 http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/27720/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Strozzi-Acciaioli Hours''&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Felton Bequest, 1961 http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/23188/&lt;/ref&gt; and a fragment of a ''Universal Chronicle'',&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Felton Bequest, 1966 http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/24266/&lt;/ref&gt; all in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Felton Illuminated Manuscripts in the National Gallery of Victoria'', The National Gallery of Victoria and Macmillan Art Publishing, 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11130">The''' Massacre in the Great Temple''', also called the '''Alvarado Massacre''', was an event on May 22, 1520, in the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlan]] during the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest of Mexico]], in which the celebration of the Feast of Toxcatl ended in a massacre of Aztec elites.&lt;ref&gt;El Calendario Mexica y la Cronografía. Rafael Tena 2008 INAH-CONACULTA p 48 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revista de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, UNAM Volume 49, Issues 522-527 p 40&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Hernán Cortés]] was in Tenochtitlan, he heard about other Spaniards arriving on the coast – [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] had come from [[Cuba]] with orders to arrest him  – and Cortés was forced to leave the city to fight them.  During his absence, [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] asked deputy governor [[Pedro de Alvarado]] for permission to celebrate [[Toxcatl]] (an Aztec festivity in honor of [[Tezcatlipoca]], one of their main gods). But after the festivities had started, Alvarado interrupted the celebration, killing almost everyone present at the festival, men, women, and children alike. The few who managed to escape the massacre climbing over the walls proceeded to inform the community of the treacherous Spaniards' atrocity.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

The Spanish version of the incident claims the [[conquistador]]s intervened to prevent a ritual of human sacrifice in the [[Templo Mayor]]; the Aztec version says the Spaniards were enticed into action by the gold the Aztecs were wearing, prompting an Aztec rebellion against the orders of Moctezuma. While differing so on Alvarado's specific motive, both accounts are in basic agreement that the celebrants were unarmed and that the massacre was without warning and unprovoked.

The Aztecs were already antagonistic towards the Spaniards for being inside their city and for holding Moctezuma under house arrest.  When Cortez and his men, including those who had come under Narvaez, returned, the Aztecs began to commence full scale hostilities against the Spaniards.  The Spaniards had no choice but to retreat from the city, which they did on what is called the Sad Night ([[La Noche Triste]]), losing most of their men, who were either killed in the battle or were captured and sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Díaz del Castillo, Bernal |year=1963 |origyear=1632 |title=[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|The Conquest of New Spain]] |edition=6th printing (1973)|others=[[J.

==An Aztec account of the incident==
This is part of the Aztec account:&lt;ref name=Miguel&gt;León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74-77}}

:''Here it is told how the Spaniards killed, they murdered the Mexicans who were celebrating the Fiesta of Huitzilopochtli in the place they called The Patio of the Gods''

:''At this time, when everyone was enjoying the celebration, when everyone was already dancing, when everyone was already singing, when song was linked to song and the songs roared like waves, in that precise moment the Spaniards determined to kill people. They came into the patio, armed for battle.''

:''They came to close the exits, the steps, the entrances [to the patio]: The Gate of the Eagle in the smallest palace, The Gate of the Canestalk and the Gate of the Snake of Mirrors. And when they had closed them, no one could get out anywhere.''

:''Once they had done this, they entered the Sacred Patio to kill people. They came on foot, carrying swords and wooden and metal shields. Immediately, they surrounded those who danced, then rushed to the place where the drums were played. They attacked the man who was drumming and cut off both his arms. Then they cut off his head [with such a force] that it flew off, falling far away. ''

:''At that moment, they then attacked all the people, stabbing them, spearing them, wounding them with their swords. They struck some from behind, who fell instantly to the ground with their entrails hanging out [of their bodies]. They cut off the heads of some and smashed the heads of others into little pieces.''

:''They struck others in the shoulders and tore their arms from their bodies. They struck some in the thighs and some in the calves. They slashed others in the abdomen and their entrails fell to the earth. There were some who even ran in vain, but their bowels spilled as they ran; they seemed to get their feet entangled with their own entrails. Eager to flee, they found nowhere to go.''

:''Some tried to escape, but the Spaniards murdered them at the gates while they laughed. Others climbed the walls, but they could not save themselves. Others entered the communal house, where they were safe for a while. Others lay down among the victims and pretended to be dead. But if they stood up again they [the Spaniards] would see them and kill them.''

:''The blood of the warriors ran like water as they ran, forming pools, which widened, as the smell of blood and entrails fouled the air.''

:''And the Spaniards walked everywhere, searching the communal houses to kill those who were hiding. They ran everywhere, they searched every place.''

:''When [people] outside [the Sacred Patio learned of the massacre], shouting began, "Captains, Mexicas, come here quickly! Come here with all arms, spears, and shields! Our captains have been murdered! Our warriors have been slain! Oh Mexica captains, [our warriors] have been annihilated!"''

:''Then a roar was heard, screams, people wailed, as they beat their palms against their lips. Quickly the captains assembled, as if planned in advance, and carried their spears and shields. Then the battle began. [The Mexicas] attacked them with arrows and even javelins, including small javelins used for hunting birds. They furiously hurled their javelins [at the Spaniards]. It was as if a layer of yellow canes spread over the Spaniards. '' -- [[The Broken Spears|Visión de los Vencidos]]

==The Spaniards' account of the incident==

Spanish Historian Francisco [[López de Gómara]]'s, who was never in the Americas, account:

:''Cortes wanted to entirely understand the cause of the Indians' rebellion. He interrogated them [the Spaniards] altogether. Some said it was caused by the message sent by Narváez, others because the people wanted to toss the Spaniards out of Mexico [Tenochtitlan], which had been planned as soon as the ships had arrived, because while they were fighting they shouted "Get out!" at them. Others said it was to liberate Moctezuma, for they fought saying, "Free our god and King if you don't want to die!" Still others said it was to steal the gold, silver, and jewels that the Spaniards had, because they heard the Indians say, "Here you shall leave the gold that you have taken!" Again, some said it was to keep the Tlaxcalans and other mortal enemies out of Mexico. Finally, many believed that taking their idols as gods, they had given themselves to the devil.''

:''Any of these things would have been enough to cause the rebellion, not to mention all of them together. But the principal one was that a few days after Cortes left to confront Narváez, it became time for a festival the Mexicas wanted to celebrate in their traditional way. . . . They begged Pedro de Alvarado to give them his permission, so [the Spaniards] wouldn't think that they planned to kill them. Alvarado consented provided that there were no sacrifices, no people killed, and no one had weapons. ''

:''More than 600 gentlemen and several lords gathered in the yard of the largest temple; some said there were more than a thousand there. They made a lot of noise with their drums, shells, bugles, and hendidos, which sounded like a loud whistle. Preparing their festival, they were naked, but covered with precious stones, pearls, necklaces, belts, bracelets, many jewels of gold, silver, and mother-of-pearl, wearing very rich feathers on their heads. They performed a dance called the mazeualiztli, which is called that because it is a holiday from work [symbolized by the word for farmer, macehaulli]. . . . They laid mats in the patio of the temple and played drums on them. They danced in circles, holding hands, to the music of the singers, to which they responded. ''

:''The songs were sacred, and not profane, and were sung to praise the god honored in the festival, to induce him to provide water and grain, health, and victory, or to thank him for healthy children and other things. And those who knew the language and these ceremonial rites said that when the people danced in the temples, they perform very different from those who danced the netoteliztli, in voice, movement of the body, head, arms, and feet, by which they manifested their concepts of good and evil. The Spaniards called this dance, an areito, a word they brought from the islands of Cuba and Santo Domingo.  ''

:''While the Mexica gentlemen were dancing in the temple yard of Vitcilopuchtli [Huitzilopochtli], Pedro de Alvarado went there. Whether on [the basis of] his own opinion or in an agreement decided by everyone, I don't know, but some say he had been warned that the Indian nobles of the city had assembled to plot the mutiny and the rebellion, which they later carried out; others, believe that [the Spaniards] went to watch them perform this famous and praised dance, and seeing how rich they were and wanting the gold the Indians were wearing, he [Alvarado] covered each of the entrances with ten or twelve Spaniards and went inside with more than fifty [Spaniards], and without remorse and lacking any Christian piety, they brutally stabbed and killed the Indians, and took what they were wearing.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López de Gómara|first1=Francisco|title=Conquista de Méjico|date=1887|publisher=Biblioteca Clásica Española|location=Barcelona|url=http://faculty.fullerton.edu/nfitch/nehaha/gomara.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">'''Mohamed Harbi''' (born 1933) is an [[Algeria]]n historian who was a member of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].

Mohamed Harbi was born in 1933 into a wealthy family in [[El Harrouch]], Algeria. At the age of 15, he joined the FLN. According to his later memoirs, Harbi lived underground in France and gathered support for the Algerian independence. 1954-1962 he was in a prominent position in the FLN.

After the Algerian War of Independence, he became an advisor to new president, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] and later a member of his cabinet. According to his memoirs, Harbi tried to resist the increasingly authoritarian approach of the new government and urged Ben Bella to arm the people to avert a [[military coup]].

In June 1965 [[Houari Boumedienne]] seized power and arrested Ben Bella. Two months later Harbi was also imprisoned. For the next six years he was transferred between prisons until he was placed in [[house arrest]] in 1971. In 1973 he escaped to [[Tunisia]] with a false Turkish passport and from there moved to Paris.

In France, Harbi began to teach political science in the [[University of Paris]]. 

During his house arrest, Harbi had begun to write the history of the independence movement and in 1975 published a book ''The history of FLN''. His inside view of the movement was not the one FLN cherished and he began to receive death threats from three sides; Algerian secret police, Algerian Islamic militants and French ultra nationalists.

Currently Harbi lives in Paris, retired from the university. The first part of his memoirs was published in 2003.

'''Nataliia Polonska-Vasylenko''' ({{lang-uk|Наталія Полонська-Василенко}}; 12 February 1884 in [[Kharkiv]] – 8 June 1973 in [[Dornstadt]], near [[Ulm]], [[West Germany]]) was one of the foremost [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian historians]] of the 20th century. She was a wife of the Ukrainian academician of history and statesman [[Mykola Vasylenko]].

==Life and career==
Polonska-Vasylenko studied history under [[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapol'skiy]] at [[Kiev University]] and from 1912 was a member of the [[Kiev]]-based Historical Society of [[Nestor the Chronicler]]. From 1916, she was a lecturer at Kiev University and Director of its archeological museum. During the 1920s, the most liberal years of Soviet rule, she was a professor at the Kiev Institutes of Geography, Archeology, and Art, and a Research Associate at the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (VUAN). She witnessed, but survived the [[Joseph Stalin]] purges of the 1930s and was a member of the reorganized and Sovietized academy from 1937 to 1941. In 1940, she received her doctorate and became a professor at Kiev University. During the German occupation, she directed the Kiev Central Archive of Old Documents and worked in Kiev City Administration, was responsible for renaming of streets and consulted [[Kiev Archive Museum of Transitional Period]] (dedicated to achievements of German occupation and crimes of Communists). As the tide of the war turned against the Germans, she fled west, first to [[Lviv]], then to [[Prague]], and finally to [[Bavaria]]. She was a Professor at the [[Ukrainian Free University]] in Prague (1944–45), and moved together with this institution to Munich where she continued to teach until her death in 1973. In the 1960s, she took an active part in the establishment of the American-Based [[Ukrainian Historical Association]] and was its Vice-president from 1965.

==Writings==
Polonska-Vasylenko was a specialist in Ukrainian archeology, the history of [[Kievan Rus']], the later history of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], and the history of her own times. She also wrote extensively on modern Ukrainian historiography.

Before the [[First World War]], she participated in the compilation and writing of a large Russian cultural history atlas which was published in three volumes between 1913 and 1914. During the 1920s, she published extensively in the various periodicals of the Ukrainian Academy on the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the transformation and absorption of southern Ukraine into the Russian Empire during the reigns of Catherine the Great and her predecessors.

During the Cold War, deprived of the use of the archives of her native land, Polonska-Vasylenko collected and reprinted many of her earlier studies on [[Zaporozhia]] (1965–67), wrote several memoirs of intellectual life in revolutionary and Soviet [[Ukraine]] including a history of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (2 vols. 1955-58), published a book on the Stalin repressions of Ukrainian historians (1962), and turned increacingly toward synthesis, at the end of her career, publishing a volume on Ukrainian historiography (1971) and a two volume general history of Ukraine (1973–1976).

In her general approach to Ukrainian history, Polonska-Vasylenko followed the lead of her distinguished emigre predecessor, [[Dmytro Doroshenko]], and wrote in a conservative vain, stressing the importance of the [[Cossack]] officer class and the Ukrainian gentry into which they were later transformed. She saw the strivings of this class for national unity and independence, or, at least autonomy, as one of the main currents of Ukrainian history, and she characterized the nineteenth century as a time of Russian and Austrian occupation. She ended her general history with the advent of Soviet rule.

==Legacy==
Through her teaching at the Ukrainian Free University and her many publications, Polonska-Vasylenko influenced several younger Ukrainian historians in the west, especially the founder of the [[Ukrainian Historical Association]], Lubomyr Wynar. After the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in 1991 and the subsequent growth of intellectual freedom, her major works, including her history of the Ukrainian Academy and her general history of Ukraine were reprinted in her homeland where she finally became widely known.

'''Nüwa''' or '''Nügua''' is the [[mother goddess]] of [[Chinese mythology]], the sister and wife of [[Fuxi]], the emperor-god. She is credited with creating mankind and repairing the Pillar of [[Tian|Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100241815 |title= Nügua |work=Oxford Reference |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reverential name is '''Wahuang''' ({{zh|t=媧皇|l=Empress Wa}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdic.net/c/2/77/122254.htm |title=媧皇 |publisher=Handian |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ''[[Huainanzi]]'' relates Nüwa to the time when Heaven and Earth were in disruption: {{cquote|Going back to more ancient times, the four pillars were broken; the [[Nine Provinces of China|nine provinces]] were in tatters. [[Tian|Heaven]] did not completely cover [the earth]; Earth did not hold up [[Tian|[Heaven]]] all the way around [its circumference]. Fires blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; water flooded in great expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blameless people; predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, Nüwa smelted together five-colored stones in order to patch up the [[qing (color)|azure]] sky, cut off the legs of [[ao (turtle)|the great turtle]] to set them up as the four pillars, killed the black dragon to provide relief for [[Ji Province]], and piled up reeds and cinders to stop the surging waters. The [[qing (color)|azure]] sky was patched; the four pillars were set up; the surging waters were drained; the [[Nine Provinces of China|province]] of [[Ji Province|Ji]] was tranquil; crafty vermin died off; blameless people [preserved their] lives.{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|loc=ch. 6}}{{efn|A different translation of the same text is also given in Lewis.{{sfnp|Lewis|2006|p=111}}}}}}

The catastrophes were supposedly caused by the battle between the deities [[Gonggong]] and [[Zhuanxu]] (an event that was mentioned earlier in the ''Huainanzi''),{{refn|group=lower-alpha|"In ancient times [[Gonggong|Gong Gong]]&lt;!--sic--&gt; and [[Zhuanxu|Zhuan Xu]]&lt;!--sic--&gt; fought, each seeking to become the [[thearch]]. Enraged, they crashed against Mount Buzhou; [[Tian|Heaven]]'s pillars broke; the cords of Earth snapped. [[Tian|Heaven]] tilted in the northwest, and thus the sun and moon, stars and planets shifted in that direction. Earth became unfull in the southeast, and thus the watery floods and mounding soils subsided in that direction."{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|loc=ch. 3}}}} the five-colored stones symbolize the [[Wu Xing|five Chinese elements]] (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), the black dragon was the essence of water and thus cause of the floods, [[Ji Province]] serves metonymically for the [[Zhongyuan|central regions]] (the Sinitic world).{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|loc=ch. 6 n}} Following this, the ''Huainanzi'' tells about how the sage-rulers Nüwa and [[Fuxi]] set order over the realm by following [[Tao|the Way]] (道) and [[De (Chinese)|its potency]] (德).{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|loc=ch. 6}}

The ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'', dated between the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han Dynasty]], describes Nüwa's intestines as being scattered into ten spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[Shan Hai Jing]] |script-title=zh:''山海經'' |chapter=16《大荒西經》 |language=Chinese |chapter-url=http://ctext.org/shan-hai-jing/da-huang-xi-jing |orig-year=1st pub. 4th Century BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=October 2014}}

In ''[[Liezi]]'' (c. 475 – 221 BC), Chapter 5 "Questions of Tang" ({{zh|t=卷第五 湯問篇}}), author [[Lie Yukou]] describes Nüwa repairing the original imperfect heaven using five-colored [[stones]], and cutting the legs off a [[ao (turtle)|tortoise]] to use as struts to hold up the sky.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In ''[[Chuci|Songs of Chu]]'' (c. 340 – 278 BC), Chapter 3 "[[Heavenly Questions|Asking Heaven]]" ({{zh|s=问天}}), author [[Qu Yuan]] writes that Nüwa molded figures from the yellow earth, giving them life and the ability to bear children. After demons fought and broke the pillars of the heavens, Nüwa worked unceasingly to repair the damage, melting down the five-coloured stones to mend the heavens.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (c. 58 – 147 AD), China's earliest dictionary, under the entry for Nüwa author [[Xu Shen]] describes her as being both the sister and the wife of [[Fuxi]]. Nüwa and Fuxi were pictured as having snake-like tails interlocked in an [[Han Dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han Dynasty]] mural in the Wuliang Temple in Jiaxiang county, Shandong province.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In ''[[Duyi Zhi]]'' ({{zh|t=獨異志}}; c. 846 – 874 AD), Volume 3, author [[Li Rong (philosopher)|Li Rong]] gives this description.
{{cquote|Long ago, when the world first began, there were two people, Nü Kua and her older brother. They lived on [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount K'un-lun]]. And there were not yet any ordinary people in the world. They talked about becoming husband and wife, but they felt ashamed. So the brother at once went with his sister up [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount K'un-lun]] and made this prayer: "Oh Heaven, if Thou wouldst send us two forth as man and wife, then make all the misty vapor gather. If not, then make all the misty vapor disperse." At this, the misty vapor immediately gathered. When the sister became intimate with her brother, they plaited some grass to make a fan to screen their faces. Even today, when a man takes a wife, they hold a fan, which is a symbol of what happened long ago.&lt;ref&gt;Translation in Birrell 1993, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Yuchuan Ziji]]'' ({{zh|s=玉川子集}} c. 618 – 907 AD), Chapter 3 ({{zh|s="與馬異結交詩" 也稱 "女媧本是伏羲婦"}}), author [[Lu Tong]] describes Nüwa as the wife of Fuxi.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', [[Sima Zhen]] (679–732) provides commentary on the prologue chapter to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', "Supplemental to the Historic Record: History of the Three August Ones," wherein it is found that the [[Three August Ones and Five Emperors|Three August Ones]] are Nüwa, Fuxi, and [[Shennong]]; Fuxi and Nüwa have the same last name,  Feng ({{zh|t=風}}; Hmong: Faj).{{efn|Sima Zhen's commentary is included with the later ''Siku Quanshu'' compiled by [[Ji Yun]] and [[Lu Xixiong]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}}

In the collection ''[[Songsi Dashu|Four Great Books of Song]]'' (c. 960 – 1279 AD), compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] and others, Volume 78 of the book ''[[Taiping Yulan|Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' contains a chapter "Customs by Yingshao of the Han Dynasty" in which it is stated that there were no men when the sky and the earth were separated. Thus Nüwa used yellow clay to make people. But the clay was not strong enough so she put ropes into the [[clay]] to make the bodies erect. It is also said that she prayed to gods to let her be the goddess of marital affairs. Variations of this story exist.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Appearance in ''Fengshen Yanyi''==
[[File:Ping Sien Si - 065 Nu Wa Niang Niang (16140351273).jpg|thumb|Relief of Nuwa at the Ping Sien Si Temple in Perak, Malaysia]]

Nüwa is featured within the famed [[Ming dynasty]] novel ''[[Fengshen Bang]]''. As featured within this novel, Nüwa is very highly respected since the time of the [[Xia Dynasty]] for being the daughter of the [[Jade Emperor]]; Nüwa is also regularly called the "Snake Goddess". After the [[Shang Dynasty]] had been created, Nüwa created the five-colored stones to protect the dynasty with occasional seasonal rains and other enhancing qualities. Thus in time, [[Shang Rong]] asked [[King Zhou of Shang]] to pay her a visit as a sign of deep respect. After Zhou was completely overcome with lust at the very sight of the beautiful ancient goddess Nüwa (who had been sitting behind a light curtain), he would write a small poem on a neighboring wall and take his leave. When Nüwa later returned to her temple after visiting the [[Yellow Emperor]], Nüwa would see the foulness of Zhou's words. In her anger, she swore that the Shang Dynasty would end in payment for his foulness. In her rage, Nüwa would personally ascend to the palace in an attempt to kill the king, but was suddenly struck back by two large beams of red light.

After Nüwa realized that King Zhou was already destined to rule the kingdom for twenty-six more years, Nüwa would summon her three subordinates—the Thousand-Year Vixen (later becoming [[Daji]]), the [[Pipa Jing|Jade Pipa]], and the [[Jiutou Zhiji Jing|Nine-Headed Pheasant]]. With these words, Nüwa would bring destined chaos to the Shang Dynasty, "The luck [[Cheng Tang]] won six hundred years ago is dimming. I speak to you of a new [[mandate of heaven]] which sets the destiny for all. You three are to enter King Zhou's palace, where you are to bewitch him. Whatever you do, do not harm anyone else. If you do my bidding, and do it well, you will be permitted to reincarnate as human beings." Thus, with these words, Nüwa would never be heard of again, but would still be a major indirect factor towards the Shang Dynasty's fall.

'''Offenbach am Main''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔfn̩bax ʔam ˈmaɪn|-|De-Offenbach_(Main).ogg}}) is a city in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], located on the left bank of the river [[Main (river)|Main]] and part of the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Regional Authority|Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area]]. Offenbach has a population of 126,934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Einwohner der Stadt Offenbach am Main nach Statistischen Bezirken am 31.12.2013|url=http://www.offenbach.de/stepone/data/pdf/90/25/00/einwohner-stat-bez.m-w-2013.pdf|publisher=Melderegister Offenbach|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175805/http://www.offenbach.de/stepone/data/pdf/90/25/00/einwohner-stat-bez.m-w-2013.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century the city's economy was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries, and it was also a major centre of the typography and design industries. Other important industries are the automobile and pharmaceutical industries. During the [[Second World War]] the city suffered heavily from bombing by the Allied Forces. More than half of the city's population have a non-German background, with [[Turkish people|Turks]], former [[Yugoslavs]], [[Arabs]], [[Italians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Poles]] as major groups.

==Geography==

===Subdivisions===
The inner town of Offenbach is quite large and has only a few suburbs. In the east the three incorporated: [[Offenbach-Bürgel|Bürgel]] (incorporated 1908), [[Offenbach-Bieber|Bieber]] (incorporated April 1, 1938), and [[Offenbach-Rumpenheim|Rumpenheim]] (incorporated April 4, 1942). In the south are the newer suburbs [[Offenbach-Lauterborn|Lauterborn]] and [[Offenbach-Rosenhöhe|Rosenhöhe]], [[Tempelsee]], the office town [[Offenbach-Kaiserlei|Kaiserlei]] and the industrial area [[Offenbach-Waldheim|Waldheim]]. The newest suburb is [[Offenbach-Mathildenviertel|Mathildenviertel]] in the center near to the Main river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antrag Magistratsvorlage Nr. 144/10|url=http://pio.offenbach.de/index.php?docid=2010-0015188&amp;dsnummer=DS%20I%20(A)%20588|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Offenbach (Merian).jpg|thumb|left|Offenbach in 1655]]
[[File:Frankfurterstr-of.jpg|thumb|left|The main street ''Frankfurter Straße'' around 1900]]
The first documented reference to a suburb of Offenbach appears in 770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Braun|first=Lothar|title=Offenbach und seine Vororte|url=http://offenbach.de/offenbach/themen/unterwegs-in-offenbach/stadtinfo/stadtteile/article/Vororte.html?pdfurl=http://offenbach.de/offenbach/themen/unterwegs-in-offenbach/stadtinfo/stadtteile/article/Vororte.html|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=4 February 2014|date=12 February 2004}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a document of the Holy Roman [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] dating to 977 exists the first mention of the place of Offenbach.&lt;ref name=factsfigures&gt;{{cite web|title=Offenbach - Facts and Figures|url=http://www.offenbach.de/stepone/data/pdf/67/22/00/of-in-zahlen-2012_final_engl.pdf|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=4 February 2014|page=2|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822010347/http://www.offenbach.de/stepone/data/pdf/67/22/00/of-in-zahlen-2012_final_engl.pdf|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Middle Ages Offenbach passed through many hands. Only in 1486 could the Count Ludwig of [[County of Isenburg|Isenburg]] finally take control of city for his family, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß (Isenburg Palace), which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.

In 1635 Offenbach given to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt]] but it was returned to the Isenburg-Birstein Count (later Prince) in 1642 and remained in that Principality until 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. A year later it was given to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt]].

Always very close to the city centre of Frankfurt, Offenbach was a popular location for business. The town has its own trade fair, and many companies have opened facilities here because there are fewer restrictions and no closed businesses. French Protestants ([[Huguenot]]s) came in the 17th century and settled in Offenbach and contributed to making Offenbach a prosperous city, e.g., bringing knowledge of tobacco with them and turning Offenbach into a centre for rolling cigars. The town was more cosmopolitan than Frankfurt; famous people such as [[Goethe]] and [[Mozart]] visited it several times.

The Rumpenheim Palace and its park were a popular destination for monarchs in the 19th century. The city was thereafter ruled by [[Rulers of Hesse|Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine]] until the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Offenbach became the center of the traditional design with figures such as the architect [[Hugo Eberhardt]], the typographer [[Rudolf Koch]], the bookbinder and designer Ignatz Wiemeler and [[Ernst Engel]] and the painter [[Karl Friedrich Lippmann]].

During the [[Second World War]] a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing, which claimed 467 lives. With the new district [[Offenbach-Lauterborn|Lauterborn]] the city was expanded to the south in the 1960s. On the border with Frankfurt, the office district Kaiserlei was built.
Offenbach is a so-called ´Sozialer Brennpunkt`(= multiple social problems area) because of unemployment, poverty, gang related crime and migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnp.de/rhein-main/Gangster-Ghetto-Offenbach-was-ist-dran;art801,1166004|title=Nach dem Tod von Tugce A.:|first=Frankfurter Neue|last=Presse|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 17th century, Offenbach remained a small town with less than a thousand habitants. With the coming into power of the count [[Johann Philipp]] in 1685, the city began to develop and the population rose steadily. In the 19th century the city became industrialized and the population increased even tenfold.&lt;ref name=grossstadtmain&gt;{{cite web|title=Offenbach - die kleine Großstadt am Main|url=http://www.offenbach.de/offenbach/themen/unterwegs-in-offenbach/stadtinfo/article/ofportrait.html|publisher=City of Offenbach|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219072938/http://www.offenbach.de/offenbach/themen/unterwegs-in-offenbach/stadtinfo/article/ofportrait.html|archivedate=2014-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the concept of protasis in linguistics, see [[Conditional sentence]].''
In [[drama]], a '''protasis''' is the introductory part of a play, usually its first act. The term was coined by the fourth-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]]. He defined a play as being made up of three separate parts, the other two being [[epitasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. In modern [[dramatic theory]] the term [[Dramatic_structure|dramatic arc]] has substantially the same meaning&lt;ref&gt;https://makingmusic.ableton.com/dramatic-arc&lt;/ref&gt;, though with slightly different divisions.

==Life==

When he was 17 years of age, he enrolled in the [[University of Havana]], where he majored in 1882 in Civil Law.

Two years later, his first literary reviews were published. He contributed extensively to the periodicals ''La lotería'', to ''Revista de Cuba'', and ''Cuba en América''.&lt;ref name=baquero/&gt;

In July 7, 1900, he was appointed Subsecretary of Justice, filling in the position for Alfredo Zayas y Alfonso.&lt;ref name=biblioteca/&gt;&lt;ref name=civil&gt;Wood, Leonard. ''Civil report, 1899-1900, volume 2.'' (1900). s. n.

The '''representation of women in Athenian tragedy''' was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[The arts|art-forms]] constitutes a [[paradox]]. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female [[Character (arts)|characters]]: [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]''. Female [[Greek chorus|tragic choruses]] also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.&lt;ref name="Easterling"&gt;Easterling, P. E. (Ed.). (1997). ''Cambridge companion to Greek tragedy.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural stereotype== 
Macaria, in the ''[[Heracleidae]]'' states that "for a woman, silence and self control are best."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; The philosopher [[Xenophon]] thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion.&lt;ref name="Bushnell"&gt;Bushnell, R. W. (Ed.). (2005). ''A companion to tragedy.'' Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D14&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into "the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; [[Sheila Murnaghan]] argues that "it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father.&lt;ref name="Blondell"&gt;Blondell, R., et al. (Ed.). (1999). ''Women on the edge: four plays by Euripides.'' New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; 
The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist [[Alcestis]], represents the "perfect wife" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet as Blondell points out this "female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic" as her own marriage kills her.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

The most important relationships within this play are between the men. [[Heracles]] goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. [[Admetos]] goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. "Alcestis drops out," Easterling argues, "to facilitate the interaction between the men."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt;

In contrast, however, Euripides [[Medea]] breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. "In a sense," Blondell argues, "every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband."&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

==Theatrical themes==

===The problem of male absence===
In the surviving plays, women become [[Tragedy|tragic]] figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

[[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]] takes action after her uncle [[Creon]] refuses to bury her brother [[Polynices]]. In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] takes power in [[Argos]] because her husband [[Agamemnon]] has been away fighting at [[Troy]] for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband [[Jason]] plans a new more advantageous marriage.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The public versus the private===
There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was [[Setting (narrative)|set]] outside the private sphere of the home.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; Indeed, [[Euripides]] was notorious for "taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy" and thereby reducing its remoteness.&lt;ref name="McLeish"&gt;McLeish, K., et al. (Trans.). (2005). ''Greek tragedy.'' London: Nick Hern.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son [[Orestes]] forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. "This three play sequence," Bushnell argues, "which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The female warrior===
A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. [[Euripides]]' [[Medea]] is the prime example. Her name in Greek means "cunning" and is also the word for the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

Most of the time, a woman is full of fear&lt;br&gt;
Too weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel &lt;br&gt;
But if she happens to be wronged in love,&lt;br&gt;
Hers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as [[Patroclus]] famously does to [[Homer]]’s [[Achilles]] in the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet Medea, similarly to [[Aeschylus]]’ [[Clytemnestra]], another "woman with a heart of manly counsel"&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; were not admired  but portrayed as "[[Cruella de Vil]]" type characters.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

So the declaration "that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour" does not apply to women.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

==Public reaction==
In [[Plato]]’s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], [[Socrates]] thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried "about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt; Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal [[Polis|city-state]].&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

The [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] however thought it important to place on "display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice."&lt;ref name="Bushnell"/&gt;

'''Muhammad Saeed Khawar'''&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; (born 14 August 1966)&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://pu.edu.pk/images/cv/1349847518C.V.%20Dr.%20Saeed%20%20Khawar%20Bhutta.pdf Dr. Saeed Khawar Bhutta] CV - University of Punjab. Retrieved 10 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his pen name, '''Saeed Bhutta''',&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; is a prominent [[Oral history|oral historian]] of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]]. He currently serving as Professor of [[Punjabi language]] and [[Punjabi literature|literature]] at [[Oriental College]], [[University of the Punjab]], [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. He has published numerous books of folktales, folklore, and folksongs. His research papers have been published in scholarly journals.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental College Magazine, 320, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
He received his M.A. from University of the Punjab, Lahore. Before Joining University of the Punjab as lecturer in 1994, he served as a research scholar at Pakistan Punjabi Adbi Board, Lahore. At the Board, he benefitted from the supervision of Muhammad Asif Khan, a renowned linguist, researcher and critic of Punjabi literature.

==Biography and books==
Born on 14 of August, 1966 in Pipple Bhutta, a small village in Chiniot, Jhang district, Punjab&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merajhang.com/jhangvian/saeed.html&lt;/ref&gt; to Mian Muhammad Bukhsh.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; He received his Ph.D from the [[University of the Punjab]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pu.edu.pk/images/cv/1349847518C.V.%20Dr.%20Saeed%20%20Khawar%20Bhutta.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests included pre-colonial Punjab, oral history, culture and language of the Punjab. His primary contribution was in the field of folk literature. Many volumes of  folktales collected, compiled, and edited by him were published during the last two decades.  Literary critics positively reviewed his collections of folk stories entitled Kamal Kahani, Nabar Kahani, Bar Kahani and Raj Kahani. His early works included edited volumes of critical essays Sanjh Wichar and Sanjh Surat.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/SanjhWichar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
in March 2010, Saeed Bhutta was selected as Professor of Punjabi at Oriental College University of the Punjab Lahore.Bhutta lately focused his research work on legends and epics of Punjab and published the first volume of his work in this series entitled ‘Des Diyan Vaaran’. Earlier, he had  edited a book of folksongs which were collected during his field research from Chiniot district. He has also written short fiction and has published a collection of short stories.

His important contribution had been in the field of folk literature. His research highlighted the resistance of residents of Punjab against European, Central Asian and Middle Eastern invaders. Contrary to the so-called scholarship of the western Punjab, he brought to light the secular culture of the Punjab and its distinctive features like resistance, hospitality and social justice.

Unlike the imagined picture of the Punjab portrayed in the  Persian and English writings, the folk tales collected as a result of his field work depicted a different character and culture of Punjab. In the folktales collected by him, one finds the sensation of sharing a  sophisticated culture and a higher level of commitment to the cause of social justice  displayed by characters.

Most of writings on pre-colonial Punjab were in Persian and published from Delhi, Lahore, and Multan. In those writings,  references to Bars of Punjab (areas between rivers of Punjab) and Punjabi folk literature were conspicuous by their absence.   Because of a particular tradition of history writing promoted by foreign rulers, it became important to  have a closer look at Punjab’s culture, identity, and value system in the light of  primary sources like folktales, folklore and oral history.

Bhutta has opened a new door for sociologists and historians of Punjab by introducing them to a new wealth of authentic material on social structure and value system of  pre-colonial Punjab. His research findings have made it possible for us to break into the Punjab of medieval ages from natives’ point of view. His research work on folk literature of Punjab has added an altogether new dimension to the anthropological, sociological, historical and cultural studies of pre-colonial Punjab.
He is devoted to his culture and this motivates him to work on the classical poetry, Folklore, Varan and the oral literature of Jhang. He has introduced many prominent personalities of Jhang and has highlighted their achievements. His works are regularly published in Pakistan and abroad. He is the son of the soil in true sense.

In Punjab, and among the circles of Punjabi academia, these folk tales have been reviewed as a major contribution to the cultural studies of Punjab. The fascinating language of  these  folk tales had a positive  impact on contemporary Punjabi fiction and poetry. Many contemporary creative minds found it natural to express themselves in the diction and the idiom that had roots in the collective memory of the land and was preserved by Saeed Bhutta in such a professional manner.
He has supervised 11 Doctorate theses, and almost 50 theses of Master of Punjabi are written under his supervision. His more than 40 research articles are published in renowned local and international Journals of Punjabi language and literature and 20 in the HEC's(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan)approved research Journals. He is also included in the list of approved PhD supervisors of HEC Islamabad, Pakistan.

'''Stan Gooch''' (born 1932 in [[Lewisham]], London, died 13 September 2010)&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8110857/Stan-Gooch.html|title=Stan Gooch|work=The Telegraph|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[psychologist]] and author who is probably best known as the proponent of a "[[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|hybrid-origin theory]]" of human evolution.

==Publications==

===Total Man===
Gooch's first book ''Total Man'' (1972) was an attempt to examine all fields of interest relevant to humans today. On the back cover of the American print of ''Total Man'' Stan Gooch states:
:"Essentially, the view I have taken of other 'theories of personality', such as those of [[Marx]], Christianity, [[Freud]], [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]], [[Nietzsche]] and many others, is not that all, or all but one, are wrong, but on the contrary that all are correct. I was, and am still, unable to escape the implications of the fact that each of the theorists in question was, after all, concerned with one and the same human being. Instead of rejecting all such views, I found myself essentially rejecting none. This shift of emphasis is, I believe, crucial. The task is changed from one of selection to one of assembly."

===Theory of polarities===
In various chapters of ''Total Man'' Gooch outlined what would become the basis of his theories when he showed that phenomena can be divided into two columns, which he titled System A and System B, later associated with [[Cro-Magnon]] and [[Neanderthal]] lineage, respectively. These could be roughly equated to Freud's [[Ego and Id]], and in some ways [[Carl Jung]]'s Male and Female principles.

===Hybrid-origin theory===
''Total Man'' was followed by  ''Personality and Evolution'' (1973) and ''The Neanderthal Question'' (1977).
In these books, Gooch develops what would become known as the "hybrid-origin theory". The theory as represented in
'' Guardians of the Ancient Wisdom'' (1979) can be outlined as follows:
# From other human species, [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon man]] evolves in Northern India during a long period of isolation, develops and practices [[sun worship]] and [[hunting magic]]; the culture is [[patriarchal]].
# Elsewhere during the same period, different forms of [[Neanderthal man]] evolve in Europe and the Middle East, while [[moon worship]] and [[earth magic]] is developed and practiced; the culture is [[matriarchal]].
# Around 35,000 years ago, Cro-Magnon abandons India and heads west through the Middle East into Europe, overrunning Neanderthal. By 25,000 years ago, the predominant type in Europe is Cro-Magnon.
# In the Middle East a hybrid population, a cross between the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal types, emerges. Pure Neanderthal has largely ceased to exist either here or in Europe.
# By 15,000 years ago, pure Cro-Magnon man has also ceased to exist, driven out of north and west Europe, into southern Europe, by renewed glaciation, absorbed by the hybrid type (that is, modern ''Homo sapiens'').

Gooch continued to develop the theory during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s in ''Cities of Dreams'' (1989, 1995),
and ''The Neanderthal Legacy'' (2008).

===The Paranormal===
In ''The Paranormal'' (1978), Gooch reveals that prior to obtaining a degree in psychology, in his mid-twenties, he had been trained as a [[mediumship|medium]]. The book in a first part deals with his own [[paranormal]] experiences and those of his acquaintances and in a second part presents a theoretical examination of the paranormal.

===The Double Helix of the Mind===
In ''The Double Helix of the Mind'' (1980), Gooch criticizes the hemisphere model of the [[human brain]].
Gooch develops the theory that the [[cerebellum]], rather than the right hemisphere of the brain, is responsible for dreaming, creativity and paranormal experience.

==Reception==
Gooch's theories have generally been dismissed by academia. In his book ''Right Hand, Left Hand: The Origins of Asymmetry in Brains, Bodies, Atoms and Cultures'', Chris McManus, a psychologist at [[University College London]], has described Stan Gooch's ideas about the origins of [[left-handedness]] as "myths", stating that they lack any supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chris McManus |title=Right Hand, Left Hand: The Origins of Asymmetry in Brains, Bodies, Atoms and Cultures |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=295 |isbn=0-674-01613-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinker and novelist [[Colin Wilson]], on the other hand, argues that Gooch's work forms "one of the most impressive and exciting intellectual structures of the second half of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aulis.com/twothirds_colin_wilson.htm Colin Wilson.

'''Sylvanus Griswold Morley''' (June 7, 1883{{spaced ndash}}September 2, 1948) was an American  [[archaeology|archaeologist]], [[epigraphy|epigrapher]], and [[Mayanist]] scholar who made significant contributions toward the study of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] in the early 20th century.

Morley made extensive excavations of the Maya site of [[Chichen Itza]] that he directed on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution]]. He also published several large compilations and treatises on [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic writing]], and wrote popular accounts on the Maya for a general audience.

To his contemporaries, "Vay" Morley&lt;ref&gt;The nickname by which he was popularly called, as Eric Thompson puts it, "from the Cosmos Club, Washington, to the American Club, Guatemala City". See Thompson (1949, p.293).&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the leading [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeologists of his day. Although more recent developments in the field have resulted in a re-evaluation of his theories and works, his publications, particularly on [[Maya calendar|calendric]] inscriptions, are still cited. In his role as director of various projects sponsored by the Carnegie Institution, he oversaw and encouraged many others who later established notable careers in their own right. His commitment and enthusiasm for Maya studies helped inspire the necessary sponsorship for projects that would ultimately reveal much about ancient Maya civilization.

Morley also conducted [[espionage]] in Mexico on behalf of the United States during World War I, but the scope of those activities only came to light well after his death. His archaeological field work in Mexico and Central America provided suitable [[cover (intelligence)|cover]] for investigating German activities and anti-American activity at the behest of the United States' [[Office of Naval Intelligence]].

==Early life, education and first expeditions==
Morley was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], the eldest of six children.&lt;ref&gt;Roys and Harrison (1949, p.215), Thompson (1949, p.293). Some sources erroneously note his birthplace as Massachusetts, in apparent confusion with that of his cousin, also named Sylvanus Griswold Morley.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Colonel Benjamin F. Morley, was at the time vice-president and professor of chemistry, mathematics and tactics at [[Pennsylvania Military College]] (PMC).&lt;ref&gt;Roys and Harrison (1949, p.215), Thompson (1949, p.293). The PMC would later become [[Widener University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Sarah also had a connection with the college, where her father Felix de Lannoy had been a professor of Modern Languages.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson (1949, p.293)&lt;/ref&gt; Felix (Sylvanus' maternal grandfather) was an immigrant to the United States from newly independent [[Belgium]], where his father had been a judge in the [[Belgian Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Roys and Harrison (1949, p.215)&lt;/ref&gt;

His family moved to [[Colorado]] when Sylvanus was ten years old, and his secondary education was completed at [[Buena Vista, Colorado|Buena Vista]] and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; It was during his later schooling in Colorado that Morley first developed an interest in archaeology, and in particular [[Egyptology]].&lt;ref name="Coe"&gt;Coe (1992, p.126), Thompson (1949, p.294)&lt;/ref&gt; However his father—a man trained in the hard sciences and who had graduated at the top of his class in civil engineering at PMC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1926 |title=A Distinguished Family |url=http://www3.widener.edu/SiteData/docs/1926_Vol_9_No_2_Feb/1e86492fc6872ed493b093da59f728bb/1926_Vol_9_No_2_Feb.pdf |format=PDF online facsimile |journal=The P.M.C. News |volume=9 |issue=2 |location=Chester, PA |publisher=Pennsylvania Military College |pages=1, 4 |oclc=36641738 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910034046/http://www3.widener.edu/SiteData/docs/1926_Vol_9_No_2_Feb/1e86492fc6872ed493b093da59f728bb/1926_Vol_9_No_2_Feb.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—was initially unsupportive of his ambitions. Seeing little scope for employment opportunities in archaeology, the Colonel encouraged his son to study engineering instead. Sylvanus duly enrolled in a [[civil engineering]] degree at PMC, graduating in 1904.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Nonetheless immediately upon graduating from PMC Sylvanus got his wish, and was able to attend [[Harvard University]] in pursuit of an undergraduate degree in archaeology. The focus of his studies at Harvard shifted from Ancient Egypt to the pre-Columbian Maya, at the encouragement of [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] director [[F. W. Putnam]] and the young [[Alfred Tozzer]], a recently appointed professor at Harvard's Anthropology department.&lt;ref name="Coe" /&gt; Morley's interest in the Maya may have stirred even earlier than this, according to his student contemporary at Harvard and later colleague [[Alfred V. Kidder]]. The 1895 novel ''Heart of the World'' by [[H. Rider Haggard]], based on tales of the "lost cities" of Central America, was a particular favorite of the young Morley.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder (1950, p.94).&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley graduated with an [[A.B.]] in American Research from Harvard in 1907.&lt;ref name="Coe" /&gt; His first field trip to [[Mexico]] and [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] was in January of the same year, when he visited and explored several Maya sites, including [[Acanceh]], [[Xtocche]], [[Labna]], [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], [[Uxmal]], [[Zayil]], [[Kiuic]], and [[Mayapan]].&lt;ref name="Thompson_a"&gt;Thompson (1949, p.294)&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several weeks at [[Chichen Itza]] as a guest of Edward Thompson, where he assisted with the dredging of the Cenote Sagrado. On his return trip to the US he carried with him artifacts taken from the cenote, to be deposited at Harvard's Peabody Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse (1971, pp.32,38)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1907, Morley went to work for the [[School of American Archaeology]] (SAA) in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], where for two months he undertook [[fieldwork]] in the [[American Southwest]]. Here he studied the sites and [[architecture]] of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|ancient Pueblo peoples]] (Anasazi). His contemporaries in this work included the noted artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]. Morley made some significant contributions to the definition of a particular "Santa Fe" style of pre-Columbian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchel (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assignment Morley went to work permanently for the SAA, and over the next several years alternated his fieldwork assignments between the Southwest, and Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse (1971, pp.41–47)&lt;/ref&gt; Morley completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree at Harvard, awarded in 1908.&lt;ref name="Thompson_a" /&gt;

==Carnegie Institution and Chichen Itza proposal==
&lt;!-- DELETED PHOTO OF EL CASTILLO, AS THIS WAS ''not'' A CARNEGIE PROJECT. CARNEGIE WORKED ON TEMPLE OF WARRIORS AND CARACOL --&gt;

In 1912, at the urging of executive committee member [[William Barclay Parsons]], the Carnegie Institution announced it would fund a department of anthropology. In December the board announced it was seeking proposals for an appropriate project; three proposals were submitted, including one from Morley to explore and excavate Chichen Itza.

The Institution approved Morley's proposal in December 1913 and one month later hired him to direct the project, but instability in Yucatán (an aftershock of the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and the World War, among other factors, would postpone action on the proposal for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse (1971, pp.64–73).&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation work at Chichen Itza did not begin until the 1923–24 field season.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer (1994, p.388).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Chichen Itza project was on hold, Morley conducted several expeditions in Mexico and Central America on behalf of the Carnegie Institution. He also published his first major work, ''An Introduction to the Study of Maya Hieroglyphs'' (1915).

==Espionage work==
During the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914&amp;ndash;1918), Morley gathered intelligence about and reported on the movements of [[German Empire|German]] operatives in the region, information in which the U.S. Government had a keen interest. According to subsequent investigations,&lt;ref&gt;
See in particular Harris and Sadler (2003, ''passim.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Morley was one of a number of [[Office of Naval Intelligence|ONI]] operatives working in the region under the guise of conducting scholarly research. Their mission was to seek out evidence of pro-German and anti-American agitation in the Mexico-Central America region and to look for secret German [[U-boat|submarine]] bases (which proved non-existent). Morley's archaeological work provided a ready excuse to travel the countryside armed with photographic equipment, and he himself traveled more than 2,000 miles (over 3,200&amp;nbsp;km) along the coastlines of Central America in search of evidence for German bases.&lt;ref&gt;Price (2006, p.118).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several times Morley needed to convince suspicious soldiers of his ''bona fides'', and was almost unmasked on occasion. In one incident in 1917, Morley was prevented from photographing an old Spanish fort by a party of Honduran soldiers who had been distrustfully monitoring his presence. He protested strongly to the local authorities, proclaiming his credentials as an archaeologist ought to be above suspicion. The local authorities remained unmoved, and only when Morley had arranged for a letter of introduction signed by the Honduran president [[Francisco Bertrand]] did they allow him to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Price (2006, p.116).&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley produced extensive analyses (he filed over 10,000 pages of reports)&lt;ref&gt;Price (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; on many issues and observations of the region, including detailed coastline charting and identification of political and social attitudes which could be viewed as "threatening" to U.S. interests. Some of these reports bordered on economic spying, detailing the activities of local competitors and opponents of large U.S. companies present in the region, such as the [[United Fruit Company]] and [[International Harvester]].

As his later work proved, Morley was also a genuine scholar and archaeologist with an abiding interest in the region. However, his research activities in this period seem to have played a largely secondary role to his espionage duties. The authors of research into his spying proclaim Morley "arguably the best secret agent the United States produced during World War I".&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sadler (2003); quote also reproduced in Price (2006, p.116).&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the war several of Morley's contemporaries voiced their misgivings over the duplicitous nature of the espionage work that Morley and several of his colleagues had been suspected of. One notable critic, the famous anthropologist [[Franz Boas]], published a letter of protest in the December 20, 1919 edition of ''[[The Nation]]''. Without naming the suspected archaeologists,&lt;ref&gt;Boas had acquired information which implicated Morley and three other American scholars, [[Herbert Spinden]], H. E. Mechling and [[J. Alden Mason]]; see Patterson (2001, p.53).
&lt;/ref&gt; Boas' letter denounced these Central American operatives who had "prostituted science by using it as a cover for their activities as spies".&lt;ref&gt;Quote reproduced in Patterson (2001, p.53); also Price (2006, p.118).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten days after the letter was published, the [[American Anthropological Association]] censured Boas for this action in a 21-to-10 formal vote on a resolution distancing the AAA from Boas' views.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2001, pp.53–54). Price (2006, p.118) notes the vote was "dominated by the scholars he accused of spying and their cohorts".&lt;/ref&gt; The ethical debate surrounding such "archaeologist-spies" continues into the present, with some commentators noting the dangers and suspicion it throws upon others engaged in legitimate archaeological fieldwork, particularly those who work or seek to work in "sensitive" government-controlled areas.&lt;ref&gt;
See Price (2003); also expanded discussion in Price's chapter "Cloak and Trowel" in ''Archaeological Ethics'' (Price 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fieldwork in Mexico and Central America==
Morley was to devote the most of the next two decades working in the Maya region, overseeing the seasonal archaeological digs and restoration projects, returning to the United States in the off-season to give a series of lectures on his finds. Although primarily involved with the work at Chichen Itza, Morley also took on responsibilities which extended Carnegie-sponsored fieldwork to other Maya sites, such as [[Yaxchilan]], [[Coba]], [[Copán]], [[Quiriguá]], [[Uxmal]], [[Naranjo]], [[Seibal]] and [[Uaxactun]]. Morley rediscovered the last of these sites (located in the [[Petén Basin]] region of [[Guatemala]], to the north of [[Tikal]]). Believing that there must be many more as-yet unknown ancient Maya sites in the area, Morley advertised a "bounty" in return for news of such sites to the local ''[[chicle]]ros'', who ranged through the jungles seeking exploitable sources of [[natural gum]]; in due course he was rewarded with the information which led to its rediscovery. He also bestowed its name, ''uaxactun'', from the [[Mayan languages]], after a [[stela]] inscription he found there which recorded a [[Maya Long Count Calendar]] date in the 8th cycle (i.e., "8-''tuns''"; the name could also literally mean "eight stones").

During this time, Morley established a reputation for trustworthiness with the local Yucatec [[Maya peoples|Maya]] around Mérida, who were still suffering from the depredations of the [[Caste War of Yucatán]] against the Mexican government. Over the years, he was to act almost as their representative in several matters, although he was equally careful not to upset the Mexican and U.S. governments.

His directorship over all of the Institute's activities in the Maya region soon ran into difficulty. Because of cost and schedule overruns as well as criticisms of the quality of some of the research produced, the Carnegie board began to believe that managing multiple projects was not Morley's forte. In 1929, the overall directorship of the programme was passed to [[Alfred V. Kidder|A. V. Kidder]], and Morley was left to concentrate on Chichen Itza.&lt;ref name="Villela"&gt;Villela (2000, p.2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the archaeological investigations which were the main purpose of the Carnegie programme's efforts under Morley, the programme also sponsored the undertaking of comparative field research on modern Yucatec Maya communities. This research, conducted in the 1930s and led by the anthropologist [[Robert Redfield]] as a Carnegie research associate, collected data and examined the cultural contrasts of indigenous Maya experience at four "levels" of community — a traditional indigenous village, a peasant village, a town, and a city — which were analyzed in [[social anthropology|social anthropological]] terms as 'types' representing different degrees of societal isolation and homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;See Wolf and Tam (2004, pp.181–185) for discussion and assessment of Redfield's findings. According to Redfield, the decreasing isolation and homogeneity (moving from tribal to peasant village, to township, to urban center) were causes of increased levels disorganization, secularization and individualization among the Maya. The communities studied by Redfield and his collaborators were Tusik (the 'tribal Indian' village), Chan Kom (the 'peasant' village, largely a settlement of recent colonists), Dzintas (the town) and [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], the capital (and only) city of Yucatán state.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly built and not noted for possessing a strong constitution, Morley saw his health deteriorate over the years spent laboring in the Central American jungles under often adverse conditions. Several times, he was incapacitated by recurring bouts of [[malaria]] and he had to be hospitalised after separately contracting [[colitis]] and then [[amoebic dysentery]] the following year. During the 1930s, it also became evident that he had developed [[congestive heart failure|cardiac difficulties]], which would plague him for the remainder of his life. Nevertheless, although he "detested" the jungle conditions, he persevered in his work with evident enthusiasm.

In between overseeing the projects and conducting his own researches, Morley published several treatises on [[Maya hieroglyphics]] and his interpretations on their meaning. These include a survey of inscriptions at [[Copán]] (1920) and a larger study (a massive tome of over 2,000 pages in five volumes) encompassing many of the sites he had investigated in the [[Petén Basin|Petén]] region (1932–38).

==Excavations at Chichen Itza==

===Context===
[[File:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|A ''[[Chac Mool]]'' statue, first identified by [[Augustus Le Plongeon|le Plongeon]] but later extensively documented by Morley's Chichen Itza excavations. This type of statue (whose purpose remains unclear, presumed to relate to ritual sacrifice) is also characteristic of [[Toltec]] sites, and thus provided a linkage between [[Chichen Itza]] and Central Mexico.]]

[[Chichen Itza]] is about 120[[kilometre|km]] (75&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s) southeast of [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], on the inland plains of north-central [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]. It had been known to Europeans since the first recorded visits by the 16th century ''[[conquistador]]es''. During the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|conquest of Yucatán]], the Spanish attempted to establish a capital at Chichén Itzá, but resistance by Maya in the region drove them out after several months of occupation. When the Spanish returned to Yucatán in 1542 they finally succeeded in establishing a capital at another Maya city, ''T'ho'' (or ''Tiho''), which they renamed Mérida.

Chichen Itza had evidently been functionally abandoned long before the Spanish first came, although the local [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Yucatec [[Maya people|Maya]] still lived in settlements nearby, and even within its former boundaries (but in recently built wooden huts, not the stone buildings themselves). The name "Chichen Itza" is known from the earliest recorded Spanish accounts —such as [[Diego de Landa]]'s— of these local inhabitants, for whom the site had long been a place of pilgrimage and ceremony. The name (''chich'en itza'' in modern Yukatek orthography) means roughly "mouth of the well of the [[Itza]]", the "well" being the nearby [[Sacred Cenote]] (water-filled sinkhole) and "Itza" being the name of the people who were reputed to be its former inhabitants. Over the next three centuries after the Conquest, the site remained relatively undisturbed until the arrival of Stephens and Catherwood, although several plantations were established nearby.

At the time its full extent was not at all clear, but today it is recognised as one of the largest Maya sites in the Yucatán region. How long ago the site had been functionally abandoned (not including the ongoing presence of local Maya farmers) was not immediately apparent, although it appeared to have been recently, in comparison with the seemingly older abandoned sites of the central and southern Maya region.

===Carnegie Project initiated===
[[File:Sylvanus Morley at Chichen Itza, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Morley with [[Addie Worth Bagley Daniels]] and Josephus Daniels at Chichen Itza.]]
By 1922 the turbulent political situation in Mexico had stabilized somewhat, clearing the way for work to begin on the Carnegie Institution's Chichen Itza project. Morley and Carnegie Institution President Charles Merriam visited Chichen Itza in February 1923. The Mexican government was already at work restoring the massive pyramid, [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]]. Morley gave Merriam a tour of the area he believed would be best for excavation and restoration, a mound complex then known as the Group of One Thousand Columns (which included the Temple of Warriors).&lt;ref&gt;February 22–23, 1923, Sylvanus Morley diaries, Sylvanus Morley Papers, American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia; John M. Weeks and Jane A. Hill (editors), The Carnegie Maya: The Carnegie Institution of Washington Maya Program, 1913-1957 (Boulder, Colo.: University of Colorado Press, 2006) 66&lt;/ref&gt;

When Morley and his team returned in 1924 to commence their excavations, [[Chichen Itza]] was a sprawling complex of several large ruined buildings and many smaller ones, most of which lay concealed under mounds of earth and vegetation. Some areas of the site had been surveyed, photographed and documented in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by [[Desire Charnay]], [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], [[Teoberto Maler]], [[Alfred Maudslay]], [[Eduard Seler]], and [[Edward Herbert Thompson|Edward H. Thompson]], although only Le Plongeon and Thompson had conducted any significant excavation, and their efforts would pale in comparison to the Carnegie project.

===Major finds===
[[File:Templo de los Guerreros-x768.jpg|thumb|The "Temple of the Warriors", excavated by Morley's team. The rows of the "Thousand Columns" can be seen in its foreground, and extending off to the right.]]

In 1924, armed with a renewable ten-year digging concession from the Mexican government, Morley, his field director [[Earl Morris|Earl H. Morris]], artists [[Ann Axtel Morris]] and [[Jean Charlot]], and several others began their first explorations. They selected an area within what appeared to be the central plaza of the site, where the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of some [[column]]s lay exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Charlot's biography (McVicker 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Much to their surprise they uncovered row upon row of free-standing columns — surprising since such columns hardly ever figured in Classic [[Maya architecture]]. This complex (now called the "Complex of a Thousand Columns", although the columns number fewer than one thousand), un-Maya-like in both execution and arrangement, added confirmation to earlier speculations that Chichen Itza was something of an enigma. This arrangement had much more in common with the architectural styles of civilizations in central Mexico (more than a thousand kilometres away) than that of the Classic or Pre-Classic Maya. In particular, this complex and some others which were gradually revealed appeared to have much in common with structures built at [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], believed to be the capital of the [[Toltec]]s and which was located about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of present-day [[Mexico City]].

Over the next few seasons, the team expanded their digs, recovering other anomalous structures from the earthen mounds, such as the Temple of the Jaguar and the Temple of the Warriors. In 1927 they discovered an older structure underneath this latter, which they called the "Temple of the Chacmool" after a further example found of this distinctive statuary. These structures had [[fresco]]es which again exhibited a non-Maya style, or at least a hybrid of Maya and non-Maya. They also worked on the reconstruction of ''el Caracol'', a unique circular building believed (and later confirmed) to be an [[observatory]]. A separate archaeological dig, this one under the Mexican government, had also commenced working the site; the two projects divided the areas to excavate, continuing side-by-side for several years, in a somewhat guarded but nonetheless cordial fashion.

While Morris oversaw day-to-day operations, and Charlot sketched the murals, Morley occupied himself with copying all the inscriptions he could find, particularly the date portions. Since most of these inscription dates at the site were recorded in an abbreviated form known as the "Short Count", which only identified an event within a span of about 260 years, it was difficult to pin down in which particular span an event referred to in the inscriptions occurred. Towards the end of the project Morley's work on these was to be superseded somewhat by a more-comprehensive analysis made by [[Hermann Beyer]] in 1937. In this work, Beyer would note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I frequently have differed with the opinions of Dr.&lt;ref&gt;Almost universally addressed as "Doctor", Morley (like many of his contemporaries) did not actually hold a postgraduate degree; see Coe (1992, p.127).&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily explained by the fact that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While I agree with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer (1937), p.3 of Preface (as reproduced online at Mesoweb).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The later years of the project would increasingly concentrate on completing the restorative work on the principal structures, for Morley always had an eye on the dual purpose of the project: to research, but also rebuild to generate the promised revenue from tourism.

===Result summary===
[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Columnar statues in the form known as the "[[Atlantean figures]]" or "Atlantids", representing [[Toltec]] warriors. The examples shown here are from the Toltec site of [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula (Tollan)]], north of [[Mexico City]]; similar examples and styles found at Chichen Itza by Morley provided further evidence of Maya cultural exchange with central Mexico.]]

The net research result of their excavations revealed Chichen Itza to be an unusual mixture of building styles: not only was there a wide variety of Maya styles such as [[Puuc]], [[Rio Bec]] and [[Chenes]], but a significant presence of Mexican influences such as [[El Tajín]], but more particularly Toltec. The evidence indicated that the site had been inhabited since at least the mid-Classic, but that a particular florescence had occurred in the Post-Classic, when the site was apparently a major power. From the combined results of their work, that of others, and some documented tales of contact-era Maya peoples, a view was formed that Chichen Itza had actually been invaded and conquered sometime in the 10th century by Toltec warriors from the far west, who maintained their hold over the local Maya for another century or so, only in turn to be replaced by a later mixed Maya-Mexica group known as the [[Itza]]. Later evidence suggested that the actual year of this invasion was 987, and identified its leader with a legendary Toltec ruler called [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl]] after the Mesoamerican deity [[Quetzalcoatl]] (''[[Kulkulcan|K'ulk'ulkan]]'' in Yucatec).

Morley was in general opposed to ideas that other external groups had influenced the Maya, but in this case, since the conquest occurred in the "degenerate" Post-Classic phase he found it acceptable. This view of the Toltec invasion of Yucatán became the one maintained by the majority of Mayanists. However, recent research from the mid-1990s onwards has now questioned this orthodoxy, to the point where many now hold an actual invasion did not take place, but the similarities in style are largely due to [[cultural diffusion]] and trade, and that in fact there is evidence that the diffusion in this period flowed in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;Voss and Kremer (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronology of Chichen Itza continues to be a source of debate, and the hoped-for answers to the mystery of the Classic Maya decline elusive (wholesale "Mexicanisation" by invading forces ruled out by the lack of these indicators in the central and southern sites). However, the Carnegie excavations did add significantly to the corpus of available information, and are notable for their scope alone, if not for fine details and quality of research. The site's reconstruction by Carnegie has proved to be a lasting one, and the site today is among the most visited of pre-Columbian ruins in all of Central America and Mexico, with in excess of a million visitors per year.

==Project completion and final years==
After almost twenty years, Carnegie's Chichen Itza project wound to a close in 1940, its restorative and investigative work complete and its objectives substantially met. Morley and his second wife Frances moved from the Hacienda Chichén, their home for many years, and rented the Hacienda Chenku, now within the city of Mérida, Yucatán.

After the close of the Chichen Itza Project, Morley began spending more time in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he had lived half of the year every year since 1910. He was appointed director of the [[School of American Research]] and the [[Museum of New Mexico]], following the death of [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] in 1946. He also began work on a large-scale popular work on ancient Maya society, which he completed and published in 1946. ''The Ancient Maya'' was to be one of his more successful works (outside of his popular writings in magazines), and has been posthumously revised and reprinted several times, although since the 1980s Morley's name is no longer listed as the main author.

Morley last visited Yucatán and the Hacienda Chenku in spring of 1948, just months before his death. He escorted a party to the ruins of Uxmal in February,&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; on what was possibly his last visit to a Maya ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse (1971, p.292)&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Santa Fe on September 2, 1948, aged 65, two years after the publication of ''The Ancient Maya''. He was buried in a plot in Santa Fe's Fairview Cemetery; his second wife Frances Rhoads Morley was interred in the same plot upon her death in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmexicohistory.org/uploads/9948/Fairview%20Cemetery.pdf; see also Kidder 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219111625/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/uploads/9948/Fairview%20Cemetery.pdf |date=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley's personal research library is preserved and available for consultation at the Laboratory of Anthropology Library in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

==Theories and retrospective assessment==
[[File:Morley 1915 ISglyphs.svg|thumb|160px|An example of one of Sylvanus Morley's drawings of [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic]] inscriptions, taken from his 1915 publication. This illustrates the text appearing on a [[lintel]] in the [[Chichen Itza]] building commonly known as the "Temple of the Initial Series", as it is the only inscription for the site known to show a [[Maya Long Count Calendar]] date. The date shown here (starting row 2, ending at A5) is 10.2.9.1.9 9 Muluk 7 Sak (equivalent to July 30, 878 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Voss and Kremer (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In his day, Morley was widely regarded as one of the leading figures in Maya scholarship, in authority perhaps second only to Eric Thompson, whose views he mostly shared. From the late 1920s through to perhaps the mid-1970s, the reconstruction of ancient Maya society and history pieced together by Morley, Thompson and others constituted the "standard" interpretation against which competing views had to be measured. However, major advances made in the [[decipherment]] of [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic writing]] and refinements in archaeological data which have been made since that time have now called into question much of this former "standard" interpretation, overturning key elements and significantly revising the Maya historical account. As far as Morley's own research is concerned, its reputation for soundness and quality has been downgraded somewhat in the light of recent reappraisals;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Houston (1989, p.11), who writes: "His decipherments now seem somewhat negligible, his photographs and drawings well below the standards of achieved by Maudslay and Maler." See also summation by Coe (1992, pp.128–129).&lt;/ref&gt; yet he is still regarded as an important contributor to the field.

===Influences on other scholars===
Many Mayan scholars and archaeologists had their first research opportunity and employment under Morley's tutelage working on the various Carnegie projects. Of these, perhaps the two most notable were [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] and [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]]. Thompson shortly became the field's most dominant figure and its uncontested expert. Together with Morley, he was most responsible for promulgating the view of the ancient Maya as peaceable astronomers, obsessed with [[time]] and [[calendar|calendric]] observations. This view became the prevailing one for the next several decades. Proskouriakoff also went on to establish a stellar career and a lifelong association with the Carnegie Institution; however, her researches ultimately provided the primary convincing evidence which later disproved much of what had been maintained by Thompson and Morley.

In 1925, a young [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|English]] [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[anthropology]] student named [[J. Eric S. Thompson|John Eric Sidney Thompson]] wrote to Morley seeking employment with the Carnegie programme on digs in Central America. Thompson had studied Morley's 1915 work and from that taught himself [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrics]], which were a particular passion for Morley. The Carnegie Institution at Morley's urging accordingly hired Thompson, and he soon found himself at work in Chichen Itza, involved with its architectural reconstruction (for which task Thompson had no particular qualifications). During the 1925–26 season, Thompson became well-acquainted with Morley, the two of them along with their wives (the newly married Thompson was in fact on his [[honeymoon]]) making several side-trips together. However, at the end of the 1926 season, Thompson left Carnegie's employ to take up a post offered by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. This post offered Thompson far greater freedom and diversity for his research. Thompson and Morley were to remain close and like-minded colleagues in spite of this move.

Towards the end of the Chichen Itza project, Morley came across the drawings of a young artist and draftsperson, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], who as an unpaid excavator had accompanied a 1936–37 [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] expedition to the Maya site of [[Piedras Negras (Guatemala)|Piedras Negras]]. The quality of her reconstructive panorama drawings (depicting what the site "might have looked like" when in use) so impressed Morley that he determined to enroll her onto the Carnegie staff. However, this was in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and funds for hiring were scarce; it was also not clear whether Morley had the appropriate authority to do so. After several entreaties, Morley again came up with an innovative funding scheme whereby he devised two campaigns to raise money by subscription to send Proskouriakoff to [[Copán]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]. These were successful, and in 1939, Proskouriakoff transferred onto the Carnegie payroll and was duly dispatched to Copán to gather data for reconstructive drawings of that site.&lt;ref name="Villela" /&gt; Morley's support of Proskouriakoff was to prove fortuitous to Maya scholarship, as she went on to a lengthy and successful career with the Carnegie Institution and was lauded as one of the foremost Maya scholars of her time.

===Views on ancient Maya society===
Morley maintained that ancient Maya society was essentially a united [[theocracy]], and one which was almost exclusively devoted to [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and mystically noting (even "worshipping") the passage of [[time]]. These ideas (which Thompson's later work would develop to its fullest extent) are now extensively modified, and although astronomical and calendric observations were clearly important to the Maya, the people themselves are now seen in more historical, realistic terms—concerned also with dynastic succession, political conquests, and the lives and achievements of actual personages.

He also believed that the southern centers such as [[Copán]] and [[Quiriguá]] had been united in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classical period]] under what he termed the "Old Empire". This empire mysteriously collapsed, but the remnants later migrated to the northern sites (such as Chichen Itza) to form a "New Empire".&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.127).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now generally accepted that at no time was the Maya region united under a single [[polity]], but rather that individual "city-states" maintained a somewhat independent existence, albeit one with its fluctuating conquests and local subservience to more dominant centers. In support of his view, Morley devised a 4-tier classification system of relative importance, which he ascribed to all of the then-known main Maya sites (about 116); many more sites are now known, and his classification system is now seen as an arbitrary one, contradicted in places by the sites' texts which can now be (substantially) read.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, pp.126–129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ideas Morley put forward include the proposal that the ancient Maya were the first in [[Mesoamerica]] to [[domestication|domesticate]] [[maize]] (''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mays''), with the wild variety known as ''[[teosinte]]'' being its [[progenitor]]. Recent [[genetics|genetic]] studies have shown Morley to be largely correct in this, although the beginnings of its domestication ([[10th millennium BC|12,000]] to [[5th millennium BC|7,500]] years ago) pre-dates the establishment of anything resembling Maya society. In general, Morley held that the ancient Maya had been the pre-eminent [[civilization]] of Mesoamerica, from which other cultures had drawn their influences. It is now accepted that other societies (such as the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Olmec]]) preceded that of the Maya and the influences—such as development of [[writing system|writing]] and the [[Mesoamerican calendars]]—were rather the other way around; even in the later stages of Maya history, their region came under significant influences drawn from central Mexico, such as the [[Toltec]] "invasion". However, the Maya did also exert a widespread influence over neighboring contemporary cultures, one which was significant and not to be overlooked.

===Maya writing===
In common with most other Maya scholars, Morley was particularly interested in the mysterious nature of the [[Maya script]]. The essentials of the calendric notation and astronomical data had been worked out by the early 20th century, and by the 1930s [[John E. Teeple]] had solved (with Morley's encouragement) the glyphs known as the "Supplementary Series", proving that these referred to the [[lunar cycle]] and could be used to predict [[lunar eclipse]]s. However, the bulk of the texts and inscriptions still defied all attempts at decipherment, despite much concerted effort. It was Morley's view, and one that found wide support, that these undeciphered portions would contain only more of the same astronomical, calendric and perhaps religious information, not actual historical data. He wrote in 1940, "time, in its various manifestations, the accurate record of its principal phenomena, constitutes the majority of Maya writing."&lt;ref&gt;Morley (1940, pp.144–149). Quotation as cited in Coe (1992, p.143; see also n.37).&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that he doubted that any [[toponym]] would be found in the texts. He supposed that the Maya writing system was one based chiefly upon [[ideogram|ideographic]] or [[pictogram|pictographic]] principles, and that if present any elements of [[phonetics|phoneticism]] would always be "overshadow[ed]" by the ideographic meaning assigned to each glyph."&lt;ref&gt;Morley (1975, p.30). In full, Morley writes that even though it might be anticipated that more phonetic elements would come to be identified, ''"...the idea conveyed by a glyph will always be found to overshadow its phonetic value."''&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, in Morley's view each [[glyph]] substantially represented words, ideas and concepts ''in toto'', and did not separately depict the individual [[phoneme|language sounds]] as spoken by the scribes who had written them (with the possible exception of an occasional [[rebus]]-like element, as had already been demonstrated for [[Aztec writing]]).&lt;ref&gt;Following [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Brinton]], Morley uses the word ''ikonomatic'' for these rebus-like elements, and while allowing that Maya writing probably contained similar elements their phonetic value could only ever be secondary to their ideographic reading; see Morley (1975, pp.26–29).&lt;/ref&gt;

The convincing evidence which was to overturn this view became known only after Morley's death, starting with [[Yuri Knorozov]]'s work in the 1950s. Over the next decades other Mayanists such as Proskouriakoff, [[Michael D. Coe]], and [[David H. Kelley]] would further expand upon this phonetic line of enquiry, which ran counter to the accepted view but would prove to be ever more fruitful as their work continued. By the mid-1970s, it had become increasingly clear to most that the Maya [[writing system]] was a [[logogram|logosyllabic]] one, a mixture of logograms and phonetic components that included a fully functional [[syllabary]].&lt;ref&gt;See description of the script in Coe (1992, pp.262–265); Houston (1989, pp.33–42). See also the [[Maya script]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;

These realizations led to the successful [[decipherment]] of many of the texts which had been impenetrable (and almost "dismissed") by Morley and the "old school". In retrospect, these breakthroughs may have been realized earlier had it not been for Morley's, and later Eric Thompson's, almost "on principle" position against the phonetic approach. Consequently, most of Morley's attempts to advance understanding of the Maya script have been superseded.

Morley's particular passion was the study of the [[Maya calendar]] and its related inscriptions, and in this respect, he made useful expositions that have withstood later scrutiny. His talent was not so much to make innovations, but rather to publicise and explain the workings of the various systems. He was particularly proficient at recovering calendar dates from well-worn and weathered inscriptions, owing to his great familiarity with the various glyphic styles of the ''[[tzolkin|tzolk'in]]'', ''[[haab|haab']]'' and [[Maya Long Count Calendar|Long Count]] elements. Yet in his focus on calendric details, he would often overlook or even neglect the documentation of other non-calendric aspects of the Maya script; the comprehensiveness of some of his publications suffered much as a result. Some leading figures from a later generation of Mayanists would come to regard his publications as being inferior in detail and scope to that of his predecessors, such as [[Teoberto Maler]] and [[Alfred Maudslay]] — poorer quality reproductions, omitted texts, sometimes inaccurate drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, pp.127–129).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
As a director of archaeological excavation projects, Sylvanus Morley was well regarded and liked by his colleagues and his Carnegie board employers, his later movement to "lighter duties" notwithstanding. The reconstructions of Chichen Itza and other sites were widely admired; but in terms of the research output and the resulting documentation produced, the legacy of these projects did not quite amount to what might have been expected to come from such a lengthy investigation. For some later Maya researchers, "...in spite of seventeen years of research at Chichén Itzá by Carnegie, this world-famous city yet remains an archaeological enigma";&lt;ref&gt;Quote is from Coe (1992, p.128).&lt;/ref&gt; it is comparatively little-understood given the amount of work which had gone into it under Morley's direction. Coe also comments that many talented people such as Thompson would spend more time in restoring the site for later tourism than in actual research. Thompson himself would later remark in reference to his time working for Carnegie:
"...in my memory it seems that I personally shifted every blessed stone."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson [1963](1994, p.30), cited in Coe (1992, p.128).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summation===
Despite the later reassessments that were to somewhat dull the shine of his achievements, Sylvanus Morley remains a notable and respected figure in Maya scholarship. His publications are now generally superseded, except for his calendrical compilations. His [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] work, which was his personal abiding interest ("bringing home the epigraphic bacon" was a favorite quote of his),&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.129); Houston (1989, p11).&lt;/ref&gt; is likewise generally outdated, although it was widely supported for several decades after his death. Perhaps the contributions that today remain the most relevant arise from his instigation of the Carnegie research programmes, his enthusiasm and support shown to other scholars, and the undeniable successes in the restorative efforts that have made the Maya sites justly famous. He had particular talents in communicating his fascination for the subject to a wider audience, and in his lifetime became quite widely known as perhaps ''the'' quintessential model of an early 20th-century Central American scholar and explorer, complete with his ever-present [[pith helmet]]. Some have even speculated&lt;ref&gt;See for example Kitchel (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; that his life and exploits may have provided some of the inspiration for the character of [[Indiana Jones]] in the [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] films; the Carnegie Institute itself mentions that it might also have been Morley's field director at Chichen Itza, Earl Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Carnegie Celebrates 100 Years of Scientific Breakthroughs |url=http://carnegieinstitution.org/news_011210.html |publisher=Carnegie Institution |date=December 10, 2001 |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070343/http://carnegieinstitution.org/news_011210.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvanus Morley was also to be remembered as a spokesman and representative of the [[Maya peoples]], among whom he spent so much of his time, and who otherwise lacked the means to directly address some of their concerns with the wider public.

==Major works==
Morley's publications include:
*1915 – ''An Introduction to the Study of Maya Hieroglyphs''
*1920 – ''The Inscriptions of Copán''
*1938 – ''The Inscriptions of Petén'' (5 vols.)
*1946 – ''The Ancient Maya'' (revised 3rd ed. issued in 1956 by G. W. Brainerd)

In addition to his scholarly work, Morley thought it important to share his enthusiasm for the ancient Maya with the public. He wrote a popular series of articles about the Maya and various Maya sites in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''. Several later archaeologists would recall that their youthful exposure to these articles, "vividly illustrated with a color rendition of a purported virgin in filmy ''[[huipil]]'' [a type of clothing] being hurled into the Sacred Cenote", had drawn them into the field in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.126).&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley's ''The Ancient Maya'' was later detected to be a primary source used in several attempted forgeries of Mesoamerican conquest-era manuscripts, such as those known as ''[[Historias de la Conquista del Mayab]]'', the "[[Canek Manuscript]]", and several others. These documents purported to be contemporary accounts written around the 17th century, which had been "discovered" in the mid-20th century. The manuscripts described various aspects of Maya culture and detailed some episodes from early Spanish colonial history; several also included illustrations of Maya glyphs. Although initially accepted by some sources as authentic, later analysis demonstrated striking similarities with the Spanish-language edition of Morley's work, and thus identifying them as modern fakes made sometime between 1950 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Prem (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "other" Sylvanus G. Morley==
Confusingly, and remarkably, there were actually two Sylvanus Griswold Morleys whose careers were contemporaneous. This second Sylvanus G. Morley was in fact the older maternal cousin to the first, born February 23, 1878, in [[Baldwinville, Massachusetts|Baldwinville]], [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], [[Massachusetts]]. This latter was originally baptised Sylvanus Griswold Small ("Sylvanus Griswold" being a family "heirloom" name), but changed his surname from Small to Morley in his early twenties when his father did likewise. As a result, many biographical references confuse details of the two, such as interchanging their birthplaces.

Sylvanus G. (Small) Morley preceded Sylvanus the archaeologist into Harvard, and he was later to establish a career as a Professor of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In his autobiography, the Spanish professor noted the effect of this name change and subsequent confusion:
{{blockquote|However, the person with the most right to complain was my cousin Sylvanus Griswold Morley, the celebrated archaeologist. The move made us homonyms, and gave rise to endless confusion. Look in a Who's Who in America and you will learn the facts. Look in a library catalog, and you will be lucky to learn anything but errors. Sylvanus, a most good-natured soul, never protested. He was an undergraduate at Harvard while I was in the Grad. School. I sometimes received his Univ. bills, and less often, [[Love letter|billets doux]] from his lights of love. I think he has none of mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=Morley, Thomas |year=1997 |title=One Life: A Non-Transcendental Autobiography |work=Autobiographical Writings of Sylvanus Griswold (Small) Morley |url= http://sites.google.com/site/sgmmmf/home/sgm3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Morley is perhaps best known to students of American culture for his early interest in old covered bridges as historical structures. His book on The Covered Bridges of California (University of California Press, 1938) remains an important reference work on the subject.

Sylvanus G. (Small) Morley died in 1970; his son Thomas published his autobiographical notes posthumously.

'''''The Age of Louis XIV''''' ("''Le Siècle de Louis XIV''", also translated '''''The Century of Louis XIV''''') is a historical work by the French historian, philosopher, and writer [[Voltaire]], first published in 1751.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeVY2xQUY1oC|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Cronk|first=Nicholas|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521849739|page=xii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through it, the French 17th century became identified with [[Louis XIV of France]], who reigned from 1643 to 1715.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeVY2xQUY1oC|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Cronk|first=Nicholas|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521849739|page=1-3|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A letter in May 1732 is the first recorded mention of Voltaire's intent to write a history of the reign of Louis XIV.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTXWCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;vq=voltaire%20painting&amp;pg=PA348|title=Intellectual Development of Voltaire|last=Wade|first=Ira O.|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400877829|pages=348–351|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stopped and resumed the project multiple times, expressing the fear that he might not live long enough to complete it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For preparation, he read two hundred volumes of material, plus many unpublished memoirs, as well as historical documents he found in the archives of [[Louvre|the Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXXlCgQR4V8C|title=The Age of Voltaire: The Story of Civilization|last=Durant|first=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451647662|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
In common with other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers, Voltaire saw the age of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Pericles]], the age of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Augustus]], and the [[Italian Renaissance]] as "great ages" or "ages of light". He presented the age of Louis XIV as the fourth and greatest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=syb6-0eW-_sC&amp;pg=PA47|title=Medievalist Enlightenment: From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau|last=Montoya|first=Alicia|date=2013|publisher=DS Brewer|isbn=9781843843429|page=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period covered by the history does not correspond either to the 17th century nor to the reign of Louis XIV, but from the last years of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] to the years after Louis XIV's death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEpJAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|last=Delon|first=Michel|date=2013-12-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135959982|page=1227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire described this age as the greatest ever in terms of arts and philosophy; the time coming closest to perfection. By praising a past age as the greatest ever, he implicitly criticised the culture and art of his own time – the mid-18th century, in the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] – as being in decline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The history consists of 36 chapters.

Voltaire repeatedly remarked that the work should be seen as less like a history but as like a painting: his main concern was not to document already noteworthy events but to celebrate the progress of reason and culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He saw more greatness in the advance of art or the rejection of medieval [[superstition]]—for example, the release of everyone who had been imprisoned for sorcery—than in celebrated military victories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He described his own role as highlighting trends that others had not noticed, similarly to how a painter sees subtleties of light and colour that others miss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The Protestant writer [[Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle]] published an annotated version of the book, ''Notes sur le siècle de Louis XIV,'' in 1753, adding many attacks against Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeVY2xQUY1oC|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Ferret|first=Olivier|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521849739|editor-last=Cronk|editor-first=Nicholas|language=en|chapter=Voltaire pamphlets and polemic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the English writer [[Hannah More]] wrote that Voltaire had "decorated both the period and the king with so much that is great and brilliant, that they fill a large space in the eye of the reader."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tA9EAQAAMAAJ|title=The Works of Hannah More: Hints towards forming the character of a princess|last=More|first=Hannah|date=1819|publisher=T. Cadell and W. Davies, in the Strand|page=85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Virginia Randolph Cary]] wrote in 1828 that "Voltaire's General History, and his Age of Lewis XIV, will always be read with pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMciAAAAMAAJ|title=Letters on Female Character Addressed to a Young Lady on the Death of Her Mother|last=Cary|first=Virginia Randolph|date=1828|publisher=A. Works|location=Richmond, VA|page=130|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of new editions of ''The Age of Louis XIV'' in the late [[20th century]] helped to renew interest in Voltaire as a historian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Modern scholars have described it as "the foundational text of French literary history" and "a milestone on the road to modern history-writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voltaire.ox.ac.uk/www_vf/ocv/ocv_siecle3.ssi|title=Voltaire Foundation: Reviews of the new critical edition of Voltaire’s Siècle de Louis XIV|website=www.voltaire.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Day Goodrich''' (1927–2015) was an American teacher and historian of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

== Early life ==
Tom Goodrich was the son of a prominent scholar of Chinese history and language, Luther Carrington Goodrich, who took him to live in China from the ages of 3 to 5. The family then moved back to the United States, where Goodrich attended school and did his military service.
&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Goodrich (obituary)|url=https://www.indianagazette.com/news/obituaries/thomas-goodrich,23091664/|publisher=Indiana Gazette|accessdate=August 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821221003/https://www.indianagazette.com/news/obituaries/thomas-goodrich,23091664/|archivedate=August 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, he received his master's degree from [[Columbia University]]. He wanted to teach overseas, so he accepted a position in [[Turkey]] at a middle school for boys, where he taught for four years. He then spent an additional year in Turkey teaching at a high school for girls in [[Izmir]].&lt;ref name="indiana"/&gt; It was during this time abroad that he met his first wife Carol "Rusty" Wright.

== Scholarly career ==
Back in the US, Goodrich began a [[PhD|doctoral program]] in history at Columbia University, where he studied with [[Tibor Halasi-Kun]] (his thesis advisor) and [[Peter Gay]].&lt;ref name="indiana"/&gt;

With the help of a [[Fulbright Scholarship]], Goodrich completed his dissertation, an in-depth study and translation of the [[Tarih-i Hindi-i Garbi]]. This is an illustrated history of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|exploration and conquest of America]] written by an Ottoman author in the late 16th century. Upon completing his graduate studies, he and Carol Wright were married and he accepted a teaching position at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. An expanded version of his dissertation was published as a book "The Ottoman Turks and the New World" in 1990. 
&lt;ref name=pinto&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/03085694.2016.1171504| issn = 0308-5694| volume = 68| issue = 2| pages = 238–239| last = Pinto| first = Karen| title = Thomas Day Goodrich (1927–2015)| journal = Imago Mundi| date = July 2, 2016| url = https://www.academia.edu/26644130/Thomas_Day_Goodrich_1927_2015_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodrich went on to bring to light several little-known Ottoman maps and to become an expert on [[Piri Reis]]. In the early 1990s he was invited by the Topkapi Saray Museum Library to prepare a catalogue their map collection, which he published in ''[[Imago Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name=pinto/&gt;

Since 1967, Goodrich taught history at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1973 he was elected chair of the University Senate. He retired in 1994 with emeritus status.&lt;ref name="indiana"/&gt;

The ''[[Journal of Ottoman Studies]]'' dedicated two issues to Tom Goodrich in a "festschrift" in 2012.&lt;ref name=festschrift&gt;{{cite web|title=History Professor Emeritus Tom Goodrich Honored with Journal Issue Dedication|url=http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=138550&amp;amp;blogid=2117|publisher=Indiana University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=August 21, 2016|date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">'''Trần Quốc Vượng''' (12 December 1934 – 8 August 2005) was a Vietnamese historian, archaeologist and culturologist. He was part of the generation including [[Hà Văn Tấn]], and [[Phan Huy Lê]] which formed the foundation of Vietnamese History Studies since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Pelley -Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past - Page 50  2002 "who relied more on the work of Lenin — most notably Trần Quốc Vượng, [[Hà Văn Tấn]], and [[Phan Huy Lê]] — published two pathbreaking studies, Primitive Communism and The History of Feudalism, from which they conspicuously omitted the .....proceeding instead directly from primitive communism to feudalism. Inspired by Lenin's assertions regarding the Slavic countries, historians at the university insisted that beginning with the Hùng kings and the legendary kingdom of [[Văn Lang]]... during the reign of An Dương Vương, who ruled the legendary kingdom of Âu Lạc, and through the early stages of the Chinese occupation (from 2879 B.C.E. to 43 C,E., in other words) Vietnamese society was based on primitive communism "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers - Education As a Political Tool in Asia - Page 149  2009 "Already since 1954, with a new generation of modern Vietnamese historians (Trần Quốc Vượng, Phan Huy Lê etc.), 'Vietnamese-ness' had been clearly considered as having no relation with Chinese influences. "&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1956, he was Professor of University of Social Sciences and Humanities - [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi]] and gave lectures on Vietnamese Ancient-Middle History, Archaeology and Culturology until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://ussh.vnu.edu.vn/gs-tran-quoc-vuong/411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical Notes==
Born on December 12, 1934, in Kinh Mon Village, [[Hải Dương province]], Trần Quốc Vượng graduated as Bachelor of History-Geography at [[University of Hanoi]]. He was then invited to teach at the University of Hanoi (later known as University of Social Sciences and Humanities, [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi]]). He studied archaeology during 1959-60 and together with renowned Archaeology Institute director and professor [[Hà Văn Tấn]] led the way in unearthing Vietnam's archaeological history. He was made a professor in 1980.

He held the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] visiting fellowship to [[Cornell University]]'s [[Cornell Southeast Asia Program|Centre for Southeast Asian Studies]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Peter, 'Letter to the Editors - More Memories of Tran Quoc Vuong', ''Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum Newsletter'', Vol. II, No. 7, September - October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Trần Quốc Vượng's many posts included deputy general secretary of the Vietnam's Folklore Literature Association and first president of the Hanoi History Association.

Professor Trần Quốc Vượng wrote about a variety of subjects from history, to archaeology and man in society, was among the first to begin a systematic study of Vietnam's culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thai Press Report, 'VIETNAM: FAMED HISTORIAN DIES AT 71', 11 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he translated and provided notes to [[Đại Việt sử lược]] (ancient Chinese: 大越史略), or Sketches of Vietnam's History, one of the country's most ancient surviving works. In 1973, he was the chief author of the two-edition ''Danh nhân Hà Nội'' (Hanoi's Famous Personalities) and in 1975, in collaboration with Vũ Tuân Sán he wrote Hà Nội Nghìn Xưa, or Thousand-year Hanoi. In 1976, he worked with Lê Văn Hảo and Dương Tất Từ to write ''Mùa xuân và phong tục Việt Nam'' (Vietnam or Spring and Vietnam's Customs). All were expressions of his desire to contribute all his knowledge to recording his country's history.

'''Yuriy Valentinovich Knorozov''' (alternatively '''Knorosov'''; {{lang-ua|Ю́рій Валенти́нович Кно́розов}}, {{lang-ru|Ю́рий Валенти́нович Кноро́зов}}; November 19, 1922 – March 31, 1999) was a Soviet [[Linguistics|linguist]]&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Phillips, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Aztec and Maya'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]], who is particularly renowned for the pivotal role his research played in the decipherment of the [[Maya script]], the [[writing system]] used by the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]].

== Early life ==
Knorozov was born in a village [[Pivdenne]] near [[Kharkiv]] in [[Ukraine]], at that time the capital of the newly formed [[Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ukrainian SSR was incorporated as a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] on December 30, 1922, barely a month after Knorozov's birth. Among other momentous changes, the Republic was also suffering from the after-effects of the [[Russian famine of 1921]].&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Russians|Russian]] intellectuals, and his paternal grandmother Maria Sakhavyan had been a stage actress of national repute in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Under the pseudonym "Мари Забель" ("Mary Zabel"). See Ershova (2000, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, the young Yuri was a difficult and somewhat eccentric student, who made indifferent progress in a number of subjects and was almost expelled for poor and willful behaviour. However, it became clear that he was academically bright with an inquisitive temperament; he was an accomplished violinist, wrote romantic poetry and could draw with accuracy and attention to detail.&lt;ref name="Ershova 2000"&gt;Ershova (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 at the age of 17, Knorozov left Kharkiv for [[Moscow]] where he commenced undergraduate studies in the newly created Department of [[Ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;MSU's Department of Ethnology was created only the year before, in 1939; see [http://www.hist.msu.ru/English/departments/Ethn/info.htm "Department of Ethnology"], MSU History Faculty.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Moscow State University|Moscow State University's]] faculty of History. He initially specialised in [[Egyptology]].&lt;ref&gt;Ershova (2002); Hammond (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military service and the "Berlin Affair" ==
Knorozov's study plans were soon interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]] hostilities along the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in mid-1941. From 1943 to 1945 Knorozov served his term in the [[second world war]] in the [[Red Army]] as an [[artillery observer|artillery spotter]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ershova (2000) and Kettunen (1998a) for dates of Knorozov's military service. Coe (1992, p.146) gives his unit as the 58th Heavy Artillery, however Ershova (2000) alternatively gives this as the 158th. Ershova also notes Knorozov himself did not participate in the capture of Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the closing stages of the war in May 1945, Knorozov and his unit supported the push of the Red Army vanguard into [[Berlin]]. It was here, sometime in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Berlin]], that Knorozov is supposed to have by chance retrieved a book which would spark his later interest in and association with deciphering the [[Maya script]]. In their retelling, the details of this episode have acquired a somewhat folkloric quality, as "...one of the greatest legends of the history of Maya research".&lt;ref&gt;Quotation is from Kettunen (1998b).&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been much reproduced, particularly following the 1992 publication of [[Michael D. Coe]]'s ''Breaking the Maya Code''.&lt;ref&gt;The incident as relayed in Coe (1992) appears on p.146. For another retelling of this version of the incident, see Gould (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this version of the anecdote, when stationed in Berlin, Knorozov came across the National Library while it was ablaze. Somehow Knorozov managed to retrieve from the burning library a book, which remarkably enough turned out to be a rare edition&lt;ref&gt;The work in question was Villacorta and Villacorta's ''Códices mayas'', published 1930 in [[Guatemala City]]; see Coe (1992, p.146) and Kettunen (1998a) for the identification of this volume.&lt;/ref&gt; containing reproductions of the three [[Maya codices]] which were then known—the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], Madrid and Paris codices.&lt;ref&gt;These surviving [[pre-Columbian]] [[codex|codices]] (screen-fold books) contain a mixture of astronomical, calendric and ritual data, and are illustrated with depictions of deities, animals and other scenes. Crucially, many of the illustrations are also accompanied with captions in the Maya script, which would provide a basis for Knorozov and others to begin in determining the [[phonetic]] values represented by the glyphs.&lt;/ref&gt; Knorozov is said to have taken this book back with him to Moscow at the end of the war, where its examination would form the basis for his later pioneering research into the Maya script.

However, in an interview conducted a year before his death, Knorozov provided a different version of the anecdote.&lt;ref&gt;See record of interview in Kettunen (1998a and 1998b).&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained to his interlocutor, the Mayanist epigrapher [[Harri Kettunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]]:
[[File:StabiMitte 2a.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Inner courtyard of the ''[[Berlin State Library|Preußische Staatsbibliothek]]'' (2005)]] 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Unfortunately it was a misunderstanding: I told about it [finding the books in the library in Berlin] to my colleague Michael Coe, but he didn't get it right. There simply wasn't any fire in the library. And the books that were in the library, were in boxes to be sent somewhere else. The fascist command had packed them, and since they didn't have time to move them anywhere, they were simply taken to Moscow. I didn't see any fire there."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Kettunen (1998b).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The "National Library" mentioned in these accounts is not specifically identified by name, but at the time the library then known as the  ''Preußische Staatsbibliothek'' (Prussian State Library) had that function. Situated on [[Unter den Linden]] and today known as the [[Berlin State Library]] (''Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin''), this was the largest scientific library of Germany. During the war, most of its collection had been dispersed over some 30 separate storage places across the country for safe-keeping. After the war much of the collection was returned to the library.  However, a substantial number of volumes which had been sent for storage in the eastern part of the country were never recovered, with upwards of 350,000 volumes destroyed and a further 300,000 missing. Of these, many ended up in Soviet and Polish library collections, and in particular at the [[Russian State Library]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Berlin State Library staff |year=n.d.|title=Verlagerte Bestände: Die ausgelagerten Bestände der Staatsbibliothek in Osteuropa |work=Profil der Bestände|url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/deutsch/bestaende/verlagerte_bestaende.html |publisher=[[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]] |accessdate=2006-08-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060514115534/http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/deutsch/bestaende/verlagerte_bestaende.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-14|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documentary sources, the so-called "Berlin Affair" is just one of many legends related to the personality of Knorosov. His student [[Galina Yershova|Ershova]] exposed it as a legend and also reported, that documents of Knorosov, first of all his military card, could be a proof, that he did not take part in the [[Battle of Berlin]] and was then in a different place, finishing his service in a military unit located near Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;''Portraits of historians. Time and fate'' (2004) (Russian: Портреты историков. Время и судьбы. М., Наука, 2004. С.474-491.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resumption of studies ==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Any possible system made by a man can be solved or cracked by a man.|source=Yuri Knorozov (1998), St. Petersburg. Interview published in ''Revista Xamana'' (Kettunen 1998a)}}
In the autumn of 1945 after World War II, Knorozov returned to [[Moscow_State_University|Moscow State University]] to complete his undergraduate courses at the department of Ethnography. He resumed his research into [[Egyptology]], and also undertook comparative cultural studies in other fields such as [[Sinology]]. He displayed a particular interest and aptitude for the study of ancient languages and [[writing system]]s, especially [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s, and he also read in medieval Japanese and Arabic literature.&lt;ref name="Ershova 2000" /&gt;

While still an undergraduate at MSU, Knorozov found work at the [[Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography|N.N. Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology]]&lt;ref&gt;Named after the noted 19th-century ethnologist and anthropologist [[Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai]].&lt;/ref&gt; (or IEA), part of the prestigious [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. Knorozov's later research findings would be published by the IEA under its imprint.

As part of his ethnographic curriculum Knorozov spent several months as a member of a field expedition to the [[Central Asia]]n Russian republics of the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen SSR]]s (what had formerly been the [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm PSR]], and would much later become the independent nations of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]] following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union). On this expedition his ostensible focus was to study the effects of Russian expansionary activities and "modern" developments upon the nomadic ethnic groups, of what was a far-flung frontier world of the Soviet state.

At this point the focus of his research had not yet been drawn on the Maya script. This would change in 1947, when at the instigation of his professor, Knorozov wrote his dissertation on the "[[de Landa alphabet]]", a record produced by the 16th century Spanish [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]] in which he claimed to have transliterated the Spanish alphabet into corresponding Maya hieroglyphs, based on input from [[Maya peoples|Maya]] informants. De Landa, who during his posting to [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] had overseen the destruction of all the codices from the [[Maya civilization]] he could find, reproduced his alphabet in a work (''Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán'') intended to justify his actions once he had been placed on trial when recalled to Spain. The original document had disappeared, and this work was unknown until 1862 when an abridged copy was discovered in the archives of the Spanish Royal Academy by the French scholar, [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]].

Since de Landa's "alphabet" seemed to be contradictory and unclear (e.g., multiple variations were given for some of the letters, and some of the symbols were not known in the surviving inscriptions), previous attempts to use this as a key for deciphering the Maya writing system had not been successful.

== Key research ==
[[File:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Page from [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán'' (1853 edition by [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg|Brasseur de Bourbourg]]), which contained description of the ''[[de Landa alphabet]]'' which Knorozov relied upon for his breakthrough.]]
In 1952 Knorozov published a paper which was later to prove to be a seminal work in the field (''Drevnyaya pis’mennost’ Tsentral’noy Ameriki'', or "Ancient Writing of Central America".) The general thesis of this paper put forward the observation that early [[writing system|scripts]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|ancient Egyptian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] which were generally or formerly thought to be predominantly [[logogram|logographic]] or even purely [[ideogram|ideographic]] in nature, in fact contained a significant [[phonetics|phonetic]] component. That is to say, rather than the [[grapheme|symbols]] representing only or mainly whole words or concepts, many symbols in fact represented the sound elements of the language in which they were written, and had [[alphabet]]ic or [[syllabary|syllabic]] elements as well, which if understood could further their [[decipherment]]. By this time, this was largely known and accepted for several of these, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs (the decipherment of which was famously commenced by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822 using the tri-lingual [[Rosetta Stone]] artefact); however the prevailing view was that Mayan did not have such features. Knorozov's studies in comparative linguistics drew him to the conclusion that the Mayan script should be no different from the others, and that purely logographic or ideographic scripts did not exist.

Knorozov's key insight was to treat the Maya glyphs represented in de Landa's alphabet not as an alphabet, but rather as a syllabary. He was perhaps not the first to propose a syllabic basis for the script, but his arguments and evidence were the most compelling to date. He maintained that when de Landa had commanded of his informant to write the equivalent of the Spanish letter "b" (for example), the Maya scribe actually produced the glyph which corresponded to the ''syllable'', /be/, as spoken by de Landa. Knorozov did not actually put forward many new transcriptions based on his analysis, nevertheless he maintained that this approach was the key to understanding the script. In effect, the de Landa "alphabet" was to become almost the "Rosetta stone" of Mayan decipherment.

A further critical principle put forward by Knorozov was that of [[synharmony]]. According to this, Mayan words or syllables which had the form consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) were often to be represented by two glyphs, each representing a CV-syllable (i.e., CV-CV). In the reading, the vowel of the second was meant to be ignored, leaving the reading (CVC) as intended. The principle also stated that when choosing the second CV glyph, it would be one with an [[echo vowel]] that matched the vowel of the first glyph syllable. Later analysis has proved this to be largely correct.

== Critical reactions to his work ==
Upon the publication of this work from a then hardly known scholar, Knorozov and his thesis came under some severe and at times dismissive criticism. [[J. Eric S. Thompson]], the noted British scholar regarded by all as the leading [[Mayanist]] of his day, led the attack. Thompson's views at that time were solidly anti-phonetic, and his own large body of detailed research had already fleshed-out a view that the Maya inscriptions did not record their actual history, and that the glyphs were founded on [[ideogram|ideographic]] principles. His view was the prevailing one in the field, and many other scholars followed suit.

The situation was further complicated by Knorozov's paper appearing during the height of the [[Cold War]], and many were able to dismiss his paper as being founded on misguided [[Marxism|Marxist]]-[[Leninism|Leninist]] ideology and polemic. Indeed, in keeping with the mandatory practices of the time, Knorozov's paper was prefaced by a foreword written by the journal's editor which contained digressions and propagandist comments extolling the State-sponsored approach by which Knorozov had succeeded where Western scholarship had failed. However, despite claims to the contrary by several of Knorozov's detractors, Knorozov himself never did include such polemic in his writings.

Knorozov persisted with his publications in spite of the criticism and rejection of many Mayanists of the time. He was perhaps shielded to some extent from the ramifications of peer disputation, since his position and standing at the institute was not adversely influenced by criticism from Western academics.

== Progress of decipherment ==
Knorozov further improved his decipherment technique in his 1963 [[monograph]] "The Writing of the Maya Indians"&lt;ref name="Ershova 2000" /&gt; and published translations of Mayan manuscripts in his 1975 work "Maya Hieroglyphic Manuscripts".

During the 1960s, other Mayanists and researchers began to expand upon Knorozov's ideas. Their further field-work and examination of the extant inscriptions began to indicate that actual Maya history was recorded in the [[stele|stela]]e inscriptions, and not just [[Maya calendar|calendric]] and [[astronomy|astronomical]] information. The Russian-born but American-resident scholar [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] was foremost in this work, eventually convincing Thompson and other doubters that historical events were recorded in the script.

Other early supporters of the phonetic approach championed by Knorozov included [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[David H. Kelley|David Kelley]], and whilst initially they were in a clear minority, more and more supporters came to this view as further evidence and research progressed.

Through the rest of the decade and into the next, Proskouriakoff and others continued to develop the theme, and using Knorozov's results and other approaches began to piece together some decipherments of the script. A major breakthrough came during the first round table or Mesa Redonda conference at the Maya site of  [[Palenque]] in 1973, when using the syllabic approach those present (mostly) deciphered what turned out to be a list of former rulers of that particular Maya city-state.

Subsequent decades saw many further such advances, to the point now where quite a significant portion of the surviving inscriptions can be read. Most Mayanists and accounts of the decipherment history apportion much of the credit to the impetus and insight provided by Knorozov's contributions, to a man who had been able to make important contributions to the understanding of this distant, ancient civilisation.

== Later life ==
As his theories became more widely known, Knorozov was in 1956 granted leave to attend an international convention of Mesoamerican scholars in [[Copenhagen]]. This was to be his one and only venture outside the Soviet Union for quite some time, since as a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] academic, Knorozov was subject to the usual restrictions placed on travel outside of the Soviet Union. Over subsequent years western Mayanists needed to travel to Leningrad to meet up with him. It was not until 1990 that he was eventually able to leave Russia again and finally visit the ancient Maya homelands and archaeological sites in [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. This was at the invitation of the Guatemalan President [[Vinicio Cerezo|Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo]], at a time of improved diplomatic relations between the two countries. Cerezo presented him with an honorary medal, and Knorozov was able to extend his stay in the region, visiting several of the important Maya sites such as [[Tikal]]. However, shortly after Vinicio Cerezo left office, Knorozov received threats from suspected right-wing militarist groups who were antagonistic to the indigenous Mayan peoples, and was forced to go into hiding and then leave the country.

The government of Mexico awarded him the ''[[Order of the Aztec Eagle|Orden del Águila Azteca]]'' (Order of the Aztec Eagle), the highest decoration awarded by Mexico to non-citizens, which was presented to him at a ceremony at the Mexican Embassy in Moscow on November 30, 1994.

Knorozov had broad interest in, and contributed to, other investigative fields such as archaeology, semiotics, human migration to the Americas and the evolution of the mind. However, it is his contributions to the field of Maya studies for which he is best remembered.

In his very last years, Knorozov is also known&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira (2006, p.6)&lt;/ref&gt; to have pointed to a place in the [[United States]] as the likely location of [[Chicomoztoc]], the ancestral land from which—according to ancient documents and accounts considered [[mythology|myth]]ical by a sizable number of scholars—Indian peoples now living in Mexico are said to have come.

Knorozov died in Saint Petersburg on March 31, 1999, of [[pneumonia]] in the corridors of a city hospital, just before he was due to receive the honorary [[Proskouriakoff Award]] from [[Harvard University]].
