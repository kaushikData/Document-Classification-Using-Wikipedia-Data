{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}

The '''1954 Guatemalan coup d'état''' was a covert operation carried out by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) that [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] the [[Guatemalan presidential election, 1950|democratically elected]] Guatemalan President [[Jacobo Árbenz]] and ended the [[Guatemalan Revolution]] of 1944–1954. Code-named '''Operation PBSUCCESS''', it installed the military dictatorship of [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in [[Guatemala]].

The Guatemalan Revolution began in 1944, when a popular uprising toppled the authoritarian [[Jorge Ubico]] and brought [[Juan José Arévalo]] to power via Guatemala's [[Guatemalan presidential election, 1944|first democratic election]]. The new president introduced a [[minimum wage]] and near-[[universal suffrage]], aiming to turn Guatemala into a [[liberal democracy]]. Arévalo was succeeded by Árbenz in 1951, who instituted popular [[Decree 900|land reforms]] which granted property to landless peasants.{{sfn|Handy|1994|p=4}} The Guatemalan Revolution was disliked by the United States Federal government, [[Latin America–United States relations|which was predisposed]] by the [[Cold War]] to see it as [[communism|communist]]. This perception grew after Árbenz took power and legalized the [[Guatemalan Party of Labour|Communist Party]]. The [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC), whose highly profitable business had been affected by the end to exploitative labor practices in Guatemala, engaged in an influential lobbying campaign to persuade the U.S. to overthrow the Guatemalan government. U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] authorized [[Operation PBFORTUNE]] to topple Árbenz in 1952; although the operation was quickly aborted, it was a precursor to PBSUCCESS.

[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line [[Anti-communism|against communism]]; the links that his staff members [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Allen Dulles]] had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. Federal government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of [[psychological warfare]]. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of [[Guatemala City]] and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the [[Military of Guatemala|Guatemalan army]], which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in [[San Salvador]].

Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America]]. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched [[Operation PBHISTORY]], which sought evidence of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a [[Guatemalan genocide|genocide of the Maya peoples]].

==Historical background==

===Monroe Doctrine===
{{Further information|Monroe Doctrine}}
[[File:Guatemala in North America (-mini map -rivers).svg|thumb|The [[Monroe Doctrine]] stated that the [[Western Hemisphere]], including the Republic of Guatemala, was within the U.S. sphere of influence.]]

U.S. President [[James Monroe]]'s foreign policy doctrine of 1823 warned the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|European powers]] against further [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization in Latin America]]. The stated aim of the Monroe Doctrine was to maintain order and stability, and to ensure that U.S. access to resources and markets was not limited. Historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened [[Latin America]]n countries to squabbling children. While the U.S. did not initially have the power to enforce the doctrine, over the course of the 19th century many European powers withdrew from Latin America, allowing the U.S. to expand its [[sphere of influence]] throughout the region.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Gilderhus|2006|pp=6–9}} In 1895, President [[Grover Cleveland]] laid out a more militant version of the doctrine, stating that the U.S. was "practically sovereign" on the continent.{{sfn|Gilderhus|2006|pp=10–12}}

Following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, this aggressive interpretation was used to create a U.S. economic empire across the [[Caribbean]], such as with the [[Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1903)|1903 treaty with Cuba]] that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor.{{sfn|Gilderhus|2006|pp=10–12}} U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in [[Central America]].{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=34}} The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] (1912–33), and [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]] (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=8–10}} Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a [[banana republic]].{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=xii}} From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from [[British Empire#Britain's imperial century (1815–1914)|Britain]] and [[German Empire|Germany]] to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=8–10}} The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and was used to justify the coup in 1954.{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=6}}

===Authoritarian governments and the United Fruit Company===
{{Further information|Manuel Estrada Cabrera|Jorge Ubico}}
[[File:InterinoWstradaCabrera1898.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Manuel Estrada Cabrera, President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, granted several concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]].]]

Following a surge in [[History of coffee|global coffee demand]] in the late 19th century, the Guatemalan government made several concessions to plantation owners. It passed legislation that dispossessed the communal landholdings of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Guatemala|indigenous population]] and allowed [[Coffee production in Guatemala|coffee growers]] to purchase it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}} [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]], President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, was one of several rulers who made large concessions to foreign companies, including the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC).{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}} Formed in 1899 by the merger of two large U.S. corporations,{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=68–70}} the new entity owned large tracts of land across Central America, and in Guatemala controlled the [[Rail transport in Guatemala|railroads]], the docks, and the communication systems.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=65–68}}{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=76–77}} By 1900 it had become the largest exporter of bananas in the world,{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=68–72}} and had a monopoly over the Guatemalan [[Banana production in the Caribbean|banana trade]].{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|pp=76–77}} Historian [[William Blum]] describes UFC's role in Guatemala as a "[[state within a state]]".{{sfn|Blum|2003|p=75}} The U.S. government was also closely involved with the Guatemalan state under Cabrera, frequently dictating financial policies and ensuring that American companies were granted several exclusive rights.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=77}} When Cabrera was overthrown in 1920, the U.S. sent an armed force to make certain that the new president remained friendly to it.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=10–11}}

Fearing a popular revolt following the unrest created by the [[Great Depression]], wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who won an uncontested [[Guatemalan general election, 1931|election in 1931]].{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}}{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=10–11}} Ubico's regime became one of the most repressive in the region. He abolished [[debt peonage]], replacing it with a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of [[forced labor]] annually. He authorized landowners to take any actions they wished against their workers, including [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|executions]].{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}}{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=11–12}} Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascism|fascist]] leaders such as [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], but had to [[Guatemala–United States relations|ally with the U.S.]] for geopolitical reasons,{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=79}} and received substantial support from this country throughout his reign.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=11–12}} A staunch [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=34–37}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=9–10}}

By 1930 the UFC had built an operating capital of 215 million U.S. dollars,{{efn|{{Inflation|US|215000000|1930|fmt=eq|r=-6}}}} and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}} Ubico granted it a new contract, which was immensely favorable to the company. This included {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} an exemption from all taxes,{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=12}} and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=68–72}} Ubico requested the UFC to cap the daily salary of its workers at 50 U.S. cents, so that workers in other companies would be less able to demand higher wages.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}}

===Guatemalan Revolution and presidency of Arévalo===
{{Main article|Guatemalan Revolution}}

The repressive policies of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=12–13}} Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person [[junta (governing body)|junta]] which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the [[Guatemalan Revolution#October revolution|October Revolution]] that aimed to transform Guatemala into a [[liberal democracy]].{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=12–13}} The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, [[Juan José Arévalo]], as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=14–15}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|p=149}} Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist [[Guatemalan Party of Labour]] (''Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo'', PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all [[labor union]]s in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=98–99}} By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=99–101}} However, Arévalo refused to advocate [[land reform]] of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=14–15}}

Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was suspicious of him, and worried that he was under Soviet influence.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}} The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through the strength of its teachers' union.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=98–99}} Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the [[Caribbean Legion]]. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included [[Fidel Castro]], that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=13–14}} The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|pp=94–96}} A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by [[Francisco Arana]], which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister [[Jacobo Árbenz]]. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=50–69}} Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the [[Catholic Church in Guatemala|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=93}}

===Presidency of Árbenz and land reform===
{{Further information|Decree 900}}
[[File:Guatearbenz0870.JPG|thumb|upright|A mural celebrating President Árbenz and his [[Decree 900|landmark agrarian reform]], which benefited 500,000 people]]

The largely free [[Guatemalan presidential election, 1950|elections of 1950]] were won by the popular Árbenz,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=73–84}} and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala.{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=91}} Árbenz had personal ties to some members of the communist PGT, which was legalized during his government,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=73–84}} and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=134–148}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=61–67}} Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a [[communist state]], instead choosing a moderate [[capitalism|capitalist]] approach.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|Figueroa Ibarra|2006|p=397}} The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from [[feudalism]] and improving workers' rights.{{sfn|Figueroa Ibarra|2006|pp=397–398}} The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}} Árbenz drafted the bill himself,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=144–146}} having sought advice from economists across Latin America.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}} The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}}

The official title of the agrarian reform bill was [[Decree 900]]. It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than {{convert|673|acre|ha}}. If the estates were between {{convert|224|acre|ha}} and {{convert|672|acre|ha}}, uncultivated land was to be expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The owners were compensated with government bonds, the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated. The value of the land itself was what the owners had declared it to be in their tax returns in 1952. Of the nearly 350,000 private landholdings, only 1,710 were affected by expropriation. The law was implemented with great speed, which resulted in some arbitrary land seizures. There was also some violence, directed at landowners, as well as at peasants that had minor landholdings.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=149–164}}

[[File:Quetzaltenango farm highlands 2009.jpg|thumb|Farmland in the [[Quetzaltenango Department]], in western Guatemala]]

By June 1954, {{convert|1400000|acre|ha}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had received land by this point. Contrary to the predictions made by detractors, the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity, and in an increase in cultivated area. Purchases of farm machinery also increased. Overall, the law resulted in a significant improvement in  living standards for many thousands of peasant families, the majority of whom were indigenous people.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=149–164}} Historian [[Greg Grandin]] sees the law as representing a fundamental power shift in favor of the hitherto marginalized.{{sfn|Grandin|2000|pp=200–201}}

== Genesis and prelude ==
===United Fruit Company lobbying===
[[File:1920UnitedFruitCompanyEntrance.jpg|thumb|upright|The former headquarters of the United Fruit Company, in [[New Orleans]]. The company played a key role in instigating the 1954 ''coup d'état''.]]

By 1950, the United Fruit Company's annual profits were 65 million U.S. dollars,{{efn|{{Inflation|US|65000000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-6}}}} twice as large as the revenue of the government of Guatemala.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=73–76}} The company also virtually owned [[Puerto Barrios]], Guatemala's only port to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], allowing it to make profits from the flow of goods through the port.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}} Due to its long association with Ubico's government, Guatemalan revolutionaries saw the UFC as an impediment to progress after 1944. This image was reinforced by the company's discriminatory policies against its [[people of color|workers of color]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=73–76}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=71}} Due to its size, the reforms of Arévalo's government affected the UFC more than other companies. Among other things, the new labor code allowed UFC workers to strike when their demands for higher wages and job security were not met. The company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and refused to negotiate with the numerous sets of strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=75–82}} The company's troubles were compounded with the passage of Decree 900 in 1952. Of the {{convert|550000|acre|ha}} that the company owned, only 15 percent was being cultivated; the rest was idle, and thus came under the scope of the agrarian reform law.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=75–82}}

The UFC responded by intensively [[lobbying]] the U.S. government; several [[United States Congress|Congressmen]] criticized the Guatemalan government for not protecting the interests of the company. The Guatemalan government replied that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that "[to] the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation's welfare".{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=72–77}} In 1953, {{convert|200000|acre|ha}} of uncultivated land was expropriated by the government, which offered the company compensation at the rate of 2.99 U.S. dollars to the acre (7.39 U.S. dollars per hectare),{{efn|{{Inflation|US|7.39|1953|fmt=eq|r=2}}}} twice what the company had paid when it bought the property.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=72–77}} More expropriation occurred soon after, bringing the total to over {{convert|400000|acre|ha}}; the government offered compensation to the company at the rate at which the UFC had valued its own property for tax purposes.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=75–82}} Since this was a major undervaluation, the company was unhappy with its compensation, resulting in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]], who had close ties to the company.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=72–77}}

The UFC also began a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired [[Edward Bernays]], who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as the victim of a communist Guatemalan government.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=78–90}} The company stepped up its efforts after [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was elected U.S. President in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories" but it nonetheless had a significant impact on the members of Congress who read it.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=90–97}} Overall, the company spent over half a million dollars to convince lawmakers and the American public that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=90–97}}

===Operation PBFORTUNE===
{{main article|Operation PBFORTUNE}}
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. President Harry Truman (pictured here in 1950) authorized the CIA to effect a Guatemalan ''coup d'état'' in 1952.]]

As the [[Cold War]] developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on an increasing number of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=82–100}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=14–28}} In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=82–100}} Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=95}} Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=109–110}} The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}}

The U.S.'s worries over communist influence increased after the election of Árbenz in 1951 and his enactment of Decree 900 in 1952.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=14–28}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=228}} In April 1952 [[Anastasio Somoza García]], the dictator of [[Nicaragua]], made his first state visit to the U.S.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=28–35}} He made several public speeches praising the U.S., and was awarded a medal by the New York City government. During a meeting with Truman and his senior staff, Somoza said that if the U.S. gave him the arms, he would "clean up Guatemala".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–229}} The proposal did not receive much immediate support, but Truman instructed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to follow up on it. The CIA contacted [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], a Guatemalan army officer who had been exiled from the country in 1949 following a [[Guatemalan Revolution#1949 coup attempt|failed coup attempt]] against President Arévalo.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=59–69}} Believing that Castillo Armas would lead a coup with or without their assistance, the CIA decided to supply him with weapons and 225,000 U.S. dollars.{{efn|{{Inflation|US|225000|1949|fmt=eq|r=-4}}}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=28–35}}

The coup was planned in detail over the next few weeks by the CIA, the UFC, and Somoza. The CIA also contacted [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] of Venezuela and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the Dominican Republic; the two U.S.-backed dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=229–230}} Although PBFORTUNE was officially approved on 9 September 1952, various planning steps had been taken earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA's [[National Clandestine Service|Directorate of Plans]] compiled a list of "top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup".{{sfn|Haines|1995}} The CIA plan called for the assassination of over 58 Guatemalans, as well as the arrest of many others.{{sfn|Haines|1995}}

The CIA put the plan into motion in late 1952. A freighter that had been borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in [[New Orleans]] and loaded with weapons under the guise of agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=230}} However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars,{{efn|{{Inflation|US|3000|1952|fmt=eq|r=-3}}}} and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=229–230}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=28–35}}

===Eisenhower administration===
[[File:CIA-Arbenz-overthrow-FOIA-documents-1of5.gif|thumb|The memorandum which describes the CIA's organisation of the paramilitary deposition of President Jacobo Árbenz in June 1954]]

During his successful campaign for the U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to [[Rollback|roll back]] communism, rather than [[Containment|contain it]]. Working in an atmosphere of increasing [[McCarthyism]] in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=234}} Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=231}} Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=96}}

Several figures in Eisenhower's administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother CIA Director [[Allen Dulles]], had close ties to the United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]], and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State [[Walter Bedell Smith]] would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=106–107}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=122–127}} The success of the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|1953 CIA operation]] to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=100–101}}

Historians and authors writing about the 1954 coup have debated the relative importance of the role of the United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=489}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=2–5}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|pp=149–151}} Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC.{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|pp=149–151}}{{sfn|McCleary|1999|p=10}}{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Figueroa Ibarra|2006|p=400}} Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=489}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=2–5}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|pp=149–151}} Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=1–2}} Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=489}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=2–5}}{{sfn|McCleary|1999|p=10}}{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|pp=92–100}}

==Operation PBSUCCESS==

===Planning===
[[File:Allen w dulles.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=File photo of Allen Dulles|Allen Dulles, director of the CIA during the 1954 coup, and brother of U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]]]

The CIA operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, was authorized by Eisenhower in August 1953. The operation was granted a budget of 2.7 million U.S. dollars{{efn|{{Inflation|US|2700000|1954|fmt=eq|r=-5}}}} for "psychological warfare and political action".{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}} The total budget has been estimated at between 5 and 7 million dollars, and the planning employed over 100 CIA agents.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=138–143}} In addition, the operation recruited scores of individuals from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of the surrounding countries.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=138–143}} The plans included drawing up lists of people within Árbenz's government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. Manuals of assassination techniques were compiled, and lists were also made of people whom the junta would dispose of.{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}}

The State Department created a team of diplomats who would support PBSUCCESS. It was led by [[John Peurifoy]], who took over as [[United States Ambassador to Guatemala|Ambassador to Guatemala]] in October 1953.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=45}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=137}} Another member of the team was [[William D. Pawley]], a wealthy businessman and diplomat with extensive knowledge of the aviation industry.{{sfn|Holland|2005|pp=53–56}} Peurifoy was a militant anti-communist, and had proven his willingness to work with the CIA during his time as [[United States Ambassador to Greece]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=251–254}} Under Peurifoy's tenure, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, although those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy stated that he was "definitely convinced that if [Árbenz] is not a communist, then he will certainly do until one comes along".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=255}} Within the CIA, the operation was headed by [[Deputy Director of Plans]] [[Frank Wisner]]. The field commander selected by Wisner was former U.S. Army Colonel Albert Haney, then chief of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney reported directly to Wisner, thereby separating PBSUCCESS from the CIA's Latin American division, a decision which created some tension within the agency.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=108–109}} Haney decided to establish headquarters in a concealed office complex in [[Opa-locka, Florida]].{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=110, 112–113}} Codenamed "Lincoln", it became the nerve center of operation PBSUCCESS.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=288}}

The CIA operation was complicated by a premature coup on 29 March 1953, with a futile raid against the army garrison at [[Salamá]], in the central Guatemalan department of [[Baja Verapaz Department|Baja Verapaz]]. The rebellion was swiftly crushed, and a number of participants were arrested. Several CIA agents and allies were imprisoned, weakening the coup effort. Thus the CIA came to rely more heavily on the Guatemalan exile groups and their anti-democratic allies in Guatemala.{{sfn|Cullather|1994|p=21}} The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]], the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the Guatemalan opposition but was rejected for his role in the Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race ''[[mestizo]]'' population.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=141–142}} Another popular candidate was the coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo's cabinet before becoming the legal adviser to the UFC. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 turned him against the government, and he had planned the unsuccessful Salamá coup in 1953 before fleeing to join Castillo Armas in exile. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=141–143}} Thus it was Castillo Armas, in exile since the failed 1949 coup and on the CIA's payroll since the aborted PBFORTUNE in 1951, who was to lead the coming coup.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=28–35}}

Castillo Armas was given enough money to recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA established training camps in Nicaragua and [[Honduras]] and supplied them with weapons as well as several [[bomber]]s. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=162–165}} These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a ''[[fait accompli]]''. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=162–165}}

===Caracas conference and U.S. propaganda===
While preparations for Operation PBSUCCESS were underway, Washington issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=256–257}} The State Department also asked the [[Organization of American States]] to modify the agenda of the [[Pan-American Conference|Inter-American Conference]], which was scheduled to be held in [[Caracas]] in March 1954, requesting the addition of an item titled "Intervention of International Communism in the American Republics", which was widely seen as a move targeting Guatemala.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=256–257}} On 29 and 30 January 1954, the Guatemalan government published documents containing information leaked to it by a member of Castillo Armas' team who had turned against him. Lacking in original documents, the government had engaged in poor forgery to enhance the information it possessed, undermining the credibility of its charges.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=55}} A spate of arrests followed of allies of Castillo Armas within Guatemala, and the government issued statements implicating a "Government of the North" in a plot to overthrow Árbenz. Washington denied these allegations, and the U.S. media uniformly took the side of their government; even publications which had until then provided relatively balanced coverage of Guatemala, such as ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', suggested that Árbenz had succumbed to communist propaganda. Several Congressmen also pointed to the allegations from the Guatemalan government as proof that it had become communist.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=259–262}}

At the conference in Caracas, the various Latin American governments sought economic aid from the U.S., as well as its continuing non-intervention in their internal affairs.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=267–278}} The U.S. government's aim was to pass a resolution condemning the supposed spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere. The Guatemalan foreign minister [[Guillermo Toriello]] argued strongly against the resolution, stating that it represented the "internationalization of McCarthyism". Despite support among the delegates for Toriello's views, the anti-communist resolution passed with only Guatemala voting against, because of the votes of dictatorships dependent on the U.S. and the threat of economic pressure applied by John Dulles.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=146–150}} Although support among the delegates for Dulles' strident anti-communism was less strong than he and Eisenhower had hoped for,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=267–278}} the conference marked a victory for the U.S., which was able to make concrete Latin American views on communism.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=146–150}}

The U.S. had stopped selling arms to Guatemala in 1951 while signing bilateral defense agreements and increasing arms shipments to neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. promised the Guatemalan military that it too could obtain arms—if Árbenz were deposed. In 1953, the State Department aggravated the U.S. arms embargo by thwarting the Árbenz government's arms purchases from Canada, Germany, and [[Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=144–150}}{{sfn|Cullather|1994|p=36}} By 1954 Árbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from [[Czechoslovakia]], which would have been the first time that a [[Soviet bloc]] country shipped weapons to the Americas, an action seen as establishing a communist beachhead in the Americas.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=280–285}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=155–160}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|p=152}} The weapons were delivered to Guatemala at the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios by the Swedish freight ship {{MS|Alfhem}}, which sailed from [[Szczecin]] in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=155–160}} The U.S. failed to intercept the shipment despite imposing an illegal naval quarantine on Guatemala.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=310–316}} However "Guatemalan army officers" quoted in ''The New York Times'' said that "some of the arms&amp;nbsp;... were duds, worn out, or entirely wrong for use there".{{sfn|Gruson|1954}} The CIA portrayed the shipment of these weapons as Soviet interference in the United States' backyard; it was the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=155–160}}

U.S. rhetoric abroad also had an effect on the Guatemalan military. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied a lot of pressure on senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=300–311}} Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the ''Alfhem'' to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=300–311}}

===Castillo Armas' invasion===
[[File:Un-guatemala.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The CIA trained and funded army of Carlos Castillo Armas invaded the Republic of Guatemala from Honduras and from El Salvador. The invasion force was split into four teams, targeting the towns of [[Puerto Barrios]], [[Zacapa]], [[Esquipulas]] and [[Jutiapa]].]]

Castillo Armas' force of 480 men had been split into four teams, ranging in size from 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and [[El Salvador]], and assembled in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of [[Esquipulas]], [[Jutiapa]], and [[Zacapa]], the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=87–89}} The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=87–89}} At 8:20&amp;nbsp;am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=87–89}} Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz's immediate surrender.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=161}} The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=87–89}}

When the rebels did reach their targets, they met with further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten by a garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=90–93}} The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, with many of the rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebel planes tried air attacks on the capital.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=90–93}} These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was. The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of [[Managua]]; as a result, they had a limited [[payload]]. A large number of them substituted dynamite or [[Molotov cocktail]]s for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=166–167}} The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.

Early in the morning on 27 June 1954, a CIA [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning#Variants|Lockheed P-38M Lightning]] attacked [[Puerto San José]] and dropped [[napalm]] bombs on the British cargo ship, {{SS|Springfjord}}, which was on charter to the U.S. company [[W. R. Grace and Company#Shipping|W.R. Grace and Company Line]], and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee.{{sfn|Gordon|1971}} This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation.{{efn|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1954|fmt=eq|r=-5}}}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=166–167}} On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of [[San Pedro de Copán]]; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=340}} The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=168–169}} [[William Pawley]] had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.{{sfn|Holland|2005|pp=58–61}}

===Psychological warfare===
Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was not large enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a campaign of [[psychological warfare]], which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a ''fait accompli'' to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign.{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|pp=152–154}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=165}} The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the [[U.S. Information Agency]] (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing tens of thousands of leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=166}}

''Alfhem''{{'}}s success in evading the quarantine led to Washington escalating its intimidation of Guatemala through [[United States Navy|its navy]]. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER, a naval blockade of Guatemala. Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=82–83}} However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the U.S. would not interfere with their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The intimidation was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas' planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=82–83}}

The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station [[Voice of Liberation]]. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in [[Miami]] by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts have been given a lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=74–77}} These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=100–101}}

===Guatemalan response===
The Árbenz government originally meant to repel the invasion by arming the military-age populace, workers' militias, and the [[Military of Guatemala|Guatemalan Army]]. Resistance from the armed forces, as well as public knowledge of the secret arms purchase, compelled the President to supply arms only to the Army.{{sfn|Gordon|1971}} From the beginning of the invasion, Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily and expressed this confidence in public. But he was worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a direct invasion by the U.S. military. This also contributed to his decision not to arm civilians initially; lacking a military reason to do so, this could have cost him the support of the army. [[Carlos Enrique Díaz de León|Carlos Enrique Díaz]], the chief of the Guatemalan armed forces, told Árbenz that arming civilians would be unpopular with his soldiers, and that "the army [would] do its duty".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=320–323}}

Árbenz instead told Díaz to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all regarded to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=320–323}} On the night of 19 June, most of the Guatemalan troops in the capital region left for Zacapa, joined by smaller detachments from other garrisons. Árbenz stated that "the invasion was a farce", but worried that if it was defeated on the Honduran border, Honduras would use it as an excuse to declare war on Guatemala, which would lead to a U.S. invasion. Due to the rumours spread by the Voice of Liberation, there were worries throughout the countryside that a [[fifth column]] attack was imminent; large numbers of peasants went to the government and asked for weapons to defend their country. They were repeatedly told that the army was "successfully defending our country".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=323–326}} Nonetheless, peasant volunteers assisted the government war effort, manning roadblocks and donating supplies to the army. Weapons shipments dropped by rebel planes were intercepted and turned over to the government.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=323–326}}

The Árbenz government also pursued diplomatic means to try and end the invasion. It sought support from El Salvador and Mexico; Mexico declined to get involved, and the Salvadoran government merely reported the Guatemalan effort to Peurifoy. Árbenz's largest diplomatic initiative was in taking the issue to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. On 18 June the Guatemalan foreign minister petitioned the Council to "take measures necessary&amp;nbsp;... to put a stop to the aggression", which he said Nicaragua and Honduras were responsible for, along with "certain foreign monopolies which have been affected by the progressive policy of my government".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=326–329}} The Security Council looked at Guatemala's complaint at an emergency session on 20 June. The debate was lengthy and heated, with Nicaragua and Honduras denying any wrongdoing, and the U.S. stating that Eisenhower's role as a general in World War II demonstrated that he was against imperialism. The [[Soviet Union]] was the only country to support Guatemala. When the U.S. and its allies proposed referring the matter to the Organization of American States, the Soviet Union [[United Nations Security Council veto power|vetoed]] the proposal. Guatemala continued to press for a Security Council investigation; the proposal received the support of Britain and France, but on 24 June it was vetoed by the U.S., the first time it did so against its allies. The U.S. accompanied this with threats to the foreign offices of both countries that the U.S. would stop supporting their other initiatives.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=169–172}} UN Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] called the U.S. position "the most serious blow so far aimed at the [United Nations]".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=331}} A fact-finding mission was set up by the [[Inter-American Peace Committee]]; Washington used its influence to delay the entry of the committee until the coup was complete and a military dictatorship installed.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=169–172}}

===Árbenz's resignation===
Árbenz was initially confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory of a small garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180 strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. By 21 June, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa under the command of Colonel Víctor M. León, who was believed to be loyal to Árbenz. León told Árbenz that the counter-attack would be delayed for logistical reasons, but assured him not to worry, as Castillo Armas would be defeated very soon. Other members of the government were not so certain. Army Chief of Staff Parinello inspected the troops at Zacapa on 23 June, and returned to the capital believing that the army would not fight. Afraid of a U.S. intervention in Castillo Armas' favor, he did not tell Árbenz of his suspicions.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=326–329}} PGT leaders also began to have their suspicions; acting secretary general [[Bernardo Alvarado Monzón|Alvarado Monzón]] sent a member of the central committee to Zacapa to investigate. He returned on 25 June, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. Monzón reported this to Árbenz, who quickly sent another investigator. He too returned the same report, carrying an additional message for Árbenz from the officers at Zacapa—asking the President to resign. The officers believed that given U.S. support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Árbenz was to blame for it. He stated that if Árbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas, and march on the capital with him.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=330–335}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=97}}

During this period, Castillo Armas had begun to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited material success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=98–100}} On 25 June, the same day that he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at [[Chiquimula]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=330–335}} Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that if it were not for U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=330–335}}

On the night of 25 June, Árbenz called a meeting of the senior leaders of the government, the political parties, and the labor unions. Colonel Díaz was also present. The President told them that the army at Zacapa had abandoned the government, and that the civilian population needed to be armed in order to defend the country. Díaz raised no objections, and the unions pledged several thousand troops between them. When the troops were mustered the next day, only a few hundred showed up. The civilian population of the capital had fought alongside the Guatemalan Revolution twice before—during the [[Guatemalan Revolution#October revolution|popular uprising of 1944]], and again during the [[Guatemalan Revolution#1949 coup attempt|attempted coup of 1949]]—but on this occasion the army, intimidated by the United States, refused to fight. The union members were reluctant to fight both the invasion and their own military.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=342–345}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=100–101}} Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the President, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed without demur. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8&amp;nbsp;pm on 27 June 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning in order to eliminate the "pretext for the invasion", and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution of 1944.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=345–349}} He walked to the nearby [[List of diplomatic missions of Mexico|Mexican Embassy]], seeking political asylum.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=201}} Two months later he was granted safe passage out of the country, and flew to exile in Mexico.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=390}} Some 120 Árbenz loyalists or communists were also allowed to leave, and none of the assassination plans contemplated by the CIA were actually implemented.{{sfn|Haines|1995|pp=8–9}}

===Military governments===
Immediately after the President announced his resignation, Díaz announced on the radio that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue to fight against the invasion of Castillo Armas.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=102–105}}{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=92}} He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels [[Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre]] and [[Jose Angel Sánchez]].{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=92}}{{sfn|McCleary|1999|p=237}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=174}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told Díaz that he had to resign because, in the words of a CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, he was "not convenient for American foreign policy".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=206}} Peurifoy castigated Díaz for allowing Árbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army's main powder magazine, in order to intimidate the colonel.{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=92}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=175}} Soon after, Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel Monzón, who was more pliable to U.S. interests.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=207–208}} On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, the ''Pacto de Las Tunas'', three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas, in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, "despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}}

Although Monzón was staunchly anti-communist and repeatedly spoke of his loyalty to the U.S., he was unwilling to hand over power to Castillo Armas. The fall of Díaz had led Peurifoy to believe that the CIA should make way and let the State Department play the lead role in negotiating with the new government of Guatemala.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=102}} The State Department asked [[Óscar Osorio]], the dictator of El Salvador, to invite all players for talks in [[San Salvador]]. Osorio agreed, and Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30 June.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} Peurifoy initially remained in Guatemala City, to avoid the appearance of a heavy U.S. role, but he was forced to travel to San Salvador when the negotiations came close to breaking down on the first day.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=212–215}} In the words of John Dulles, Peurifoy's role was to "crack some heads together".{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=212–215}} Neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas could have remained in power without U.S. support, and thus Peurifoy was able to force an agreement, which was announced at 4:45&amp;nbsp;am on 2 July. Under the agreement, Castillo Armas and his subordinate Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva joined the three-person junta headed by Monzón, who remained president.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}}{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=93}} On 7 July Colonels Dubois and Cruz Salazar, Monzón's supporters on the junta, resigned, according to the secret agreement they had made without Monzón's knowledge. Outnumbered, Monzón also resigned, allowing Castillo Armas to be unanimously elected president of the junta.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} The two colonels were paid 100,000 U.S. dollars apiece for their cooperation.{{efn|{{Inflation|US|100000|1954|fmt=eq|r=-4}}}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} The U.S. promptly recognized the new government on 13 July.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=216}} Soon after taking office as President, Castillo Armas faced a coup from young army cadets, who were unhappy with the army's surrender to him. The coup was crushed, leaving 29 dead and 91 wounded.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|p=42}} Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=224–225}}

===Reactions===
The Guatemalan ''coup d'état'' was reviled internationally. ''[[Le Monde]]'' of Paris and ''[[The Times]]'' of London attacked the United States' coup as a "modern form of [[economic colonialism]]".{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}} In Latin America, public and official opinion was sharply critical of the U.S., and for many Guatemala became a symbol of armed resistance to U.S. hegemony.{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}} Former British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] called it "a plain act of aggression".{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=217}} When Allen Dulles described the coup as a victory of "democracy" over communism and claimed that the situation in Guatemala was "being cured by the Guatemalans themselves", a British official remarked that "in places, it might almost be [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] speaking about&amp;nbsp;... Czechoslovakia or Hitler speaking about [[Austria]]".{{sfn|Young|1986|p=584}} UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld said that the paramilitary invasion with which the U.S. deposed Guatemala's elected government was a geopolitical action that violated the human rights stipulations of the [[United Nations Charter]].{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}} Even the usually pro–U.S. newspapers of [[West Germany]] condemned the coup.{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}} [[Kate Doyle]], the Director of the Mexico Project of the [[National Security Archives]], described the coup as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.{{sfn|Kornbluh|1997}}

The coup had broad support among U.S. politicians. Historian Piero Gleijeses writes that the foreign policy of both Republican and Democratic parties expressed an intransigent assertion of U.S. hegemony over Central America, making them predisposed to seeing communist threats where none existed. Thus Eisenhower's continuation of the Monroe Doctrine had continued [[Bipartisanship#In U.S. politics|bipartisan]] support.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=361–370}} The coup met with strong negative reactions in Latin America; a wave of anti-United States protests followed the overthrow of Árbenz. These sentiments persisted for several decades afterwards; historians have pointed to the coup as a reason for the hostile reception given to U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] when he visited Latin America four years later.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=371}} A State Department study found that negative public reactions to the coup had occurred in eleven Latin American countries, including a few that were otherwise pro-American.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=189}} Historian [[John Lewis Gaddis]] states that knowledge of the CIA's role in coups in Iran and Guatemala gave the agency "an almost mythic reputation throughout Latin America and the Middle East as an instrument with which the United States could depose governments it disliked, whenever it wished to do so".{{sfn|Gaddis|2006|p=166}}

==Aftermath==
===Operation PBHISTORY===
{{Main article|Operation PBHistory}}
[[File:Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (logo).svg|thumb|upright|The logo of the PGT, whose offices were searched during Operation PBHISTORY in the hope that they would yield incriminating documents]]

Operation PBHISTORY was an effort by the CIA to analyze documents from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been under the influence of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=300}} Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}} A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=302–303}} The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=302–305}}

Although the initial search failed to find any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many government departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=305}} To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding the creation of a Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the [[National Committee of Defense Against Communism]] (''Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo'') was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=306}} The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=308}} A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist [[Che Guevara|Ernesto Che Guevara]].{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}}

In the subsequent decade, the documents gathered were used by the authors of several books, most frequently with covert CIA assistance, which described the Guatemalan Revolution and the 1954 coup in terms favorable to the CIA.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=318–320}} Despite the efforts of the CIA, both international and academic reaction to U.S. policy remained highly negative. Even books partially funded by the CIA were somewhat critical of its role.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=321–324}} PBHISTORY failed in its chief objective of finding convincing evidence that the PGT had been instruments of the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=321–324}} or even that it had any connection to Moscow whatsoever.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=185}} The Soviet description of the coup, that the U.S. had crushed a democratic revolution to protect the United Fruit Company's control over the Guatemalan economy, became much more widely accepted.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=322}} Historian Mark Hove stated that "Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of 'a new, smoldering resentment' that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala."{{sfn|Hove|2007|p=40}}

===Political legacy===
The 1954 coup had a large political fallout both inside and outside Guatemala. The relatively easy overthrow of Árbenz, coming soon after the similar [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister]] in 1953, made the CIA overconfident in its abilities, which led to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] to overthrow the Cuban government in 1961.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=370–377}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=189–190}} Among the civilians living in Guatemala City during the coup was a 25-year-old Ernesto Che Guevara. After a couple of abortive attempts to fight on the side of the government, Guevara took shelter at the embassy of [[Argentina]], before eventually being granted safe passage to Mexico, where he would join the [[Cuban Revolution]]. His experience of the Guatemalan coup was a large factor in convincing him "of the necessity for armed struggle&amp;nbsp;... against imperialism", and would inform his successful military strategy during the Cuban Revolution.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=184–185}} Árbenz's experience during the Guatemalan coup also helped Fidel Castro's Cuban regime in thwarting the CIA invasion.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=194–195}} Throughout the years of the Guatemalan Revolution, both United States policy makers and the U.S. media had tended to believe the theory of a communist threat. When Árbenz had announced that he had evidence of U.S. complicity in the Salamá incident, it had been dismissed, and virtually the entire U.S. press portrayed Castillo Armas' invasion as a dramatic victory against communism.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=366–370}} The press in Latin America were less restrained in their criticism of the U.S., and the coup resulted in lasting anti-United States sentiment in the region.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=370–371}}{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=112}}

Within Guatemala, Castillo Armas worried that he lacked popular support, and thus tried to eliminate all opposition. He promptly arrested several thousand opposition leaders, branding them communists, repealed the constitution of 1945, and granted himself virtually unbridled power.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=198–201}} Concentration camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails overflowed. Acting on the advice of Allen Dulles, Castillo Armas detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created the National Committee of Defense Against Communism, with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or "[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]", frequently without trial.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=198–201}} He outlawed all labor unions, peasant organizations, and political parties,{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=113}} except for his own, the [[National Liberation Movement (Guatemala)|National Liberation Movement]] (''Movimiento de Liberación Nacional'', MLN), which was the ruling party until 1957,{{sfn|Grandin|2004|p=86}} and remained influential for decades after.{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=93}} Castillo Armas' dependence on the officer corps and the mercenaries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption, and the Eisenhower administration was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many millions of U.S. dollars.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=114–115}} Castillo Armas also reversed the agrarian reforms of Árbenz, leading the U.S. embassy to comment that it was a "long step backwards" from the previous policy.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=382}} The UFC did not profit from the coup; although it regained most of its privileges, its profits continued to decline, and it was eventually merged with another company to save itself from bankruptcy.{{sfn|Cullather|2006|pp=118–119}} Despite the influence which some of the local Catholic Church leaders had in the coup, [[Anti-Catholicism#In primarily Catholic countries|anti-Catholic]] restrictions which had been enforced under previous governments in Guatemala would resume by the 1960s, as many anti-communist governments felt the Church had too much sympathy towards socialist parties.{{sfn|Pew|2006}}

===Civil War===
{{Further information|Guatemalan Civil War}}
[[File:Ex General Efrain Rios Montt testifying during the trial.jpg|thumb|[[Efraín Ríos Montt]], President of Guatemala during some of the most violent years of the civil war]]

The rolling-back of the progressive policies of the civilian governments resulted in a series of leftist insurgencies in the countryside, beginning in 1960. This triggered the 36-year [[Guatemalan Civil War]] between the U.S.-backed military government of Guatemala and the leftist insurgents, who frequently had a large degree of popular support. The largest of these movements was led by the [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor]], which at its largest point had 270,000 members.{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}} During the civil war, atrocities against civilians were committed by both sides; 93% of these violations were committed by the U.S.-backed military,{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}}{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2013|p=216}}{{sfn|Harbury|2005|p=35}} which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous [[Maya people|Maya population]] in the 1980s.{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}}{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|p=90}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} The violence was particularly severe during the presidencies of [[Efraín Ríos Montt|Ríos Montt]] and [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Lucas García]].{{sfn|May|1999|pp=68–91}}

Numerous other human rights violations were committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape,{{sfn|Bartrop|Jacobs|2015|p=963}} aerial bombardment, and [[Forced disappearance#Guatemala|forced disappearances]].{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}} Gleijeses wrote that Guatemala was "ruled by a culture of fear", and that it held the "macabre record for human rights violations in Latin America".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=383}} These violations were partially the result of a particularly brutal [[counter-insurgency]] strategy adopted by the government.{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}}{{sfn|May|1999|pp=68–91}} The ideological narrative that the 1954 coup had represented a battle against communism was often used to justify the violence in the 1980s.{{sfn|Castañeda|2005|pp=89–92}} Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup, and the "anti-communist paranoia" that it generated.{{sfn|Figueroa Ibarra|1990|p=113}} The civil war came to an end in 1996, with a peace accord between the guerrillas and the government of Guatemala, which included an amnesty for the fighters on both sides.{{sfn|May|1999|pp=68–91}} The civil war claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 civilians in all.{{sfn|McAllister|2010|pp=276–281}}{{efn|The figure of 200,000 is not universally accepted; historian Carlos Sabina argues for a much lower total of 37,000 civil war deaths, while a 2008 study in ''[[The BMJ]]'' gave an estimate of 20,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Diane M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Na_SCgAAQBAJ|title=Who Counts?: The Mathematics of Death and Life after Genocide|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780822375074|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obermeyer|first1=Ziad|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher J.

===Apologies===
In March 1999, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] apologized to the Guatemalan government for the atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed dictatorships.{{sfn|Broder|1999}} Clinton stated "For the United States it is important that I state clearly that support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake."{{sfn|Broder|1999}} The apology came soon after the release of a truth commission report that documented U.S. support for the military forces that committed genocide.{{sfn|Broder|1999}}

In May 2011 the Guatemalan government signed an agreement with Árbenz's surviving family to restore his legacy and publicly apologize for the government's role in ousting him. This included a financial settlement to the family. The formal apology was made at the National Palace by Guatemalan President [[Álvaro Colom]] on 20 October 2011, to Jacobo Árbenz Villanova, the son of the former president, and a Guatemalan politician.{{sfn|Malkin|2011}} Colom stated, "It was a crime to Guatemalan society and it was an act of aggression to a government starting its democratic spring."{{sfn|Malkin|2011}} The agreement established several forms of reparation for the next of kin of Árbenz Guzmán.{{sfn|Malkin|2011}}

{{Centurybox|9}}
The '''9th century''' was a period from [[801]] to [[900]] in accordance with the [[Julian calendar]] in the [[Common Era]].

==West Africa==

===Southeastern Nigeria===
{{details|Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu}}
Around the 9th century the [[Edo people]] of what is now southeastern [[Nigeria]] developed bronze casts of humans, animals, and mythical creatures. These bronzes, which were used as vessels, amulets, pendants, and sacrificial tools, are among the earliest made bronzes ever found in Nigeria. Most items were part of a burial of a nobleman culture in the northern part of [[benin empire]]. Evidence of long distance trade between benin empire and poutugist was also discovered through the thousands of glass beads found at Old Cairo at the workshops of Fustat.

The development of the [[Benin Kingdom]] can be attributed to the proficiency at advanced metallurgy seen in the bronze jewelry crafted by local artisans.

===Ghana Empire===
{{details|Ghana Empire}}
The [[Ghana (Wagadu) Empire]] (before c. 830 until c. 1235) was located in what is now southeastern [[Mauritania]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and western [[Mali]]. It is considered the first of the [[Sahelian Kingdoms]], which would exist in some form until the early 20th century.

==Western Europe==

=== Britain and Ireland ===
[[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] experienced a great influx of [[Viking]] peoples in the 9th century as the [[Viking Age]] continued from the previous century. The kingdoms of the [[Heptarchy]] were gradually conquered by the Danes, who set up Anglo-Saxon puppet rulers in each kingdom. This invasion was achieved by a huge military force known as the [[Great Heathen Army]], which was supposedly led by [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], and [[Guthrum]]. This Danish army first arrived in Britain in [[865]] in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. After conquering that kingdom, the army proceeded to capture the city of [[York]] ([[Jorvik]]) and establish the kingdom of [[Jorvik]]. The Danes went on to subjugate the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and to take all but the western portion of [[Mercia]]. The remaining kingdom of [[Wessex]] was the only kingdom of the [[Heptarchy]] left. [[Alfred the Great]] managed to maintain his kingdom of [[Wessex]] and push back the Viking incursions, relieving the neighbouring kingdoms from the threat of the Danes following his famous victory over them at the [[Battle of Ethandun]] in [[878]]. Alfred re-established [[Anglo-Saxon]] rule over the western half of [[Mercia]], and the [[Danelaw]] was established which separated [[Mercia]] into halves, the eastern half remaining under the control of the Danes.

[[Ireland]] was also affected by the Viking expansion across the [[North Sea]]. Extensive raids were carried out all along the coast and eventually permanent settlements were established, such as that of [[Dublin]] in [[841]]. Particular targets for these raids were the monasteries on the western coast of Ireland, as they provided a rich source for loot. On such raids the [[Vikings]] set up impermanent camps, which were called [[longphorts]] by the Irish—this period of Viking raids on the coasts of Ireland has been named the longphort phase after these types of settlements. Ireland in the 9th century was organised into an amalgam of small kingdoms, called [[tuatha]]. These kingdoms were sometimes grouped together and ruled by a single, provincial ruler. If such a ruler could establish and maintain authority over a portion of these tuatha, he was sometimes granted the title of [[High King of Ireland|High King]].

[[Scotland]] also experienced significant Viking incursions during the 9th century. The Vikings established themselves in coastal regions, usually in northern Scotland, and in the northern islands such as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. The Viking invasion and settlement in Scotland provided a contributing factor in the collapse of the kingdoms of the [[Picts]], who inhabited most of Scotland at the time. Not only were the Pictish realms either destroyed or severely weakened, the Viking invasion and settlement may have been the reason for the movement of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]], the king of [[Dál Riata]] at that time. The kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] was located on the western coast of Scotland, and Viking incursions destroyed it after the death of its previous king, [[Áed mac Boanta]] in 839, according to the [[Annals of Ulster]].  This may have caused the new king, MacAlpin, to move to the east, and conquer the remnants of the Pictish realms. MacAlpin became king of the Picts in 843 and later kings would be titled as the [[King of Alba]] or [[King of Scots]].

=== Art of the 9th century ===
*Art in the 9th century was primarily dedicated to the Gospel and employed as basic tools of liturgy of the Roman Orthodox Church. Thousands of golden art objects were made: Sacred cups, vessels, reliquaries, crucifixes, rosaries, altar pieces, and statues of the Virgin and Child or Saints all kept the flame of western art from dying out. Architecture began to revive to some extent by the 9th century, taking the form of Church facilities of all kinds, and the first castle fortifications since Roman times began to take form in simple "moat and bailey" castles, or simple "strong point" tower structures, with little refinement.
*9th - [[13th century]] - [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]], [[Yucatan]], Mexico, is built. Itza (northern Maya) culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10369">The '''active intellect''' ([[Latin]]: ''intellectus agens''; also translated as '''agent intellect''', '''active intelligence''', '''active reason''', or '''productive intellect''') is a concept in classical and medieval [[philosophy]]. The term refers to the [[Substantial form|formal]] (''morphe'') aspect of the intellect (''[[nous]]''), in accordance with the theory of [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|hylomorphism]]. 

The nature of the active intellect was the subject of intense discussion in medieval philosophy, as various Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers sought to reconcile their commitment to Aristotle's account of the body and soul to their own theological commitments. At stake in particular was in what way Aristotle's account of an incorporeal soul might contribute to understanding of the nature of eternal life.

== Aristotle's conception ==
The idea is first encountered in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages (''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25) by Joe Sachs, with some notes about the Greek:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Joe |last=Sachs |title=Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection|year=2001|publisher=Green Lion Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material ([[matter|''hulē'']]) for each kind ''([[genos]])'' (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul (''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]'') too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect (''[[nous]]'') by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition (''[[hexis]]'') like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors (''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] (''epistēmē''), in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says that the [[passive intellect]] receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors. 

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle also discusses the human mind and distinguishes between the active and [[passive intellect|passive]] intellects. In that passage Aristotle appears to equate the active intellect with the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2017}}

==Interpretations==
Sachs comments that the nature of the active intellect was "the source of a massive amount of commentary and of fierce disagreement"; elsewhere, chapter 5 of ''De Anima'' has been referred to as "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; As Davidson remarks: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Greek'''

The early Greek commentators on Aristotle, in particular [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Themistius]], gave several different interpretations of the distinction between the active and passive intellects. Some of them regarded the active intellect as a power external to the human mind, Alexander going so far as to identify it with God. 

Later, both these interpretations, [[Neoplatonist]] ones, and perhaps others, influenced the development of an important Arabic language philosophical literature, using the term ''[['aql]]'' as the translation for ''nous''. This literature was later translated into, and commented upon, in Latin and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish and Islamic'''

[[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], and also the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], agreed with the "external" interpretation of active intellect, and held that the active intellect was the lowest of the ten emanations descending through the [[celestial spheres]]. Maimonides cited it in his definition of [[prophecy]] where 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by the [[God|Divine Being]] through the medium of the Active Intellect, in the first instance to man's [[Reason|rational faculty]], and then to his [[Imagination|imaginative faculty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, [[Guide for the Perplexed]] (translator: [[Michael Friedländer]]), Dover: New York, 1904, [http://www.meru.org/Advisors/Sunwall/RambamProphecy.html p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The more strictly Aristotelian Muslims (in particular [[Avempace]] and [[Averroes]]) wrote about how one could conjoin oneself with the active intellect, thus attaining philosophical nirvana.  

The reason of the Islamic and Jewish Aristotelians for positing a single external Agent Intellect is that all (rational) human beings are considered by Aristotelians to possess or have access to a fixed and stable set of concepts, a unified correct knowledge of the universe.  The only way that all human minds could possess the same correct knowledge is if they all had access to some central knowledge store, as terminals might have access to a mainframe computer {{Harv|Kraemer|2003}}. This mainframe is the Agent Intellect, the "mind" of the universe, which makes all other cognition possible.

'''Western Christian'''

In medieval and Renaissance Europe some thinkers, such as [[Siger of Brabant]], adopted the interpretation of Averroes on every point, as did the later school of "Paduan Averroists". [[Thomas Aquinas]] elaborated on Aristotle's distinction between the active intellect and passive intellect in his ''Disputed Questions on the Soul'' and his commentary on Aristotle's ''De anima'', arguing, against Averroes, that the active intellect is part of the individual human personality. A third school, of "Alexandrists", rejected the argument linking the active intellect to the [[immortality]] of the soul, while hastening to add that they still believed in immortality as a matter of religious faith. (See [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]; [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]].)

The active intellect, in the sense described, is more properly called the Agent Intellect, as it is the force triggering intellection in the human mind and causing thoughts to pass from the potential to the actual. It must not be confused with the "intellect in act", which is the result of that triggering, and is more akin to the psychological term "active knowledge".  Another term for the final result of intellection, that is to say a person's accumulated knowledge, is the "acquired intellect".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2178">'''The American Society of Genealogists''' is the scholarly honorary society of the [[genealogy|genealogical]] field. Founded by John Insley Coddington, Arthur Adams, and Meredith B. Colket, Jr., in December 1940, its membership is limited to 50 living fellows. ASG publishes ''[[The Genealogist]]'', a scholarly journal of genealogical research semi-annually since 1980.

In a time when genealogy was frequently viewed as the realm of eccentric dilettantes, the founders of ASG were leaders advocating more rigorous research standards. This included using original sources whenever possible and documenting the source of information. [[Donald Lines Jacobus]], founder of ''[[The American Genealogist]]'', noted in 1960 that a new school had developed in American genealogy circles about 1930. That movement, according to the late [[Milton Rubincam]], "wrote accounts of specific families, documented and referenced: they showed by example how problems should be solved, what sources should be used, and how records should be interpreted."&lt;ref&gt;Milton Rubincam, "Introduction," in Donald Lines Jacobus, ''Genealogy as Pastine and Profession'' 2nd ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1999), pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellows of the American Society of Genealogists, who bear the postnominal acronym [[FASG]], have written some of the most notable genealogical materials of the last half-century. In particular, current Fellow [[Robert Charles Anderson]] is director of ''The Great Migration Study Project'', an effort to catalogue the earliest [[Europe]]an immigrants to [[New England]]. John Frederick Dorman, currently the senior fellow, recently (2007) completed the fourth edition of ''Adventurers of Purse and Person'', chronicling the earliest settlers in colonial [[Virginia]].

The '''Association of Young Legal Historians (AYLH)''' was founded by 56 young legal historians from over 20 nations in [[Seville]] on 8 September 2007. Its main purposes are the organisation of the annual conference "European Forum of Young Legal Historians", the publication of the "Yearbook of Young Legal History" and the facilitation of communication within the [[scientific community]] between the annual conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Tilmann J. Röder, Crossing Academic Cultures. Report to H.Law, 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.mpil.de/shared/data/pdf/roeder_aylh_2007_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611184238/http://www.mpil.de/shared/data/pdf/roeder_aylh_2007_report.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "European Forum of Young Legal Historians" had grown into the leading conference for up-and-coming legal historians. Its origins were two international meetings in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the early 1990s. The 1999 [[Zürich]] meeting marked the break-through towards a truly European event. More than a hundred participants from Europe and beyond came together to attend presentations in the German, English, French and Italian languages. Since then, young researchers from countries which had not been reached before visited the conference in increasing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kaius Tuori, Get a haircut and get a real job! In: Rechtsgeschichte (Rg) 9 (2006), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "young" legal historians is understood in a broad sense. The "European Forum of Young Legal Historians" is primarily designed to give all those a chance to present the results of their studies who would not otherwise have the opportunity to do so. As the academic hierarchicies tend to affect the free expression of younger researchers, professors holding a chair in [[legal history]] are, as a general rule, excluded from participation to the conference. Similarly, professors and organisations who wish to support the objectives of the society may not vote in the general assembly of the AYLH.

Another special feature of the AYLH is the avoiding of any competing for positions within the association. The executive committee simply consists of the organizers of the last, and the next Fora.

'''Bolanle Awe''' (born 26 January 1933) is a [[Nigeria]]n history professor.

==Life==
Awe was born in [[Nigeria]] on 28 January 1933. She attended Holy Trinity School, Imofe-[[Ilesha]], St James Primary School, Okebola, [[Ibadan]], and St Anne's School, Ibadan.&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite news |last=Olujimi |first=Toluwanimi |date=2006-05-01 |title=Nigeria: Founding Fathers Laid Foundation for Under-Development |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200605010687.html  |dead-url=no |newspaper=Vanguard |location=Allfrica.com |archive-url=|archive-date= |access-date=2016-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She took her A-levels at the [[Perse School]] in Cambridge. She went to [[St Andrews University]] in Scotland where she obtained a masters in history, before taking a doctorate in history at [[Oxford University]]. Awe then returned to Nigeria, where she became a lecturer at the [[University of Ibadan]].

She rose to be a professor at the same university.&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://www.mynewswatchtimesng.com/bolanle-awe-quintessential-teacher-historian/ Bolanle Awe - A Quintessential teacher, historian], 2014, MyNewsWatchTimesNG.com, Retrieved 15 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the historians who allowed their evidence to include [[oral tradition]]s. This meant that she was able to trace back histories before the arrival of Europeans. She was also active in identifying how the role of women in history was being overlooked and she co-founded the Women's Research and Documentation Centre (WORDOC) to promote the coordination of women's studies research and new methodologies to study Nigerian women.&lt;ref&gt;Awe, B., &amp; Mba, N. (1991). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174578 "Women's Research and Documentation Center (Nigeria)". ''Signs'', 16(4), 859–864.

On Christmas Day 1960 she married Olumuyiwa Awe. He would also become a professor and they would have children. Her husband died in 2015 at the age of 82.&lt;ref name=news/&gt;&lt;ref name=hubby&gt;[http://theanchoronline.com.ng/renowned-physics-professor-olumuyiwa-awe-passes-on-at-82/ "Oluwole Awolowo finally laid to rest today at Ikenne-Remo, Ogun state"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331082224/http://theanchoronline.com.ng/renowned-physics-professor-olumuyiwa-awe-passes-on-at-82/# |date=2016-03-31 }}, AnchorOnline.

'''Building restoration''' describes a particular treatment approach and philosophy within the field of [[architectural conservation]].

According to the U.S. ''Secretary of Interior's standards'', "Restoration is said as the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10|df=}} Updated 12/113/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States restoration is different from preservation (American English, ''conservation'' in British English) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.

==Overview==
[[File:Valletta Großmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]
In the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)

Since Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.

Exterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.

In the United States, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] is the head of the [[National Park Service]] which owns and maintains thousands of historic buildings and has been a leader in historic preservation for over 100 years. The standards were developed in 1975 and updated in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David E.. ''Guidelines for the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards in housing''. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1995. 18-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards deal with the "...materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122165718/http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |archivedate=2013-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of historic buildings and are divided into preservation, rehabilitating, restoration and reconstruction. It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:
* '''Preservation''' "places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair." All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.
* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.
* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.
* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.

The first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to "...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials." which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.

==Storm Restoration==

Storm restoration is the restoring of a building due to damage from a severe storm. Most damage is caused by strong wind gusts or hail, but may also include large amounts of rainfall, lightning strikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored chapel|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110733/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|archivedate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as extreme storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes. The majority of storm damage occurs on roofs, sides of structures, and in basements, but over time causes damage to the interior. Unlike heritage restoration, storm restoration takes place on buildings with no historic significance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uasrc.org/|title=United Association of Storm Restoration Contractors|first=Jacob|last=Sachs|website=uasrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dionysius Exiguus''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Dionysius the Humble"{{efn|Sometimes rendered in [[English language|English]] as ''Dennis the Small'', ''the Dwarf'', ''the Little'', or ''the Short'', referring to his [[humility]].}}; {{circa|[[AD]] 470}} – {{circa|lk=no|AD 544}}) was a 6th-century monk born in [[Scythia Minor]] (probably modern [[Dobruja]], in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]). He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constanța|Tomis]], the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Some churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].

From about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continues to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.

The author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a "most learned abbot of the city of Rome", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.

==Origins==
According to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a "[[Scythian]]", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).&lt;ref&gt;''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as "[[Scythians|Scythian]]" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].&lt;ref name=Amory&gt;Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489–554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term "Scythian" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a wide-encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|127}} Even for the "Scythian monk" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are "Scythian" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a "[[Gallia|Gaul]]".&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|127}}

The dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as "Goths".&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term "Scytha"; he is presented as commanding "Hunnic", "Gothic", "Scythian", "[[Bessi]]an" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Dacians|Dacian]]-[[Getae|Getic]] (Thracian) stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).&lt;ref name=Amory/&gt;{{rp|130–131}}

==Works and translations==
Dionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the "Life of St. Pachomius", the "Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople" for the Armenians, the "De opificio hominis" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.

Of great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:

:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:
::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesiæ Universæ''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four œcumenical councils from Nicæa (325) to Chalcedon (451).
::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called "Canons of the Apostles" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).
::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of Pope [[Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.

:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384–498).

==Anno Domini==
Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which he also stated was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one "Victorian cycle" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.

Evidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the [[Old Testament]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Easter tables==
In 525, Dionysius prepared a table of the future dates of [[Easter]] and a set of "arguments" explaining their calculation ([[computus]]). This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian tables gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, the tables had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 1999, 793–794.&lt;/ref&gt; Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius – arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before Bede. Dionysius also introduced his tables and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  

Dionysius ignored the existing tables used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which were prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that they did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own tables were correct, he simply extended a set of tables prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but were never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, they were used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin tables were prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. They covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&amp;ndash;19).}}

Ultimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532–626 to the years 532–721,&lt;ref&gt;G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.&lt;/ref&gt; must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.&lt;/ref&gt; where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,&lt;ref&gt;L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]’s lunar limits 16–22 were gradually replaced with Dionysius’ lunar limits 15–21; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.

The Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the "day of the [planetary] gods" and in the west the "concurrent". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.&lt;ref&gt;L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The epact, since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years, making Dionysius the first known medieval Latin writer to use a precursor of the [[0 (number)|number zero]]. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nihil'', also meaning ''nothing''. Both "zeros" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus’ Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].

Dionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact.

Most of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. The Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.

Ever since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch – [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&amp;nbsp;1 and 1&amp;nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&amp;nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years "since the Incarnation" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&amp;nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&amp;nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.&lt;/ref&gt; deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.&lt;/ref&gt; Having read Suslyga's work,&lt;ref&gt;Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W. Burke-Gaffney.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] noted that Christ was born during the reign of King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]–[[Matthew 2:18|18]]), whose death he placed in 4&amp;nbsp;BC. Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.&lt;ref name="j"&gt;John P. Pratt, [http://www.johnpratt.com/items/docs/herod/herod.html “Yet another eclipse for Herod”] originally published in ''The Planetarian'', vol. 19, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 8–14.   “Josephus ... not always clear and ... sometimes inconsistent ... states that Herod captured Jerusalem and began to reign in what we would call 37&amp;nbsp;B.C., and lived for 34 years thereafter, implying his death was in 4–3&amp;nbsp;B.C.”  “Of the candidates to be Herod's eclipse, the December 29, 1&amp;nbsp;B.C. eclipse was the most likely to have been widely observed.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, Herod died in the year 4 or 3&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="j" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herod died 34 years after the death of Antigonus and 37 years after Herod was made king by the Romans ([http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=560 ''Ant. Jews'' 17.8.1]). Antigonus died when Marcus Agrippa and Caninius Gallus were consuls (37 BC) ([http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=480 ''Ant. Jews'' 14.16.4]). Herod was made king when Caius Domitias Calvinus and Caius Asinius Pollio were consuls (40 BC) ([http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=472 ''Ant. Jews'' 14.14.5]). Both 37&amp;nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&amp;nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&amp;nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon – the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;                  

Dionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]]. Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.

'''Emma Baeri''' (born in [[Palermo]] on July 11, 1942) is a Sicilian feminist historian and essayist. She has played an active role in organizing feminist political action and literary life in Italy along with her academic career.

==Biography==
Emma Baeri was born the daughter of parents Ernesto Baeri, an electrical engineer, and Maria Parisi. During her childhood she lived in [[Agrigento]], a city she established a strong emotional relationship with, and [[Piazza Armerina]].&lt;ref name=enciclopedia /&gt; While still a girl, she moved to [[Catania]] with her family in 1951.

In 1960 she earned her high school diploma at the Mario Cutelli Classical Lyceum of Catania. In 1968 she graduated with a degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Catania]] with a thesis on the history of political doctrines on education reforms in [[Sicily]] in the second half of the eighteenth century. She was a researcher and instructor of [[modern history]] in the same faculty from 1972 to 2007.

==Professional political activity==
[[Feminism]] marked a watershed for her political, intellectual, and personal life. In December 1975 she began her political career in the feminist movement: in the "Woman Difference" collective (''Differenza Donna'') she became conscious of her self; later, she practiced "inside-outside" politics—within the group and in public policy struggles by the Coordination for Women's Self-Determination of Catania in defense of [[Abortion in Italy|Law 194]]'s abortion rights, for a [[women's shelter]], against [[sexual violence]], for [[unilateral disarmament]] when American missiles were placed in [[Comiso]], and then, in the Friday Group, she found a strong political relationship that lasted more than twenty years. Lately, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, she has participated in the Voltapagina (Page Turners) literary café group.

In 1986, at the conclusion of that revolutionary decade, Emma Baeri launched a close-quarter body-to-body encounter between her woman-body and the corpus of [[historiography]]. In 1992 this labor gave birth to ''I Lumi e il cerchio. Una esercitazione di storia'' (The Lights and the Circle: An Exercise in History),&lt;ref&gt;Rome: Editori Riuniti, 1992; Soveria Mannelli: Rubbettino Editore, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a text that contaminated the genres—novel, autobiography, historical essay, poetry—entrusting their mutual stridency to the disruptive effect of the unforeseen subject—a woman, her biohistorical experience—in the discourse of historiography. A necessary contamination in the transformation of an orthodox history—engaged in research on the events of a canonical Enlightenment education reformer of eighteenth-century Sicily, Giovanni Agostino De Cosmi—in an unforeseen history, by the inability of the hereditary instruments of work to answer this question: Why are women, although present in history, absent from historiography? 
{{Quote|text=It quickly became clear to me that I must recover the memory of me to go forward, to untangle the thread of my history to find the meaning of history.... In fact, not only was my way of living, my profession transformed, in those years I myself was transformed, within a collective history, and my sense of history was radically adjusted. Time, memory, utopia, and identity were words with a new flavor, which I said, wrote, and loved as though for the first time (''I Lumi e il cerchio'', pp. 10-11).}}

In 1989 she was one of the founding members of the Società Italiana delle Storiche (Italian Society of Women Historians),&lt;ref&gt;official site [http://www.societadellestoriche.it/ Società Italiana delle Storiche]&lt;/ref&gt; of which she spent two terms in office as a director. In the Society she immediately went to work on the Education Commission, an experience out of which she curated the book ''Generazioni: Trasmissione della storia e tradizione delle donne'' (Generations: Transmission of women's history and tradition) from a seminar held by the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Turin: Rosemberg &amp; Sellier, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, 1995, and 2004 at the Women's History Summer School,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societadellestoriche.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=114 Scuola Estiva di Storia delle donne]&lt;/ref&gt; first organized by the Society at the [[Certosa di Pontignano|Carthusian monastery of Pontignano]] near [[Siena]], and later in [[Fiesole]]. She was a council member of the Unione Femminile Nazionale (National Women's Union)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionefemminile.it/ Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; and president and council member of the United Women's Archives of Milan.

Her writings appear in many feminist periodicals, such as ''[[Noi donne]]'', ''DWF: donnawomanfemme'', ''Lapis'', ''Nosside'', ''Il Paese delle Donne'', and they testify to her growing interest in the methodology of historical research, in the history of Italian feminism, with particular focus on curating the movement's archives and on the links between feminism and citizenship.

In 1997 Baeri participated with [[Annarita Buttafuoco]] in preparing the exhibit ''Riguardarsi'' ('looking out for yourself'), a traveling exhibit of manifestos from the women's political movement in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baeri|first1=Emma|authorlink1=Emma Baeri|title=L'introduzione di Emma Baeri al catalogo della mostra (Emma Baeri's introduction to the exhibit catalog)|url=http://www.storiadelledonne.it/?page_id=261|website=Storia delle Donne|publisher=Firenze University Press|accessdate=October 12, 2017|location=Florence|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this experience was born the book ''Riguardarsi: Manifesti del Movimento Politico delle Donne in Italia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Baeri|editor1-first=Emma|editor2-last=Buttafuoco|editor2-first=Annarita|editor1-link=Emma Baeri|title=Riguardarsi: Manifesti del Movimento Politico delle Donne in Italia: Anni '70–'90|trans-title=To Look Out for Yourself: Manifestos of the Political Women's Movement in Italy, 1970s–1990s|date=1997|publisher=Protagon|location=Arezzo|isbn=9788880240280|url=https://books.google.it/books/about/Riguardarsi.html?id=6CF5AAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in a limited, not-for-sale edition, she published ''Isola mobile: nipoti, gatti, scritti,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baeri|first1=Emma|title=Isola mobile: nipoti, gatti, scritti|date=2012|publisher=Giuseppe Maimone|location=Catania|isbn=9788877513533|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Isola_mobile.html?id=pMRinQAACAAJ|language=it|trans-title=Moving Island: Grandchildren, Cats, Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "bookish object," as the author calls it, that gathers scattered texts published and unpublished, fragments of memoir, poetic words, and photographs illustrating her three great passions: collages, patchworks, and cats.
 {{Quote|text=I would only like to leaf through these pages to feel the pulsing in my veins, energy of the earth, of [[Mount Etna|Etna]], of a woman who's a grandmother, a researcher of stories likely to be impostures... and with cats always around. (Baeri, ''Isola mobile'', p. 16)}}

In 2013 she published ''Dividua'', whose back cover reads: 
{{Quote|text=From two words—feminism and citizenship—apparently at least two centuries apart, is born a new word, "Dividual," the Other of the Individual,{{efn|"''Dividua, l'Altra dell'Individuo''"—literally '(female) Dividual, the (female) Other of the (male) Individual'}} from today and always subjects recognizable in their reciprocal difference, together for a new civil pact that is equal, different, diverse. So thinks Emma Baeri, a feminist from the beginning, a feminist historian, who in this book ties together her various writings from the late 1990s till today, with a cord that is also her vexation: the nexus, and the necessary friction, between emancipation and liberation, between rights and women's freedom. And she does it with an expressive freedom that means to point out even in its form the feminist angle: poetry and prose, story and diary tell of the emotional, cultural, and sociable contexts that have accompanied the birth of an etymologically transgressive thought, which has the presumption to take a further step, beyond the usual meaning of politics, history, and the inherited words that they still speak. At the end, an affectionately hazarded bet: she asks two young women with differing ideas of feminism, Elena Caruso Raciti and Antonia Cosentino Leone: "What do ''you'' think of ''this?''"
}}

==Personal life==
Baeri is married and has two daughters, Maria Carla and Paola; three grandchildren, Gabriele, Lorenzo, and Anna; and an extended feline family.

'''Francisco de Aguilar''' (1479 — 1571?), born '''Alonso de Aguilar''', was a Spanish [[conquistador]] who took part in the expedition led by [[Hernán Cortés]] that resulted in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[fall of Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec]] state in the [[Mexican Plateau|central Mexican plateau]].

He was granted an ''[[encomienda]]'' after the conquest, but in 1529, eight years after the fall of Tenochtitlan, he gave up his ''encomienda'' and entered the [[Dominican Order]], adopting the name ''Francisco''. Aguilar spent the remaining 40 years of his life as a Dominican friar. According to Patricia de Fuente, who translated his account to English, Aguilar "was contemplative by nature, and ... he brooded about the moral aspect of the Conquest."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia de Fuente, "Introduction to the Chronicle of Fray Francisco de Aguilar," in ''The Conquistadors'', Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1993, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his long life, in his early 80s, his fellow Dominicans urged him to write an account of the Aztec conquest drawing from his experiences. This account, known as ''[[Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'' ("Brief Record [Account] of the Conquest of New Spain"), went unpublished in his lifetime, however a [[manuscript]] copy of it was preserved at the [[Real Biblioteca de San Lorenzo de El Escorial|royal library of El Escorial]] outside of [[Madrid, Spain]]. It was first published in 1900 by the Mexican historian and archivist, [[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]]. A modern English translation of Aguilar's chronicle is published in ''The Conquistadors: First-Person Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico,''&lt;ref&gt; ''The Conquistadors,'' Patricia de Fuentes, editor and translator. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1993, pp. 134-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his elderly years, he was diagnosed with gout and he soon died in Mexico at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Gary B. 2003. ''Encyclopedia of American history''. New York: Facts on File. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georges Perrot''' (12 November 1832 &amp;ndash; June 30, 1914) was a French [[archaeologist]]. 

He taught at the [[Sorbonne]] from 1875 and was director of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1888 to 1902. In 1874 he was elected to the [[Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]], where he served as the permanent secretary from 1904 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/perrotg Perrot, Georges] Dictionary of Art Historians&lt;/ref&gt; 

His most famous archaeological discovery was made while on an expedition to [[Asia Minor]] in 1861 and 1862, where he found a [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the document known as 'The Political Testament of the Emperor Augustus'. Perrot edited and contributed to the journal ''[[Revue archéologique]]''. His works include ''Souvenirs d'un voyage en Asie mineur'' (1863) and the ten-volume ''Histoire de l'art dans l'antiquité'', which he wrote with [[Charles Chipiez]] (1882–1914).

The '''history of the [[German language]]''' as separate from common [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] begins in the [[Early Middle Ages]] with the [[High German consonant shift]]. [[Old High German]], [[Middle High German]] and [[Early New High German]] span the duration of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The 19th and 20th centuries saw the rise of [[Standard German]] and a decrease of dialectal variety.

The 20th century brought around the German catastrophe. After [[World War I]], the use of German was suppressed and discouraged due to the [[anti-German sentiment]], but nevertheless it did not inflict any lasting damage to its [[Sprachraum]] nor its ''[[lingua franca]]'' status in some areas. However, after [[World War II]], [[Potsdam Agreement|territorial changes implemented by the Allies]] practically removed the German language from large parts of Central and Eastern Europe that were inhabited by German-speaking populations beginning in the 12th century. It contributed to moribundness and extinction of some local dialects like [[Silesian German]], [[High Prussian]] or [[East Pomeranian]] dialects. Furthermore, it also damaged the language's status in Central-Western and Central-Southern Europe, where anti-German sentiment became even greater than before the war.

{{main|Old High German}}
The earliest testimonies of [[Old High German]] are from scattered [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, especially in [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], from the 6th century, the earliest glosses (''[[Abrogans]]'') date to the 8th and the oldest coherent texts (the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', the ''[[Muspilli]]'' and the [[Merseburg Incantations]]) to the 9th century.

===Middle High German===
{{main|Middle High German}}
Middle High German (MHG, German ''Mittelhochdeutsch'') is the term used for the period in the history of the [[German language]] between 1050 and 1350. It is preceded by [[Old High German]] and followed by [[Early New High German]]. In some older scholarship, the term covers a longer period, going up to 1500.

===Early New High German===
{{main|Early New High German}}

When [[Martin Luther]] translated the [[Bible]] (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534) he based his translation mainly on this already developed language, which was the most widely understood language at this time. This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern [[Central German]] dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper [[Germany]] that at that time had already begun to lose the [[genitive case]] and the [[preterite]]). In the beginning, copies of the Bible had a long list for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the [[Dialect|regional dialect]]. [[Roman Catholics]] rejected Luther's translation at first and tried to create their own Catholic standard (''gemeines Deutsch'') — which, however, differed from 'Protestant German' only in some minor details. It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a standard that was widely accepted, thus ending the period of [[Early New High German]].

==Low German==
[[Low German]], being at the crossroads between High German, [[Anglo-Frisian]], [[Low Franconian]] and the [[South Jutlandic]] dialect of Danish, has a less clear-cut linguistic history, epitomizing that the West Germanic group is really a [[dialect continuum]]. 

Low German was strongly influenced by Anglo-Frisian in Early Medieval times, and by High German during the duration of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. After the end of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the 17th century, Low German was marginalized to the status of local dialects.

===Old Saxon===
{{main|Old Saxon}}
'''Old Saxon''', also known as '''Old Low German''', is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language. It is documented from the 9th century until the 12th century, when it evolved into [[Middle Low German]]. It was spoken on the north-west coast of Germany and in [[Denmark]]  by [[Saxon people]]s. It is closely related to Old [[Anglo-Frisian]] ([[Old Frisian]], [[Old English]]),  partially participating in the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]].

===Middle Low German===
{{main|Middle Low German}}
The Middle Low German language is an ancestor of the modern [[Low German]]. It was spoken from about 1100 to 1500, splitting into [[West Low German]] and [[East Low German]]. The neighbour languages within the [[dialect continuum]] of the [[West Germanic languages]] were [[Middle Dutch]] in the West and [[Middle High German]] in the South, later substituted by [[Early New High German]]. Middle Low German was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]], spoken all around the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. Based on the language of [[Lübeck]], a standardized [[written language]] was developing, though it was never codified.

==19th century==
German was the language of commerce and government in the [[Habsburg Empire]], which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. It indicated that the speaker was a [[merchant]], an urbanite, not his nationality. Some cities, such as [[Budapest]] ([[Buda]], German: ''Ofen''), were gradually [[Germanisation|Germanized]] in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as [[Bratislava]] (German: ''Pressburg''), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time. A few cities such as [[Milan]] (German: ''Mailand'') remained primarily non-German. However, most cities were primarily German at least during the early part of the century, such as Prague, Budapest, Bratislava, [[Zagreb]] (German: ''Agram''), and [[Ljubljana]] (German: ''Laibach''), though they were surrounded by territory where other languages were spoken.

Until about 1800, standard German was almost solely a written language. At this time, people in urban [[northern Germany]], who spoke dialects very different from Standard German, learnt it almost as a [[foreign language]] and tried to pronounce it as close to the spelling as possible. Prescriptive pronunciation guides of that time considered northern [[German phonology|German pronunciation]] to be the standard. However, the actual pronunciation of standard German varied from region to region.

Media and written works are almost all produced in standard German (often called ''Hochdeutsch'' in German), which is understood in all German-speaking areas (except by [[Nursery school|pre-school]] children in areas where only dialect is spoken, for example [[Switzerland]] — but in this age of [[television]], even they now usually learn to understand Standard German before school age).

The first dictionary of the [[Brothers Grimm]], which was issued in 16 parts between 1852 and 1860, remains the most comprehensive guide to the lexicon of the German language.

In 1880, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the ''[[Duden Handbook]]''. In 1901, this was declared the standard definition of the German language. Standard German orthography subsequently went essentially unrevised until 1998, when the [[German spelling reform of 1996]] was officially promulgated by government representatives of [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Switzerland]]. After the reform, German spelling underwent an eight-year transitional period, during which the reformed spelling was taught in most schools, while traditional and reformed spelling co-existed in the media.

{{History of Thailand}}
The '''history of Thailand since 1973''' saw an unstable period of democracy, with [[military dictatorship|military rule]] being reimposed after a bloody coup in 1976. (The previous military rulers had been removed, as a result of the [[#Revolution|revolution]] of 14 October 1973.)

For most of the 1980s, [[Thailand]] was ruled by prime minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], a democratically-inclined {{Citation needed|reason=this claim needs a reliable source|date=September 2013}} strongman who restored parliamentary politics. Thereafter the country remained a democracy apart from a brief period of military rule from 1991 to 1992. The populist [[Thai Rak Thai]] party, led by prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], governed from 2001 until 2006. In 2006 mass protests against the Thai Rak Thai party's alleged corruption, prompted the military to stage a coup d'état, in September. A general election in December 2007 restored a civilian government, but in May 2014 another military coup returned the absolute power to the army.

==Revolution (1973)==
{{main article|1973 Thai student uprising}}
[[File:Democracy monument, Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Democracy Monument, Bangkok|Democracy Monument]] in Bangkok, built in 1940 to commemorate the end of the [[absolute monarchy]] in 1932, was the scene of massive demonstrations in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.]]

The events of October 1973 amounted to a revolution in Thai politics. For the first time the urban middle class, led by the students, had challenged the ruling [[military junta|junta]], and had gained the apparent blessing of the king for a transition to democracy. The leaders of the junta were forced to step down; they took refuge in the United States or Taiwan.

Thailand, however, had not yet produced a political class able to make this bold new democracy function smoothly. The January 1975 elections failed to produce a stable party majority, and fresh elections in April 1976 produced the same result. The veteran politician [[Seni Pramoj]] and his brother [[Kukrit Pramoj]] alternated in power, but were unable to carry out a coherent reform program. The sharp increase in oil prices in 1974 led to recession and inflation, weakening the government's position. The democratic government's most popular move was to secure the withdrawal of American forces from Thailand. The communist insurgency led by the Thai communist party gradually became more active in the countryside, allying with urban intellectuals and students.

[[South Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] fell to communist forces in 1975. The threat of the communists in the neighboring countries soon led to panic among the people. The arrival of communist regimes on Thailand’s borders, the abolition of the 600-year-old [[Lao monarchy]], and the arrival of a flood of refugees from Laos and Cambodia swung public opinion in Thailand to the right, and conservatives did much better in the 1976 elections than they had done in 1975.

==Return to military rule==
By late 1976 moderate middle class opinion had turned away from the activism of the students, who had moved increasingly to the left. The army and the right-wing parties began a propaganda war against student liberalism by accusing student activists of being 'communists' and through formal paramilitary organizations such the [[Village Scouts]] and the [[Red Gaurs]] many of those students were killed. Matters came to a head in October when Thanom returned to Thailand to enter a royal monastery, [[Wat Bovorn]].

Tension between workers and factory owners became fierce, as the civil right movement became more active after 1973. Socialism and leftist ideology gained popularity among intellectuals and the working class. The political atmosphere became even more tense. Workers were found hung in [[Nakhon Pathom]] after protesting against a factory owner. A Thai version of anti-communist [[McCarthyism]] spread widely. Whoever staged a protest could be accused of being part of a communist conspiracy.

In 1976, students protesters occupied the Thammasat University campus and held protests over the violent deaths of the workers and staged a mock hanging of the victims, one of whom allegedly bore a resemblance to the [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince]]. Some newspapers the following day, including the [[Bangkok Post]], published an altered version of a photo of the event, which suggested the protestors had committed [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lese majeste]]. Rightist and ultra-conservative icons such as [[Samak Sundaravej]] blasted the protestors, instigating violent means to suppress them, culminating in the [[6 October 1976 Massacre]]. The army unleashed the paramilitaries and mob violence followed, in which many were killed.

The same evening, a junta staged a coup, declaring the end of [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] led-coalition government. The army installed [[Thanin Kraivichien]], an ultra-conservative former judge, as prime minister, and carried out a sweeping purge of the universities, the media and the civil service. Thousands of students, intellectuals and other leftists fled Bangkok and took refuge with the [[Communist Party of Thailand|Communist Party]]'s insurgent forces in the north and north-east, operating from safe bases in Laos. Others left for exile, including Dr. [[Puey Ungphakorn]], a respected economist and Rector of Thammasat University.

The economy was also in serious difficulties, in no small part due to Thanin's policies, which frightened foreign investors.

The new regime proved as unstable as the democratic experiment had been. In October 1977 a different section of the army staged another "coup" and replaced Thanin with General [[Kriangsak Chomanand]]. In 1978 the government offered an amnesty to Thai communists willing to "work with us to build a prosperous nation".&lt;ref name="oc1982-12-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2r4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ee8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thai%20communists&amp;pg=1189%2C1418196|title=Thailand ..Communists Surrender En Masse|date=2 December 1982|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer included housing, family reunion and security.&lt;ref name="oc1982-12-02"/&gt;

By this time, Thai forces had to deal with the situation resulting from the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. There was another flood of refugees, and both Vietnamese and [[Khmer Rouge]] forces periodically crossed into Thai territory, sparking clashes along the borders. A 1979 visit to Beijing earned [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s agreement to end support for Thailand's communist movement; in return, the Thai authorities agreed to give safe haven to the [[Khmer Rouge]] forces fleeing west following the invasion of Cambodia. Revelations of the crimes of the defeated [[Khmer Rouge]] also sharply reduced the appeal of communism to the Thai public. Kriangsak's position as prime minister soon became untenable and he was forced to step down in February 1980 at a time of economic troubles. Kriangsak was succeeded by the army commander-in-chief, General [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], a staunch royalist with a reputation for being incorruptible.

===Vietnamese incursions===
{{main article|Vietnamese border raids in Thailand}}
Between 1979 and 1988, [[Vietnam]]ese occupation forces in [[Kampuchea]] made incursions into Thai territory, allegedly seeking rebel guerrillas they claimed were hiding in refugee camps (where many [[Lao people|Laotian]]s and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees had also settled). Sporadic skirmishes continued along the border from 1985 to 1988, as Vietnamese troops periodically made cross border raids to wipe out [[Khmer Rouge]] border camps in Thailand, which along with China was a major supporter of the Khmer Rouge resistance. At times this led to direct combat with the Royal Thai Army, which drove back the intruders.

==Coups and elections==
Much of the 1980s saw a process of democratisation overseen by the King and Prem. The two preferred constitutional rule, and acted to put an end to violent military interventions.

===The Prem era===
In April 1981 a clique of junior army officers popularly known as the "Young Turks" staged a coup attempt, taking control of Bangkok. They dissolved the National Assembly and promised sweeping social changes. But their position quickly crumbled when Prem accompanied the royal family to [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Khorat]]. With the King's support for Prem made clear, loyalist units under the palace favourite General [[Arthit Kamlang-ek]] managed to recapture the capital in an almost bloodless counterattack..

This episode raised the prestige of the monarchy still further, and also enhanced Prem’s status as a relative moderate. A compromise was therefore reached. The insurgency ended and most of the ex-student guerillas returned to Bangkok under an amnesty. In December 1982, the Thai army Commander in Chief accepted flag of the Communist Party of Thailand at a widely publicized ceremony held in Banbak. Here, communist fighters and their supporters handed in their weapons and swore allegiance to the government.&lt;ref name="oc1982-12-02"/&gt; Prem declared the armed struggle over.&lt;ref name="oc1982-12-02"/&gt; The army returned to its barracks, and yet another constitution was promulgated, creating an appointed Senate to balance the popularly elected National Assembly. Elections were held in April 1983, giving Prem, now in the guise of a civilian politician, a large majority in the legislature (an arrangement which came to be known as "Premocracy").

Prem was also the beneficiary of the accelerating economic revolution which was sweeping south-east Asia. After the recession of the mid-1970s, economic growth took off. For the first time Thailand became a significant industrial power, and manufactured goods such as computer parts, textiles and footwear overtook rice, rubber and tin as Thailand’s leading exports. With the end of the Indochina wars and the insurgency, tourism developed rapidly and became a major earner. The urban population continued to grow rapidly, but overall population growth began to decline, leading to a rise in living standards even in rural areas, although the [[Isaan]] continued to lag behind. While Thailand did not grow as fast as the "[[Four Asian Tigers]]," (namely [[Taiwan]], South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore) it achieved sustained growth.

Prem held office for eight years, surviving two more general elections in 1983 and 1986, and remained personally popular, but the revival of democratic politics led to a demand for a more adventurous leader. In 1988 fresh elections brought former General [[Chatichai Choonhavan]] to power. Prem rejected the invitation offered by major political parties for the third term of premiership.

The Prem era also marked the end of violent struggle between the Bangkok government and the communist insurgents by issuing the general amnesty. Former students who fled the cities, joined the communist party, returned eventually and resumed their lives.

===The NPKC and Bloody May===
{{see also|National Peace Keeping Council|Bloody May}}
By allowing one faction of the military to get rich on government contracts, Chatichai provoked a rival faction, led by Generals [[Sunthorn Kongsompong]], [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], and other generals of Class 5 of the [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy]] to stage a coup in February 1991, charging Chatichai's government as a corrupt regime or 'Buffet Cabinet'. The junta called itself the [[National Peace Keeping Council]]. The NPKC brought in a civilian prime minister, [[Anand Panyarachun]], who was still responsible to the military. Anand's anti-corruption and straightforward measures proved popular. Another [[Thailand legislative election, March 1992|general election was held in March 1992]].

The winning coalition appointed coup leader [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]] to become Prime Minister, in effect breaking a promise he had made earlier to the King and confirming the widespread suspicion that the new government was going to be a military regime in disguise. However, the Thailand of 1992 was not the Siam of 1932. Suchinda’s action brought hundreds of thousands of people out in the largest demonstrations ever seen in Bangkok, led by the former governor of Bangkok, Major-General [[Chamlong Srimuang]].

Suchinda brought military units personally loyal to him into the city and tried to suppress the demonstrations by force, leading to a massacre and riots in the heart of the capital, [[Bangkok]], in which hundreds died. Rumours spread out as there was a rift in the armed forces. Amidst the fear of civil war, King [[Bhumibol]] intervened: he summoned Suchinda and Chamlong to a televised audience, and urged them to follow the peaceful solution. This meeting resulted in Suchinda's resignation.

==Democracy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] --&gt;
The King re-appointed royalist Anand as interim prime minister until elections could be held in September 1992, which brought the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] under [[Chuan Leekpai]] to power, mainly representing the voters of Bangkok and the south. Chuan was a competent administrator who held power until 1995, when he was defeated at elections by a coalition of conservative and provincial parties led by [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]]. Tainted by corruption charges from the very beginning, Banharn’s government was forced to call early elections in 1996, in which General [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s [[New Aspiration Party]] managed to gain a narrow victory.

The 1997 Constitution was the first constitution to be drafted by popularly elected Constitutional Drafting Assembly, and was popularly called the "people's constitution".&lt;ref name="Criminal Justice"&gt;Kittipong Kittayarak, {{cite web |url= http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no60/ch06.pdf |title= The Thai Constitution of 1997 and its Implication on Criminal Justice Reform |access-date= 19 June 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033157/http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no60/ch06.pdf |archive-date= 14 June 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(221&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Constitution created a [[bicameral legislature]] consisting of a 500-seat [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]] (สภาผู้แทนราษฎร, ''sapha phu thaen ratsadon'') and a 200-seat [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]] (วุฒิสภา, ''wutthisapha''). For the first time in Thai history, both houses were directly elected.

Many human rights were explicitly acknowledged, and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments. The House was elected by the [[first past the post]] system, where only one candidate with a simple majority could be elected in one constituency. The Senate was elected based on the provincial system, where one province could return more than one senator depending on its population size.

The two houses of the National Assembly have two different terms. In accordance with the constitution the Senate is elected to a six-year term, while the House is elected to a four-year term. Overall the term of the National Assembly is based on that of the House. The National Assembly each year will sit in two sessions: an "ordinary session" and a "legislative session". The first session of the National Assembly must take place within thirty days after the general election of the House of Representatives. The first session must be opened by the [[King of Thailand|king]] in person by reading a [[Speech from the Throne]]; this ceremony is held in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. He may also appoint the [[crown prince]] or a representative to carry out this duty. It is also the duty of the king to prorogue sessions through a [[royal decree]] when the House term expires. The king also has the [[royal prerogative|prerogative]] to call extraordinary sessions and prolong sessions upon advice of the House of Representatives.

The National Assembly may host a "joint-sitting" of both Houses under several circumstances. These include: The appointment of a regent, any alteration to the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the opening of the first session, the announcement of policies by the [[Cabinet of Thailand]], the approval of the [[declaration of war]], the hearing of explanations and approval of a [[treaty]] and the amendment of the Constitution.

Members of the House of Representatives served four-year terms, while senators served six-year terms. The 1997 People's Constitution also promoted human rights more than any other constitution. The court system (ศาล, san) included a [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|constitutional court]] with jurisdiction over the constitutionality of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, and political matters.

Soon after coming into office, Prime Minister Chavalit was confronted by the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997. After coming under strong criticism for his handling of the crisis, Chavilit resigned in November 1997 and Chuan returned to power. Chuan came to an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] which stabilised the currency and allowed IMF intervention on Thai economic recovery. In contrast to the country's previous history, the crisis was resolved by civilian rulers under democratic procedures.

During the 2001 election Chuan’s agreement with IMF and use of injection funds to boost the economy were a cause for great debate, whilst Thaksin’s policies appealed to the mass electorate. Thaksin campaigned effectively against the old politics, corruption, organized crime, and drugs. In January 2001 he had a sweeping victory at the polls, winning a larger popular mandate (40%) than any Thai prime minister has ever had in a freely elected National Assembly.

While Thaksin himself owned a large portion of shares in [[Shin Corporation]] (formerly Shinawatra Computer and Communications), one of Thailand's major telecommunications companies, he put his holding under the names of his servants and driver until his children were old enough to be able to hold shares. The shares eventually transferred to family members. The share issue went to court and the court ruled in his favor, acquitting him from the legal clause that a prime minister cannot hold shares. Even though this legally freed him, political opposition parties and many Thai people did not accept the court ruling on this matter.

In power, Thaksin has presided over the rapid recovery of the Thai economy and repaid all debts borrowed from IMF before due time. By 2002 Thailand, and Bangkok in particular, was once again booming. As low-end manufacturing moved to China and other low-wage economies, Thailand moved upscale into more sophisticated manufacturing, both for a rapidly expanding domestic middle class market and for export. Tourism, and particularly [[sex tourism]], also remained a huge revenue earner despite intermittent "social order" campaigns by the government to control the country's nightlife. Thaksin won a majority at elections in February 2005, securing his second consecutive term.

However, Thaksin became one of the most controversial premiers in the democratic Thailand. While he was applauded as an able leader, his critics became more severe. From the very beginning of his power, he was charged with hiding assets. He was 'at war' with journalists. His relationship with Myanmar's junta was also criticized. His policy of 'war on drug' led to the non-judicial killing of thousands 'suspects', inviting critics from human right groups domestically and internationally. Reports of his abuse of power and the conflict of interest were heralded.

In December 2005 media proprietor Sonthi Limthongkul launched an anti-Thaksin campaign, after his news analysis TV program, sharp critic of Thaksin, was removed from the channel. Sondhi's movement was based on accusations of Thaksin's abuse of power, corruption, human right violation, and immorality. Accusations included the improper handling of privatization of PTT and EGAT, the unfairness of the [[United States–Thailand Free Trade Agreement|U.S.–Thailand free trade agreement]], the corruption in the [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] project, and conflicts of interest due to the Shinawatra family's continued ownership of [[Shin Corporation]].. In January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold its shares in Shin Corporation, but due to a condition in Thai law, they did not have to pay capital gains tax. Although legal, Sonthi, his [[Peoples Alliance for Democracy]], and the opposition claimed that the tax-free sale was immoral. Sonthi and the PAD held mass protests for months. In February 2006 Thaksin responded by calling a snap election in April. The opposition boycotted the elections, causing the Constitutional Court to later nullify the election results. Another election was scheduled for October 2006.

However, despite efforts to clean up the system, vote buying and electoral violence remained electoral problems in 2005.&lt;ref name="QuoVadis"&gt;Aurel Croissant and Daniel J. Pojar, Jr., [http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2005/Jun/croissantJun05.asp Quo Vadis Thailand?

The PollWatch Foundation, Thailand's most prominent election watchdog, declared that vote buying in this election, specifically in the north and the northeast, was more serious than in the 2001 election. The organisation also accused the government of violating the election law by abusing state power in presenting new projects in a bid to seek votes.

=== 2006 coup d'état ===
{{See also|2006 Thai coup d'état}}
Without meeting much resistance, a [[military junta]] [[2006 Thailand coup|overthrew]] the interim government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] on 19 September 2006. The [[Military dictatorship|junta]] [[wikt:abrogated|abrogated]] the constitution, dissolved Parliament and the Constitutional Court, detained and later removed several members of the government, declared [[martial law]], and appointed one of the king's Privy Counselors, General [[Surayud Chulanont]], as the Prime Minister. The junta later wrote a highly abbreviated [[2006 Interim Constitution of Thailand|interim constitution]] and appointed a panel to draft a new permanent constitution. The junta also appointed a 250-member legislature, called by some critics a "chamber of generals" while others claimed that it lacks representatives from the poor majority.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/headlines/headlines_30016076.php NLA 'doesn't represent' all of the people] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102080434/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/headlines/headlines_30016076.php |date=2 November 2006 }}, 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/headlines/headlines_30016078.php Assembly will not play a major role] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116151859/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/headlines/headlines_30016078.php |date=16 January 2007 }}, 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In this interim constitution draft, the head of the junta was allowed to remove the prime minister at any time. The legislature was not allowed to hold a vote of confidence against the cabinet and the public was not allowed to file comments on bills.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/27/headlines/headlines_30014776.php Interim charter draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206062909/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/27/headlines/headlines_30014776.php |date=6 February 2007 }}, 27 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This interim constitution was later surpassed by [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|the permanent constitution]] on 24 August 2007. Martial law was partially revoked in January 2007. The ban on political activities was lifted in July 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/18/politics/politics_30041398.php|title=Ban on political activities lifted|work=The Nation|date=18 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155318/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/18/politics/politics_30041398.php|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Party dissolution charges in Thai politics, 2006|30 May dissolution]] of the [[Thai Rak Thai]] party. The new constitution was approved by referendum on 19 August, which led to a return to a [[Thai general election, 2007|democratic general election]] on 23 December 2007.

==2008 political crisis==
{{main article|2008 Thai political crisis}}

In mid-2008, the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) renewed its large protests against the government of Prime Minister [[Samak Sundaravej]], who was the declared nominee of the former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7581565.stm |title=Thai protesters 'want new coup' |accessdate=2 September 2008 |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=26 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hG71oGl1LokvZphtDQZzL44nzc3QD92R52AG0|title=Thai protest refuses order to leave gov't compound|accessdate=2 September 2008 |last=Wannabovorn|first=Sutin|publisher=Associated Press|date=28 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following several court rulings against him in a variety of scandals, and surviving a vote of no confidence, and protesters blockading government buildings and airports, in September 2008, Sundaravej was found guilty of conflict of interest by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand]] (due to being a host in a TV cooking program),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090900505.html |title=Thai Premier Ousted Over Stints on Cooking Show |work=The Washington Post  |date= 10 September 2008|accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Ambika | last=Ahuja}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus, ended his term in office.

Immediately following what many media described as a "judicial coup", a senior member of the Armed Forces met with factions of the governing coalition to get their members to join the opposition and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] was able to form a government, a first for the party since 2001. The leader of the Democrat party, and former leader of the opposition, [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]], was appointed and sworn in as the 27th [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], together with the new cabinet on 17 December 2008.

In April 2009, protests by the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD, or "[[Red Shirts (Thailand)|Red Shirts]]") forced the cancellation of the [[Fourth East Asia Summit]] after protesters stormed the Royal Cliff hotel venue in Pattaya, smashing the glass doors of the venue to gain entry, and a blockade prevented the Chinese premier at the time, [[Wen Jiabao]], from attending. The summit was eventually held in Thailand in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters storm Asian leaders' summit in Thailand|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/11/thailand-economics|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 April 2009|first=Peter|last=Beaumont}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squaring the Japanese and Australia proposals for an East Asian and Asia Pacific Community: is America in or out?|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2009/11/04/squaring-the-japanese-and-australia-proposals-for-an-east-asian-and-asia-pacific-community-is-america-in-or-out/|work=East Asia Forum|publisher=East Asian Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=22 February 2014|first=Joel|last=Rathus|date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a year later, a set of new [[2010 Thai political protests|"Red Shirts" protests]] resulted in 87 deaths (mostly civilian and some military) and 1,378 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://visaonlinevietnam.com/pm-vows-to-seek-truth-n1899|title=PM vows to seek truth|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|date=22 May 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the army tried to disperse the protesters on 10 April 2010, it was met with automatic gunfire, grenades, and fire bombs from the opposition faction in the army, known as the "watermelon". This resulted in the army returning fire with rubber bullets and some live ammunition.  During the time of the "red shirt" protests against the government, there have been numerous grenade and bomb attacks against government offices and the homes of government officials.  Gas grenades were fired at "yellow-shirt" protesters, who were protesting against the "red shirts" and in favor of the government, by unknown gunmen killing one pro-government protester; the government stated that the Red Shirts were firing the weapons at civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8612783.stm |title=Bangkok clashes death toll climbs to 18, with 800 hurt |date=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aj Jazeera English, [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/04/20104113019324124.html Bloodiest Thai clashes in 18 years], 11 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100414123827/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/20100411120452/Article/index_html Australia 'very concerned' over Thailand clashes], NST Online Australia, 11 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://khmerization.blogspot.jp/2010/04/military-admits-firing-at-reds.html Military admits firing at reds], ''Bangkok Post'', 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Red shirts continued to hold a position in the business district of Bangkok and it was shut down for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268|title=Profile: Thailand's reds and yellows|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2011, the oppositional [[Pheu Thai Party]], led by [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] (the youngest sister of Thaksin Shinawatra), won the [[Thai general election, 2011|general election]] by a landslide (265 seats in the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], out of 500). She had never previously been involved in politics, Pheu Thai campaigning for her with the slogan 'Thaksin thinks, Pheu Thai acts'. Yingluck is the nation's first female prime minister and her role was officially endorsed in a ceremony presided over by [[King Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. The Pheu Thai Party is a continuation of Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand confirms Yingluck Shinawatra as first female PM|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/05/thailand-yingluck-shinawatra-prime-minister|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 Coup d'état==
{{Main article|2013–14 Thai political crisis|2014 Thai coup d'état}}
Protests recommenced in late 2013, as a broad alliance of protestors, led by former opposition deputy leader [[Suthep Thaugsuban]], demanded an end to the so-called Thaksin regime. A blanket amnesty for people involved in the 2010 protests, altered at the last minute to include all political crimes – including all convictions against Thaksin – triggered a mass show of discontent, with numbers variously estimated between 98,500 (the police) and 400,000 (an aerial photo survey done by the Bangkok Post), taking to the streets. The Senate was urged to reject the bill to quell the reaction, but the measure failed.  A newly named group, the [[People's Democratic Reform Committee]] (PDRC) along with allied groups, escalated the pressure, with the opposition Democrat party resigning en masse to create a parliamentary vacuum. Protesters demands variously evolved as the movement's numbers grew, extending a number of deadlines and demands that became increasingly unreasonable or unrealistic, yet attracting a groundswell of support. They called for the establishment of an indirectly elected “people’s council”—in place of Yingluck's government—that will cleanse Thai politics and eradicate the Thaksin regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand’s street politics turns violent yet again|url=http://theconversation.com/thailands-street-politics-turns-violent-yet-again-21020|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=3 December 2013|author=Kevin Hewison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the intensive protests, Yingluck dissolved parliament on 9 December 2013 and proposed a new election for 2 February 2014, a date that was later approved by the election commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai prime minister dissolves parliament|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2013/12/thai-pm-says-she-will-dissolve-parliament-201312913831169537.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDRC insisted that the prime minister stand down within 24 hours, regardless of her actions, with 160,000 protesters in attendance at Government House on 9 December. Yingluck insisted that she would continue her duties until [[Thai general election, 2014|the scheduled election in February 2014]], urging the protesters to accept her proposal: "Now that the government has dissolved parliament, I ask that you stop protesting and that all sides work towards elections. I have backed down to the point where I don't know how to back down any further."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai PM Urges Protesters to Take Part in Election|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/12/10/world/asia/10reuters-thailand-protest.html?ref=reuters&amp;_r=0|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 December 2013|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Electoral Commission (EC)'s registration process for party-list candidates—for the scheduled election in February 2014—anti-government protesters marched to the Thai-Japanese sports stadium, the venue of the registration process, on 22 December 2013. Suthep and the PDRC led the protest, of which security forces claimed that approximately 270,000 protesters joined. Yingluck and the Pheu Thai Party reiterated their election plan and anticipate presenting a list of 125 party-list candidates to the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep: Protesters to block EC registration|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/386179/suthep-to-block-poll-registration|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=22 December 2013|last1= Khoonton|first1=Thanarak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that Yingluck would have to step down as the Prime Minister as she was deemed to have abused her power in transferring a high-level government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/thai-court-orders-yingluck-shinawatra-resign|title=Thai court orders Yingluck Shinawatra to step down as PM|last=Hodal|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 2014 she was replaced by army chief General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]].&lt;ref name="PrayuthPM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coup leader General Prayuth is Thailand's new PM|url=http://www.southeastasiapost.com/index.php/sid/224972447|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=Southeast Asia Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 to present===
The ruling junta led by Prayuth Chan-o-cha promised to hold new elections, but wants to enact a new constitution before the elections are held.

A national referendum, the first since the 2014 coup, on a newly drafted constitution was held on 7 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36972396&lt;/ref&gt; There was a 55% turnout of which around 61% voted in favour of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/thailand-votes-in-favour-of-military-backed-constitution&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new constitution an unelected person other than a member of parliament can be appointed as Prime Minister, which would open the post to a military official.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/c0638358-5d29-11e6-bb77-a121aa8abd95&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution also gives the National Council for Peace and Order the authority to make all the appointments to the 250-member senate in the next government.&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4448655/thailand-constitutional-referendum/&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional court will also have final authority in times of crisis, a power previously held by the king.

{{nihongo|'''Hōan'''|保安}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,|''nengō'',|lit. "year name"}} after ''[[Gen'ei]]'' and before ''[[Tenji (era)|Tenji]].''  This period spanned the years from April 1120 through April 1124.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Hō-an''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 338|page=338}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperors were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Toba of Japan|Toba]]''-tennō''|鳥羽天皇}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Sutoku of Japan|Sutoku]]''-tennō''|崇徳天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA178,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 178]-182; Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979).

==Change of era==
* '''February 1, 1120''' {{nihongo|''Hōan gannen''|保安元年}}&lt;!-- NengoCalc 保安一年一月一日 --&gt;: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Gen'ei'' 3, on the 10th day of the 4th month of 1120.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Hōan'' era==

* '''February 25, 1123''' (''Hōan 4, on the 28th day of the 1st month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 保安四年一月二十八日 --&gt;: In the 17th year of Emperor Toba's reign (鳥羽天皇17年), Toba was forced to abdicate by his father, retired-[[Emperor Shirakawa]]. Toba gave up the throne in favor of his son Akihito, who would become Emperor Sutoku. Toba was only 21 years old when he renounced his title; and he had already reigned for 16 years:  two in the ''nengō'' ''Tennin'', three in ''Ten'ei'', five in the ''nengō'' ''Eikyū'', two in ''Gen'ei'', and four in the ''nengō'' ''Hōan.''  At this time, Toba took the title ''Daijō-tennō.''&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 320-321; Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA181,M1   p.181.]&lt;/ref&gt; The succession (''senso'') was received by his son.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]],  [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami|Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Herbert "Herbie" Brennan''' (born Ireland, 5 July 1940) is a lecturer and the author of over 100 fiction and non-fiction [[books]] for adults, teens, and children.

==Biography==
Brennan's ''[[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (role-playing game)|Man, Myth &amp; Magic]]'' was published by [[Yaquinto Publications]] in 1982; he had originally started developing it as a much smaller RPG called ''Arena'', but the game continued to grow from its Roman has as he developed it.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=[[Mongoose Publishing]]|date=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164}} Brennan also designed ''Timeship'', the last roleplaying game published by Yaquinto Publications.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|165}} Brennan wrote several different [[gamebook]]s, including ''[[GrailQuest]]'' (1984–1987), a series of eight Arthurian adventures, and two published only in French – ''Aztec Quest'' (1997) and ''Egyptian Quest'' (1997).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|165}}

His works have been translated into approximately 50 languages, he has also written books on the [[Occult]] and [[New Age]]. More recently, his teenage novel ''Faerie Wars'' achieved ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller status in the United States and is now part of a five book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/books/children-s-books-098566.html|title=Children's Books|first=Elizabeth|last=Devereaux|date=22 June 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially trained in [[esoteric]] teachings and Qabalah with the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]]. He later became associated with [[Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki]] and the [[Servants of the Light]].

In 1995 he contributed two novels to the Horrorscopes series under the house pen name "Maria Palmer". In 1998 he published ''Martian Genesis'' an [[ancient astronaut]] book which claimed the human race is of [[Outer space|extraterrestrial]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Book review of Martian Genesis in ''Weekly World News'', 14 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Brennan published the children's book ''The Book of Wizardry: The Apprentice's Guide to the Secrets of the Wizards' Guild'' under the pseudonym "Cornelius Rumstuckle."  The book purports to instruct children on how to become a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]; it discusses crafts such as making a [[wand]], and includes [[astrology|astrological]] references throughout.  According to the biographical note on the back cover, Rumstuckle "joined the Wizards' Guild in 1514 and became its youngest president ever seventy-eight years later, a post he holds to this day." The novel stars "you" as you train to become a wizard (in wiccan style{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}). You then participate in a "wizard's adventure" a game where you utilise the knowledge you gained after reading the book. The ending is ambiguous, leaving you with the location of the Wizards' Guild, possibly hinting a sequel. In 2011 Herbie Brennan's book ''The Secret History of Ancient Egypt'' was republished by Bedford Square Books.

The '''Jewish Internet Defense Force''' ('''JIDF''') is an organization that uses social media to mobilize support for campaigns against websites and Facebook groups that promote or praise what it describes as [[Islamic terrorism]] or [[antisemitism]]. The group's website describes the JIDF as a "private, independent, non-violent protest organization representing a collective of activists".&lt;ref name="jidf_about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the JIDF |url=http://www.thejidf.org/2008/10/about-jidf.html|publisher=JIDF |date=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JIDF's work has been termed "[[hacktivism]]" by some media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7827293.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gaza crisis spills onto the web | date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman |first=Benjamin L. |url=http://www.haaretz.com/ga/israel-s-internet-intifada-1.394381 |title=Israel's Internet intifadaIsrael News - Haaretz Israeli News source |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and methods==
According to the JIDF, the organization "formed as a grassroots effort in 2000, to mount mass e-mail campaigns, in response to the outbreak of the Second Intifada."&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephanie Rubenstein |title=Jewish Internet Defense Force 'seizes control' of anti-Israel Facebook group |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=109334 |publisher=[[JPost|The Jerusalem Post]]| location=Jerusalem |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is run by a person who identifies himself as "David Appletree."&lt;ref name="jewishweek1"&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/brief/internet_activist_no_friend_facebook Internet activist no friend of Facebook] ''[[The Jewish Week]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a reporter from ''The Jewish Week'' in 2009 he "will not say if that is his true surname". In the same article Appletree accused Facebook administrators of antisemitism for closing down his account. A Facebook spokesperson replied that the account was terminated because the website did not believe he was using his real name, which is a breach of Facebook's "real name culture". Appletree went on to say that he maintains approximately 40 Facebook groups focused on combating terrorism and antisemitism.&lt;ref name="jewishweek1"/&gt;

The group says they "specifically target hateful material or material which blatantly promotes hatred or violence, no matter where it can be found."&lt;ref name="jidf_responsetowikipedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=JIDF Response to Wikipedia
|url=http://www.thejidf.org/2008/08/current-response-to-wikipedia.html
|publisher=JIDF
|date=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "About" page of the website says "We believe in direct action both to eradicate the problems we face online and to create the publicity that will cause those with companies like Facebook and Google to take the needed action themselves."&lt;ref name="jidf_about"/&gt; The group focuses its attention on websites like [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name="Jewish Activist Battl"&gt;

In another article, Appletree maintained, "The main reason the JIDF exists is to promote Israel and fight Jew hatred as well as Islamic terrorist trends online," and stated, "we are a grassroots organization that reaches the hearts and the minds of normal, everyday Jews and Israel supporters who haven't been bamboozled into supporting the Jewish establishment that has completely failed Israel and the Jewish people in every way imaginable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137769&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007, a controversy on Facebook was reported involving "the drop-down list of places members can use to show where they live."&lt;ref name="Playing Politics on Facebook"/&gt; A Facebook group, "Palestine Is not a country ... Delist it from Facebook as a country!", had been formed in 2007 which petitioned Facebook management to remove Palestine from Facebook's list of countries. Several [[Facebook group]]s formed to support or oppose this removal including "Israel is not a country!
Delist it from Facebook as a country".  Matt Hicks of Facebook responded by saying: "As long as the groups meet our terms of use, they can stay up. But we encourage users to report anything that is racist or objectionable.&lt;ref name="Playing Politics on Facebook"&gt;{{cite news

According to a November 2008 article in ''[[Haaretz]]'',&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;{{cite news

|date=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the JIDF forwarded lists of Facebook groups that it deemed promoted hatred or violence to the website's administrators, hoping they would be removed. According to a man named "David" quoted in the Haaretz article, Facebook either did nothing or waited months before taking action. "David" told Haaretz that his group then decided to try to technically "intercept Facebook groups and make them impossible to access." The JIDF was particularly upset about Facebook groups praising the shooting of [[Mercaz HaRav massacre|students at Jerusalem's Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva]] in March 2008.&lt;ref name="Jewish Activist Battl" /&gt;

In July 2009, the JIDF and [[Avi Dichter]] took credit for successfully pressuring Facebook into removing a fan page for [[Hizbullah]] leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]. The JIDF said it mobilized supporters to complain about the page to Facebook's owners.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=206 Social media users successfully face down Nasrallah on Facebook], Jerusalem Post, July 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The JIDF website claims that it deleted the vast majority of a pro-Hezbollah fan page's 118,000 members. The JIDF sites says it has removed more than 100 antisemitic groups from Facebook.&lt;ref name="Hartman" /&gt; The JIDF said in September 2009 that it took over the Facebook group "Eliminate Israel from Being" and deleted more than 5,000 members before Facebook management "returned control of the site to its administrators."&lt;ref name=CJN&gt;{{cite web

The JIDF has criticized Facebook for allegedly condoning and hosting [[Holocaust denial]] groups on its network. The group has charged that it's hypocritical of Facebook to remove groups that support the KKK, for instance, while not removing what it considers Holocaust denial sites and has vowed to keep putting pressure on Facebook over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090615/FOREIGN/706149970/-1/SPORT Call for hate groups to be taken offline], The National, Dubai, June 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/innovation/2009/05/11/is-facebook-changing-its-tune-on-holocaust-deniers/ Is Facebook Changing its Tune on Holocaust Deniers?], CS Monitor, May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=153148 |title='Facebook doesn't bar hateful content against Jews' |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |first=Elan |last=Miller |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elsewhere on the Web ===

JIDF's measures "include reporting Wikipedia editors it claims are anti-Israel, and taking action against entries seen as including one-sided or false accounts of the history of Israel and the Mideast conflict," Haaretz wrote. The group has sought to have Palestinian villages listed as having been destroyed during the foundation of Israel removed from [[Google Earth]] and has campaigned against the description of "Palestine" as a country.&lt;ref name=Hartman/&gt;

The JIDF organized a pro-[[Gilad Shalit]] campaign in 2009 on the social networking site [[Twitter]]. During the Tweet4Shalit campaign Twitter users drove the Gilad Shalit name to the second highest trend on the day of his 23rd birthday. Tweets for Shalit ranged from the demand to "Free Shalit" to requests for international supervision of the case.&lt;ref name="'Tweet4Schalit' campaign reaches No. 2 spot in Twitter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=153145 |title='Tweet4Shalit' campaign reaches No. 2 spot in Twitter |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |first1=Josiah Daniel |last1=Ryan |first2=Elan |last2=Miller |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/132750 Happy Birthday for Gilad Shalit?], Israel National News, August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In October 2008, the German newspaper the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] (FAZ)'' wrote that "the JIDF follows an open political agenda as well. Many of its members protested the clearing of Israeli settlements in the Gaza strip in 2005 – they regard this policy of trading Land for Peace as wrong." The newspaper wrote that "Ultimately the JIDF also wants to propagate ‘Jewish values on the Internet’. This leads to the self-appointed warriors against online-hatred to link their own homepage to a dubious site named ‘thereligionofpeace.com’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubCF3AEB154CE64960822FA5429A182360/Doc~E131A1CEB38A14371865189591440F0A4~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html?rss_aktuell Christoph Gunkel, ''Antisemitismus im Web 2'', Frankfurter Allgemeine FAZ.NET 14. Oktober 2008]. Quotes are taken from the authorised English translation, [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/antisemitism/Facebook_and_Google_Earth_Anti-Semitism_in_Web_2.0.htm Facebook and Google Earth: Anti-Semitism in Web 2.0] published at Zionism On The Web, seen 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The JIDF website itself says "Mohammed was a genocidal pedophile who murdered people who didn't think like he did, or believe the things he believed.  Millions of Muslims promote the idea that if we "insult" him (despite the fact that he's dead), that we should be killed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejidf.org/2010/05/must-see-religion-of-peace-photo-of-day.html   ''Must see Religion of "Peace" Photo of the day] JIDF website, May 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The website says that Mohammad was a "false prophet" and that the "[[Islamic]] ideology itself is clearly one of hatred and violence, which is declaring war against the entire non-Islamic world... it is determined to dominate the world, just as Nazism was." The website came out against plans to build an Islamic cultural center near [[Ground Zero]] in New York, and said this was the reason why. "Because Islam is a hateful and violent ideology which preaches hate and violence against ALL non-Muslims (especially Jews, as it is obsessed with us, and dehumanizes us as apes and pigs), we are against ALL mosques. We are against Islam, just as we are against [[Nazism]]. Just as we don't wish to see Nazi institutions springing up everywhere, we don't need to see Islamic one's springing up everywhere, either."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejidf.org/2010/08/during-ramadan-celebrations-obama.html   During Ramadan Celebrations, Obama Supports Ground Zero Mosque (as do the "protesters"...just not at Ground Zero)] JIDF website, August 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[CNN]] wrote that the JIDF is "sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own",&lt;ref name="cnn-1"&gt;Lisa Respers France, [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/05/08/facebook.holocaust.denial/index.html Facebook urged to remove Holocaust-denial groups], [[CNN.com]], May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a 2008 interview published on Facebook critic [[Brian Cuban]]'s site in which a JIDF representative discussed "the issues surrounding [then-candidate [[Barack Obama]]'s] terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-Semitic church, which has supported [[Hamas]] and the Rev. [[Louis Farrakhan]]", and the reply when asked how the Jewish and Muslim communities saw the JIDF, that "99.9% of Muslims hate us".&lt;ref name=cuban&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuban |first=Brian |title=Inside The Jewish Internet Defense Force |url=http://www.briancuban.com/inside-the-jewish-internet-defense-force/ |publisher=Brian Cuban |accessdate=2010-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111104349/http://www.briancuban.com/inside-the-jewish-internet-defense-force/ |archivedate=2010-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
CNN quoted a JIDF spokesperson as saying he would rather people not focus on those specific quotations as the interview had been "informal" and Cuban "would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline."&lt;ref name="cnn-1" /&gt;
Asked in the Cuban interview "What is the position of the JIDF on the “Palestinian Question” regarding disputes over occupied lands" the spokesman replied: "Palestinians should be transferred out of Israeli territories. They can live in any of the other many Arab states. We are against all land concessions to our enemies. We are against the release of terrorist prisoners from Israeli prisons. We are against the arming and funding of our enemies and the negotiation with them. We are for morals, ethics and common sense and feel Israel must truly act as a “light unto the nations” in order for the world to be safe as we feel Israel is truly on the front lines in the war in which Islam has declared upon us."&lt;ref name=cuban/&gt;

'''John Hall-Jones''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|size=85%}} (14 September 1927 – 19 November 2015) was a New Zealand [[historian]], [[otolaryngologist]] and [[outdoorsman]]. Jones concentrated on the history of [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]], New Zealand's southernmost [[Regions of New Zealand|regions]], as well as the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]].&lt;ref name=stimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Fallow |title=Southern historian John Hall-Jones dies |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/74293425/Southern-historian-John-Hall-Jones-dies |work=[[Southland Times]] |date=23 November 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1927, Hall-Jones was the great–grandson of [[John Turnbull Thomson]] (1821–1884), a British [[architect]] and [[civil engineer]] who was the original surveyor of the city of [[Invercargill]],&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; the grandson of New Zealand prime minister Sir [[William Hall-Jones]], and the son of [[Fred Hall-Jones]], a community leader and historian.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Hall-Jones, Frederick George |first= John|last= Hall-Jones|id=5h4|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine at the [[University of Otago]], graduating [[MB ChB]] in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shadowsoftime.co.nz/university11.html |title=NZ university graduates 1870–1961: Ha–He |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then undertook postgraduate training in London.&lt;ref name="Infonews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=10332 |title=Otago announces December graduation honorary doctorates |date=29 November 2007 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until his retirement at the age of 60, Hall-Jones was a practising [[otolaryngologist]],&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; and made a significant contribution to postgraduate medical education in Southland.&lt;ref name="Infonews"/&gt;

An avid outdoorsman, much of Hall–Jones's writing focused on the [[natural history]] and wilderness areas of southern New Zealand. He also published works on the history of [[Antarctica]], the [[Himalayas]], [[Patagonia]], and the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Hall-Jones would often begin research for his books by exploring the wilderness of an area by flying, [[kayaking]], trekking or camping in a region. He would write during the winters when the weather was colder.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; In all he published 34 historical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/features/72943628/an-88yearold-indiana-jones-reflects | title=An 88-year-old Indiana Jones reflects | date=14 October 2015 | work=Southland Times | accessdate=16 December 2015 | first=Michael | last=Fallow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1995 New Year Honours]], Hall-Jones was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]], for services to medicine and local history.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=53894 |date=31 December 1994 |page=34 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was awarded an honorary [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] degree by the University of Otago.&lt;ref name="Infonews"/&gt; He won the J.M. Sherrard Award for regional histories for two of his books, ''Fiordland Explored'' and ''Bluff Harbour''.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; His ''The Fjords of Fiordland'' was a finalist in the 2003 [[Montana Book Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pageandblackmore.co.nz/product/66671-TheFjordsofFiordland-9780908629565 |title=The Fjords of Fiordland |date= |website= |publisher=Page &amp; Blackmore Booksellers |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Goldfields of the South'' was a Sir James Wattie Book award finalist.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

In 2015, he published his autobiography, ''A Life of Adventures'', just a few months before his death. He died on 19 November 2015, at the age of 88.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

== Chronology ==
The very long, approximately 14,000 years, Jōmon period is conventionally divided into a number of phases: Incipient (16,500-10,000 years ago), Initial (10,000-7,000), Early (7,000-5,450), Middle (5,450-4,420), Late (4,420-3,220) and Final (3,220-2,350), with the phases getting progressively shorter.&lt;ref name="perri2016"/&gt; The fact that this entire period is given the same name by archaeologists should not be taken to mean that there was not considerable regional and temporal diversity; the chronological distance between the earliest Jōmon pottery and that of the more well-known Middle Jōmon period is about twice as long as the span separating the building of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] from the 21st century.

Dating of the Jōmon sub-phases is based primarily upon ceramic [[typology (archaeology)|typology]], and to a lesser extent [[radiocarbon dating]].

== Incipient and Initial Jōmon (14,000–4000 BCE) ==

Traces of [[Paleolithic]] culture, mainly stone tools, occur in Japan from around [[Upper Paleolithic#30.2C000 BC|30,000 BCE]] onwards. The earliest "Incipient Jōmon" phase began while Japan was still linked to continental Asia as a narrow peninsula.&lt;ref name="Mason, 13"&gt;Mason, 13&lt;/ref&gt; As the glaciers melted following the end of the [[last glacial period]] (approximately 12,000 years ago), sea levels rose, separating the Japanese archipelago from the Asian mainland; the closest point (in [[Kyushu]]) about {{convert|190|km}} from the [[Korean Peninsula]] is near enough to be intermittently influenced by continental developments but far enough removed for the peoples of the Japanese islands to develop their own ways. In addition, a continuous chain of islands encompasses [[Luzon]], [[Taiwan]], [[Ryukyu]] and [[Kyushu]], allowing for continuous contact between the Jōmon and [[maritime Southeast Asia]].

Within the archipelago, the vegetation was transformed by the end of the Ice Age. In southwestern [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]], and Kyushu, broadleaf [[evergreen]] trees dominated the forests, whereas broadleaf [[deciduous]] trees and conifers were common in northeastern Honshu and southern [[Hokkaido]]. Many native tree species, such as [[beech]]es, [[Aesculus|buckeyes]], [[chestnut]]s, and [[oak]]s produced edible nuts and acorns. These provided abundant sources of food for humans and for animals.

In the northeast, the plentiful marine life carried south by the [[Oyashio Current]], especially [[salmon]], was another major food source. Settlements along both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean subsisted on immense amounts of shellfish, leaving distinctive [[midden]]s (mounds of discarded shells and other refuse) that are now prized sources of information for archaeologists. Other food sources meriting special mention include [[Sika deer]], [[wild boar]] (with possible wild-pig management&lt;ref name="Crawford2011"/&gt;), wild plants such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]-like tubers, and freshwater fish. Supported by the highly productive deciduous forests and an abundance of seafood, the population was concentrated in central and northern Honshu, but Jōmon sites range from Hokkaido to the [[Ryukyu Islands]].

=== Earliest pottery ===
[[File:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Incipient [[Jōmon pottery]] (14th–[[8th millennium BC|8th millennium BCE]]) [[Tokyo National Museum]], [[Japan]]]]
The earliest pottery in Japan was made at or before the start of the Incipient Jōmon period. Small fragments, dated to 14,500 BCE, were found at the [[Odai Yamamoto I site]] in 1998. Pottery of roughly the same age was subsequently found at other sites such as Kamikuroiwa and Fukui Cave.&lt;ref name="Mason, 13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=Mark J.|authorlink=Mark J.

Archaeologist Junko Habu claims "[t]he majority of Japanese scholars believed, and still believe, that pottery production was first invented in mainland Asia and subsequently introduced into the Japanese archipelago."&lt;ref name="habu" /&gt; This seems to be confirmed by recent archaeology. As of now, the earliest pottery vessels in the world date back to 20,000 [[Before Present|BP]] and were discovered in [[Xianren Cave]] in [[Jiangxi]], China.&lt;ref name=Xianrendong&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Pottery at 20,000 Years Ago in Xianrendong Cave, China|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=June 29, 2012|volume=336|issue=6089|pages=1696–1700|doi=10.1126/science.1218643|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6089/1696|accessdate=June 29, 2012| pmid=22745428|author1=Wu|first1=X|last2=Zhang|first2=C|last3=Goldberg|first3=P|last4=Cohen|first4=D|last5=Pan|first5=Y|last6=Arpin|first6=T|last7=Bar-Yosef|first7=O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/06/pottery-found-in-from-china-cave-confirmed-as-worlds-oldest/1#.UDiyGtZlRv0 |title=Pottery found in China cave confirmed as world's oldest |author=Stanglin, Douglas |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery may have been used as [[cookware and bakeware|cookware]].&lt;ref name=Xianrendong /&gt; Other early pottery vessels include those excavated from the [[Yuchanyan Cave]] in southern China, dated from 16,000 BCE,&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/06/chinese_pottery_may_be_earlies.html "Chinese pottery may be earliest discovered."] [[Associated Press]]. 2009-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and at present it appears that pottery emerged at roughly the same time in Japan, and in the [[Amur River]] basin of the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuzmin | first1 = Y.V. | last2 = Keally | first2 = C.T. | year = 2001 | title = Radiocarbon Chronology of the Earliest Neolithic Sites in East Asia | url = | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 43 | issue = 2B| pages = 1121–1128 | doi=10.1017/s0033822200041771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 =Craig|first1 =O.E|last2= Saul|first2=H.|title=Earliest evidence for the use of pottery|journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume =496|issue =7445|pages =351–354|doi =10.1038/nature12109|year =2013|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Jōmon pottery]] is characterized by the cord-marking that gives the period its name and has now been found in large numbers of sites.{{sfn|Craig|Saul|2013}} The pottery of the period has been classified by archaeologists into some 70 styles, with many more local varieties of the styles.&lt;ref name="Mason, 14" /&gt; The antiquity of Jōmon pottery was first identified after World War II, through [[radiocarbon dating]] methods.&lt;ref name="imamura" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radiocarbon measures of carbonized material from pottery artifacts (uncalibrated): Fukui Cave 12500 +/-350 BP and 12500 +/-500 BP (Kamaki&amp;Serizawa 1967), Kamikuroiwa rockshelter 12, 165 +/-350 years BP in Shikoku&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest vessels were mostly smallish round-bottomed bowls 10–50&amp;nbsp;cm high that are assumed to have been used for boiling food and, perhaps, storing it beforehand. They belonged to [[hunter-gatherer]]s and the size of the vessels may have been limited by a need for portability. As later bowls increase in size, this is taken to be a sign of an increasingly settled pattern of living. These types continued to develop, with increasingly elaborate patterns of decoration, undulating rims, and flat bottoms so that they could stand on a surface.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, 15, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacture of pottery typically implies some form of [[sedentism|sedentary life]] because pottery is heavy, bulky, and fragile and thus generally unusable for [[hunter-gatherer]]s. However, this does not seem to have been the case with the first Jōmon people, who perhaps numbered 20,000 over the whole archipelago.&lt;ref name="Mason, 13" /&gt; It seems that food sources were so abundant in the natural environment of the Japanese islands that it could support fairly large, semi-sedentary populations. The Jōmon people used [[lithic reduction|chipped stone tools]], [[ground stone]] tools, traps, and [[bow and arrow|bows]], and were evidently skillful coastal and deep-water fishermen.

=== Early agriculture ===
The degree to which horticulture or [[small-scale agriculture]] was practiced by Jōmon people is debated. The hunter-gatherer conceptualization of the Jōmon period culture is part of scientific romanticized narratives.&lt;ref name="Crawford2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Gary W.|title=Advances in Understanding Early Agriculture in Japan|year=2011|jstor=10.1086/658369|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=52|issue=S4|pages=S331–S345|doi=10.1086/658369}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that [[arboriculture]] was practiced in the form of tending groves of lacquer ([[Toxicodendron vernicifluum|Toxicodendron verniciflua]]) and nut ([[Castanea crenata]] and [[Aesculus turbinata]]) producing trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matsui | first1 = A. | last2 = Kanehara | first2 = M. | year = 2006 | title = The Question of Prehistoric Plant Husbandry During the Jomon Period in Japan | doi = 10.1080/00438240600708295 | journal = World Archaeology | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages=259–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, G.W.

Madison: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well [[soybean]], [[Calabash|bottle gourd]], [[hemp]], [[Perilla]], [[Adzuki bean|adzuki]] among others. These characteristics place them somewhere in between hunting-gathering and agriculture.&lt;ref name="Crawford2011"/&gt;

An apparently domesticated variety of [[peach]] appeared very early at Jōmon sites in 6700–6400 BP (4700–4400 BCE).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This was already similar to modern cultivated forms. This domesticated type of peach was apparently brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China, itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date of c. 5300 to 4300 BP.&lt;ref name="YangZheng2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaoyan|last2=Zheng|first2=Yunfei|last3=Crawford|first3=Gary W.|last4=Chen|first4=Xugao|title=Archaeological Evidence for Peach (Prunus persica) Cultivation and Domestication in China|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=9|year=2014|pages=e106595|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0106595|pmid=25192436|pmc=4156326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population expansion ===
{{Update|section|date=March 2017}}

By the end of the Incipient Jōmon phase, around 8000 BCE, a semi-sedentary life-style apparently led to an increase in population density, so that the subsequent phase, the Initial Jōmon, exhibits some of the highest densities known for foraging populations.&lt;ref&gt;"Jōmon population densities are among the highest recorded for a foraging population, although in some areas of the Pacific Coast of North America, comparable and even higher figures of population densities have been observed (Hassan, 1975)." [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]], ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' p249, {{ISBN|0-691-08750-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic mapping studies by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] have shown a pattern of genetic expansion from the area of the [[Sea of Japan]] towards the rest of eastern Asia. This appears as the third principal component of genetic variation in Eurasia (after the "Great expansion" from the African continent, and a second expansion from the area of Northern Siberia), which suggests geographical expansion during the early Jōmon period.&lt;ref&gt;"The third synthetic map shows a peak in Japan, with rapidly falling concentric gradients... Taken at face value, one would assume a center of demographic expansion in an area located around the [[Sea of Japan]]." Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' p249, {{ISBN|0-691-08750-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies also suggest that the Jōmon demographic expansion may have reached America along a path following the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;"The synthetic maps suggest a previously unsuspected center of expansion from the Sea of Japan but cannot indicate dates. This development could be tied to the Jōmon period, but one cannot entirely exclude the pre-Jōmon period and that it might be responsible for a migration to the Americas. A major source of food in those pre-agricultural times came from fishing, then as now, and this would have limited for ecological reasons the area of expansion to the coastline, perhaps that of the Sea of Japan, but also farther along the Pacific Coast." Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' p253, {{ISBN|0-691-08750-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Early and Middle Jōmon periods saw an explosion in population, as indicated by the number of settlements from this period. These two periods occurred during the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] (between [[4th millennium BC|4000]] and [[20th century BC|2000 BCE]]), when the local climate became more humid.&lt;ref name="mayle2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Francis E.

== Middle Jōmon (2500–1500 BCE) ==
Highly ornate pottery [[dogū]] figurines and vessels, such as the so-called "flame style" vessels, and lacquered wood objects remain from that time. Although the ornamentation of pottery increased over time, the ceramic fabric always remained quite coarse.

This period saw a rise in complexity in the design of [[pit-house]]s, the most commonly used method of housing at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trussel.com/prehist/news21.htm |title=Early Jomon hamlet found|journal=The Japan Times|date= May 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Moriya|2015}} with some even having stone paved floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 =Moriya|first1 =Toyohito|title=A Study of the Utilization of Wood to Build Pit Dwellings from the Epi-Jomon Culture|journal =Journal of the Graduate School of Letters|volume=10|pages=71–85|doi =10.14943/jgsl.10.71|year=2015|ref=harv|url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/58209/1/10_06_moriya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study in 2015 found that this form of dwelling continued up until the [[Satsumon culture]].{{sfn|Moriya|2015}}

== Late and Final Jōmon (1500–900/300 BCE) ==
After [[1500s BC (decade)|1500 BCE]], the [[climate]] cooled, and populations seem to have contracted dramatically. Comparatively few archaeological sites can be found after 1500 BCE.

During the Final Jōmon period, a slow shift was taking place in western Japan: steadily increasing contact with the [[Korean Peninsula]] eventually led to the establishment of Korean-type settlements in western Kyushu, beginning around [[900s BC (decade)|900 BCE]]. The settlers brought with them new technologies such as [[paddy field|wet rice farming]] and bronze and iron metallurgy, as well as new pottery styles similar to those of the [[Mumun pottery period]]. The settlements of these new arrivals seem to have coexisted with those of the Jōmon and Yayoi for around a thousand years.

Outside Hokkaido, the Final Jōmon is succeeded by a new farming culture, the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] (ca. 300 BCE-300 CE), named after an archaeological site near Tokyo.&lt;ref name="imamura" /&gt;

Within Hokkaido, the Jōmon is succeeded by the [[Zoku-Jōmon]] (post-Jōmon) or Epi-Jōmon period, which is in turn succeeded by the [[Satsumon culture]] around the 7th century.

== Foundation myths ==
The [[origin myth]]s of [[culture of Japan|Japanese civilization]] extend back to periods now regarded as part of the Jōmon period, though they show little or no relation to what we know archaeologically of Jōmon culture. 11 February 660 BCE is the traditional founding date of the Japanese nation by [[Emperor Jimmu]]. This version of Japanese history, however, comes from the country's first written records, the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', dating from the 6th to the 8th centuries, after Japan had adopted [[Chinese characters]] ([[Go-on]]/[[Kan-on]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:沖森 卓也|OKimori Takuya]] "日本の漢字1600年の歴史 (1600 years of history in Japanese Kanji)" {{cite web |url=http://www.beret.co.jp/column/2011/10/1600.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017164014/http://www.beret.co.jp/column/2011/10/1600.html |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of modern Japanese culture may date from this period and reflect the influences of a mingled migration from the northern Asian continent and the southern Pacific areas and the Jōmon peoples. Among these elements are the precursors to [[Shinto]], some marriage customs, architectural styles, and technological developments such as [[lacquerware]], laminated [[yumi]], metalworking, and glass making.

== Genetics==
{{Disputed section|date=April 2017}}
The relationship of Jōmon people to the modern [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ([[Yamato people]]), [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]] and [[Ainu people|Ainu]] is diverse and not well clarified.

==Change of era==
* '''1661''' {{nihongo|''Kanbun gannen''|寛文元年}}: The new era name of ''Kanbun'' (meaning "Generous Art") was created to mark a number of disasters including a great fire at the Imperial Palace. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Manji'' 4.

==Events of the ''Kanbun'' era==
* '''March 20, 1662''' (''Kanbun 2, 1st day of the 2nd month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 寛文二年二月一日  --&gt;: There was a violent earthquake in [[Heian-kyō]] which destroyed the tomb of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] .&lt;ref name="t413"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg8oAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=editions:OCLC63259938#PRA1-PA413,M1  p. 413.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1620''' (''Kanbun 2''): Emperor Gosai ordered [[Tosa Hiromichi]] (土佐広通, 1561–1633), a [[Tosa school|Tosa-school]] disciple, to adopt the name Sumiyoshi (probably in reference to a 13th-century painter, [[Sumiyoshi Keinin]] 住吉慶忍), upon assuming a position as official painter for the Sumiyoshi Taisha 住吉大社.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sumiyoshiha.htm "Sumiyoshi" in Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (JAANUS) Internet article (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''March 5, 1663''' (''Kanbun 3, 26th day of the 1st month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc  寛文三年一月二十六日 --&gt;:  Go-sai abdicated in favor of his younger brother, Satohito, aged 10; and then he lived in complete retirement until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg8oAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=editions:OCLC63259938#PRA1-PA413,M1  p. 413;] Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''June 6, 1663''' (''Kanbun 3, 1st day of the 5th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 寛文三年五月一日  --&gt;: An earthquake struck in [[Ōmi Province]].&lt;ref name="t413"/&gt;
* '''1665''' (''Kanbun 5, 6th month''): Courts of inquiry were established in all the villages of the empire. These courts were charged with discovering the faith of the inhabitants, and their express purpose was to discover and eradicate all remnants of Christianity and Christian believers in Japan.
* '''1668''' (''Kanbun 8, 1st day of the 2nd month'')&lt;!-- Nengo Calc 寛文八年一月二日 --&gt;: A major fire broke out in Edo—a conflagration lasting 45 days. The disastrous fire was attributed to arson. Residents of Edo and later historians of the period also called this the fire of the eighth year of ''Kanbun.''&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1669''' (''Kanbun 9''): An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] rebellion, [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669–1672), breaks out in [[Hokkaido]] against the [[Matsumae clan]]
* '''1670''' (''Kanbun 10''): The [[Bonin Islands]] (''Ogasawara'' Islands) are discovered by the Japanese when a ship bound for Edo from Kyūshū is blown off course by a storm.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Hiroyuki.

== Early career ==
Barwick graduated from [[Syracuse University]] and also attended [[Harvard University]] as a Loeb Fellow.&lt;ref name="mas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/summitnyc/speakers/kent-l-barwick/|title=Kent L. Barwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation, he became involved in the [[Historic Preservation]] movement after telephoning [[The New Yorker]]'s prolific writer [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joe Mitchell]] regarding a project in [[Cooper Square]]. “In those days you could call The New Yorker and ask to speak to Joe Mitchell, and you could get him," explained Barwick in [[The New York Times]]. "Can you imagine?"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
Barwick began a long professional relationship with The Municipal Art Society in 1969.&lt;ref name="mas.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/awards/jkomedal/|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal (JKO) –  The Municipal Art Society of New York|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1975, the [[New York State Supreme Court]] overturned [[Grand Central Terminal]]'s New York City Landmark status, which opened the door to a demolition plan by the bankrupt [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] railroad.&lt;ref name="mas.org1"/&gt; Penn Central planned to demolish the structure, by then shabby, cluttered and dark, in favor of a [[Marcel Breuer]]-designed structure in an effort to raise desperately-needed funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untappedcities.com/2013/03/28/the-new-york-city-that-never-was-grand-central-terminal-towers/|title=The New York City that Never Was: Grand Central Terminal Towers|work=Untapped Cities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barwick and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] successfully campaigned to halt the plan and preserve the station by taking the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Grand Central Terminal Survived the Wrecking Ball - And Lived to 100|url = http://www.wnyc.org/story/283953-how-grand-central-terminal-survived-the-wrecking-ball-and-lived-to-100/|website = WNYC|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ostia antica - s Aurea - Leone Marsicano 1020496.JPG|thumb|Modern bust of Leo]]
'''Leo Marsicanus''' (meaning "of the [[Marsi]]") or '''Ostiensis''' (meaning "of [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]]"), also known as '''Leone dei Conti di Marsi''' (1046, [[Marsica]] &amp;ndash; 1115/7, [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]]), was a nobleman and monk of [[Monte Cassino]] around 1061 and Italian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from the 12th century.

In Monte Cassino, he became a friend of Desiderius of Benevento, later [[Pope Victor III]], and it was to him that Leo dedicated his most famous work as an historian and chronicler, being a librarian: the '''''Chronicon monasterii Casinensis''''', usually called the Montecassino Chronicle in English. The chronicler depends largely on [[Amatus of Montecassino|Amatus]]' earlier work, but also on oral traditions and other archives. Leo finished it at 1075; it is continued by other monastic librarian [[Peter the Deacon]].

[[Pope Urban II]] created him [[cardinal deacon]] in 1088 with the [[Cardinal-deaconry|deaconry]] of ''Ss. Vito e Modesto''. In 1101, [[Pope Paschal II]] promoted him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]-[[bishop]] of [[bishop of Ostia|Ostia]]. In 1105 he was appointed cardinal - bishop of   [[bishop of Velletri|Velletri]] until his death.

'''Lorentz Henrik Segelcke Dietrichson''' (1 January 1834 [[Bergen]] - 6 March 1917) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[poet]] and [[art historian|historian of art]] and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Lorentz_Henrik_Segelcke_Dietrichson ''Lorentz Henrik Segelcke Dietrichson'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lorentz Henrik Segelcke Dietrichson was the son of Fredrik Dietrichson (1800–52) and  Marie Heiberg Dahl (1808–83).  Dietrichson grew up in Bergen as an only child in a home of cultural officials interested in the parents' social circle.  While an undergraduate in the [[University of Christiania]], he composed many clever student songs which were collected and published in 1859. After school graduation in 1853 at the University of Christiania and other exams the following year he began to study theology, but he was more keen to cultivate their literary and artistic interests.

For a time he served as instructor at [[Uppsala University]] and subsequently for three years was secretary to the Norwegian minister at [[Rome]]. On his return he became connected with the administration of the [[Nationalmuseum]] in Stockholm. In 1869, he was appointed professor in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] in Stockholm. Six years later he moved to the University of Christiania as professor of the history of art.

He published several volumes mostly dealing with Norwegian art in the Middle Ages. He published  ''Læredigtet i Nordens poetiske Literatur '' (1860), ''Kivle-Slaatten. Thema og Variationer over et norsk Folkesagn. Et polemisk Digt'' (1879) and numerous other works. After examining  Danish  and Swedish 18th century literature,  he published two-volume ''Omrids af den norske Poesis Historie'' (1866-1869). It was the first presentation of Norway's history and development of literature from folk tales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lorentz_Dietrichson/utdypning ''Lorentz Dietrichson – utdypning'' (NBL-artikkel)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis-Frédéric Brugère''' (8 October 1823 [[Orléans]] &amp;ndash; 11 April 1888, [[Issy]]) was a Roman Catholic professor of [[apologetics]] and church history.

He studied with the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]] at St. Euverte, and at the Petit Séminaire of Orléans. His poem of 300 lines describing an inundation of the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] and composed in 1841 was printed and sold for the benefit of the flood victims at [[Lyon]]. He entered the Grand Séminaire of Orléans in 1841 and the Paris Séminaire in 1845, where he received the degrees of Bachelor of Licentiate and Doctor. From 1846 to 1861, with the exception of two years spent as assistant in the parish of St. Aignan, Brugère taught the classics and philosophy in the Orléans diocesan college of La Chapelle-saint-Mesmin. In 1862 he entered the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice]] and was appointed professor of apologetics in the seminary of Paris where, in 1868, he occupied the chair of church history in addition to his other labours.

Brugère's teaching was characterized by rare tact and discernment. It was his conviction that, in order to assist in the establishment of communication between the naturally darkened mind and the radiance of revealed truth, the Christian apologist must consider the individual mental attitudes of those whom he would direct. Thus he was a strong advocate of the ''methodus ascendens ab intrinseco'', which was introduced towards the end of the fifteenth century, described in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[It] holds that the apologist should first arouse interest by setting forth the needy condition of the human soul, with its problems unsolved and its cravings unsatisfied; then gradually suggest the unchanging organization which offers satisfaction and peace. Curiosity and interest thus intensified, and the admirable adjustment of Christianity to the needs of the soul once recognized, fairmindedness urging further research, the honest inquirer will learn how moral certitude, though differing from metaphysical and physical certitude, is nevertheless true certitude, excluding all reasonable fear of error, and is not to be confounded with probability, however great. Thus, only when prepared to recognize in the genuine miracle the credentials of the Divinity, may this inquirer be conducted back through history, from fulfilment to prediction, in the hope of discovering, by well authenticated miracles, that the Almighty has stamped as His own the Christianity preserved, defended, and explained by His one true Church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such, in brief outline, is the method advocated in ''De Verâ Religione'' and ''De Ecclesia'', two treatises which Brugère published in 1873. In addition to these treatises, Brugère published ''Tableau de l'histoire et de la littérature de l'Eglise''. But it is chiefly as a professor that Brugère is remembered. Gifted with a remarkable memory, his mind was a storehouse of exact information which he freely imparted, embellishing it with anecdote and illustration, so that students gladly sought him out for pleasure and profit.

The '''National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program'''&lt;ref name=GAO2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DHSDogs /&gt;&lt;ref name=HarveyDogs /&gt; is a program administered by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] which uses law enforcement and TSA-run explosive [[detection dog]] teams to detect explosives in transportation environments.&lt;ref name=GAO2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/651725.pdf|format=PDF|title=TSA EXPLOSIVES DETECTION CANINE PROGRAM : Actions Needed to Analyze Data and Ensure Canine Teams Are Effectively Utilized|publisher=Government Accountability Office|website=GAO.gov|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675604.pdf|format=PDF|title=EXPLOSIVES DETECTION CANINES : TSA Has Enhanced Its Canine Program, but Opportunities May Exist to Reduce Costs|publisher=Government Accountability Office|website=GAO.gov|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The program was originally started in 1972 by the TSA's predecessor, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]&lt;ref name=GAO2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DHSDogs /&gt;&lt;ref name=HarveyDogs /&gt;, who at the time, was responsible for [[aviation security]] in the United States. The program paired airport-based law enforcement officers with conventional explosive detection canines to detect explosives in objects such as vehicles and baggage.&lt;ref name=GAO2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO2013 /&gt;

Following the [[September 11th attacks]], which resulted in the creation of TSA, the NEDCTP was transferred from the FAA to TSA and was completed by March 2003. In the following years, TSA expanded the LEO teams to other modes of transportation, such as mass transit. In January 2008, TSA began deploying their own unarmed teams where regulatory transportation security inspectors (TSIs) were paired with a canine to screen [[air cargo]]. In 2011, TSA furthered the program by launching passenger screening canine (PSC) teams, which are explosive detection canines who besides detecting explosives in objects, can also detect explosives hidden on a person.&lt;ref name=GAO2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO2013 /&gt;

== Canines and training ==
TSA sources their canines from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Military Working Dog program. The canines are trained at TSA's Canine Training Center, located at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], also home to DOD's Military Working Dog program.&lt;ref name=DHSDogs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsa.gov/news/testimony/2016/03/03/hearing-dogs-dhs-how-canine-programs-contribute-homeland-security |title=Dogs of DHS: How Canine Programs Contribute to Homeland Security |last=Hutchinson |first=Kimberly |date=March 3, 2016 |website=TSA.gov |publisher=Transportation Security Administration |access-date=October 30, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarveyDogs /&gt;&lt;ref name=K9Factsheet /&gt;

TSA uses the following breeds of canine for explosive detection work:
*[[Belgian Malinois]]
*[[German Shepherd]]
*[[German Shorthaired Pointer]]
*[[German Wirehaired Pointer]] 
*[[Golden Retriever]]
*[[Labrador Retriever]]
*[[Vizsla]]&lt;ref name=K9Factsheet&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/caninetrainingcenter_factsheet_0.pdf|format=PDF|title=TSA Canine Training Center Factsheet |publisher=Transportation Security Administration|website=TSA.gov|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of explosive detection canines trained by TSA:
*Conventional explosive detection canines (EDC) who undergo a 10-week training course accompanied by either an assigned LEO or TSA handler. EDCs are trained to recognize explosive odors coming from baggage and vehicles.&lt;ref name=DHSDogs /&gt;&lt;ref name=K9Factsheet /&gt;
*Passenger screening canines (PSC) who undergo a 12-week training course accompanied by their TSA handler. PSCs are trained to recognize explosive odors on passengers plus odors from objects as an EDC does.&lt;ref name=DHSDogs /&gt;&lt;ref name=K9Factsheet /&gt;

TSA operates 372 canine teams&lt;ref name=HarveyDogs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsa.gov/news/testimony/2017/05/18/border-disasters-and-beyond-critical-canine-contributions-dhs-mission |title=From the Border to Disasters and Beyond: Critical Canine Contributions to the DHS Mission |last=Harvey |first=Melanie |date=May 18, 2017 |website=TSA.gov |publisher=Transportation Security Administration |access-date=October 30, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a Transportation Security Specialist - Explosive Detection Canine Handler (TSS-EDCH) and a canine. Prior to 2017, the handler was classified as a Transportation Security Inspector - EDCH. The remaining 675 NEDCTP teams are made up state and local law enforcement handlers.

'''Odessa''' (also known as '''Odesa'''; {{lang-uk|Оде́са}} {{IPA-uk|ɔˈdɛsɐ|}}; {{lang-ru|Оде́сса}} {{IPA-ru|ɐˈdʲesə|}}; {{lang-yi|אַדעס}}) is the third most populous city of [[Ukraine]] and a major tourism center, seaport and transportation hub located on the northwestern shore of the [[Black Sea]]. It is also the [[administrative center]] of the [[Odessa Oblast]] and a multiethnic cultural center. Odessa is sometimes called the "pearl of the Black Sea",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/07/01/418905297/whos-behind-a-string-of-bombings-in-ukraines-black-sea-pearl |title=Who's Behind A String Of Bombings In Ukraine's Black Sea 'Pearl'?|website=NPR|year=2015|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "South Capital" (under the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]]), and "Southern [[Palmyra]]".&lt;ref name=about_region&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbUfDC9xE5s Tell about Ukraine.

Before the Tsarist establishment of Odessa, an [[ancient Greek]] settlement existed at its location as elsewhere along the northwestern Black Sea coast. A relatively more recent [[Tatars|Tatar]] settlement was also founded at the location by [[Hacı I Giray]], the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]] in 1440 that was named after him as "Hacıbey".&lt;ref&gt;Pultar, Gonul. {{Google books|KhiQAwAAQBAJ|Imagined Identities: Identity Formation in the Age of Globalization|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} After a period of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duchy]] control, Hacibey and surroundings became part of the domain of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]]s in 1529 and remained there until the empire's defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1792.

In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the [[Russian Empire|Russian empress]] [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a [[list of free ports|free port]]. During the Soviet period it was the most important port of trade in the [[Soviet Union]] and a Soviet [[naval dockyard|naval base]]. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and [[free economic zone]] for a period of 25 years.

Odessa is a [[warm-water port]]. The city of Odessa hosts both the [[Port of Odessa]] and [[Yuzhne|Port Yuzhne]], a significant oil [[container terminal|terminal]] situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, [[Port of Chornomorsk|Chornomorsk]], is located in the same [[oblast]], to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major [[transport hub]] integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic [[pipeline transport|pipelines]].

== Name ==
The city was named in compliance with the [[Greek Plan]] of Catherine the Great. It was named after the ancient Greek city of [[Varna#Antiquity and Bulgarian conquest|Odessos]], which was mistakenly believed to have been located here. Odessa is located in between the ancient Greek cities of [[Tyras]] and [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], different from the ancient Odessos's location further west along the coast, which is at present day [[Varna]], Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcfLKHVi2UUC&amp;pg=PA254|title=The Greek Settlements in Thrace Until the Macedonian Conquest|first=Benjamin H.|last=Isaac|date=1 January 1986|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine's [[secretary of state]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Adrian Gribovsky|ru|3=Грибовский, Адриан Моисеевич}} claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 "Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors"], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'',

=== Early history ===
[[File:Античный музей на бульваре.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Remains of ancient Greek settlement (under glass roof) on Primorsky Boulevard in Odessa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaguide.net/sights_excavationsite.ru.html|title=Одесские достопримечательности — раскопки греческого поселения|first=Igor|last=Kalinin|date=|work=odessaguide.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Odessa was the site of a large [[Greek colony|Greek settlement]] no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a [[necropolis]] from the 5th–3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]]. Whether the Bay of Odessa is the ancient "Port of the Histrians" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence.&lt;ref&gt;"The Greek Colonisation of the Black Sea Area: Historical Interpretation of Archaeology," December 1998, Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. (ed.), ''Franz Steiner Verlag'', p. 41, n. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artifact (archaeology)|Archaeological artifacts]] confirm extensive links between the Odessa area and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

In the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odessa region included various [[nomad]]ic tribes ([[Pechenegs|Petchenegs]], [[Cumans]]), the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Crimean Khanate]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Yedisan]] [[Crimean Tatars]] traded there in the 14th century.

During the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Hacı I Giray]] of [[Crimea]] (1441–1466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odessa was then a fortress known as [[Khadjibey]] (named for Hacı I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in [[Modern English|English]], Hacıbey or Hocabey in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and Hacıbey in [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]). It was part of the [[Dykra]] region. However, most of the rest of the area remained largely uninhabited in this period.

=== Ottoman Yedisan ===
Khadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529 as part of a region known as Yedisan, and was administered in the Ottoman [[Silistra Province, Ottoman Empire|Silistra (Özi) Province]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the [[Fortification|fortress]] at Khadjibey (also was known Hocabey), which was named ''Yeni Dünya'' (literally "New World"). Hocabey was a [[sanjak]] centre of [[Silistre]] Province.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== In the Russian Empire ===

[[File:CASTELNAU(1827) p3.039 PLAN DE LA VILLE D' ODESSA EN 1814.jpg|thumb|240px|Plan of Odessa in 1814]]
The sleepy fishing village that Odessa had been saw a step-change in its fortunes when the wealthy [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnate]] and future [[Voivode]] of [[Kiev]] (1791), [[Antoni Protazy Potocki]], set up trade routes through the port for the ''Polish Black Sea Trading Company'' and set up the infrastructure in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;Łubieński, Tomasz Wentworth. (1886). ''Henryk Łubieński i jego bracia: wspomnenia rodzinne odnoszące się do historyi Królestwa Polskiego i Banku Polskiego''. Warsaw: Księg. G. Gebethner, p.41 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russian-Turkish War of 1787–1792]], on 25 September 1789, a detachment of the   [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian forces]] including Zaporozhian [[Cossacks]] under [[Alexander Suvorov]] and [[Ivan Gudovich]] took Khadjibey and Yeni Dünya for the [[Russian Empire]]. One part of the troops came under command of a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] in Russian service, [[Major General]] [[José de Ribas]] (known in Russia as Osip Mikhailovich Deribas), and the main street in Odessa today, [[Deribasivska Street]], is named after him. Russia formally gained possession of the area as a result of the [[Treaty of Jassy]] (Iaşi) in 1792 and it became a part of [[Novorossiya]] ("New Russia").

The city of Odessa, founded by [[Catherine the Great]], Russian Empress, centers on the site of the Turkish fortress Khadzhibei, which was occupied by Russian Army in 1789. Flemish engineer working for the empress, Franz de Volan ([[François Sainte de Wollant]]) recommended the area of Khadzhibei fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed and would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Governor General of Novorossiya, [[Platon Zubov]] (one of Catherine's favorites) supported this proposal, and in 1794 Catherine approved the founding of the new port-city and invested the first money in constructing the city.

[[File:Odessa vlasenko.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ivan Martos]]'s statue of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]] in Odessa]]

However, adjacent to the new official locality, a [[Moldavia]]n colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement known under the name of [[Moldavanka]]. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odessa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey (since 1795 Odessa proper), on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odessa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.&lt;ref name="Richardson, p.110"&gt;[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox church]], the [[Church of the Dormition (Odessa)|Church of the Dormition]], built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as of a cemetery. Nearby stood the [[barracks|military barracks]] and the country houses (''[[dacha]]'') of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], appointed by Tzar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as Governor of Odessa in 1803.

[[File:Большая Московская.jpg|thumb|upright|right|In the mid-19th century Odessa became a resort town famed for its popularity among the Russian upper classes. This popularity prompted a new age of investment in the building of hotels and leisure projects.]]

In the period from 1795 to 1814 the population of Odessa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="UKRWorld"/&gt; Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odessa's central district, such as the Italians [[Francesco Carlo Boffo]] and [[Giovanni Torricelli]], Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes and squares remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="Richardson, p.110"/&gt;

The new city quickly became a major success although initially it received little state funding and privileges.&lt;ref name="older settlements already"&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (18 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Its early growth owed much to the work of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the [[French Revolution]], he had served in [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine's]] army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered{{by whom|date=August 2011}} one of the founding fathers of Odessa, together with another Frenchman, Count [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|Andrault de Langeron]], who succeeded him in office. Richelieu is commemorated by a [[bronze sculpture|bronze statue]], unveiled in 1828 to a design by [[Ivan Martos]]. His contributions to the city are mentioned by [[Mark Twain]] in his travelogue ''[[The Innocents Abroad|Innocents Abroad]]'': "I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa – watched over it with paternal care – labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests – spent his fortune freely to the same end – endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World".
[[File:CP Odessa Dom Russova circa 1920s.JPG|left|thumb|By the early 1900s Odessa had become a large, thriving city, complete with European architecture and electrified urban transport.]]

In 1819, the city became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. It became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous "ethnic" names on the city's map, for example ''Frantsuzky'' (French) and ''Italiansky'' (Italian) Boulevards, ''Grecheskaya'' (Greek), ''Yevreyskaya'' (Jewish), ''Arnautskaya'' (Albanian) Streets). Its [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] nature was documented by the great [[List of Russian language poets|Russian poet]] [[Alexander Pushkin]], who lived in [[exile|internal exile]] in Odessa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters he wrote that Odessa was a city where "the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read".

Odessa's growth was interrupted by the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–1856, during which it was bombarded by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Second French Empire|Imperial French]] naval forces.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Pointing, ''The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth'', Chatto &amp; Windus, London, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7011-7390-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odessa Russia's largest grain-exporting port. In 1866, the city was linked by rail with [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]] as well as with [[Iaşi]] in Romania.

[[File:potemkinstairs.jpg|thumb|right|The 142-metre-long [[Potemkin Stairs]] (constructed 1837–1841), made famous by [[Sergei Eisenstein]] in his movie ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925).]]

The city became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37% of the population. The community, however, was repeatedly subjected to [[anti-Semitism]] and anti-Jewish agitation from almost all Christian segments of the population.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Odessa |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/odessa |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pogrom]]s were carried out in [[Odessa pogrom|1821, 1859, 1871, 1881 and 1905]]. Many Odessan Jews fled abroad after 1882, particularly to the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] region that became [[Palestine (region)#Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods|Palestine]], and the city became an important base of support for [[Zionism]].

=== Beginnings of revolution ===
[[File:Entry of the Red Army in Odessa, April 1919.jpg|thumb|Bolshevik troops entering Odessa]]
In 1905, Odessa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[Iskra]]. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s famous motion picture ''The Battleship Potemkin'' commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odessan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the "Potemkin Steps"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]]. The actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odessa to see the site of the "slaughter". The "Odessa Steps" continue to be a [[tourist attraction]] in Odessa. The film was made at [[Odessa Film Studio|Odessa's Cinema Factory]], one of the oldest cinema studios in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bolsheviks enter odessa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Army|Bolshevik forces]] enter Odessa, February 1920]] --&gt;
Following the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917 during [[Ukrainian-Soviet War]], Odessa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the [[Odessa Bolshevik Uprising|second of which]] succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months the city became a center of the [[Odessa Soviet Republic]]. After signing of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], providing support to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name=UkrainianWeekOd16042018&gt;{{cite | last = Tynchenko | first = Yaros | title = The Ukrainian Navy and the Crimean Issue in 1917-18 | url = http://ukrainianweek.com/History/105648 | work = [[The Ukrainian Week]] | date = 23 March 2018 | accessdate = October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the [[World War I]] and withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Few months later the city was occupied by the [[French Army]] and the [[Greek Army]] that supported the Russian [[White movement|White Army]] in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the unwelcome [[Triple Entente]] forces out of the city, but Odessa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. Finally by 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city.

The people of Odessa suffered badly from a [[famine]] that resulted from the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1921–1922 due to the Soviet policies of [[prodrazverstka]].&lt;gallery mode="packed-hover" caption="Revolutionary soldiers, Odessa - 1916" heights="200"&gt;

=== World War II ===
Odessa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941. The [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|defense of Odessa]] lasted 73 days from 5 August to 16 October 1941. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} long and situated some {{convert|25|to|30|km|abbr=off}} from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated {{convert|6|to|8|km|abbr=off}} from the city and was about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} long. The third and last line of defense was organised inside the city itself.

[[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Soviet Union|A medal]], [[Medal "For the Defence of Odessa"|"For the Defence of Odessa"]], was established on 22 December 1942. Approximately 38,000 people were awarded to servicemen of the Soviet Army, Navy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and civil citizens who took part in the city's defence. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of "[[Hero City]]" in 1945.  These others were ( [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Sevastopol]].

[[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odessa. Her first two kills were effected near Belyayevka using a Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle with a P.E. 4-power scope. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during defense of Odessa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totalled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).

Before being occupied by Romanian troops in 1941, a part of the city's population, industry, infrastructure and all cultural valuables possible were evacuated to inner regions of the USSR and the retreating Red Army units destroyed as much as they could of Odessa's remaining harbour facilities. The city was [[land mine|land mined]] in the same way as Kiev.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During [[World War II]], from 1941–1944, Odessa was subject to [[Romania during World War II|Romanian]] administration, as the city had been made part of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nataliya and Yuri Kruglyak, KRT Web Studio at www.webservicestudio..com, Odessa, Ukraine |url=http://www.odessitclub.org/en/archives/dallin/chapter_5.html#Elite |title=Odessa population during WWII |publisher=Odessitclub.org |accessdate=28 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929073610/http://www.odessitclub.org/en/archives/dallin/chapter_5.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partisan fighting continued, however, in the [[Odessa Catacombs|city's catacombs]].

[[File:Odessa Soviet artilery.JPG|right|thumb|Soviet gun crew in action at Odessa in 1941]]

Following the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|Siege of Odessa]], and the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupation, approximately 25,000 Odessans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]]. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80% of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed,&lt;ref name="Richardson, p.33"&gt;[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/05/the-antonescu-paradox-romania-world-war-ii-hitler/|title=The Antonescu Paradox|last=|first=|date=5 February 2016|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining [[Jewish population]] to extermination camps in German [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the tragic events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Richardson, p.33"/&gt;

The city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odessa were damaged during both its siege and recapture on 10 April 1944, when the city was finally liberated by the Red Army. Some of the Odessans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering – claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Soviet policies imprisoned and executed numerous Odessans (and deported most of the German and Tatar population) on account of collaboration with the occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postwar history ===
[[File:RIAN archive 171693 Fleet of whalers lying up in Odessa port.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Ships at anchor in Odessa – the USSR's largest port, 1960]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew. Nevertheless, the majority of Odessa's Jews emigrated to [[Israel]], the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s. Many ended up in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Brighton Beach]], sometimes known as "Little Odessa". Domestic migration of the Odessan middle and [[Social class|upper classes]] to Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale. Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.

[[File:Будинок прибутковий Маврокордато.jpg|thumb|Nowadays the city is undergoing a phase of widespread urban restoration.]]
As a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the city preserved and somewhat reinforced its unique cosmopolitan mix of Russian/Ukrainian/Jewish culture and a predominantly [[Russophone]] environment with the [[:ru:Русский язык Одессы|uniquely accented dialect of Russian spoken in the city]]. The city's unique identity has been formed largely thanks of its varied demography; all the city's communities have influenced aspects of Odessan life in some way or form.

Odessa is a city of more than 1 million people. The city's industries include shipbuilding, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], chemicals, metalworking and food processing. Odessa is also a Ukrainian [[Ukrainian Navy|naval]] base and home to a [[fishing fleet]]. It is known for its large outdoor market – the [[Seventh-Kilometer Market]], the largest of its kind in Europe.

The city has seen violence in the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine]] during [[2014 Odessa clashes]]. The [[2 May 2014 Odessa clashes]] between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian protestors killed 42 people. Four were killed during the protests, and at least 32 trade unionists were killed after a trade union building was set on fire and its exits blocked by Ukrainian nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukrainian-helicopters-shot-down-pilots-killed-as-violence-breaks-out-in-eastern-city/article18385793/ |title=At least 35 killed in Odessa, Ukraine, as building set on fire |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506162417/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukrainian-helicopters-shot-down-pilots-killed-as-violence-breaks-out-in-eastern-city/article18385793/ |archivedate=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls conducted from September to December 2014 found no support for joining Russia.&lt;ref name="DT150103"/&gt;

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:Воронцовський маяк.JPG|thumb|right|The Vorontsov Lighthouse in the Gulf of Odessa. The city is located on the Black Sea.]]
Odessa is situated ({{Coord|46|28|N|30|44|E|type:city(1,012,500)_region:UA}}) on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor on the [[Black Sea]] in the [[Gulf of Odessa]], approximately {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the estuary of the [[Dniester]] river and some {{convert|443|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Ukrainian capital [[Kiev]]. The average elevation at which the city is located is around {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off}}, whilst the maximum is {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=off}} and minimum (on the coast) amounts to {{convert|4.2|m|1|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The city currently covers a territory of {{convert|163|km²|0|abbr=on}}, the population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km². Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city. Being located in the south of Ukraine, the topography of the area surrounding the city is typically flat and there are no large mountains or hills for many kilometres around. Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odessa is famous for its beautiful tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The city's location on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odessa. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The city's famous Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its many visitors. This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odessa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine, as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated.

The coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent [[landslide]]s, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city [[above sea level]] near water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherkez|first=E. A.|last2=Dragomyretska|first2=O. V.|last3=Gorokhovich|first3=Y.|date=11 November 2006|title=Landslide protection of the historical heritage in Odessa (Ukraine) |journal=Landslides|volume=3|issue=4|pages=303–309|doi=10.1007/s10346-006-0058-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a potential danger to the infrastructure and architecture of the city is the presence of multiple openings underground. These cavities can cause buildings to collapse, resulting in a loss of money and business. Due to the effects of climate and weather on sedimentary rocks beneath the city, the result is instability under some buildings' foundations.

=== Climate ===
Odessa has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'', using the {{convert|0|C|disp=sqbr}} isotherm) that borderlines the [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') as well as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') This has, over the past few centuries, aided the city greatly in creating conditions necessary for the development of summer tourism. During the tsarist era, Odessa's climate was considered to be beneficial for the body, and thus many wealthy but sickly persons were sent to the city in order to relax and recuperate. This resulted in the development of a spa culture and the establishment of a number of high-end hotels in the city. The average annual temperature of sea is {{convert|13|-|14|C}}, whilst seasonal temperatures range from an average of {{convert|6|C}} in the period from January to March, to {{convert|23|C}} in August. Typically, for a total of 4 months – from June to September – the average sea temperature in the Gulf of Odessa and city's bay area exceeds {{convert|20|C}}.&lt;ref name="weather2travel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/ukraine/odessa.php|title=Odessa Climate Guide|accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city typically experiences dry, cold winters, which are relatively mild when compared to most of Ukraine as they're marked by temperatures which rarely fall below {{convert|-10|C}}. Summers on the other hand do see an increased level of precipitation, and the city often experiences warm weather with temperatures often reaching into the high 20s and low 30s. Snow cover is often light or moderate, and municipal services rarely experience the same problems that can often be found in other, more northern, Ukrainian cities. This is largely because the higher winter temperatures and coastal location of Odessa prevent significant snowfall. Additionally the city hardly ever faces the phenomenon of sea-freezing.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2001 census, [[Ukrainians]] make up a majority (62 percent) of Odessa's inhabitants, along with an ethnic [[Russians|Russian]] minority (29 percent).&lt;ref name=Census2001&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/nationality/odesa/ |title=All-Ukrainian Census of 2001 Official Site |publisher=2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study by the [[International Republican Institute]] found that 68% of Odessa was ethnic Ukrainian, and 25% ethnic Russian.&lt;ref name=iri1/&gt;

Despite the Ukrainian majority, [[Russian language]] is dominant in the city. In 2015, the languages spoken at home were [[Russian language|Russian]] – 78%, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] – 6%, and an equal combination of Ukrainian and Russian – 15%.&lt;ref name=iri1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ukrainian Municipal Survey, March 2–20, 2015|journal=IRI|url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odessa oblast is also home to a number of other nationalities and minority [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Albanians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], among others.&lt;ref name=Census2001/&gt; Up until the early 1940s the city also had a large Jewish population. As the result of [[Holocaust|mass deportation to extermination camps]] during the [[Second World War]], the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]] and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community.

Through most of the 19th century and until the mid 20th century the largest ethnic group in Odessa was [[Russians]], with the second largest ethnic group being the [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Dnistryansky, М.S.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
[[File:Odessa's city hall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Odessa City Hall]], the seat of the city's municipal authorities]]
Whilst Odessa is the [[Capital city|administrative centre]] of the [[Odessa Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), the city is also the main constituent of the Odessa Municipality. However, since Odessa is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]], this makes the city subject directly to the administration of the oblast's authorities, thus removing it from the responsibility of the municipality.

The city of Odessa is governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget is also controlled by the administration.

The mayoralty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/ua/mayor |title=Official Website of the city administration: Structure of the Mayorality |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration. Above all comes the mayor, who is elected, by the city's electorate, for five years in a direct election. [[Ukrainian local elections, 2015#Odessa|2015 Mayoral election of Odessa]] [[Gennadiy Trukhanov]] was reelected in the first round of the election with 52,9% of the vote.&lt;ref name="en.interfax.com.ua"/&gt;

There are five deputy mayors, each of which is responsible for a certain particular part of the city's public policy.
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b42 726-0.jpg|right|thumb|An old map of Odessa's city centre.  North is to the left.]]
The City Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/council/ |title=Official Website of the city administration: City Council |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the city makes up the administration's [[legislative]] branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or [[rada]]. The municipal council is made up of 120 elected members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/ua/council/members/ |title=City Council members |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council is the fifth in the city's modern history, and was elected in January 2011. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city's budget is drawn up. The council has seventeen standing commissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/council/commissions/ |title=Official Website of the city administration, Standing commissions of the City Council |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which play an important role in controlling the finances and trading practices of the city and its merchants.

The territory of Odessa is divided into four administrative [[raion]]s (districts):
* Kyivsky Raion ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Киевский район, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Київський район)
* Malynovsky Raion (Russian: Малиновский район, {{lang-uk|Малиновський район}})
* Prymorsky Raion (Russian: Приморский район, {{lang-uk|Приморський район}})
* Suvorovsky Raion (Russian, Суворовский Район, {{lang-uk|Суворовський район}})

In addition, every [[raion]] has its own administration, subordinate to the Odessa [[City council]], and with limited responsibilities.

Many of Odessa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the Italian [[Francesco Boffo]], who in early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odessa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the [[Potocki Palace, Odessa|Potocki Palace]] and many other public buildings.

[[File:Opera2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque architecture#Rome and Southern Italy|Italian baroque]] facade of the [[Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater]].]]
In 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed – the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by [[Ferdinand Fellner|Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer|Helmer]] in [[neo-baroque]]; its luxurious hall was built in the [[rococo]] style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's famous [[Semperoper]] built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings for Music, Michael Forsythe, Cambridge University Press, p. 344 {{ISBN|9780521268622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ekaterininskay square Odessa 2010.JPG|thumb|left|The centre of Odessa, with its statue of [[Catherine the Great]], is one of the city's central landmark.]]
Odessa's most iconic symbol, the [[Potemkin Stairs|Potemkin Steps]] (Primorsky Stairs) is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by [[Sergei Eisenstein]] in his film, [[Battleship Potemkin|The Battleship Potemkin]].

Most of the city's 19th-century houses were built of [[limestone]] mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local [[smuggling|smugglers]]. This created a gigantic complicated [[labyrinth]] of underground tunnels beneath Odessa, known as "[[Odessa Catacombs]]". During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Приморский бульвар, 11.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Londonskaya Hotel]], on Odessa's magnificent Primorsky Bulvar, is one of the city's landmark buildings.]]

Deribasivska Street, an attractive pedestrian avenue named after José de Ribas, the Spanish-born founder of Odessa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and magnificent architecture. During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous cafés, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |title=Deribasovskaya Street|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104105310/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |archivedate=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Primorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most beautiful, imposing buildings are to be found.

As one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odessa's port is busy all year round. The Odessa Sea Port is located on an artificial stretch of Black Sea coast, along the north-western part of the Gulf of Odessa. The total shoreline length of Odessa's sea port is around {{convert|7.23|km|2|abbr=out}}. The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters. The port is able to handle up to 14 million tons of cargo and about 24&amp;nbsp;million tons of oil products annually, whilst its passenger terminals can cater for around 4&amp;nbsp;million passengers a year at full capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |title=The Passage|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104104712/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |archivedate=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Украина, Одесса - Свято-Преображенский кафедральный собор 02.jpg|left|thumb|The city's Preobrazhensky Park surrounds its cathedral.]]
There are a number of public parks and gardens in Odessa, among these are the Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks, the latter of which is an arboretum. The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens.

The [[Odessa city garden|City Garden]], or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odessa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odessa, [[José de Ribas]]) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odessa. The transfer of ownership took place on 10 November 1806. Nowadays the garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played.

Odessa's largest park, [[Shevchenko Park (Odessa)|Shevchenko Park]] (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by Emperor Alexander II. The park covers an area of around {{convert|700|by|900|m|ft|abbr=off}} and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there is a wide variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, wide pedestrian avenues and natural beauty. In the center of the park one can find the local top-flight football team's [[Chornomorets Stadium]], the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet [[Taras Shevchenko]].

== Education ==
[[File:Odesa National scientific library-03.jpg|left|thumb|The Odessa National Scientific Library is a major research library, and centre for study, in southern Ukraine.]]
Odessa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education. The city's best-known and most prestigious university is the [[Odessa National University|Odessa 'I.I. Mechnikov' National University]]. This university is the oldest in the city and was first founded by an edict of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1865 as the Imperial Novorossiysk University. Since then the university has developed to become one of modern Ukraine's leading research and teaching universities, with staff of around 1,800 and total of thirteen academic faculties. Other than the National University, the city is also home to the 1921-inaugurated [[OSEU|Odessa National Economic University]], the [[Odessa National Medical University]] (founded 1900), the 1918-founded [[Odessa National Polytechnic University]] and the Odessa National Maritime University (established 1930).
[[File:Odesa Olgivska-4 0-1.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the Odessa National Medical University.]]
In addition to these universities, the city is home to the Odessa Law Academy, the National Academy of Telecommunications and the [[Odessa National Maritime Academy]]. The last of these institutions is a highly specialised and prestigious establishment for the preparation and training of merchant mariners which sees around 1,000 newly qualified officer cadets graduate each year and take up employment in the [[merchant marine]]s of numerous countries around the world. The South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University is also based in the city, this is one of the largest institutions for the preparation of educational specialists in Ukraine and is recognised as one of the country's finest of such universities.

In addition to all the state-run universities mentioned above, Odessa is also home to a large number of private educational institutes and academies which offer highly specified courses in a range of different subjects. These establishments, however, typically charge much higher fees than government-owned establishments and may not have hold the same level of official accreditation as their state-run peers. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

With regard to primary and secondary education, Odessa has a large number of schools catering for all ages from kindergarten through to lyceum (final secondary school level) age. Most of these schools are state-owned and operated, and all schools have to be state-accredited in order to teach children.

=== Museums, art and music ===
[[File:Odessa arheological museum.JPG|thumb|left|Odessa Archaeological Museum was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] just like many other landmarks of the city.]]
The [[Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art]] is arguably Odessa's most important museum; it has large European collections from the 16–20th centuries along with the art from the East on display. There are paintings from [[Caravaggio]], [[Pierre Mignard|Mignard]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], Teniers and Del Piombo. Also of note is the city's [[Odessa Pushkin Museum|Alexander Pushkin Museum]], which is dedicated to detailing the short time [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] spent in exile in Odessa, a period during which he continued to write. The poet also has a city street named after him, as well as a statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Travel-News/Odessa-The-Star-of-Exile|title=Odessa: The Star of Exile|author=|date=|work=jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other museums in the city include the [[Odessa Archeological Museum]], which is housed in a beautiful neoclassical building, the renowned [[Odessa Numismatics Museum]], the [[Odessa Art Museum]], the [[Odessa Museum of the Regional History]], Museum of Heroic Defense of Odessa (411th Battery).

Among the city's public sculptures, two sets of ''[[Medici lions]]'' can be noted, at the [[Vorontsov Palace (Odessa)|Vorontsov Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:Category:Medici lions at Vorontsov palace in Odessa]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Starosinnyi Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:File:Starosinnyi Garden.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]], the major star of the [[Yiddish theatre]] in New York and father of the actor, director and teacher [[Stella Adler]], was born and spent his youth in Odessa. The most popular Russian show business people from Odessa are [[Yakov Smirnoff]] (comedian), [[Mikhail Zhvanetsky]] (legendary [[List of humorists|humorist]] writer, who began his career as a port engineer) and Roman Kartsev (comedian {{Interlanguage link multi|Карцев, Роман Андреевич|ru}}). Zhvanetsky's and Kartsev's success in the 1970s, along with Odessa's [[KVN]] team, contributed to Odessa's established status as "capital of Soviet humor", culminating in the annual [[Humorina|Humoryna]] festival, carried out around the beginning of April.

Odessa was also the home of the late Armenian painter [[Sarkis Ordyan]] (1918–2003), the Ukrainian painter [[Mickola Vorokhta]] and the Greek philologist, author and promoter of [[Modern Greek|Demotic Greek]] [[Ioannis Psycharis]] (1854–1929). [[Yuri Siritsov]], bass player of the Israeli Metal band PallaneX is originally from Odessa. [[Igor Glazer]] Production Manager [[Baruch Agadati]] (1895–1976), the Israeli classical ballet dancer, choreographer, painter, and film producer and director grew up in Odessa, as did Israeli artist and author [[Nachum Gutman]] (1898–1980). Israeli painter [[Avigdor Stematsky]] (1908–89) was born in Odessa.

[[File:Bunina-15-135.jpg|thumb|The main hall of the Odessa Philharmonic Society's theatre.]]
Odessa produced one of the founders of the Soviet violin school, [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]]. It has also produced many musicians, including the violinists [[Nathan Milstein]], [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Igor Oistrakh]], [[Boris Goldstein]], [[Zakhar Bron]] and pianists [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], [[Vladimir de Pachmann]], [[Shura Cherkassky]], [[Emil Gilels]], [[Maria Grinberg]], [[Simon Barere]], [[Leo Podolsky]] and [[Yakov Zak]]. (Note: Richter studied in Odessa but wasn't born there.)

The [[Odessa International Film Festival]] is also held in this city annually since 2010.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Одеса 189115.JPG|thumb|left|The [[School of Stolyarsky]], founded in 1933, has long been recognised as a centre of musical excellence.]]
Poet [[Anna Akhmatova]] was born in Bolshoy Fontan near Odessa.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last= Anderson|first= Nancy K.|author2=Anna Andreevna Akhmatova|title= The word that causes death's defeat|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn= 0-300-10377-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has produced many writers, including [[Isaak Babel|Isaac Babel]], whose series of short stories, [[Odessa Tales]], are set in the city. Other Odessites are the duo [[Ilf and Petrov]], and [[Yury Olesha|Yuri Olesha]]. [[Vera Inber]], a poet and writer, as well as the famous poet and journalist, [[Margarita Aliger]] were both born in Odessa. The Italian writer, slavist and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] dissident [[Leone Ginzburg]] was born in Odessa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived.

One of the most prominent pre-war [[Russian literature|Soviet writers]], [[Valentin Kataev]], was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including [[Yury Olesha]] and [[Ilf and Petrov|Ilya Ilf]] (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular [[List of Russian language writers|Russian writers]] of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first [[editing|chief editor]] of the ''Youth'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Юность, Yunost'}}), one of the leading [[literary magazine|literature magazines]] of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|Ottepel]] of the 1950s and 1960s. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

These authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the "Odessa myth" in the Soviet Union. Odessites were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} These qualities are reflected in the "Odessa dialect", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odessan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city. The "Odessite speech" became a staple of the "Soviet Jew" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own [[Quality of life|well-being]], but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odessan Jew in the jokes always "came out clean" and was, in the end, a lovable character – unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanny|first=Jarrod|title=City of Rogues and Schnorrers: Russia's Jews and the Myth of Old Odessa|year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-22328-9|pages=13–22, 142–156|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=650630|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celebrations and holidays ===
{{Further information|Humorina}}
[[April Fools' Day]], held annually on 1 April, is one of the most celebrated festivals in the city. Practical joking is a central theme throughout, and Odessans dress in unique, colorful attire to express their spontaneous and comedic selves. The tradition has been celebrated since the early 1970s, when the humor of Ukraine’s citizens were drawn to television and the media, further developing into a mass festival. Large amounts of money are made from the festivities, supporting Odessa’s local entertainers and shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/odessa-celebrates-april-fools-day.html|title=Odessa Celebrates April Fools’ Day|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=1 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Odessa Seaport.JPG|left|thumb|Odessa seaport]]

The economy of Odessa largely stems from its traditional role as a port city. The nearly ice-free port lies near the mouths of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], the [[Southern Bug]], the [[Dniester]] and the [[Danube]] rivers, which provide good links to the hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

During the Soviet period (until 1991) the city functioned as the USSR's largest trading port; it continues in a similar role as independent Ukraine's busiest international port. The port complex contains an oil and gas transfer and storage facility, a cargo-handling area and a large passenger port. In 2007 the Port of Odessa handled 31,368,000 tonnes of cargo.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.ukrport.org.ua/members.htm Ассоциация портов Украины и всего Чёрного моря: члены&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229103802/http://www.ukrport.org.ua/members.htm |date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.blackseatrans.com/article.php?articleID=747 Ports of Ukraine&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109222022/http://www.blackseatrans.com/article.php?articleID=747 |date=9 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The port of Odessa is also one of the [[Ukrainian Navy]]'s most important bases on the [[Black Sea]]. Rail transport is another important sector of the economy in Odessa – largely due to the role it plays in delivering goods and imports to and from the city's port.

At present, 5% of the industrial production of Ukraine takes place in the Odessa region. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iloveodessa.eu/k2-demo-1/item/361-economics-of-odessa-a-simple-primer |title=Economics of Odessa - A Simple Primer |publisher=ILoveOdessa.eu |accessdate=15 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial enterprises located in and around the city include those dedicated to fuel refinement, machine building, metallurgy, and other types of light industry such as food preparation, timber plants and chemical industry. Agriculture is a relatively important sector in the territories surrounding the city. The [[Seventh-Kilometer Market]] is a major commercial complex on the outskirts of the city where private traders now operate one of the largest market complexes in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odessa-info.com.ua/about/ |title=Одесса &amp;#124; о городе |publisher=Odessa-info.com.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221429/http://www.odessa-info.com.ua/about/ |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The market has roughly 6,000 traders and an estimated 150,000 customers per day. Daily sales, according to the Ukrainian periodical ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', were believed to be as high as USD 20 million in 2004. With a staff of 1,200 (mostly guards and janitors), the market is also the region's largest employer. It is owned by local land and agriculture [[tycoon]] Viktor A. Dobriansky and three partners of his. [[Tavria-V]] is the most popular retail chain in Odessa. Key areas of [[business sector|business]] include: retail, wholesale, catering, production, construction and development, private label. Consumer recognition is mainly attributed{{by whom|date=November 2014}} to the high level of service and the quality of services. [[Tavria-V]] is the biggest private company and the biggest tax payer.

[[File:Deribasovskaya-33-36.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Odessa Passage|Passage]] galleries, one of the city's landmarks.]]

[[Deribasivska Street]] is one of the city's most important commercial streets, hosting a large number of the city's boutiques and higher-end shops. In addition to this there are a number of large commercial shopping centres in the city. The 19th-century shopping gallery [[Odessa Passage|Passage]] was, for a long time, the city's most upscale shopping district, and remains {{as of | 2014 | alt = to this day}} an important landmark of Odessa.

The [[Tourism in Ukraine|tourism]] sector is of great importance to Odessa, which is currently{{when|date=November 2014}} the second most-visited Ukrainian city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ua/data/upload/publication/eu/en/2889/002_profile_sez.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023180441/http://www.mfa.gov.ua/data/upload/publication/eu/en/2889/002_profile_sez.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 this sector recorded a total revenue of 189,2 mln UAH. Other sectors of the city's economy include the banking sector: the city hosts a branch of the [[National Bank of Ukraine]]. [[Imexbank]], one of Ukraine's largest commercial banks, is based in the city. Foreign business ventures have thrived in the area, as since 1 January 2000, much of the city and its surrounding area has been declared{{by whom|date=November 2014}} a [[free economic zone]] – this has aided the foundation of foreign companies' and corporations' Ukrainian divisions and allowed them to more easily invest in the Ukrainian manufacturing and service sectors. To date a number of Japanese and Chinese companies, as well as a host of European enterprises, have invested in the development of the free economic zone, to this end private investors in the city have invested a great deal of money into the provision of quality office real estate and modern manufacturing facilities such as warehouses and plant complexes.

== Transport ==

=== Maritime transport ===
{{further information|UkrFerry|Black Sea Shipping Company}}
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Морской вокзал 22.jpg|right|thumb|Odessa has long been an important [[Black Sea]] port.]]
[[File:ЧМП.gif|thumb|Soviet cruise line based in Odessa|left]]
Odessa is a major maritime transportation hub that includes several ports including [[Port of Odessa]], [[Port of Chornomorsk]] (ferry, freight), [[Yuzhne]] (freight only). Beside transportation Port of Odessa became a provisional headquarters of the [[Ukrainian Navy]], due the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Before [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Port of Odessa harbored the major Soviet cruise line [[Black Sea Shipping Company]].

Passenger ships and ferries connect Odessa with [[Istanbul]], [[Haifa]] and [[Varna]], whilst river cruises can occasionally be booked for travel up the [[Dnieper River]] to cities such as [[Kherson]], [[Dnipro]] and [[Kiev]].

=== Roads and automotive transport ===

The first car in Russian Empire, a [[Mercedes-Benz]] belonging to V. Navrotsky, came to Odessa from France in 1891. He was a popular city publisher of the newspaper ''The Odessa Leaf''.

[[File:Odessa road.jpg|thumb|left|The M05 Highway links Odessa with the nation's capital, Kiev. Odessa junction.]]
Odessa is linked to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, by the [[M05 highway (Ukraine)|M05 Highway]], a high quality multi-lane road which is set to be re-designated, after further reconstructive works, as an 'Avtomagistral' (motorway) in the near future. Other routes of national significance, passing through Odessa, include the M16 Highway to [[Moldova]], M15 to [[Izmail]] and [[Romania]], and the [[Highway M14 (Ukraine)|M14]] which runs from Odessa, through [[Mykolaiv]] and [[Kherson]] to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The M14 is of particular importance to Odessa's maritime and shipbuilding industries as it links the city with Ukraine's other large deep water port [[Mariupol]] which is located in the south east of the country.

Odessa also has a well-developed system of inter-urban municipal roads and minor beltways. However, the city is still lacking an extra-urban bypass for transit traffic which does not wish to proceed through the city centre.

Intercity bus services are available from Odessa to many cities in Russia (Moscow, [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Pyatigorsk]]), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Munich]]), Greece ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Varna]] and [[Sofia]]) and several cities of [[Ukraine]] and Europe.

=== Railways ===
[[File:Odesa Holovna.jpeg|thumb|right|Odesa Holovna is one of Ukraine's largest railway terminals. Every day trains depart to a large number of national and international destinations.]]
Odessa is served by a number of railway stations and halts, the largest of which is [[Odessa Train Station|Odesa Holovna]] (Main Station), from where passenger train services connect Odessa with [[Warsaw]], Prague, [[Bratislava]], Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], the cities of Ukraine and many other cities of the former USSR. The city's first railway station was opened in the 1880s, however, during the Second World War, the iconic building of the main station, which had long been considered to be one of the [[Russian Empire]]'s premier stations, was destroyed through enemy action. In 1952 the station was rebuilt to the designs of A Chuprina. The current station, which is characterised by its many [[Socialist Realism|socialist-realist]] architectural details and grand scale, was renovated by the state railway operator [[Ukrainian Railways]] in 2006.

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Oděsa, Sofijska, tramvaj.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Odessa tram]] on Sofievska Street.]]
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Потемкинская лестница 10.jpg|thumb|Odessa funicular]]
In 1881 Odessa became the first city in Imperial Russia to have steam tramway lines, an innovation that came only one year after the establishment of [[horsecar|horse tramway]] services in 1880 operated by the "Tramways d'Odessa", a Belgian owned company. The first [[Narrow gauge railway|metre gauge]] steam tramway line ran from Railway Station to Great Fontaine and the second one to Hadzhi Bey Liman. These routes were both operated by the same Belgian company. Electric tramway started to operate on 22 August 1907. Trams were imported from Germany.

The city's [[public transport|public transit]] system is currently made up of trams,&lt;ref name="trams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmaestro.com/tram|title=Odessa Tram Themes|accessdate=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[trolleybus]]es, buses and fixed-route taxis ([[marshrutka]]s). Odessa also has a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to [[Vidrada]] Beach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/6811754/Cable-car-to-beach-Otrada Odessa Cable Car to Vidrada/Otrada Beach] on [[Wikimapia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and recreational ferry service.

One additional mode of transport in Odessa is quite unique; the [[Potemkin Stairs]] [[Odessa Funicular|funicular railway]], which runs between the city's Primorsky Bulvar and the sea terminal, has been in service since 1902. In 1998, after many years of neglect, the city decided to raise funds for a replacement track and cars. This project was delayed on multiple occasions but was finally completed eight years later in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odessaguide.net/sights_cablecar.en.html Odessa Sights]. odessaguide.net&lt;/ref&gt; The [[funicular]] has now become as much a part of historic Odessa as the staircase to which it runs parallel.

=== Air transport ===
[[Odessa International Airport]], which is located to the south-west of the city centre, is served by a number of airlines. The airport is also often used by citizens of neighbouring countries for whom Odessa is the nearest large city and who can travel visa-free to Ukraine.

Transit flights from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East to Odessa are offered by [[Ukraine International Airlines]] through their hub at Kiev's [[Boryspil International Airport]]. Additionally Turkish Airlines wide network and daily flights offers more than 246 destinations all over the world.

The most popular sport in Odessa is [[Association football|football]]. The main professional football club in the city is [[FC Chornomorets Odesa]], who play in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Chornomorets play their home games at the [[Chornomorets Stadium]], an elite-class stadium which has a maximum capacity of 34,164. The second football team in Odessa is [[FC Odesa|FC Odessa]].[[File:Odesa Chornomorets Stadium 1.jpg|thumb|Chornomorets Stadium renovated in preparation to the [[Euro 2012]]]]Basketball is also a prominent sport in Odessa, with [[BC Odessa]] representing the city in the [[Ukrainian Basketball League]], the highest tier basketball league in Ukraine. Odessa will become one of five Ukrainian cities to host the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2015|39th European Basketball Championship]] in 2015.

=== Athletes ===
[[Chess]] player [[Efim Geller]] was born in the city. Gymnast [[Tatiana Gutsu]] (known as "The Painted Bird of Odessa") brought home Ukraine's first Olympic gold medal as an independent nation when she outscored the USA's [[Shannon Miller]] in the women's all-around event at [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain. Figure skaters [[Oksana Grishuk]] and [[Evgeny Platov]] won the 1994 and 1998 Olympic gold medals as well as the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 World Championships in ice dance. Both were born and raised in the city, though they skated at first for the Soviet Union, in the Unified Team, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and then Russia. Hennadiy Avdyeyenko won a 1988 Olympic gold medal in thehigh jump, setting an Olympic record at {{convert|2.38|m|ft|2|abbr=off}}.

'''Pessah Bar-Adon''' ([[Hebrew]]: פסח בר-אדון; b. 1907, d. 1985) was a Polish-born, Israeli archaeologist and writer.

==Early life==
Born Pessah Panitsch &lt;!--spelling?--&gt;in [[Kolno]]&lt;!--spelling?--&gt;, [[Poland]], to a [[Zionist]], ultra-orthodox family, he was educated in a Jewish orthodox school and in [[Yeshiva]]s. He immigrated to Israel in 1925. While working in housing and road construction to support himself, he studied for a degree in Middle-Eastern studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

==Career==

For a period, he lived amongst [[Bedouins]] near [[Amman]], [[Bet She'an]], and [[Kuneitra]] in order to learn their lifestyle.&lt;ref name="101years"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/orion/academics/Bar-Adon.doc| title=A Hundred (and one) Years to the Birth of Pessah Bar-Adon| first=Doron| last=Bar-Adon| language=Hebrew| year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his motivation for this endeavor was to understand why many of the ancient Kings of Israel were originally shepherds. During this period he wore traditional Bedouin clothing and went by the name Aziz Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cattle Farmer's Meeting |url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin_TAU.asp?From=Search&amp;Key=DAV/1931/10/07/3/Ar00301.xml&amp;CollName=DAV_1925_1934&amp;DOCID=105721&amp;PageLabelPrint=&amp;Skin=%54%41%55%48%65&amp;enter=%74%72%75%65&amp;Publication=%44%41%56&amp;AppName=%32&amp;Hs=%61%64%76%61%6e%63%65%64&amp;AW=%31%32%37%37%36%32%37%36%38%32%30%34%36&amp;sPublication=%44%41%56&amp;tauLanguage=&amp;sScopeID=%44%52&amp;sSorting=%49%73%73%75%65%44%61%74%65%49%44%2c%61%73%63&amp;sQuery=%22%u05d1%u05e8%20%u05d0%u05d3%u05d5%u05df%22&amp;rEntityType=&amp;sSearchInAll=%66%61%6c%73%65&amp;sDateFrom=%25%33%30%25%33%36%25%32%66%25%33%30%25%33%31%25%32%66%25%33%31%25%33%39%25%33%33%25%33%30&amp;sDateTo=%25%33%30%25%33%36%25%32%66%25%33%33%25%33%30%25%32%66%25%33%31%25%33%39%25%33%34%25%33%38&amp;ViewMode=HTML|language=Hebrew|publisher=Davar newspaper|work=[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Skins/TAUEn/Client.asp?Skin=TAUEn&amp;enter=true&amp;AW=1277628058484&amp;AppName=2 Historical Jewish Press]|date=October 7, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], he was an active member of the [[Haganah]] Jerusalem. Later he also took part in the [[Aliyah Bet]].

In 1932 he participated in one of the first movies made about the Jewish [[Yishuv]] in Palestine, called "Sabra", directed by [[Aleksander Ford]].&lt;ref name=101years/&gt;

In 1939, he married Dorothy Kahan, an American author who fell in love with the Land of Israel, and the two moved to the Blumenfeld house in [[Moshav]] [[Merhavia (moshav)|Merhavia]].

Bar-Adon was involved in many archeological excavations, among them: [[Bet Shearim]], [[Tel Bet Yerah]], and the discovery of the [[Nahal Mishmar]] hoard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= |title=Diggers |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872343,00.html |quote=Eight miles from Dr. Yadin's Cave of Letters in the Wilderness of Judah, the second archaeological team, headed by grey-haired Polish Emigré Pessah Bar-Adon, 53, dug through six feet of debris in another cave.

'''Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz''' (February 14, 1898 &amp;ndash; May 30, 1959) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer, journalist, essayist and poet, friend of [[Arturo Jauretche]] and [[Homero Manzi]], and loosely associated with the political group ''Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina'' (FORJA).

Scalabrini Ortiz was born in [[Corrientes]], the son of the naturalist Pedro Scalabrini, who was the director of the museum of the city of [[Paraná, Argentina|Paraná]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. He studied in the Faculty of Exact Sciences and became a [[surveying|land surveyor]]; then he moved to [[Buenos Aires]] and got involved in the literary conflicts of the [[Boedo group|Boedo]] and [[Florida group|Florida]] groups. In 1923 he started writing [[short story|short stories]], collected in a book, ''La Manga''; he was then a journalist for the newspapers ''[[La Nación]]'', ''El Mundo'' and ''Noticias Gráficas'', and founded and directed ''Reconquista''.

In his youth, Scalabrini Ortiz participated in a [[Marxism|Marxist]] group called ''Insurrexit''; he also travelled to several provinces for work reasons, and at 26 he visited [[Paris]], [[France]], from where he returned disappointed by the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] attitude of its citizens. Like everyone in Argentina, he felt the effects of the [[Great Depression]], and then saw the [[coup d'état]] against president [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] that began the ''[[Década Infame]]'', marked by conservative rule perpetuated by [[electoral fraud]].

During the 1930s he wrote to denounce the exploitation of Argentina for the benefit of the [[oligarchy]] and foreign interests. From its foundation in 1935 onwards, he was linked to FORJA (''Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina'', "Force of Radical Orientation of the Young Argentina"; the acronym also means "[[forge]]" in Spanish), an internal offshoot of the [[Radical Civic Union]].

Together with Arturo Jauretche, Scalabrini Ortiz is considered a pioneer of [[historical revisionism]] in Argentina, a fervently [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[anti-liberalism|anti-liberal]] current of [[historiography]] that became especially influential in the 1960s.

By 1942, Scalabrini Ortiz was jobless. He had to resort to a newspaper classified ad to earn a living, noting that he possessed an ample general culture, experience and knowledge in many fields. He finally returned to his original occupation as a surveyor, and continued working when he died in Buenos Aires in 1959, at the age of 61. An [[Scalabrini Ortiz Avenue|avenue]] in the city of Buenos Aires is named in his honor.

==Works and quotes==
Perhaps the work that better defines Scalabrini Ortiz is the "Five principles of inner cooperation" (''Cinco principios de cooperación interna''). These principles he describes in the following manner:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

# ''Principle of the collective man'', because the will of the number, which is like the surname of the collectivity, must be above the individuality. Not the wealth nor the wit or wisdom have the right to silent or mock the great voice of the necessity of the each collective group, which is the voice that best approximates the will of destiny.
# ''Principle of the man's comprehension'', for this complex unity to be always present with its biological, moral, intellectual and spiritual necessities, and for the human reality never to be sacrificed to an abstract norm or a scheme without life.
# ''Principle of the protection of the weakest'', to abolish the 'Law of the Jungle' and establish a real possibility of equality. Everything that is not legislated, is implicitly legislated on favour of the strong. The theoretical equality is a practical inequality on favour of the powerful.
# ''Principle of natural resources'', because the property is a delegation of the power of a collective organization that made it possible and supports it.
# ''Principle of the collective utility of the profit'', so that nobody has the right to obtain benefits of activities to the detriment of or useless to the society, and therefore all profit or benefit of the product of somebody else's mind or the fruitless retention of a good, must be considered null and illicit since they don't originate in the own work nor genius.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his journalistic articles and flyers, Scalabrini Ortiz tried to show the general public what he had learned by investigating. In one article he advised the reader:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"These matters of economy and finance are so simple that they are within reach of any child. They only require knowledge of addition and subtraction. When you do not understand something, ask until you do understand. If you do not understand, it is because they are trying to steal from you. When you understand that, you will already have learned how to defend the motherland on the immaterial order of economic and financial concepts."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23515">A '''reform of the date of Easter''' has been proposed several times because the current system for determining the date of [[Easter]] is seen as presenting two significant problems:

* Its [[moveable feast|date varies from year to year]]. It can fall on up to 35 different days in March and April of the respective calendar. While many Christians do not consider this to be a problem, it can cause frequent difficulties of co-ordination with [[civil calendar]]s, for example [[academic term]]s. Many countries have [[public holiday]]s around Easter weekend or tied to the date of Easter but spread from February to June, such as [[Shrove Tuesday]] or [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]].
* Many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]] calculate the date of Easter using the [[Julian calendar]], whereas some Eastern churches use the [[Revised Julian calendar]] and all [[Western Christianity|Western churches]] and civil authorities have adopted the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reforms]] for all calendrical purposes. Hence in most years, Easter is celebrated on a later date in the East than in the West.

There have been [[Easter controversy|controversies about the "correct" date of Easter]] since antiquity, leading to [[schism]]s and excommunications or even executions due to [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], but most Christian churches today agree on certain points. Easter should therefore be celebrated:

* on a [[Sunday]] (according to the [[First Council of Nicaea#Separation of Easter computation from Jewish calendar|First Council of Nicaea in 325]]),
* after the [[Northward equinox]] (around 20 March in the Gregorian calendar), that is in Northern Hemisphere spring,
* after the nominal "Paschal" [[full moon]].

There is less agreement whether Easter also should occur:

* so that [[Feast of the Annunciation|Annunciation]] – usually celebrated 25 March, 9 months before [[Christmas]] – does not fall on any day from the [[Palm Sunday|Sunday before Easter]] to the [[Octave of Easter|Sunday after]],
* on or after the [[Quartodecimanism|14th day]] of the lunar month of [[Nisan]],
* not before [[Passover|Jewish Pesach]]. (Easter is after [[passover (Christian holiday)|Christian Passover]] by definition.)

The disagreements have been particularly about the determination of moon phases and the equinox, some still preferring astronomical observation from a certain location (usually Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome or local), most others following nominal approximations of these in either the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], Julian or Gregorian calendar using different lookup tables and cycles in their algorithms.

== Fixed date ==

It has been proposed that the first problem could be resolved by making Easter occur on a date fixed relative to the western [[Gregorian calendar]] every year, or alternatively on a Sunday within a fixed range of seven dates. While tying Easter to one fixed date would serve to underline the belief that it commemorates an actual historical event, without an accompanying [[calendar reform]] that changes the pattern of the days of the week (itself a subject of [[World Calendar#Religious objections|religious controversy]]) it would also break the tradition of Easter always being on a Sunday, established since the 2nd century and by now deeply embedded in the [[Liturgy|liturgical]] practice and [[Theology|theological]] understanding of almost all [[Christian denomination]]s. 

The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican agreed in 1963 to accept a fixed Sunday in the Gregorian calendar as the date for Easter as long as other Christian churches agreed on it as well. They also agreed in principle to adopt a civil calendar reform as long as there were never any days outside the cycle of seven days per week.&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite| title = Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' | editor = [[Pope Paul VI]] | date = 4 December 1963 | url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html | chapter = Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cal|6 April next Sunday|holiday=Pepuzite Easter}}
The Pepuzites, a 5th-century sect, celebrated Easter on the Sunday following April 6 (in the [[Julian calendar]]).&lt;ref name="Sozomen1846"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sozomen |authorlink=Sozomen |title=Ecclesiastical History: A History of the Church : in Nine Books, from A.D. 324 to A.D. 440 : a New Translation from the Greek, with a Memoir of the Author |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMoCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=353 |year=1846 |publisher=Bagster |page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to the Sunday closest to April 9. The April 6 date was apparently arrived at because it was equivalent to the 14th of the month of [[Artemisios]] in an earlier calendar used in the area, hence, the 14th of the first month of spring.&lt;ref name=Talley&gt;{{cite book|last=Talley|first= Thomas J|chapter=Afterthoughts on The Origins of the Liturgical Year|title=Western Plainchant in the First Millennium: Studies in the Medieval Liturgy and Its Music |pages=1–10 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot|date=2003 |editor1=Sean Gallagher|editor2=et al|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hM16rgEACAAJ|isbn=9780754603894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cal|second Sunday of April|holiday=fixed Easter}}
The two most widespread proposals for fixing the date of Easter would set it on either the second Sunday in April (8 to 14, [[ISO 8601|week]] 14 or 15), or the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (9 to 15), affecting years with dominical letter G or AG where 1 April is a Sunday. In both schemes, account has been taken of the fact that—in spite of the many difficulties in establishing the dates of the historical events involved—many scholars attribute a high degree of probability to [[Good Friday|Friday]] 7 April 30, as the date of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], which would make 9 April the date of the [[Resurrection]]. Another date which is supported by many scholars is 3 April 33,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=B. E. |year=1990 |title=Lunar Visibility and the Crucifixion |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=53–67 |bibcode=1990QJRAS..31...53S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humphreys"&gt;

In the late 1920s and 1930s, this idea gained some momentum along with other calendar reform proposals, such as the [[International Fixed Calendar]] and the [[World Calendar]]. In 1928, [[Easter Act 1928|a law]] was passed in the United Kingdom authorising an Order in Council which would fix the date of Easter in that country as the Sunday after the second Saturday in April.&lt;ref name="Richards1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward Graham|title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and Its History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GqXDQgAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-286205-1|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was never implemented.

{{Cal|{{CURRENTYEAR}}-W14-7|holiday=fixed week Easter}}
The Sunday after the first Wednesday in April would always be in ISO week 14, except for leap years starting on Thursday (DC) where the week count is one higher than in otherwise equivalent common years after February. The [[Symmetry454 Calendar]] proposes a fixed date of Easter in week 14, which would agree with the aforementioned proposals in most years, but would be 1 week earlier in F/GF years (like the only deviation of the Pepuzite definition) and also in DC, D/ED and E/FE years. The Sunday of an ordinal ISO week ''n'' is also the ''n''th Sunday of the year, except in A/AG, B/BA and C/CB years where it is the ''n''+1st Sunday, so both major proposals put Easter on the 15th Sunday of the year except either in common years starting on Monday (G), where 8 April, i.e. the second Sunday in April, is the 14th Sunday of the year, or in leap years starting on Sunday (AG), where 15 April, i.e. the Sunday after the second Saturday in April, is the 16th Sunday of the year.

In 1977, some Eastern Orthodox representatives objected to separating the date of Easter from lunar phases.&lt;ref name="byzcath.org"&gt;[http://www.byzcath.org/index.php/news-mainmenu-49/2689-ukrainian-catholic-university-organizes-seminar-on-easter-date Ukrainian Catholic University Organizes Seminar on Easter Date]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unified date ==

Proposals to resolve the second problem have made greater progress, but they are yet to be adopted.
{{Table of dates of Easter|class=floatright|format=dmy}}

=== 1923 proposal ===

An astronomical rule for Easter was proposed by the 1923 {{Interlanguage link multi|Pan-Orthodox Congress of Constantinople|fr|3=Congrès « panorthodoxe » de Constantinople de 1923}} that also proposed the [[Revised Julian calendar]]: Easter was to be the Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] (35°&amp;thinsp;13′&amp;thinsp;47.2″&amp;thinsp;E or UT&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;20&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;55&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; for the small dome) during which the first [[full moon]] after the vernal equinox occurs.&lt;ref name="Milankovitch1923"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milankovitch|first1=M.|title=Das Ende des julianischen Kalenders und der neue Kalender der orientalischen Kirchen|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten |volume=220 |issue=23|year=1923 |pages=379–384|issn=0004-6337 |doi=10.1002/asna.19232202303 |language=de|ref=harve|bibcode=1924AN....220..379M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1924"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The new calendar of the eastern churches | last = Shields | first = Miriam Nancy | journal= Popular Astronomy|volume=32|page=407 | date = 1924 | url =  |bibcode=1924PA.....32..407S | language =   | quote =  This is a translation of Milankovitch, 1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is the following Sunday. This proposed astronomical rule was rejected by all Orthodox churches and was never considered by any Western church.

=== 1997 proposal ===

{{main|Aleppo Easter dating method}}
The [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) proposed a [[Aleppo Easter dating method|reform of the method of determining the date of Easter]] at a summit in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], in 1997:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/commissions/faith-and-order/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/towards-a-common-date-for-easter/index|title=Towards a Common Date of Easter - World Council of Churches/Middle East Council of Churches Consultation Aleppo, Syria, March 5–10, 1997|publisher=[[World Council of Churches]]|date=10 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easter would be defined as the first Sunday following the first [[Astronomy|astronomical]] [[full moon]] following the astronomical [[vernal equinox]], as determined from the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Council of Churches Press Release: THE DATE OF EASTER: SCIENCE OFFERS SOLUTION TO ANCIENT RELIGIOUS PROBLEM|url=http://www.smart.net/~mmontes/pr.wcc.19970324.html|date=24 March 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626033549/http://www.smart.net/~mmontes/pr.wcc.19970324.html |archive-date=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform would have been implemented starting in 2001, since in that year the Eastern and Western dates of Easter would coincide.

This reform has not been implemented. It would have relied mainly on the co-operation of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], since the date of Easter would change for them immediately; whereas for the Western churches, the new system would not differ from that currently in use until 2019. However, Eastern Orthodox support was not forthcoming, and the reform failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luke Luhl|title=The Proposal for a Common Date to Celebrate Pascha and Easter|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/common_luhl.aspx|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The much greater impact that this reform would have had on the Eastern churches in comparison with those of the West led some Orthodox to suspect that the WCC's decision was an attempt by the West to impose its viewpoint unilaterally on the rest of the world under the guise of [[ecumenism]]. However, it could also be argued that it is fair to ask a significant change of Eastern Christians, as they would be simply making the same substantial changes the various Western Churches have already made in 1582 (when the Catholic Church first adopted the Gregorian calendar) and subsequent years so as to bring the calendar and Easter more in line with the seasons.

=== 2008–2009 proposals ===

In 2008 and 2009, there was a new attempt to reach a consensus on a unified date on the part of Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant leaders.&lt;ref name="Sandri"&gt;{{Cite web | title = New attempt to achieve a common date for Easter | last = Sandri | first = Luigi | work = Ekklesia | date = 6 December 2008 | accessdate = 2016-01-24 | url = http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/8130 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ekklesia"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hope for a common date for Easter affirmed again | author =  | work = Ekklesia  | date = 29 May 2009 | accessdate = 2016-01-24 | url = http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/9553 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort largely relies on earlier work carried out during the 1997 Aleppo conference.&lt;ref name="byzcath.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ecumenical-christians-look-forward-to-shared-easter-dates-38932/ |title=Ecumenical Christians Look Forward to Shared Easter Dates |newspaper=Christianpost.com |date=1 June 2009  |author= Aaron J. Leichman |accessdate= 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized by academics working at the Institute of Ecumenical Studies of [[Lviv University]].&lt;ref name="CathNews "&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hopes rise for East-West common Easter |author= |work=CathNews |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2016-01-24 |url=http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=14084 |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209094946/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=14084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this attempt was reportedly influenced by ecumenical efforts in Syria and Lebanon, where the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Melkite Church]] has played an important role in improving ties with the Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soufanieh.com/PETITION/19820107.lettre.unite.eveques.htm 1982 petition for a unified Easter date]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spero"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Christians eye common date for Easter | author =  | work = Spero News | date = 8 December 2008 | accessdate = 2016-01-24 | url = http://www.speroforum.com/a/16989/Christians-eye-common-date-for-Easter#.VqTRtlnwhek | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a series of apparition phenomena known as [[Our Lady of Soufanieh]] that has urged for a common date of Easter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soufanieh.com/PETITION/petition.htm Petition for a Common date of Easter]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014–2016 proposals ===

In May 2014, on the anniversary of the meeting between himself and Pope Francis, [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]] [[Pope Tawadros II]] wrote a letter to Pope Francis asking for him to consider making renewed effort at a unified date for Easter.&lt;ref name="2015-06-19_CNA"&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/will-pope-francis-change-the-date-of-easter-87684/ Will Pope Francis change the date of Easter?], [[Catholic News Agency]], 19 June 2015, accessed 21 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on 12 June 2015, Catholic [[Pope Francis]] remarked to the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services]] 3rd World Retreat of Priests at the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]] in [[Rome]] that "we have to come to an agreement" for a common date on Easter, the date calculated under the Orthodox churches' [[Gregorian Calendar]]. {{Interlanguage link multi|Lucetta Scaraffia|it}}, an historian, writing in the Vatican daily newspaper [[L'Osservatore Romano]], said the Pope is offering this initiative to change the date of Easter "as a gift of unity with the other Christian churches" adding that a common date for Easter would encourage "reconciliation between the Christian churches and …a sort of making sense out of the calendar". A week later [[Aphrem II]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of Antioch#Current patriarchs|Patriarch of Antioch]], met with Pope Francis and noted that the celebration of Easter "on two different dates is a source of great discomfort and weakens the common witness of the church in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ieraci | first = Laura | date = June 19, 2015 | title = Pope, Orthodox patriarch express commitment for unity | periodical = National Catholic Reporter | url = http://ncronline.org/blogs/francis-chronicles/pope-orthodox-patriarch-express-commitment-unity | accessdate = 16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]] announced that he on behalf of the [[Anglican Communion]] had joined discussions with Catholic, Coptic and Orthodox representatives over a fixed date for Easter, and that he hoped it would happen within the next five to ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Archbishop Justin Welby hopes for fixed Easter date|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35326237|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welby has suggested that Easter be fixed on either the second or third Sunday of April relative to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name="Telegraph "&gt;{{Cite web | title = Easter date to be fixed 'within next five to 10 years' | last = Bingham | first = John | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = Sophie | work = The Telegraph | date = 16 January 2016 | accessdate = 2016-01-24 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12102278/Easter-date-to-be-fixed-within-next-five-to-10-years.html | quote = He said that Easter should most likely be fixed for the second or third Sunday of April }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal remains to be approved, especially by Eastern churches which currently determine Easter using the Julian calendar. 

According to [[ISO week date|international standards]], Easter Sunday ends the week containing Good Friday and the week of the second Sunday in April has the ordinal number 14 or 15 ([[dominical letter]]s D/DC, E/ED, F/FE and GF, i.e. 46.25% of years), hence the third Sunday is one respective week later. There currently is no public proposal under discussion that used a fixed [[week]] of the year for Easter and dependent feasts. The second Sunday in April is usually the 15th Sunday of the year (except for dominical letter G, 10.75%), which is almost always also the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (except for dominical letter AG, 3.75%).

'''Roberto de Mattei''' (born 21 February 1948 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]) is an Italian [[Roman Catholic]] [[historian]] and author.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

== Biography ==
De Mattei was{{when|date=October 2015}} formerly a student and assistant to the philosopher of politics [[Augusto Del Noce]] and to the historian [[Armando Saitta]] at the Faculty of [[Political Sciences]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]

De Mattei has{{when|date=October 2015}} extensively studied European history of the 16th and 20th centuries, with particular focus on the history of religious and political ideas. He describes himself as "above all … a disciple of Professor [[Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira]]".&lt;ref name = Biog&gt;{{Citation | title = Roberto de Mattei: Biography | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.robertodemattei.it/en/ | accessdate = 2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other academic positions, de Mattei was{{when|date=October 2015}} Professor of [[Modern History]] at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Cassino and is currently Professor of [[Modern History]] and [[History of Christianity]] and Coordinator of the Degree Course in [[Auxiliary sciences of history|Historical Sciences]] at the new European University in [[Rome]], which was founded in 2004 under the sponsorship of the [[Legionaries of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Presentation of the New European University of Rome | publisher = [[Regnum Christi]] | date = 25 Oct 2004 | url = http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?id=11105&amp;se=364&amp;ca=119&amp;te=782 | accessdate = 2015-03-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402171426/http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?id=11105&amp;se=364&amp;ca=119&amp;te=782 | archivedate = 2 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 2003 and 2011 de Mattei was the Vice-President of the [[National Research Council of Italy]].&lt;ref name = Biog/&gt; In that role, he has been highly criticized for his scientific ideas, in particular for having organized and funded a meeting supporting antievolutionism. This fact led part{{who|date=October 2015}} of the Italian scientific community to a request for his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Margottini  | first = Laura | journal = ScienceInsider | place = Washington, DC | publisher = [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] | date = 9 December 2009 | title = Italy Science Agency Helps Publish Creationism Book | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/12/italy-science-agency-helps-publish-creationism-book }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Courage | first = Katherine Harmon | title = Italy science council funds creationist book | journal = Scientific American – Observations | type = Blog | publisher = Scientific American | date = 10 December 2009 | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/12/10/italy-science-council-funds-creationist-book/ | accessdate = 2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy upsurged again after some statements by de Mattei, such as that the tsunami in 2011 in Japan was a divine punishment. Furthermore, he claimed the "contagion of homosexuality" had been responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Squires | first = Nick | date = 8 April 2011 | title = Fall of Roman Empire caused by 'contagion of homosexuality' | newspaper = The Telegraph | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/Italy/8438210/Fall-of-Roman-Empire-caused-by-contagion-of-homosexuality.html | accessdate = 2015-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Mattei's monthly radio program, ''Radici Cristiane'' (Christian Roots), was cancelled by the director of [[Radio Maria]] because of Mattei's increasingly "critical position regarding the Pontificate of Pope Francis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fanzaga | first = Father Livio | title = Letter to Prof. Roberto de Mattei | publisher =  | date = 13 February 2014 | url = http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/02/dictatorship-of-tolerance-at-radio.html | accessdate = 2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Mattei has been described as "a renowned apologist for ultra-traditional Catholicism".&lt;ref name=Faggioli2011&gt;{{Citation | last = Faggioli | first = Massimo | title = Council Vatican II: Bibliographical overview 2007-2010 | journal = Cristianesimo nella Storia | volume = 32 | page = 764 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Mattei is a member of the Board of Directors of the "[[Italian Historical Institute for the Modern and Contemporary Age]]" and of the "Italian Geographic Society". He is President of the Lepanto Foundation (Rome - Washington) and he is editor-in-chief of the monthly review "Radici Cristiane",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radicicristiane.it&lt;/ref&gt; the quarterly historical review "Nova Historica", and the weekly "Corrispondenza Romana".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corrispondenzaromana.it&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 2002 to May 2006, de Mattei held the post of Adviser for International Affairs to the [[Italian Government]]. He has cooperated{{how|date=October 2015}} with the [[Pontifical Council for Historical Sciences]] and has been awarded{{when|date=October 2015}} from the Holy See the Order of Knighthood of St. Gregory the Great, as acknowledgement to this service to the Church.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

Among de Mattei's most recent publications is a history of [[Vatican Council II]]  (''Il Concilio Vaticano II. Una storia mai scritta'', Lindau, Turin 2010) wherein, without touching onto the [[theological]] debate on the [[hermeneutics]] of the Council, he suggests an historical view on the event which is antithetical to that proposed by the [[Bologna School (history)|School of Bologna]].{{cn | date = March 2015}} Reviewers have noted the book's "archival discoveries from the ultra-traditionalist [[Marcel Lefebvre#Second Vatican Council|Lefebvrians]]"&lt;ref name=Faggioli2011/&gt; and its new information concerning the role of the traditionalist [[Coetus Internationalis Patrum]] at the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wicks | first = Jared, S.J. | title = Still More Light on Vatican Council II | type = Review Article | journal = The Catholic Historical Review | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | page = 501 | date = July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also described it as "critically flawed", however, for its denigration of the Council's presiding Popes, John XXIII and Paul VI, and of the Council members who followed their reform agenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wicks | first = Jared, S.J. | title = Still More Light on Vatican Council II | type = Review Article | journal = The Catholic Historical Review | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | page = 502 | date = July 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt; as following a "conspiracy-driven Lefebvrian interpretation" and "essentially useless" for developing an understanding of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=Faggioli2011/&gt;  It has been translated into English as ''The Second Vatican Council - An Unwritten Story'' with Michael M. Miller as editor.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

'''Thomas Birch''' (23 November 1705 – 9 January 1766) was an [[England|English]] [[historian]].

==Life==
He was the son of Joseph Birch, a coffee-mill maker, and was born at [[Clerkenwell]].

He preferred study to business but, as his parents were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], he did not go to the university. Notwithstanding this circumstance, he was ordained [[deacon]] in the [[Church of England]] in 1730 and priest in 1731. As a strong supporter of the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], he gained the favour of [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]], afterwards [[Lord Chancellor]] and first Earl of Hardwicke, and his subsequent preferments were largely due to this friendship. He held successively a number of benefices in different counties, and finally in London.

He was noted as a keen fisherman during the course of his lifetime, and devised an unusual method of disguising his intentions. Dressed as a tree, he stood by the side of a stream in an outfit designed to make his arms seem like branches and the rod and line a spray of blossom. Any movement, he argued, would be taken by a fish to be the consequences of a mild breeze.

In 1735 he became a member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], and was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], of which he was secretary from 1752 to 1765. In 1728 he had married Hannah Cox, who died in the following year. Birch was killed on 9 January 1766 by a fall from his [[horse]], and was buried in the church of St [[Margaret Pattens]], [[London]], of which he was then rector. He died, according to his will, "in a full confidence in the Mercy and Goodness of almighty God and with a firm persuasion of a blessed Immortality discoverable by the Light of Nature and confirmed for us Christians by that of Revelation", leaving his books and manuscripts to the [[British Museum]], and a sum of about £500 to increase the salaries of the three assistant librarians.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Writings==
[[File:Birch - Yearly bills of mortality, 1759 - 062.tif|thumb|200px|''Yearly bills of mortality'', [[1759]] (Milano, Fondazione Mansutti]]
Birch was prolific, even if [[Horace Walpole]] questioned his "parts, taste and judgment." He corresponded with prominent men of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Many of his letters appear in ''Literary Anecdotes of the 18th Century'' (London, 1812–1815) and ''Illustrations of the Literary History of the 18th Century'' (London, 1817–1858) by [[John Nichols (printer)|J. Nichols]], in the ''Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica'', vol. iii. (London, 1780–1790), and in [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Johnson]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote: "Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in conversation; but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand, than it becomes a torpedo to him, and benumbs all his faculties".

Birch often collaborated with the greatly successful London bookseller, [[Andrew Millar]], who helped publish some of Birch's most highly profitable publications. These included ''The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle,'' co-written by Reverend [[Henry Miles]] (in 5 volumes folio, 1744), and ''A Complete Collection of the Historical, Political, and Miscellaneous Works of John Milton'' (in 2 volumes folio, 1738, followed in 2 volumes quarto, 1753).

Birch wrote most of the English lives in the ''[[General Dictionary, Historical and Critical]]'', 10 vols. (London, 1734–1741), assisted in the composition of the ''[[Athenian Letters]]'' (London, 1810), edited the ''State Papers of John Thurloe'' (London, 1742) and the ''State Papers of W. Murdin'' (London, 1759). He also wrote:

*''Inquiry'' into the share which [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had in the transactions of the [[Earl of Glamorgan]] for bringing over a body of Irish rebels (published by Millar in London, 1756);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/2.html|title=The manuscripts|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Historical view of Negotiations between the Courts of England, France and Brussels 1592-1617'' (London, 1749); 
*''Life of Archbishop [[John Tillotson|Tillotson]]'' (London, 1753);
*''History of the Royal Society of London'' (London, 1756–1757); 
*''Life of Henry, Prince of Wales'' (London, 1760), and other works.
*''The heads of illustrious persons of Great Britain, in 108 copper plates, engraved by [[Jacob Houbraken|Mr. Houbraken]] and [[George Vertue|Mr. Vertue]], with their lives and characters'', by Thomas Birch, D.D. Secretary of the Royal Society, London, 1761
Among the papers left at his death were some which were published in 1848 as the ''Court and Times of James I'' and the ''Court and Times of Charles I''.

===Copies of Franklin letters===
Recently discovered by American researcher Alan Houston at the [[British Library]] is a file entitled ''Copies of'' [Benjamin Franklin's] ''Letters relating to the March of [[Edward Braddock|General Braddock]]''.  Birch was said to have obsessively copied any documents of historical importance he could get his hands on. He was a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]], and they were both members of the [[Royal Society]]. In his autobiography, Franklin refers to his "Quire Book", which has never been found, but which contained letters and papers concerning his efforts to support the British Government at that pre-revolutionary time. They speak of his 1755 efforts to help [[Red coat (British army)|British Redcoats]] led by Braddock in their march to defeat the French at [[Fort Duquesne]] (in today's Pittsburgh). Braddock desperately needed transportation for his troops, and Franklin rounded up horses and wagons for him using his persuasive powers as Pennsylvania's leading politician. Incidentally, Braddock and most of his men (who included [[George Washington]]) were defeated by the French and their Indian allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/25/uk.franklin.letters/index.html As reported by CNN on 25 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

====July====

On 8 July, Mohamed Morsi issued a decree calling back into session the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012#Dissolution, reinstatement decree|dissolved parliament]] for 10 July 2012. Morsi's decree also called for [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2013|new parliamentary elections]] to be held within 60 days of the adoption of a [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012|new constitution]] for the country, which is tentatively expected for late 2012. [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt|A constitutional assembly]] selected by the erstwhile parliament has been formed and has begun the work of drafting the constitution. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) hold an emergency meeting in response to the decree, but adjourn the meeting without making an announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian parliament to convene Tuesday, official says|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/08/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html?hpt=hp_t3|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 July 2012|author=Mohamed Fadel Fahmy|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt’s Morsi makes bid to reinstate Islamist parliament|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypts-morsi-makes-bid-to-reinstate-islamist-parliament/2012/07/08/gJQAQTnDWW_story.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 July 2012|author1=Steve Hendrix  |author2=Ernesto Londoño |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian President Mursi reverses parliament dissolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18761403|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt’s President Orders Return of Parliament|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/world/middleeast/egypts-president-orders-return-of-dissolved-parliament.html?_r=2|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 2012|author1=Kareem Fahim  |author2=Mayy El Sheikh |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Morsi orders parliament to reconvene|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201278153339685112.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, Egyptian President Mohammed Mursi's order to reconvene parliament was rejected by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court which said after meeting on 9 July 2012 that all its rulings and decisions, including its judgement that part of the election for parliament was unconstitutional and which led in return to the assembly's dissolution by the SCAF, are final, not subject to appeal and binding for all state institutions. With its ruling the court asserted that Morsi had no right to reconvene parliament after the court ordered it dissolved in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court challenges Mursi's reopening of parliament|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18765947|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Court overrules Egypt's president on parliament|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/10/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html?hpt=iaf_c2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the constituent assembly tasked with drawing up Egypt's new constitution is currently functioning, after being selected by the dissolved parliament, the SCAF also gave itself the power to choose a new assembly if the current one runs into any problems according to Al Jazeera.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's top court rebukes president's decree|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201279124421528560.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2012-07-09 statement the military council said its constitutional declaration which gave it broad powers "came as a result of the political, legal and constitutional circumstances that the country was facing" and added that the declaration "ensures the continuity of state institutions and the [military council] until a news constitution is drafted". The military said it was "confident" that all state institutions will respect constitutional declarations.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710"/&gt;

On 10 July, Egypt's parliament convened despite dissolution, but the session was adjourned by Speaker Saad al-Katatni after the members of parliament approved Katatni's proposal that the parliament seek legal advice from the Court of Cassation on how to implement the supreme court's ruling. Thousands gathered in Cairo in protest of a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court to freeze the decree issued by President Mohamed Morsi to reinstate the Islamist-led parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's parliament convenes despite dissolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18777150|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt parliament meets in defiance of court|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201271054440593307.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands in Cairo protest high court ruling|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/20127101852134809.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20120712"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court overturns President Mursi parliament order|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18789992|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20120710"&gt;{{cite news|title=Morsi convenes Egypt’s parliament in defiance of court and military|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/morsi-convenes-egypts-parliament-in-defiance-of-court-and-military/2012/07/10/gJQAGHr9ZW_story_1.html/2012/07/10/gJQAGHr9ZW_story.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 July 2012|author1=Ernesto Londoño  |author2=Steve Hendrix |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that Morsi did not have the right to reconstitute the body,&lt;ref name="WP20120710"/&gt; it also threatened the new president with the equivalent of contempt of court if he continued to reject its decisions.&lt;ref name="NYT20120710"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Egyptian Leaders Meet in Defiance of Court and Military|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/world/middleeast/egyptian-parliamentary-deputies-defy-court-and-military.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament asked Egypt's Court of Cassation to essentially overrule the aspect of the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision holding that the whole Parliament must be immediately dissolved because of flaws in the electoral system used to fill a third of the seats.

On 11 July, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi declared he will seek dialogue with political forces and judicial authorities to resolve the row over the dissolved parliament. He also said that he will respect Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court ruling that blocked his decision to call the nation's parliament back into session.&lt;ref name="CNN20120712"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's president vows to 'respect' court ruling on parliament|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/11/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html?hpt=iaf_c1|publisher=CNN|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morsi pledges respect for Egypt court rulings|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/2012711171531842973.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt crisis: Mursi seeks talks on parliament row|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18800533|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July, the parliament's request to examine Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court ruling that dissolved the Islamist-led assembly was rebuffed by the Court of Cassation. Egypt's highest appeals court unanimously ruled on 14 July 2012 it has no jurisdiction over the implementation of the 14 June 2012 constitutional court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=assation Court claims it has no jurisdiction over parliament fight|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/07/14/cassation-court-claims-it-has-no-jurisdiction-over-parliament-fight/|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily News Egypt|date=14 July 2012|author=Rana Muhammad Taha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt appeals court says no jurisdiction over Parliament rulings|url=http://www.bikyamasr.com/72755/egypt-appeals-court-says-no-jurisdiction-over-parliament-rulings/|publisher=bikyamasr.com|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Appeals Court Rejects Requests To Hear Parliament Case|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-14/egypt-appeals-court-rejects-requests-to-hear-parliament-case-1-.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 July 2012|author=Alaa Shahine|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Appeals Court rejects suit on parliament legality|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/47669/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-appeals-court-rejects-suit-on-parliament-leg.aspx|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=Al-Ahram|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July, more than 20000 workers at Egypt's largest textiles manufacturing company, which saw major strikes in [[2006 El-Mahalla El-Kubra strike|2006]] and [[2008 Egyptian general strike|2008]], began their first day of strikes demanding an increase in wages and more government investment in their sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 Jul Web Only |url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/egyworkers-strike-mahalla-0022286 |title=#Egyworkers strike in Mahalla &amp;#124; The Stream - Al Jazeera English |publisher=Stream.aljazeera.com |date=2012-07-16 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July, the Administrative Judiciary Court of the State Council put on hold all appeals against the formulation of the Constituent Assembly, tasked with drafting a new constitution, until the court decides on 30 July 2012 on suits calling for a change of the judge presiding over the case. The court was also looking at a case filed against the supplementary constitutional decree released by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces days before President Mohamed Morsi's inauguration, and another against the president's decision to bring back the People's Assembly, parliament's lower house that SCAF dissolved after the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled the parliamentary elections law unconstitutional. The court ruled lack of jurisdiction on both cases and referred the latter back to the Supreme Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Administrative court recuses itself from controversial cases|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/administrative-court-recuses-itself-controversial-cases|accessdate=19 July 2012|newspaper=Egypt Independent also known as [[Al-masry Al-youm]]|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Luiz|title=Administrative Court deflects verdicts|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/07/19/administrative-court-deflects-verdicts/|accessdate=19 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Egypt|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fate of People's Assembly referred back to Egypt's High Constitutional Court|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/48154/Egypt/Politics-/Fate-of-Peoples-Assembly-referred-back-to-Egypts-H.aspx|accessdate=19 July 2012|newspaper=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt court says can't rule on fate of parliament|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120719-egypt-court-says-cant-rule-fate-parliament|work=Agence France-Presse|publisher=France24|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi ordered to release 572 people detained by the Egyptian military in the 2011 protests, and reduced the sentence of 16 others from life sentence to seven years in jail.&lt;ref name="XinhuaChinaDaily20121009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20121009"/&gt;

On 10 October, Egypt's prosecutor general Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud failed to win a conviction of two dozen Mubarak allies charged with orchestrating an attack by thugs on the protesters who ousted Mubarak. Some of the thugs were mounted, and the resulting melee became known as 2 February 2011 Battle of the Camels where men riding horses and camels charged into crowds on Cairo's Tahrir Square, setting off two days of clashes that ended with killing of nearly a dozen people.&lt;ref name="APBoston20121011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20121011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Egypt’s Chief Prosecutor Resists President’s Effort to Oust Him|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/middleeast/egypts-chief-prosecutor-refuses-morsis-effort-to-oust-him.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist groups and political parties called for a nationwide protest on 12 October 2011 after a court acquitted all 24 people charged with involvement in the Battle of Camels.&lt;ref name="WP20121011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hauslohner|first=Abigail|title=Egypt’s Morsi moves to dismiss top prosecutor after ‘camel battle’ acquittals|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypts-morsi-moves-to-dismiss-top-prosecutor-after-camel-battle-acquittals/2012/10/11/d761795c-13e5-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October, Despite the fact that Egyptian law protects the prosecutor general from being ousted by the president, president Morsi ordered Egypt's prosecutor general Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud to leave his position as prosecutor general to defuse public anger over acquittals in the Battle of the Camels case.

On 12 October, Critics and supporters of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi clashed in Cairo's Tahrir Square on 12 October 2012 in a small but potent rally, as liberal and secular activists erupted with anger accusing the Muslim Brotherhood of trying to take over the country.

The secular camp accused the Brotherhood of holding the gathering to "hijack" the square from their anti-Morsi protest. The violence erupted when Morsi supporters stormed a stage set up by the rival camp, angered by chants they perceived as insults to the president.&lt;ref name="APHP20121012"/&gt;

On 13 October, Egypt's president Morsi backed down on 13 October 2012 from his decision to remove the country's top prosecutor Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud, keeping him in his post and sidestepping a potential clash with the country's powerful judiciary.

'''William of Poitiers''' ({{circa}} 1020 {{ndash}} 1090) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] priest of [[Normans|Norman]] origin and [[chaplain]] of Duke William of Normandy ([[William the Conqueror]]) (Guillaume le Conquerant), for whom he chronicled the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in his '''''Gesta VVillelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum''''' ("The Deeds of William, [[Duke of Normandy]] and King of England") or '''''Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum'''''. He had trained as a soldier before taking [[holy orders]].

==Life==
Little is known about William of Poitiers, with most information coming from [[Orderic Vitalis]] in his ''Historia Ecclesiactica'', written in 1114-1115 and 1125.&lt;ref name="Southern"&gt;R.H.C. Davis 'William of Poitiers and his history of William the Conqueror', in Davis, R.H.C. and Wallace-Hadrill, J.M. (eds.) The Writing of history in the Middle Ages: essays presented to Richard William Southern (Oxford, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} He was apparently born in [[Les Préaux]], France, near [[Pont-Audemer]] to an influential knightly Norman family, Probably about 1020. According to Orderic, William originally trained as a knight, which gave him a much greater insight into the details of war than the typical medieval clerical writer. About 1049 he decided to enter the church, turning away from his knightly duties. Once he turned to the priesthood, William studied at the renowned school of Saint Hilaire-le-Grand in Poitiers and was said by Orderic to have returned to Normandy 'more learned than all his friends and neighbours'.&lt;ref name="Southern"/&gt;{{rp|85}}
William was given positions of ecclesiastical authority, becoming chaplain to Duke William and archdeacon of [[Lisieux]]. However, he doesn't appear in any ecclesiastical or royal and ducal charters as might be expected from someone of such a position, which perhaps casts doubts over Orderic's account of William of Poitiers life.&lt;ref&gt;R.H.C. Davis and Marjorie Chibnall (eds.) 'Introduction' from William of Poitiers 'Gesta Guillemi' - The Deeds of William the Conqueror', trans. Davis, R.H.C. and Marjorie Chibnall (oxford 1998) p.xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;
Little is known about his old age, and he probably retired into a religious house, or possibly political disgrace.&lt;ref name="Southern"/&gt;{{rp|92}} This is implied by Orderic's statement that William of Poitiers was forced to stop writing his history of William the Conqueror due to ″unfavorable circumstances″, of which we do not know the nature.&lt;ref name="Southern"/&gt;{{rp|84}} Possible links between William of Poitiers and Duke William's rebellious son Robert can be found, and may therefore provide an explanation for this.&lt;ref name="Southern"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

==''Gesta Guillelmi''==
William of Poitiers wrote the Gesta Guillelmi some time after 1066. It tells the story of how, Duke William prepared for and achieved, the Conquest of England. It also justifies William's succession to the English throne. The bulk of the writing probably took place 1071 – 1077.

The Gesta Guillelmi is the earliest extended biography of any Duke of Normandy, and is an invaluable source for the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066. William of Poitiers was well placed to write the Gesta Guillelmi, being both trained as a military knight and serving as a chaplain within Duke William's household.
 
There are no surviving manuscripts of the 'Gesta Guillemi'. André Duchesne published an edition in 1619, although even his (now lost) manuscript was missing its beginning and end. Its present form covers the period from 1047 to 1068, and both starts and finishes mid-sentence. There is also some retrospective material concerning affairs in England after Cnut's death (1035). Orderic Vitalis says that it originally finished in 1071. The Gesta Guillelmi is most valuable as a source for the Battle of Hastings, probably based on first hand oral evidence.

The 'History' also serves as a [[panegyric]] to William the Conqueror. R. Allen Brown writes: "Within the panegyric there is a wealth of facts and details... most derived from personal knowledge and personal contacts, compiled and intelligently put together by a man uniquely qualified as both clerk and knight, closely connected with the court&amp;nbsp;... One may add that William of Poitiers must have known his hero from their joint youth up, and stress that as both former knight and former chaplain of the duke he is able to bring us closer to the heart of Normandy in the mid-eleventh century than any other writer of that age or later."&lt;ref&gt;R. Allen Brown, Anglo-Norman Studies III: Proceedings of the Battle Conference (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of the Gesta Guillelmi==
William of Poitiers undoubtedly thought of himself as an historian. He mentions in the Gesta Guillelmi that the duty of a historian is to remain within the 'bounds of the truth.'; but he failed to obey this rule. Antonia Gransden in 'Historical writing in England c.550 to c.1307' shows that William of Poitiers was just as much a panegyrist as a historian. She summarises Gesta Guillelmi as 'biased, unreliable account of events, and unrealistic portraits of the two principle protagonists.'&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Gransden, Historical Writing in England c.550 to c.1307 (London, 1974) p.102&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Orderic Vitalis, who uses the Gesta Guillelmi as his principal source in creating his 'Ecclesiastical History', chooses to omit or contradict many of Poitiers' passages in the Guesta Guillelmi, including denial of King William's mercy to the conquered English; having been brought up in England from 1075–1085, Orderic knew better. However, the Gesta Guillelmi cannot be dismissed; most of the panegyrical passages are easy to isolate, and there is a lot of material that William of Poitiers probably reports accurately.

==Sources Importance==
William of Poitier is largely known as a key figure in the study of the Norman conquest due to 'Gesta Guillelmi'. He describes his own life while also outlining the events of the Norman conquest, the greatest significance of the source is the large focus on military tactics which only a figure who has served as a knight could appreciate. William of Poitier offers an insight which is not addressed in other contemporary texts such as the Anglo-Saxon chronicle.
As a figure himself William of Poitiers offers an example of social mobility from a knight to taking holy orders. Furthermore Poitier was so close to Duke William that he has a closer view of Norman actions, this justifies the wide usage of the source as a key factor in studying 1066 and the Norman conquest in general.

==What it tells us==
'''Anglo/Saxon Society'''
William of Poitiers details the life of Duke William. Nonetheless, there are a few insights into pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon society. For example, William of Poitiers reports that a Danish raiding party returned from England with 'great booty'.&lt;ref&gt;The Gesta Guillelmi of William of Poitiers, edited and translated by R.H.C Davis and Majorie Chibnall (Oxford, 1998) i. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Harold is said to have had 'abundant treasure with which to tempt dukes'.&lt;ref name="Gesta"&gt;The Gesta Guillelmi of William of Poitiers, edited and translated by R.H.C Davis and Majorie Chibnall (Oxford, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ii. 4}} This may explain the numerous attacks England suffered during the 10th – early 11th century.
William of Poitiers believed that the pre-Conquest English 'all showed love of their country', suggesting some sort of national identity that was lacking in Normandy.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|ii.16}}

'''Norman Society''' 
William of Poitiers provides a picture of Norman France prior to 1066. The various rebellions Duke William faced in his early reign are detailed in what was a fractured Duchy. The local Norman lords constantly waging private wars contrasts with the relatively stable Anglo-Saxon Kingdom across the Channel. The domestic turbulence forced Duke William to confront and subdue his nobility, sometimes by co-operation than coertion; for example, despite revolting against Duke William, the Gesta Guillemi states that Guy of Burgundy was allowed to remain in his court.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|i.9}}
William of Poitiers shows that the Norman castle was an important element of society. An effective Duke could use them as strategic power bases, stamping their authority on the rural Duchy; however, a castle could also be a rallying point for rebellious nobles. William of Poitiers reports many a ducal siege as a result.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|i.9}}

'''Medieval Literary Tradition'''
As a eulogising text, William of Poitiers's history constantly highlights William's admirable qualities, for example that the Duke 'excelled in intelligence, assiduity, and strength'.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|i.12}} For William of Poitiers, Duke William embodies the perfect ideals of knighthood, as illustrated by improbable stories scattered through his history; for example he states that William, with 50 of his knights, fought and bested a force of 1000.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|i.17}} This represents a clear exaggeration. 
William of Poitiers also relates Duke William's exploits to those of the Greek and Roman world. For example, there is a lengthy comparison between William and Caesar's conquest of Britain.&lt;ref name="Gesta"/&gt;{{rp|ii. 39–40}} Not only was this done to flatter Duke William but also shows William of Poitiers' own knowledge.

'''The Battle of Hastings'''
The Gesta Guillelmi provides the traditional narrative of the Battle of Hastings. William of Poitiers gives detailed descriptions of the composition of both the Norman and [[Anglo Saxon]] armies. Furthermore, he describes the famous 'feigned flight' manoeuvre.
