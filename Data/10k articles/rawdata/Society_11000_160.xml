The '''2007 Chinese slave scandal''' ({{zh|s=山西黑砖窑案|t=山西黑磚窯案|p=Shānxī Hēi Zhuān Yáo àn|l=Shanxi Black Brick Kiln incident}}) was a series of [[forced labour]] cases in [[Shanxi]], China. Thousands of [[Chinese people]] including many children had been forced to work as [[slave]]s in illegal [[brickyard]]s, and were tortured by the owners of the brickyards. As of June 2007, approximately 550 people have been rescued from such situations.

==Background==
Shanxi is located in the [[Loess Plateau]] in northern China which is known for its rich [[clay]] deposits which are easier and cheaper to mine than coal. Through corrupt relationships with officials, slave "bosses" opened illegal brickyards. Due to a scarcity of labor in Shanxi, some factories outsourced production to middlemen who recruited workers from other provinces, making huge profits for the bosses. For example, in one notorious case, it was reported that Wang Bingbing, the son of Wang Dongyi, a secretary of a local CCP branch, was the owner of a brickyard located in [[Hongdong]] County, [[Linfen]].&lt;ref name="brickyard" /&gt; The owner outsourced the brickyard to Heng Tinghan, who was from [[Henan]]. The brickyard produces 10,000 bricks per day. The market price for 10,000 bricks is about 2,000 to 3,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]]; the owner, however, paid only 360 yuan to Heng per 10,000 bricks produced.  Wang Bingbing and Heng Tinghan, along with three other employees, including Heng's son, were later charged with a variety of crimes including murder, illegal detention, and forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article2607405.ece|title = Brickyard slavery trial opens in China|last = |first = |date = July 5, 2007|work = The Times Asia|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of illegal brickyards was first reported to authorities in 1998. On 1 May, Chen Jianjiao, a representative of the Shanxi People's Congress, received a telephone call from a laborer who had escaped from an illegal brickyard. The escaped man also wrote to the chairman of the Shanxi People's Congress. As a result, slave rescue operations were carried out by provincial government authorities without notifying local officials. Over 150 slaves, three of them child laborers, were freed from these illegal brickyards.  Chen Jianjiao himself was responsible for helping to free hundreds of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://english.cri.cn/2946/2007/06/21/198@240690.htm|title = China Strikes at Root of Brick Kiln Slavery Scandal|last = |first = |date = 2007-06-21|work = CRI English|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been continuing reports of cruelty committed at these illegal brickyards since 2004. On 7 May 2007, Henan TV Metro Channel reported the case of five minors around sixteen years old who had disappeared from the environs of [[Zhengzhou]] Railway Station. Having heard of earlier instances of [[child labor]]ers being kidnapped for brickyards in Shanxi, their parents suspected their children might be found there. Two months later these five were among fifty minors from Henan who were found at an illegal brickyard. [[Human traffickers]] had sold them to brickyards for 500 Yuan each.  Later in 2011, it was found that the practice had not abated, as disabled men in Zhengzhou were still being kidnapped and forced to labor in the brickyards.  The scandal was only uncovered following an undercover investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://world.time.com/2011/09/08/another-slavery-scandal-uncovered-in-central-china/|title = Another Slavery Scandal Uncovered in Central China|last = Ramzy|first = Austin|date = Sep 8, 2011|work = Time Magazine Online|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, reporters from Henan Television, accompanied by two parents, visited the sites of some illegal brickyards in Shanxi undercover. Reporters later visited many illegal brickyards in [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]] and [[Jincheng]]. The conditions they found were clearly those of slavery.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Concealed camera revealed that the local police refused to take action to rescue the slaves. Later the reporters were allowed into the illegal brickyards with the company of the local police. Concealed camera showed the police keeping them from rescuing children who were not from Henan which showed obvious local government protection for the illegal brickyards.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykc6wr2y4Ug&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working conditions==
The brickyard owners had purchased laborers from human traffickers to use as slaves. Many of the slaves were sold for CNY300 to CNY400 including delivery. The slaves included children as young as eight years old&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7315|title=Mines and Communities: From bloodstained mine-shafts to brickyard slavery, blind faith in Deng Xiaoping theory is the real|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teenagers. Moreover, brickyard owners hired guards and [[wolfdog]]s to watch their slaves. These slaves were forced to work over sixteen hours every day and any mistakes were punished by brutal torture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tiger Head, Snake Tails: China today, how it got there and why it has to change|last = Fenby|first = Jonathan|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster UK|year = 2012|isbn = 0857200887|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teenager who was rescued from an illegal brickyard said that, during his slavery, he had been taken to another brickyard by his boss to watch another slave being fed to a meat grinder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigation==
As the scandal received immediate media attention, it also caught the eyes of the country's major leaders, including President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]]. Governor [[Yu Youjun]] of Shanxi province offered an unprecedented self-criticism, took responsibility, and tendered his resignation on 30 August. He was replaced by [[Meng Xuenong]], an official who had been sacked as Beijing mayor after the SARS outbreak.&lt;ref name="scmp1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chow Chung-yan| title=Official sacked over Sars fiasco vows to do better in Shanxi| journal=South China Morning Post| date=5 September 2007| pages=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2007, 570 people in [[Shanxi]] and [[Henan]] were freed by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="brickyard"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Convictions in China slave trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6902459.stm |work= |publisher=BBC |date=17 July 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those rescued, sixty-nine of them were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zhu |last=Zhe |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=More than 460 rescued from brickyard slavery |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/15/content_894802.htm |work= |publisher=''China Daily'' |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080107111729/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/15/content_894802.htm| archivedate= 7 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the Chinese government assembled a force of 35,000 police to check northern Chinese brickyards for slaves, sent dozens of brickyard supervisors to prison, punished ninety-five low level officials in Shanxi province for dereliction of duty, and sacked twenty-four. One brickyard foreman, Heng Tinghan, was sentenced to life in prison, and an employee of his, Zhao Tanbing, earned the death penalty for killing a mentally handicapped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionandjustice.org/china-strikes-back-at-brickyard-slavery-china-workers/|title=Mission &amp; Justice - Blog Archive - China strikes back at brickyard slavery|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; slave.&lt;ref name="brickyard"/&gt;  However, no senior officials were held accountable.&lt;ref name="mac" /&gt;

A group of lawyers from Guangdong created the "Blue Ribbon Campaign" on the internet to promote awareness of the situation of children who are kidnapped and taken to these brickyards.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Wider practice of slavery in China==
Although over 500 slaves were rescued in 2007, the practice has never been stopped. In May 2012, 8 people aged between 12 and 22 were reported as missing, with 6 missing within the previous 12 months near Xinyun Cold Storage, Jincheng Town, Yunnan Province. Seven of the eight families reported their missing children to the police. The police only responded to one report and went to inspect the site once. The 8 missing are suspected to have been sold to illegal brickyards.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">The '''2010 Duke University faux sex thesis controversy''' arose from a private 42-page [[Powerpoint]] document written by a [[Duke University]] senior, Karen Owen, in the format of a thesis about her sexual experiences during her time attending the university.

==The controversy==
Shortly before graduating from [[Duke University]] in May 2010, Karen Owen wrote a thesis styled document about her sexual experiences during her time attending the university. She privately distributed the document to three friends. In mid-September 2010, during Homecoming weekend, one of these friends decided to forward it onward, and the document went [[viral email|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pradip |last=Koti |url=http://today24news.com/breaking/duke-university-scandal-excelling-in-the-realm-of-horizontal-academics-085330 |date=October 8, 2010 |title=Duke University Scandal "Excelling in the Realm of Horizontal Academics" |accessdate=10 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009181159/http://today24news.com/breaking/duke-university-scandal-excelling-in-the-realm-of-horizontal-academics-085330 |archivedate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5653374/heres-what-it-looks-like-as-the-duke-fuck-list-goes-viral |title=A Glimpse Into How The Duke Fuck List Went Viral |first=A.

The bulk of the controversy surrounded whether she invaded her partners' [[Privacy laws of the United States#Right to privacy|rights to privacy]], and whether the subjects of Owen's faux thesis have a right to sue, as was done in the case of [[Jessica Cutler]] when Cutler published details of her sex life on a [[blog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karen Owen's Duke Sex-Rating PowerPoint Goes Viral (VIDEO) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/07/karen-owen-duke-sex-rati_n_754186.html |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=October 7, 2010 |first=Leah |last=Finnegan |accessdate=9 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008214919/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/07/karen-owen-duke-sex-rati_n_754186.html |archivedate=8 October 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also raised questions as to whether [[double standard]]s exist if the reaction would have been the same had the faux thesis been written by a male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/08/karen-owen-duke-sex_n_755903.html |title=Karen Owen PowerPoint: Duke University Student's Sex Thesis Poses Question Of Double Standard |date=October 8, 2010 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=9 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011025845/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/08/karen-owen-duke-sex_n_755903.html |archivedate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The faux dissertation attracted additional attention because some of the men whom Owen ranked were from the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|lacrosse team]], and there was an [[Duke lacrosse case|unrelated sex controversy surrounding the team]] a few years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke coed’s scandalous sex ratings are viral sensation|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39552862/39552111|date=October 7, 2010|first=Michael|last=Inbar|publisher=[[NBC News]]| accessdate= 9 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
About a month after the faux thesis made headlines, the Duke University History Department held a forum about the long term implications of the faux thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke History Department Hosts "Fuck List" Forum|first=Irin|last=Carmon|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-20|url=http://jezebel.com/5676755/duke-history-department-hosts-fuck-list-forum|publisher=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after that, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' published an article discussing this incident in the context of Duke's culture as well as binge drinking by women.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/the-hazards-of-duke/8328/|title=The Hazards of Duke|last=Flanagan|first=Caitlin|date=January–February 2011|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The author==

===Background===
Karen Owen, the author of the faux thesis, grew up in [[Branford, Connecticut]]  and graduated from [[Branford High School (Connecticut)|Branford High School]] in 2006. She won a scholarship to attend Duke and was a very avid sports fan during her time there.&lt;ref name="New Haven Register"&gt;{{cite news|title=Branford High grad’s sex life ‘thesis’ goes viral; Online slide show rates prowess of Duke athletes|url=http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/10/13/news/shoreline/doc4cb53e5b63db9942803332.txt?viewmode=fullstory|date=October 13, 2010|publisher=[[New Haven Register]]|first=Mark|last=Zaretsky| accessdate= 16 January 2012 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following the controversy===
After her faux dissertation went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], Owen deleted, closed down, or blocked access to her [[social networking]] sites. She stated "that fraternities 'make lists like this all the time.'" She also expressed deep regret over the incident, saying that she would have "never intentionally hurt the people that [were] mentioned [in the faux thesis]."&lt;ref name="New Haven Register"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlprraumInfamy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alptraum |first1=Lux |title=There Is Life After Campus Infamy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/style/campus-sex-women-exposure.html |accessdate=22 July 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*On December 1, 2010, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' aired an episode called "Rescue", based on the story of Karen Owen's faux sex thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/popular-tv-show-airs-episode-inspired-owen-powerpoint|title=Popular TV show airs episode inspired by Owen PowerPoint|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-06|first=Julia|last=Love|publisher=[[The Chronicle (Duke University)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The feature film [[The Escort (2015 film)|The Escort]] features a [[prostitute]] with a similar back story, making it impossible for her to get a real job.

In May 2003 AGLA France launched "ThePink", the first [[LGBT]] online magazine in the [[Armenian language]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} By promoting public awareness on such issues as homophobia, [[coming out]] and [[HIV]]/STI prevention, AGLA sought to prepare the ground for the movement in favor of [[LGBT rights in Armenia]].

In August 2003, President [[Robert Kocharyan]] ratified Armenia's new penal code which removes the former anti-gay article 116.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/armenia/arnews006.htm |title=Armenia Decriminalizes Sex Between Men |publisher=Sodomylaws.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, Armen Avetisyan, leader of [[Armenian Aryan Union]] (AAU), an ultra-nationalist Armenian political party, announced that some senior Armenian officials were gay. That prompted heated debates in parliament that were broadcast over the public TV channel. Some members of Armenian Parliament stated that any member found to be gay should resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/armenia/arnews007.htm |title=Bigots on Baghramian?: Parliament Members Continue Gay Debate |publisher=Glapn.org |date=2004-11-06 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGLA France organized a protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-lgbt.org/spip.php?article370&amp;var_recherche=agla |title=Rassemblement devant l’ambassade d’Arménie (in French) |publisher=Inter-lgbt.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denounce the AAU's homophobic campaign and the denigration of gays by Armenian lawmakers and media outlets. AGLA France also picketed in front of the Armenian embassy in Paris. The association also wrote an open letter to the President of Armenia that was published a few days later in the newspaper "Haykakan Zhamanak".

In 2005, AGLA France invited two young men from Armenia to participate in [[ILGA-Europe]]'s annual conference which was held in Paris. A year later Menq/WFCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.wfce.am/ |title=Menq/WFCE official website |publisher=Wfce.am |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first gay-operated NGO to fight HIV/AIDS, was registered in [[Yerevan]].

In 2006, two members of AGLA France celebrated an informal wedding ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianow.com/features/6512/love_and_loyalty_marriage_i |title="Love and Loyalty": Marriage in secret, in an environment of fear |publisher=Armenianow.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] (Holy See of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]). An article published in the newspaper ''168 Zham'' (168 Hours) about this improvised marriage provoked a scandal and indignation at local conservative media outlets and among politicians and religious officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gayrussia.ru/en/news/detail.php?ID=6278 |title=First symbolical Gay wedding in Armenia |publisher=GayRussia.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202083236/http://www.gayrussia.ru/en/news/detail.php?ID=6278 |archive-date=2007-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/armenia/first_symbolical_gay_wedding_in_armenia/ |title=First symbolical Gay wedding in Armenia |publisher=ILGA-Europe |date=2001-12-01 |accessdate=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030232734/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/armenia/first_symbolical_gay_wedding_in_armenia |archivedate=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGLA France ceased its activities in 2007.

The [[Baloch people|Baloch]] is  a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. They are descended from [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribesmen who settled in this region of [[North India]] in the late Middle Ages. The community use the surname [[Khan (name)|Khan]], and are often known as [[Baloch people|Khan Baloch]].&lt;ref name="Tribes_William_Crook"&gt;Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh by William Crook&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
In the 16th century{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, some of the Baloch moved into [[Sindh]] (where they are known as the [[Sindhi Baloch]]) and also into [[Punjab region|Punjab]].&lt;ref name="Tribes_William_Crook"/&gt;

Mir Jalal Khan was one of the Baloch historical rulers, and from his four sons— [[Rind (tribe)|Rind]], [[Lashari]], [[Hooth]] and [[Korai]] spring the four main Baloch tribes. The [[Jatoi (tribe)|Jatoi]] are the children of Jato, Jalal Khan's daughter. These main sections are now divided into innumerable septs. Historically, in Uttar Pradesh and [[Haryana]], the term Baloch denoted any Muslim camel-man. The word has come to be associated with the care of camels, because the Baloch settlers of the Western plains have taken to the grazing and breeding of camels rather than to husbandry.

In the middle of the 17th century the [[Brahui people|Brahuis]], with the help of [[Turkish people|Turks]], took advantage of the Balochis weakness after the Rind-Lashari war which lasted for 30 years and had driven them out of the [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]] valley. Yielding to pressure they moved eastward into the [[Sulaiman Mountains]], drove out the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]s, and settled along the banks of the [[Indus]]. According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], the Balochis migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries,&lt;ref name="Mann2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change, Volume 1, The Earth System: Physical and Chemical Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|format=PDF|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/shared/articles/littleiceage.pdf|author= Mann, Michael|editor=Michael C MacCracken and John S Perry|accessdate=17 November 2012|chapter=Little Ice Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb1972"&gt;{{cite book|chapter = The cold Little Ice Age climate of about 1550 to 1800|author=Lamb, HH|title=Climate: present, past and future|publisher= Methuen|location=London|year=1972|page=107|isbn=0-416-11530-6}} (noted in Grove 2004:4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Glossary"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Earth observatory Glossary L-N|publisher=NASA|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Glossary/?mode=alpha&amp;seg=l&amp;segend=n|place=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Green Belt MD|accessdate=17 July 2015|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to Professor Baloch, the climate of Balochistan was very cold and the region was inhabitable during the winter so the Baloch people migrated in waves and settled in [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/688234/from-zardaris-to-makranis-how-the-baloch-came-to-sindh/ From Zardaris to Makranis: How the Baloch came to Sindh]&lt;/ref&gt; The three Baloch adventurers Ismail Khan, Fatteh Khan, and Ghazi Khan, founded the three Dehras (encampments) that bear their names, and established themselves as independent rulers of the Lower [[Derajat]] and [[Muzaffargarh District|Muzaffargarh]], which they and their descendants held for nearly 300 years. The three brothers founded the settlements of [[Dera Ghazi Khan]], [[Dera Ismail Khan]] and [[Darya Khan]]. Thence the southern Balochis gradually spread into the valleys of the [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Chenab]], and [[Sutlej]], and in 1555 a large body of Balochis, under their great leader [[Mir Chakar]], accompanied the Emperor [[Humayun]] into India. It is probable that many of the Baloch settlements, in [[North India]] (Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh), were founded by [[Humayun]]'s soldiers. [[Mir Chakar]] settled in [[Sahiwal]] and his tomb still exists at Satgarha, where he founded a military colony of [[Rind (tribe)|Rind]]s.

=== Baloch of the Doab ===

Now the most important Baloch colonies in Uttar Pradesh are those of [[Amirnagar]], [[Faridnagar]], [[Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]], [[Garhi Abdullakhan|Garhi Abdullah Khan]](Kachhi Garhi), [[Garhi Pukhta]](Pakki Garhi), [[Jasoi]] and [[Baghra]] in [[Muzaffarnagar District]] they all villages were rewarded by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] to four brothers Sher Khan, Amir Khan, Bairam khan,Hashim Khan and their sister's husband Abdullah Khan they all were from Baloch families. They settled in the district during the rule of the [[Aurangzeb]], and rose to prominence as the [[Mughal Empire]] disintegrated. Another two prominent Baloch families were those of Tajpuri and Jhajhar, in [[Bulandshahr District]]. The Tajpuri Baloch are descended from Nahar Khan, who is said to have from [[Seistan]] during the rule of [[Alauddin Khalji]]. Nahar Khan was latter appointed governor of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], and his son Sardar Khan founded a settlement in Ganaura Shaikh, and the family rose to some prominence during the rule of the Aurangzeb. While the Jhajhar family claim descent from Syed Mohammad Khan, a [[Leghari tribe|Leghari]] Baloch, who was granted a [[jagir]] by the Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]]. They played a key role in the post-Mughal history of the [[Doab]] region, but began to decline with the rise of British power in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Bulandshahr District: United Provinces Gazetteers edited H Neville page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Tufail Ahmed Khan Baloch migrated from India to Pakistan after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947. He helped many others Muslim refugees from India to settle in Pakistan. Presently many Tajpuri Baloch are settled in [[Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Lahore]], [[Islamabad]], and different parts of Pakistan.

The Baloch of Haryana emigrated to Pakistan at the time of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947. The Baloch now speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and the [[Khari Boli]] dialect, and are found in the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref name="Tribes_William_Crook"/&gt;

=== Baloch of Rohilkhand ===

The Balochs of [[Rohilkhand]] accompanied [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], [[Rohilla]] conqueror. They have now been assimilated into the Rohilla community, and lost their distinct Baloch identity. The Rohilkhand Baloch belong mainly to the [[Magsi]], [[Leghari tribe|Leghari]] and [[Mazari tribe|Mazari]] tribes. These Baloch are found mainly in the districts of [[Bareilly district|Bareilly]], [[Badaun District|Badaun]], [[Bijnor District|Bijnor]], [[Shahjahanpur District|Shahjahanpur]] and [[Moradabad District|Moradabad]].&lt;ref name="Tribes_William_Crook"/&gt;

There is also a single settlement of Baloch in [[Lucknow District]], at Baluchgarhi. These Baloch are descendants of mercenaries brought by the [[Nawabs of A
wadh]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Gazetteer of Lucknow District Volume XXXVII: Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Baloch of North India are now altogether separated from the Baloch tribes of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and tribal divisions are no longer important. They are found in the districts of [[Meerut district|Meerut]], [[Muzaffarnagar district|Muzaffarnagar]], [[Bulandshahr district|Bulandshar]] and [[Aligarh]]. Their customs are similar to those of the neighbouring Muslim communities such as the [[Jhojha]] and [[Ranghar]]. The Baloch reside in mixed Muslim villages, occupying their own quarters, and are largely small and medium-sized farmers, with a small number being landless agricultural labourers. Their most important settlements are in several villages in and around the town of Baghra in Muzaffarnagar District. A second cluster of Baloch villages exist in Bulandshahr District, where there are several villages near the towns of [[Jhajhar]] and Chanderu. In addition, the town of [[Faridnagar]] in [[Ghaziabad district, India|Ghaziabad District]] is home to an important colony of Baloch. They marry with other Muslim communities and some members are [[endogamy|endogamous]], marrying within close kin, and like other North Indian Muslim communities. The Baloch practice both cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages. They speak both Urdu and Khari Boli, the local dialect in the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;Rivalry and Brotherhood; Politics in the life of Farmers in Northern India by Dipankar Gupta&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baloch are almost entirely [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] [[Muslim]]s, and like other Doab Muslim communities have been influenced by the [[Deobandi]] reformist movement. They have no formal community association, although most villages with Baloch do have traditional associations, known as panchayats. These panchayats exercise social control, and are deal with intra community disputes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The Baloch of Balochgarhi in [[Lucknow District]] considers themselves simply as a sub-group of the [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]], with whom they intermarry. They speak the [[Awadhi]] dialect, as well as standard Urdu. The community are mainly small and medium-sized farmers, although historically many were employed by the state police. They have no connection with the Baloch of the Doab. There are also small number of Baloch colonies in [[Sitapur District|Sitapur]], [[Lakhimpur Kheri District|Kheri]] and [[Hardoi District|Hardoi]]. Many of the [[Awadh]] Baloch are [[Shia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There are a number of '''Basque breeds and cultivars'''. These are domesticated animals that have been bred - or plant species cultivated - for particular traits and features by [[Basque people]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].

Some, such as the [[Alano Español]], are not originally Basque but have only survived in the Basque Country.

===Basque apple cultivars===
[[Image:Igartubeiti.JPG|thumb|250px|An exhibition of apple cultivars at the Igartubeiti [[baserri]] in [[Ezkio-Itsaso]]]]
Apple growing has a long history in the Basque Country, in particular for use in making [[Sagardotegi|Basque cider]]. The earliest written records on cider making and drinking go back to the 11th and 12th century, the very first being a record of [[Sancho III of Navarre]] sending an [[envoy (title)|envoy]] to the [[Monastery of Leyre|Monastery of Leire]] in 1014 who mentions apples and cider-making. The other is the circa 1134 diary of the pilgrim [[Aymeric Picaud]] included in the ''[[Codex Calixtinus]]'' who mentions the Basques being notable for growing apples and drinking cider. The 16th century [[inquisitor]] [[Pierre de Lancre]] also refers to the Basque Country as "the land of the apple". 

Many varieties exist and are used for making cider. [[Resurrección María de Azkue|Azkue]]'s dictionary alone, which was printed in 1905, lists more than 80 Basque varieties of apples.&lt;ref&gt;Azkue, RM. ''Diccionario Vasco-Español-Francés'' 1905&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the desired character of the finished cider, different varieties and proportions of apple varieties are used. Some common varieties include:

*''Errezila'', sharp and sweet (mottled green), the most common Basque apple variety
*''Geza miña'', sharp; also called ''sagar zuria'' and ''esnaola sagarra'' (green)
*''Goikoetxea'', sharp (red)
*''Mokoa'', sharp (red)
*''Mozoloa'' sweet and fresh (green)
*''Patzuloa'', sweet and fresh (light green)

'''Basque '''({{IPAc-en|b|æ|s|k|,_|b|ɑː|s|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Basque}}; {{IPA|[bæsk]}} is the US pronunciation, in British English it is {{IPA|[bask]}} or {{IPA|[bɑːsk]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|eu|euskara}} {{IPA-eu|eus̺ˈkaɾa|}}) is a language spoken in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region that straddles the westernmost [[Pyrenees]] in adjacent parts of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]]. Linguistically, Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a [[language isolate]] to any other known living language. The Basques are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit, the Basque Country. The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% (751,500) of Basques in all territories. Of these, 93.2% (700,300) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% (51,200) are in the French portion.&lt;ref name=inkesta2016/&gt;

Native speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the [[French Basque Country|three "ancient provinces"]] in France. [[Gipuzkoa]], most of [[Biscay]], a few municipalities of [[Álava]], and the northern area of [[Navarre]] formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of Álava, the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish, either because Basque [[Language shift|was replaced]] by Spanish over the centuries, in some areas (most of Álava and central Navarre), or because it was possibly never spoken there, in other areas (parts of the [[Enkarterri]] and southeastern Navarre).

Under [[Restoration (Spain)|Restorationist]] and [[Francoist Spain]], public use of Basque was frowned upon, often regarded as a sign of [[Basque separatism|separatism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francisco Franco|url=http://www.history.com/topics/francisco-franco}}&lt;/ref&gt; this applied especially to those regions that did not support Franco's uprising (such as Biscay or Gipuzkoa). Overall, in the 1960s and later, the trend reversed and education and publishing in Basque began to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Robert|title=The Basques: the Franco years and beyond|year=1979|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Reno (Nevada)|isbn=0-87417-057-5|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this process, a standardised form of the Basque language, called [[Standard Basque|Euskara Batua]], was developed by the [[Euskaltzaindia]] in the late 1960s.
Besides its standardised version, the five historic Basque dialects are [[Biscayan dialect|Biscayan]], [[Gipuzkoan dialect|Gipuzkoan]], and [[Eastern Navarrese dialect|Upper Navarrese]] in Spain, and [[Navarro-Lapurdian dialect|Navarrese–Lapurdian]] and [[Souletin dialect|Souletin]] in France. They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies from region to region and from school to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consejoescolar.educacion.navarra.es/attachments/article/368/Informe%20del%20Sistema%20Educativo%20en%20Navarra%202011-2012.pdf |title=Navarrese Educational System.

A language isolate, Basque is believed to be one of the few surviving [[pre-Indo-European languages]] in Europe, and is the only one in Western Europe. The [[origin of the Basques]] and of their languages is not conclusively known, though the most accepted current theory is that early forms of Basque developed before the arrival of [[Indo-European languages]] in the area, including the [[Romance languages]] that geographically surround the Basque-speaking region. Basque has adopted a good deal of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.

The [[Basque alphabet]] uses the [[Latin script]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Names of the language==
{{See also|Basques#Etymology of the word Basque}}
In Basque, the name of the language is officially ''Euskara'' (alongside various [[Basque dialects#Dialectal divergence|dialect]] forms).

In French, the language is normally called ''basque'', though in recent times ''euskara'' has become common. Spanish has a greater variety of names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as ''el vasco'', ''la lengua vasca'', or ''el euskera''. Both terms, ''vasco'' and ''basque'', are inherited from Latin [[ethnonym]] ''[[Vascones]]'', which in turn goes back to the Greek term οὐασκώνους (''ouaskōnous''), an ethnonym used by [[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (23 CE, Book III).&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish term ''Vascuence'', derived from Latin ''vasconĭce'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=vascuence|title=Diccionario de la lengua española|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well-liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in [[Huesca]] in 1349 stated that ''Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercadería ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en '''basquenç''': et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol''—essentially penalising the use of Arabic, Hebrew, or Basque in marketplaces with a fine of 30 [[Solidus (coin)|sols]] (the equivalent of 30 sheep).&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, J.

==History and classification==
{{main|History of the Basque language}}
Basque is geographically surrounded by [[Romance languages]] but is a [[language isolate]] unrelated to them, and indeed, to any other language in the world. It is the last remaining descendant of one of the [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of Western Europe, the others being extinct outright.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt; Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the traditional [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins, but an early form of the Basque language likely was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.

Authors such as [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] have noted that the words for "knife" (''aizto''), "axe" (''aizkora''), and "hoe" (''aitzur'') derive from the word for "stone" (''haitz''), and have therefore concluded that the language dates to [[prehistoric Europe]] when those tools were made of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society'', volumes 52–56 (1942), page 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Lipscomb, ''Spain'' (2005), page 457&lt;/ref&gt; Others find this unlikely: see [[Origin of the Basques#The aizkora controversy|the ''aizkora'' controversy]].

Latin inscriptions in [[Gallia Aquitania]] preserve a number of words with [[cognate]]s in the reconstructed [[proto-Basque language]], for instance, the personal names ''Nescato'' and ''Cison'' (''neskato'' and ''gizon'' mean "young girl" and "man", respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the [[Roman Republic]]'s conquests in the western [[Pyrenees]]. Some authors even argue for [[late Basquisation]], that the language moved westward during [[Late Antiquity]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire ]] into the northern part of [[Hispania]] into what is now [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

Roman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] and [[Tartessian language]]s became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later [[Gascon language|Gascon]] (a branch of [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) in the northeast, [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the southeast and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the southwest.

===Hypotheses concerning Basque's connections to other languages===
The statistical improbability and chronological difficulty of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many [[pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. Almost all hypotheses concerning the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are:
* [[Iberian language|Iberian]]: another ancient language once spoken in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], shows several similarities with [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and Basque. However, not enough evidence exists to distinguish geographical connections from linguistic ones. Iberian itself remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]]. Eduardo Orduña Aznar claims to have established correspondences between Basque and Iberian numerals&lt;ref&gt;Orduña 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and noun case markers.
* [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]: possibly close to ([[Italo-Celtic|Italo-]])[[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or an Indo-European [[Creole language|creole]] possibly with a donor language akin to [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] on a substrate language akin to [[Italic languages|Italic]].&lt;ref name=Forni_1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forni|first=Gianfranco|title=Evidence for Basque as an Indo-European Language|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|date=2013|volume=41|page=39|url=https://www.academia.edu/3801960/Evidence_for_Basque_as_an_Indo-European_Language_EXCERPT_|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forni|first=Gianfranco|title=Evidence for Basque as an Indo-European Language: A Reply to the Critics|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|date=2013|volume=41|page=268|url=https://www.academia.edu/3801960/Evidence_for_Basque_as_an_Indo-European_Language_EXCERPT_|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forni considers it unrealistic that Basque is a non-Indo-European language that allegedly borrowed the majority of its basic lexicon (including virtually all verbs) and most of its archaic bound morphemes from neighboring Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name=Forni_1/&gt; In response, a non-Indo-European line of descent with waves or stages of Indo-European influence and minor discontinuities over probably millennia before the Roman conquest&lt;ref name=Koch_Basque&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=John T.|title=Is Basque an Indo-European Language?|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|date=2013|volume=41|page=255|url=https://www.academia.edu/4029770/Is_Basque_an_Indo-European_Language|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was suggested as the most likely alternative by [[John T. Koch]] in his review of Forni's paper outlining why an Indo-European classification of Basque cannot be accepted, even if some of Forni's data is accepted.&lt;ref name=Koch_Basque/&gt;
* [[Vasconic substratum theory]]: This proposal, made by the German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]], claims that enough [[Toponymy|toponymical]] evidence exists to conclude that Basque is the only survivor of a larger family that once extended throughout most of Western Europe, and has also left its mark in modern Indo-European languages spoken in Europe.
*[[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] substrate: This hypothesis proposed in the [[19th century]] by d'Arbois de Jubainville, J. Pokorny, P. Kretschmer and several other linguists encompasses the Basco-Iberian hypothesis.
* [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: Linking Basque to the [[Kartvelian languages]] is now widely discredited. The hypothesis was inspired by the existence of the ancient [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the [[Caucasus]] and further by some typological similarities between the two languages.&lt;ref&gt;José Ignacio Hualde, Joseba Lakarra, Robert Lawrence Trask (1995), ''Towards a history of the Basque language'', p. 81. John Benjamins Publishing Company, {{ISBN|90-272-3634-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[J. P. Mallory]], the hypothesis was also inspired by a Basque place-name ending in -''dze'' which is common in Kartvelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallory|first=J. P.|authorlink=J. P. Mallory|title=In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lENVpwAACAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory suggested that Basque and Georgian were remnants of a pre-Indo-European group. 
* [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], are seen by some linguists as more likely candidates for a very distant connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/mt26s.html A Final (?) Response to the Basque Debate in Mother Tongue 1] (John D. Bengston)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]]: Based on the possible Caucasian link, some linguists, for example [[John Bengtson]] and [[Merritt Ruhlen]], have proposed including Basque in the Dené–Caucasian superfamily of languages, but this proposed superfamily includes languages from North America and Eurasia, and its existence is highly controversial.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;
* [[Dogon languages|Dogon]]: The philologist Javier Martín Martín investigated on the subject and states that Basque is derived from Dogon, spoken in north-western Africa. This claim has been harshly contested by Xabier Kintana of the [[Euskaltzaindia]], who says that this theory makes no sense and consists of "cheap speculation", and criticises the lack of methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/cultura/detalle/1304478/teoria-origen-euskera--xabier-kintana-euskadi-irratia/|title=Kintana: '¿Por qué no decir que el dogón nació del euskera?'|last=EiTB|website=www.eitb.eus|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Euskara.png|thumb|Percentage of fluent speakers of Basque (areas where Basque is not spoken are included within the 0–4% interval)]]
[[File:Navarra - Mapa densidad euskera 2001.svg|thumb|right|Percentage of people fluent in Basque language in Navarre (2001), including second-language speakers]]
The region where Basque is spoken has become smaller over centuries, especially at the northern, southern, and eastern borders. Nothing is known about the limits of this region in ancient times, but on the basis of toponyms and epigraphs, it seems that in the beginning of the [[Common Era]] it stretched to the river [[Garonne]] in the north (including the southwestern part of present-day [[France]]); at least to the [[Val d'Aran]] in the east (now a [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking part of [[Catalonia]]), including lands on both sides of the [[Pyrenees]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|location=Zarautz (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southern and western boundaries are not clear at all.

The [[Reconquista]] temporarily counteracted this contracting tendency when the Christian lords called on Northern Iberian peoples—Basques, [[Asturians]], and "[[Franks]]"—to colonise the new conquests. The Basque language became the main everyday language, {{Where|date=January 2013}} while other languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[French language|French]], or [[Latin]] were preferred for the administration and high education.

By the 16th century, the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the southern part of Navarre, the southwestern part of [[Álava]], and the western part of Biscay, and including some parts of [[Béarn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|location=Zarautz (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of Álava—including its capital city [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=Arabako euskara|year=2012|publisher=Elkar|location=Andoain (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-15337-72-0|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces, Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed its border northwards. In the [[French Basque Country]], Basque was still spoken in all the territory except in [[Bayonne]] and some villages around, and including some bordering towns in [[Béarn]].

In the 20th century, however, the rise of [[Basque nationalism]] spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments in the [[Southern Basque Country]], it has recently made a modest comeback. In the Spanish part, Basque-language schools for children and Basque-teaching centres for adults have brought the language to areas such as [[Enkarterri]] and the [[Ribera d'Ebre]] in Navarre, where it is not known if it has ever been spoken before; and in the French Basque Country, these schools and centres have almost stopped the decline of the language.

===Official status===
[[File:Navarra - Zonificacion linguistica.png|thumb|Official status of the Basque language in Navarre]]
Historically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region. However, Basque was explicitly recognised in some areas. For instance, the ''[[fuero]]'' or charter of the Basque-colonised [[Ojacastro]] (now in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the [[13th century|13th]] and [[14th century|14th]] centuries.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] states in Article 3 that the [[Spanish language]] is the official language of the nation, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other [[languages of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#I2 |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Spanish Constitutional Court |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620064544/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#I2 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The Statute of Navarre establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre, but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the French Basque Country and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognised on the other side of the border.

The positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. The ''Ley del Vascuence'' ("Law of Basque"), seen as contentious by many Basques, but considered fitting Navarra's linguistic and cultural diversity by some of the main political parties of Navarre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20110217/navarra/el-parlamento-rechaza-ley-hacer-oficial-euskera-toda-navarra.html?not=2011021711344312&amp;idnot=2011021711344312&amp;dia=20110217&amp;seccion=navarra&amp;seccion2=politica&amp;chnl=10 |title=Navarrese Parliament rejects to grant Basque Language co-official status in Spanish-speaking areas by suppressing the linguistic delimitation |publisher=Diario de Navarra |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706214023/http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20110217/navarra/el-parlamento-rechaza-ley-hacer-oficial-euskera-toda-navarra.html?not=2011021711344312&amp;idnot=2011021711344312&amp;dia=20110217&amp;seccion=navarra&amp;seccion2=politica&amp;chnl=10 |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. Support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary, depending on the area. Others consider it unfair, since the rights of Basque speakers differ greatly depending on the place they live.

===Demographics===

[[File:Euskara iparraldean.ogv|thumb|Testimonies of Basque sociolinguistic dynamics (French Basque Country)]]
The 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque-speaking territories showed that in 2006, of all people aged 16 and above:&lt;ref name=IVInkesta&gt;''IV. Inkesta Soziolinguistikoa'' Gobierno Vasco, Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco 2008, {{ISBN|978-84-457-2775-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% [[passive speaker (language)|passive speakers]] and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in [[Gipuzkoa]] (49.1% speakers) and lowest in Álava (14.2%). These results represent an increase from previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16–24 age range (57.5%) vs. 25.0% in the 65+ age range. The percentage of fluent speakers is even higher if counting those under 16, given that the proportion of bilinguals is particularly high in this age group (76.7% of those aged between 10 and 14 and 72.4% of those aged 5–9): 37.5% of the population aged 6 and above in the whole Basque Autonomous Community, 25.0% in Álava, 31.3% in [[Biscay]] and 53.3% in Gipuzkoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-738/es/contenidos/informacion/argitalpenak/es_6092/adjuntos/MAPAcast.pdf|title=IV Mapa Sociolingüístico: 2006|publisher=Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco, Vitoria-Gasteiz|year=2008|format=PDF|isbn=978-84-457-2942-7|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In French Basque Country, 22.5% were fluent Basque speakers, 8.6% passive speakers, and 68.9% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in [[Labourd]] and [[Soule]] (55.5% speakers) and lowest in the [[Bayonne]]-[[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] conurbation (8.8%). These results represent another decrease from previous years (24.8% in 2001 and 26.4 in 1996). The highest percentage of speakers is in the 65+ age range (32.4%). The lowest percentage is found in the 25–34 age range (11.6%), but there is a slight increase in the 16–24 age range (16.1%)
* In [[Navarre]], 11.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 7.6% passive speakers, and 81.3% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in the Basque-speaking zone in the north (60.1% speakers) and lowest in the non-Basque-speaking zone in the south (1.9%). These results represent a slight increase from previous years (10.3% in 2001, 9.6% in 1996 and 9.5% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16–24 age range (19.1%) vs. 9.1% in the 65+ age range.

Taken together, in 2006, of a total population of 2,589,600 (1,850,500 in the Autonomous Community, 230,200 in the Northern Provinces and 508,900 in Navarre),  665,800 spoke Basque (aged 16 and above). This amounts to 25.7% Basque bilinguals overall, 15.4% passive speakers, and 58.9% non-speakers. Compared to the 1991 figures, this represents an overall increase of 137,000, from 528,500 (from a population of 2,371,100) 15 years previously.&lt;ref name=IVInkesta/&gt;

The 2011 figures show an increase of some 64,000 speakers compared to the 2006 figures to 714,136, with significant increases in the Autonomous Community, but a slight drop in the Northern Basque Country to 51,100, overall amounting to an increase to 27% of all inhabitants of Basque provinces (2,648,998 in total).&lt;ref name=VInkesta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-738/es/contenidos/noticia/inkesta_soziol_2012/es_berria/berria.html |title=V.

Basque is used as a language of commerce both in the Basque Country and in locations around the world where Basques immigrated throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Nina M|date=January 1, 2009|title=Basque Studies: Commerce, Heritage, And A Language Less Commonly Taught, But Whole-Heartedly Celebrated|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/85685222|journal=Scholarly Journals|volume=12|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
{{Main|Basque dialects}}
[[File:Euskalkiak koldo zuazo 2008.png|thumb|upright=1.09|The modern dialects of Basque according to 21st-century dialectology. {{legend|#849D4D|Western (Biscayan)}}{{legend|#CA5655|Central (Gipuzkoan)}}{{legend|#5287C8|Upper Navarrese}}{{legend|#D0AA5A|Lower Navarrese–Lapurdian}}{{legend|#C9CA52|Souletin (Zuberoan)}}{{legend|#9B9D9A|other Basque areas ''ca'' 1850 (Bonaparte)}}]]
The modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence, sometimes making cross-dialect communication difficult. This is especially true in the case of Biscayan and Souletin, which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.

Modern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:&lt;ref name=Zuazo2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biscayan dialect|Biscayan or "Western"]]
* [[Gipuzkoan dialect|Gipuzkoan or "Central"]]
* [[Upper Navarrese dialect|Upper Navarrese]]
* [[Navarro-Lapurdian dialect|Navarro-Lapurdian]]
* [[Souletin dialect|Souletin (Zuberoan)]]

These dialects are divided in 11 subdialects, and 24 minor varieties among them.
According to [[Koldo Zuazo]],&lt;ref name=Zuazo2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=Euskalkiak. Herriaren lekukoak|year=2003|publisher=Elkar|isbn=9788497830614}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Biscayan dialect or "Western" is the most widespread dialect, with around 300,000 speakers out of a total of around 660,000 speakers. This dialect is divided in two minor subdialects: the Western Biscayan and Eastern Biscayan, plus transitional dialects.

===Influence on other languages===
{{See also|List of Spanish words of Basque origin}}
Although the influence of the neighbouring [[Romance languages]] on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, it is usually assumed that there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well. In particular [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], and to a lesser degree [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are thought to have received this influence in the past. In the case of Aragonese and Gascon, this would have been through [[Substratum|substrate]] interference following [[language shift]] from [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or Basque to a Romance language, affecting all levels of the language, including place names around the Pyrenees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corominas|first=Joan|title=La toponymie hispanique prérromane et la survivance du basque jusqu'au bas moyen age|journal=IV Congrès International de Sciences Onomastiques|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corominas|first=Joan|title=Estudis de toponímia catalana, I|year=1965|publisher=Barcino|isbn=978-84-7226-080-1|pages=153–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corominas|first=Joan|title=De toponimia vasca y vasco-románica en los Bajos Pirineos|journal=Fontes linguae vasconum: Studia et documenta|year=1972|issue=12|pages=299–320|issn=0046-435X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohlfs, Gerhard (1980), Le Gascon: études de philologie pyrénéenne.

Although a number of words of alleged Basque origin in the Spanish language are circulated (e.g. ''anchoa'' 'anchovies', ''bizarro'' 'dashing, gallant, spirited', ''cachorro'' 'puppy', etc.), most of these have more easily explicable Romance etymologies or not particularly convincing derivations from Basque.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Ignoring cultural terms, there is one strong [[loanword]] candidate, ''ezker'', long considered the source of the Pyrennean and [[Iberian Romance]] words for "left (side)" (''{{wiktes|izquierdo}}'', ''{{wiktpor|esquerdo}}'', ''{{wiktcat|esquerre}}'').&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corominas"&gt;''izquierdo'' in the ''[[Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana]]'', volume II, [[Joan Corominas]], Francke Verlag - [[Bern]], 1954, Madrid, {{ISBN| 978-84-249-1361-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of initial {{IPA|/r/}} in Gascon could arguably be due to a Basque influence but this issue is under-researched.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

The other most commonly claimed substrate influences:
* the [[Old Spanish]] merger of {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/b/}}.
* the simple five vowel system.
* change of initial {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/h/}} (e.g. ''fablar'' → ''hablar'', with Old Basque lacking {{IPA|/f/}} but having {{IPA|/h/}}).
* [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]] {{IPAblink|s̺}}, a sound transitional between [[Laminal consonant|laminodental]] {{IPAblink|s}} and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPAblink|ʃ}}; this sound also influenced other [[Ibero-Romance languages]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

The first two features are common, widespread developments in many Romance (and non-Romance) languages.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;{{Specify|date=June 2016}}  The change of {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} occurred historically only in a limited area ([[Gascony]] and [[Old Castile]]) that corresponds almost exactly to areas where heavy Basque bilingualism is assumed, and as a result has been widely postulated (and equally strongly disputed). Substrate theories are often difficult to prove (especially in the case of phonetically plausible changes like {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}). As a result, although many arguments have been made on both sides, the debate largely comes down to the a priori tendency on the part of particular linguists to accept or reject substrate arguments.

Examples of arguments against the substrate theory,&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; and possible responses:
# Spanish did not fully shift {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}, instead, it has preserved {{IPA|/f/}} before consonants such as {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (cf ''fuerte'', ''frente''). (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|[f]}} in these words might be a secondary development from an earlier sound such as {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ɸ]}} and learned words (or words influenced by written Latin form). Gascon does have {{IPA|/h/}} in these words, which might reflect the original situation.)
# Evidence of Arabic loanwords in Castilian points to {{IPA|/f/}} continuing to exist long after a Basque substrate might have had any effect on Castilian. (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|/f/}} in these words might be a late development.  Many languages have come to accept new phonemes from other languages after a period of significant influence.  For example, French lost /h/ but later regained it as a result of Germanic influence, and has recently gained {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as a result of English influence.)
# Basque regularly developed Latin {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/b/}}.
# The same change also occurs in parts of Sardinia, Italy and the Romance languages of the Balkans where no Basque substrate can be reasonably argued for. (On the other hand, the fact that the same change might have occurred elsewhere independently does not disprove substrate influence. Furthermore, parts of [[Sardinia]] also have prothetic {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} before initial {{IPA|/r/}}, just as in Basque and Gascon, which may actually argue for some type of influence between both areas.)

Beyond these arguments, a number of [[nomadic]] groups of Castile are also said to use or have used Basque words in their jargon, such as the [[gacería]] in [[Segovia (province)|Segovia]], the [[mingaña]], the Galician [[fala dos arxinas]]&lt;ref&gt;Varela Pose, F.J.

====Basque pidgins====
A number of Basque-based or Basque-influenced [[pidgin]]s have existed. In the 16th century, Basque sailors used a [[Basque–Icelandic pidgin]] in their contacts with Iceland.&lt;ref name="Glossaria"&gt;Deen 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Algonquian–Basque pidgin]] arose from contact between Basque [[whaling|whalers]] and the [[Algonquian peoples]] in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and [[Strait of Belle Isle]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakker 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main|Basque grammar}}
Basque is an [[ergative–absolutive language]]. The subject of an [[intransitive verb]] is in the [[absolutive case]] (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the [[ergative case]] (shown by the suffix ''-k''). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.

The [[auxiliary verb]], which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this [[polypersonal agreement]] is found only in Basque, some [[languages of the Caucasus]], [[Mordvinic languages]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] (all non-Indo-European). The ergative–absolutive alignment is also rare among European languages—occurring only in some languages of the Caucasus—but not infrequent worldwide.

Consider the phrase:

:''{{Audio|martinek1.ogg|Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.}}''
:{{interlinear|lang=eu
|Martin-ek egunkari-ak erosten di-zki-t
|Martin-ERG newspaper-PL buy-GER AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO[(s)he/it_SBJ]
|"Martin buys the newspapers for me." }}

''Martin-ek'' is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending ''-k'' (with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-e-''). ''Egunkariak'' has an ''-ak'' ending, which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is ''erosten dizkit'', in which ''erosten'' is a kind of gerund ("buying") and the auxiliary ''dizkit'' means "he/she (does) them for me". This ''dizkit'' can be split like this:
* ''di-'' is used in the present tense when the verb has a subject (ergative), a direct object (absolutive), and an indirect object, and the object is him/her/it/them.
* ''-zki-'' means the absolutive (in this case the newspapers) is plural, if it were singular there would be no infix; and
* ''-t'' or '-da-' means "to me/for me" (indirect object).
* in this instance there is no suffix after ''-t''. A zero suffix in this position indicates that the ergative (the subject) is third person singular (he/she/it).

The phrase "you buy the newspapers for me" would translate as:

:''{{Audio|Zuekegunkariak.ogg|Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue}}''
:{{interlinear|lang=eu
|Zu-ek egunkari-ak erosten di-zki-da-zue
|you-ERG newspaper-PL buy-GER AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO-you(pl.).SBJ
|}}

The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'
* ''di-'' indicates that the main verb is transitive and in the present tense
* ''-zki-'' indicates that the direct object is plural
* ''-da-'' indicates that the indirect object is me (to me/for me; -t becomes -da- when not final)
* ''-zue'' indicates that the subject is you (plural)

The pronoun ''zuek'' 'you (plural)' has the same form both in the nominative or absolutive case (the subject of an intransitive sentence or direct object of a transitive sentence) and in the ergative case (the subject of a transitive sentence). In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant, e.g. ''dizkidazue'' in ''zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue'' 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped, e.g. ''zuek'' in ''egunkariak erosten dizkidazue'' 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: ''egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue'' 'it is you (pl.) who buys the newspapers for me', or ''egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue'' 'it is me for whom you buy the newspapers'.

Modern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a ''nor'' (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori'' (absolutive–dative) paradigm, as in the sentence ''Aititeri txapela erori zaio'' ("The hat fell from grandfather['s head]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut (Basque) INFLECTION §1.4.2.2. Potential paradigms: absolutive and dative.]&lt;/ref&gt; Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for antipassive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned (notice that Basque lacks a passive voice, and displays instead an [[antipassive voice]] paradigm), and also has a ''nor-nork'' (absolutive–ergative) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori-nork'' (absolutive–dative–ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the ''dizkidazue'' example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of ''nor-nori-nork'' in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. The most ubiquitous auxiliary, ''izan,'' can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.

There are more persons in the singular (5) than in the [[plural]] (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons—[[T–V distinction|informal]] masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun ''hi'' is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a ''-k'', the feminine uses an ''-n.'' This is a property rarely found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for "listener" (the [[allocutive]]) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation calls for the familiar masculine, the form is augmented and modified accordingly. Likewise for the familiar feminine.
(''Gizon bat etorri da'', "a man has come"; ''gizon bat etorri duk'', "a man has come [you are a male close friend]", ''gizon bat etorri dun'', "a man has come [you are a female close friend]", ''gizon bat etorri duzu'', "a man has come [I talk to you (Sir / Madam)]")&lt;ref name="hitano"&gt;[http://www.hiru.com/es/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aspecto, tiempo y modo] in Spanish, [http://www.hiru.com/eu/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aditzen aspektua, tempusa eta modua]{{dead link|date=March 2013}} in Basque.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong, since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it was originally the second person plural, later came to be used as a formal singular, and then later still the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.

All the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms in total, called [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: perfect (various suffixes), habitual&lt;ref name="ARKing"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Alan R. |year=1994 |title=The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction |page=393 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |isbn=0-87417-155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (suffix ''-t[z]en''), and future/potential (suffix. ''-ko/-go''). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix ''-tu'' in the perfect, adapted from the Latin perfect passive ''-tus'' suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.

Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic verb comes first, followed by the auxiliary.

A Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number (indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural: ''euskaldun'' [Basque speaker], ''euskalduna'' [the Basque speaker, a Basque speaker], ''euskaldunak'' [Basque speakers, the Basque speakers], and ''euskaldunok'' [we Basque speakers, those Basque speakers]). These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again.  It has been estimated that, with two levels of [[recursion]], a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.&lt;ref&gt;[Agirre et al., 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a noun phrase, modifying adjectives follow the noun.  As an example of a Basque noun phrase, ''etxe zaharrean'' "in the old house" is morphologically analysed as follows by Agirre et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=XUXEN: A Spelling Checker/Corrector for Basque Based on Two-Level Morphology|journal=S.e.p.l.n|volume= 8|pages=87–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic syntactic construction is [[subject–object–verb]] (unlike Spanish, French or English where a [[subject–verb–object]] construction is more common). The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic–focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] is stated first, then the [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, ''What is this?'' can be translated as ''Zer da hau?'' or ''Hau zer da?'', but in both cases the question tag ''zer'' immediately precedes the verb ''da''. This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word ''galdegai'' (focus) is used.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

In negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle ''ez'' must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: ''Aitak frantsesa irakasten du,'' "Father teaches French," in the negative becomes ''Aitak ez du frantsesa irakasten,'' in which ''irakasten'' ("teaching") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.

The Basque language features five vowels: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} (the same that are found in [[Spanish phonology#Vowels|Spanish]], [[Asturian language#Vowels|Asturian]] and [[Aragonese language#Vowels|Aragonese]]). In the [[Zuberoan]] dialect, extra phonemes are featured:
* the [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPAslink|y}}, graphically represented as {{angbr|ü}};
* a set of contrasting [[nasal vowels]], indicating a strong influence from [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

Basque has a distinction between [[laminal consonant|laminal]] and [[Apical consonant|apical]] articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. With the laminal alveolar fricative {{IPA-eu|s̻|}}, the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth.  This is the usual {{IPA|/s/}} in most European languages. It is written with an orthographic {{angbr|z}}. By contrast, the [[voiceless apicoalveolar fricative]] {{IPA-eu|s̺|}} is written {{angbr|s}}; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth and friction occurs at the tip (apex). For example, ''zu'' "you" (singular, respectful) is distinguished from ''su'' "fire". The affricate counterparts are written {{angbr|tz}} and {{angbr|ts}}. So, ''etzi'' "the day after tomorrow" is distinguished from ''etsi'' "to give up"; ''atzo'' "yesterday" is distinguished from ''atso'' "old woman".

In the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical {{angbr|s}} and the alveolar affricate {{angbr|tz}} are used.

Basque also features postalveolar sibilants ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}, written {{angbr|x}}, and {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, written {{angbr|tx}}), sounding like English ''sh'' and ''ch''.

There are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and [[motherese]] (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, ''tanta'' "drop" vs. ''ttantta'' {{IPA|/canca/}} "droplet". A few common words, such as ''txakur'' {{IPA|/tʃakur/}} "dog", use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: ''zakur''—"big dog". Many  Basque dialects exhibit a derived palatalisation effect, in which coronal onset consonants change into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the {{IPA|/n/}} in ''egin'' "to act" becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: {{IPA|/eɡina/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲa]}} "the action", {{IPA|/eɡines/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲes]}} "doing".

[[File:Diaphonej.svg|thumb|Regional realisations of {{Angbr|j}}]]
The letter {{angbr|j}} has a variety of realisations according to the regional dialect: {{IPA|[j, dʒ, x, ʃ, ɟ, ʝ]}}, as pronounced from west to east in south Bizkaia and coastal Lapurdi, central Bizkaia, east Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, south Navarre, inland Lapurdi and Low Navarre, and Zuberoa, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R. L. (1997). ''The History of Basque'', London and New York: Routledge, pp. 155–157, {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euskara - aspirazio.svg|thumb|left|The {{angbr|h}} is only pronounced in the north-east, as the isoglosses here show.]]
The letter {{angbr|h}} is silent in the Southern dialects, but pronounced (although vanishing) in the Northern ones. Unified Basque spells it except when it is predictable, in a position following a consonant.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Trask, ''The History of Basque'', pp. 157–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless they are recent loanwords (e.g. ''Ruanda'' (Rwanda), ''radar'' ... ), words may not have initial {{angbr|r}}. In older loans, initial ''r-'' took a [[Prothesis (linguistics)|prosthetic]] ''e-'', resulting in ''err-'' (''Erroma'' "Rome", ''Errusia'' "Russia"), more rarely ''irr-'' (for example ''irratia'' "radio", ''irrisa'' "rice").

===Stress and pitch===
{{main|Pitch-accent language#Basque}}
Basque features great dialectal variation in accentuation, from a weak [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] in the western dialects to a marked stress in central and eastern dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement.&lt;ref&gt;Hualde, J.I. (1986), [http://www.ehu.eus/ojs/index.php/ASJU/article/viewFile/7813/7007 "Tone and Stress in Basque: A Preliminary Survey"]. ''Anuario del Seminario Julio de Urquijo'' XX-3, 1986, pp. 867-896.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms), e.g. ''basóà'' ("the forest", absolutive case) vs. ''básoà'' ("the glass", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish ''vaso''); ''basóàk'' ("the forest", ergative case) vs. ''básoàk'' ("the glass", ergative case) vs. ''básoak'' ("the forests" or "the glasses", absolutive case).

Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard [[orthography]] and [[Euskaltzaindia]] (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a [[Syntagmatic structure|syntagma]], and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.

This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} that differentiates its sound from the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodical]] patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some ''Euskaldun berriak'' ("new Basque-speakers", i.e. second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, e.g. pronouncing ''nire ama'' ("my mum") as ''nire áma'' (– – ´ –), instead of as ''niré amà'' (– ´ – `).

===Morphophonology===
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
The combining forms of nominals in final {{IPA|/-u/}} vary across the regions of the Basque Country.  The {{IPA|/u/}} can stay unchanged, be lowered to an {{IPA|/a/}}, or it can be lost. Loss is most common in the east, while lowering is most common in the west. For instance, ''buru'', "head", has the combining forms ''buru-'' and ''bur-'', as in ''buruko'', "cap", and ''burko'', "pillow", whereas ''katu'', "cat", has the combining form ''kata-'', as in ''katakume'', "kitten". Michelena suggests that the lowering to {{IPA|/a/}} is generalised from cases of Romance borrowings in Basque that retained Romance stem alternations, such as ''kantu'', "song" with combining form ''kanta-'', borrowed from Romance ''canto'', ''canta-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basque Phonology|last=Hualde|first=Jose Ignacio|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1991|isbn=978-0-415-05655-7|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Through contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Gascon language|Gascon]], among other languages. There are a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: ''lore'' ("flower", from ''florem''), ''errota'' ("mill", from ''rotam'', "[mill] wheel"), ''gela'' ("room", from ''cellam''), ''gauza'' ("thing", from ''causa'').

==Writing system==
{{Main|Basque alphabet}}
[[File:Ascain Stèle discoïdale.jpg|thumb|An example of Basque lettering in a funerary stela.]]
Basque is written using the [[Latin script]] including ''[[ñ]]'' and sometimes ''[[ç]]'' and ''[[ü]]''. Basque does not use ''Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy '' for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by [[Euskaltzaindia]]) does include them for loanwords:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/arauak/dok/Araua_0017.pdf Basque alphabet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonetically meaningful [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''dd, ll, [[rr (digraph)|rr]], ts, tt, tx, tz'' are treated as pairs of letters.

All letters and digraphs represent unique [[phoneme]]s. The main exception is when ''l'' and ''n'' are preceded by ''i'', that in most dialects palatalises their sound into {{IPA|/[[ʎ]]/}} and {{IPA|/[[ɲ]]/}}, even if these are not written. Hence, ''[[Ikurriña]]'' can also be written ''Ikurrina'' without changing the sound, whereas the proper name ''Ainhoa'' requires the mute ''h'' to break the palatalisation of the ''n''.

''H'' is mute in most regions, but it is pronounced in many places in the northeast, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.
Its acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardisation process because the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.

[[File:Basquefontsample.png|thumb|left|The letters of the alphabet in a Basque style font.]]
In [[Sabino Arana]]'s (1865–1903) alphabet,&lt;ref name="Arana"&gt;''Lecciones de ortografía del euskera bizkaino'', Arana eta Goiri'tar Sabin, Bilbao, Bizkaya'ren Edestija ta Izkerea Pizkundia, 1896 (Sebastián de Amorrortu).&lt;/ref&gt; digraphs {{Angle bracket|ll}} and {{Angle bracket|rr}} were replaced with ''[[ĺ]]'' and ''[[ŕ]]'', respectively.

A typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.
It derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterised by thick [[serif]]s.

===Number system used by millers===
[[File:Errotarienzenbakiak.jpg|thumb|An example of the number system employed by millers.]]
Basque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin.&lt;ref&gt;Aguirre Sorondo ''Tratado de Molinología – Los Molinos de Guipúzcoa'' Eusko Ikaskuntza 1988 {{ISBN|84-86240-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the symbols are arranged either along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.

The system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, [[vigesimal]]. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Fractions are relatively common, especially {{1/2}}.

The exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a '''V''' shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines. This system is no longer in general use but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.

'''Burgenland Croats''' ({{Lang-hr|Gradišćanski Hrvati}}, {{Lang-de|Burgenlandkroaten}}, {{Lang-hu|Burgenlandi horvátok}}, {{Lang-sk| Gradiščanskí Chorváti}}) is the name for ethnic [[Croats]] in the [[Austrian state]] of [[Burgenland]], along with Croats in neighboring [[Hungary]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="enciklopedija.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=22976 |title=gradišćanski Hrvati &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 120,000 Croats that live in [[Austria]]. 27,000&lt;ref name="hrvatiizvanrh.hr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fer Projekt, Put Murvice 14, Zadar, Hrvatska, +385 98 212 96 00, www.fer-projekt.com |url=http://www.hrvatiizvanrh.hr/hr/hmiu/hrvatska-manjina-u-republici-austriji/3 |title=Hrvatska manjina u Republici Austriji |publisher=Hrvatiizvanrh.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 30,000&lt;ref name="enciklopedija.hr"/&gt; of them are Burgenland Croats. Another 56,785 have Croatian citizenship.&lt;ref name="hrvatiizvanrh.hr"/&gt;

Since 1993, Croatian organizations are appointing their representatives to the Council for National Minorities of the Austrian government.

==History==
Burgenland Croats began to emigrate from [[Lika]], [[Krbava]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Moslavina]], [[Bihać|Western Bosnia]] and [[Gorski Kotar]]. These areas were occupied by the Turks in the 16th century during the [[Turkish wars]] (1533-1584). The refugee Croats were given land and independent ecclesiastical rights by the Austrian King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], because many of their villages had been pillaged by the Turks. This gave the Croats a safe place to live while providing [[Austria]] with a [[buffer zone]] between [[Vienna]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the south and east.

[[File:Burgeland_origin_theory.png|thumb|250px|right|Theory of origin of Burgenland Croats.]]

The first wave of emigration came in the 1530s, after the Turks destroyed almost all the settlements between the river [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and the mountain [[Velebit]], along with the land between the river [[Kupa]] and the mountain range [[Velika Kapela|Kapela]]. In the second wave of emigration in the 1540s, many Croats left [[Slavonia]]. The third and last wave of emigration, came in the 1750s and 1760s.

Burgenland Croats emigrated not only because of the fear of Turkish attacks, but also because they were searching for jobs and better life opportunities.

The emigration went mainly to the north, but also across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Italy]], where [[Molise Croats]] can be found today.

The Burgenland Croats developed their own orthography during the [[counter-reformation]], however, assimilation soon followed with the language being banned from use in churches and schools.

After falling under [[Hungary|Hungarian]] rule in the [[Dual Monarchy]], liberal laws regarding ethnicity enabled them to rekindle their language and heritage. However, when a 1900 census revealed that only 18.8% of the population of Burgenland spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], severe policies of [[Magyarization]] were implemented, revoking many individual and community rights. The Burgenland Croats were also persecuted by Austro-German nationalists after [[World War I]], and by the Nazis during [[World War II]]. During this time, they tried to assimilate the Burgenland Croats.

The Croats gained minority status in the [[Austrian State Treaty|Austrian Treaty of Independence of 1955]]. Since then, they and their culture have undergone something of a renaissance, with the language being taught at schools and spoken in Church, wherever there is a large enough minority.

[[File:Hrvati gradišće.gif|thumb|200px|right|Dialects of Burgenland Croats by J. Lisac]]

Despite many languages that surround them Burgenland Croats, preserved their [[Croatian language]] and its dialects from all the Croatian regions that they originated from. The Burgenland Croatian language, as well as the general Croatian standard language, combines the [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]], [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]]m and [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] dialect. But unlike the Croatian standard language, which is mostly based on the most widespread [[Shtokavian dialect]], the Burgenland variant of the Croatian language is based on the [[Chakavian dialect]]. Burgenland Croatian includes phrases no longer used in standard Croatian, as well as certain phrases and words taken from [[German language|German]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Names are often written according to Hungarian orthography, due to the [[Magyarisation]] policies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Almost all Burgenland Croats are fluent in German.

After the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] in 1918, the area in which the Burgenland Croats lived was divided between [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. After 1921, most of these areas became part of Austria, which established a new province of [[Burgenland]], which later gave the Burgenland identifier to these Croats. In 1922, Austria founded the ''Apostolic administration of Burgenland,'' and began to abolish bilingual schools, by introducing the German language to all primary schools. This process was temporarily stopped after ''The National Education Act'', that allowed the work of the Croatian elementary schools, was adopted. After [[Hitler]] [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], this law was abolished. In 1955, the ''[[Austrian State Treaty]]'' was signed. It gave permission to the Burgenland Croats to use the Croatian language in education, judiciary, and public administration. With the adoption of the ''Law on National Minorities'' in 1976, use of the Croatian language in public life become limited. After a constitutional complaint was heeded in 1987, parts of the law were changed and the Croatian language was introduced as an official in 6 out of 7 districts of Burgenland.&lt;ref name="enciklopedija.hr"/&gt;

[[File:Hrvatske Novine.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Weekly newspapers ''Hrvatske novine'' published in [[Burgenland]]]]

By the mid-19th century, Burgenland Croatian literature had a predominantly religious character and was intended mostly for [[peasants]]. The main writers were priests and nuns. In the second half of the 19th century, teachers begin to write, thanks to that many school textbooks and calendars were written.

A '''button pusher''' ({{lang-uk|кнопкодав}}, ''Knopkodav'') is a term in Ukrainian politics and society related to a member of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of [[Ukraine]] who votes on a motion by using own [[identity card]] as well as ones belonging to other deputies. This voting is done either with or without the consent of the absent deputies.

Other names for this phenomenon are "vote in the dark", "[[truancy|truant]] voting", "multiple voting", "vote for himself and for the other guy", "piano voting",&lt;ref&gt;[http://glavcom.ua/articles/2858.html/ The Regionals are preparing new changes to the Constitution. "Glavcom". 07, Feb 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/podrobici/politinformaciya-5/ The Political Information. «Day». 08, Feb 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; "pianism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidanua.org/2011/07/spyhotehnyka-shema-pravovoho-kolapsu-ukrajiny// Spyhotehnyka.

"Maidan" July 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/24318787.html/ The new session of Parliament: how will be work majority and opposition? "Radio Liberty". September 5, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants of "button pushing" are [[Member of Parliament|МРs]] - "button pushers" who vote alien card, as well as those that provide for voting card or duplicate card to "button pusher".

The "button pushing" is one of the manifestations of [[political corruption]] and the crisis of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] in [[Ukraine]].

== Etymology ==
The term "button pusher" emerged in the early 2000s in a journalistic environment for designation MPs who vote for their colleagues.

== Description ==
If unable to attend the legislature personally, a deputy might give his or her personal voting card to a fellow deputy. Alternately, duplicate cards might be issued without the knowledge of their supposed "owner".

If voting for a neighbor, the "button pusher" inserts the card for the e-voting system "Rada" received from the missing deputy of the card, preferably not getting up, openly or secretly (hand covering newspapers, magazines, or other method) pushes the button to vote for or against the measure.

If voting for several deputies, the pusher moves from one seat to the next with multiple voting cards and pushes the buttons the same way. One such button pusher was found to have voted on average for 9.8 missing persons. Often when the [[absolute majority]] of 226 deputies was required, the button pushers were responsible for 35-40 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/columns/2012/04/17/6962826/ The button pushers will continue to force Constitution? Basil Belous. UP, April 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

With the "button pushing" voting the Verkhovna Rada adopted:
* the changes to the Constitution of Ukraine, which established the date of presidential elections in Ukraine,
* the Law of Ukraine "On measures to ensure the legislative reform of the pension system",
* the bill "On the Principles of State Language Policy" (Actually voted 172 deputies, not 234, as officially announced).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/andrushko/4fcf5283e29da/ BILL for language VOTING  - not legally?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the new Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine (It was adopted by 50 MPs instead 226),&lt;ref&gt;[http://vidia.org/2012/3212/  MPs' -button pushers approved a new Code of Criminal Procedure by night]&lt;/ref&gt;
* was appointed the new head of the National Bank of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/01/14/6981418/ Tomenko showed 22 knopkodaviv who appointed Sorkin. List. "Ukrainian Truth". January 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal analysis of violations of the law ==

On the criminal nature of voting for another in the Ukrainian parliament by the analysis of provisions which regulated the legislative procedure.
Personal vote required by the Constitution of Ukraine, Article 84: "Voting at meetings of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine made deputy of Ukraine in person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80/ The Constitution of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence and direct participation in meetings of the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine is not a matter of free decision MPs, and under paragraph 3 first part of the 24th article of the law ""About the Status of the People's Deputy of Ukraine" - is his duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2790-12/ Law of Ukraine "About the Status of the People's Deputy of Ukraine"]&lt;/ref&gt;

December 6, 2012 the Parliament of Ukraine amended the Regulation (Article 37), which require MPs to register in person to attend meetings of Parliament, to vote and to do it in person. According to the law, before the opening of each session of Parliament shall be registered MPs personally based identification MP and handwritten signatures. In the boardroom deputy recorded through the e-voting system "Rada", so that rules out the registration deputy in his stead another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1861-17/ Law of Ukraine "About the Reglament of Parliament of Ukraine"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the European Court of Human Rights in January 2013 decision in the case "Alexander Volkov v. Ukraine," in which the judge found that the vote in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in violation of the established procedure against European standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbnews.com.ua/news/73291/ ECHR declared illegal "button pushering" in Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, today the legislation also provides liability for card use another MP (including duplicate) for registration and voting by electronic system (voting for someone else's card), as well as unauthorized intervention in the electronic voting system of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and issuance of duplicate voting cards without the consent of the MP.

== "Button pushing" organizers and advocates ==
The peak of "button pushing" was reached in the sixth convocation at the initiative and organizational support leadership factions ruling majority - [[Party of Regions]] and [[Communist Party of Ukraine]]. Tactics were quick voting when the current favorable government decisions taken quickly, without discussion or almost without discussion, often in the evening or at night by pressing of the team of "button pushers" in 35-40 MPs. [[Party of Regions]] faction leadership commits MPs to vote for other members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsn.ua/politika/regionaliv-zobov-yazali-propianiniti-za-vidsutnih-odnopartiyciv.html/ The Regionals were ordered "propianinyty" for missing party members.

== Enforcement of opposition ==
From the earliest days of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine at the 7th convocation opposition faction in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine  - "[[Batkivshchyna]]", the [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform]], [[All-Ukrainian Union "Svoboda"|VO "Svoboda"]], made a series of coordinated measures to cease "button pushing" by the faction of the [[Party of Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fakty.ictv.ua/ua/index/read-news/id/1465045/ The opposition block Rada until button pushers vote.

A representative of the [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform|"UDAR"]] came to the session in the red sweater with the words "Vote personally".&lt;ref name="unn"&gt;[http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1185586-udar-vimagatime-abi-deputati-usikh-rivniv-golosuvali-personalno/ "UDAR" would "strike" to require MPs to vote personally at all levels]&lt;/ref&gt;

Faction [[All-Ukrainian Union "Svoboda"|VO "Svoboda"]] filed a bill on criminalizing voting for others in the legislature. This document provides penalties deputies who vote this way of imprisonment from 5 to 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1184083-natsionalisti-zaproponuyut-parye-vvesti-kriminalnu-vidpovidalnist-za-knopkodavstvo/ Nationalists offer PACE introduce criminal liability for "button pushing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

MP, member of the "[[Batkivshchyna]]" Yuri Odarchenko sued suit against Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine with the requirement to enter personal vote and cancel resolutions passed in violation of the regulations. MP calls implement electronic voting, which makes it impossible to register and vote one deputy instead of another, and to recognize the illegal and cancel the acts of the Verkhovna Rada, which were adopted in the period from December 13, 2012 to January 11, 2013 Lawsuit filed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine, February 5, 2013.&lt;ref name="unn" /&gt;

==In other counties==
===In Armenia===
There have been many votings, during which mostly MPs of [[Republican Party of Armenia|RPA]] voted instead of other MPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galatv.am/hy/news/489793/ Ուրիշի փոխարեն քվեարկություն եւ թեժ բանավեճ ԱԺ-ում]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/media/video/24478668.html Ուրիշի փոխարեն քվեարկության բազմաթիվ փաստեր ԱԺ-ում]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenpress.am/arm/news/680866/ ԱԺ-ում քննարկվել է ուրիշի փոխարեն քվեարկած պատգամավորների հարցը]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7109">'''Crime''' is present in various forms in [[Indonesia]].

==Crimes against foreigners in Indonesia==
Petty crime, which includes [[snatch theft]] and pick-pocketing, is present in Indonesia, usually taking place in locations with many people. [[Taxi]] scams are common in Indonesia, in which fake taxis are passed off as real ones. Foreign travellers often get fooled by this trickery, and end up getting robbed by the con-man operating the fake taxi. [[Violent crime]] is another growing issue in the country. [[Pirated]] and [[counterfeit]] merchandise can be easily found in most parts of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_2052.html |publisher=travel.state.gov |title=Indonesia |accessdate=June 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes against women in Indonesia==
===Prostitution===
{{main|Prostitution in Indonesia}}
[[File:Prostitution in Indonesia.png|thumb|Number of registered prostitutes in Indonesia, from 1984 to 1995]]
[[Prostitution]], interpreted as a "crime against decency/morality", is illegal in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov 1"/&gt; Nevertheless, the practice still is widespread, tolerated and regulated. Prostitution is most visibly manifested in Indonesia’s [[brothel]] complexes, or ''lokalisasi'', which are found throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue10/surtees.html |title=Intersections: Traditional and Emergent Sex Work in Urban Indonesia|publisher=Intersections.anu.edu.au |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These brothels are managed under local government regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catw-ap.org/programs/research-documentation-publications/facts-and-statistics/ |title=Facts and Statistics » Coalition Against Trafficking In Women – Asia Pacific |publisher=Catw-Ap |date=22 November 2010|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During or after raids by the police, the prostitutes are able to bribe the law enforcers and be released from custody; this has led to police raids being called "nothing more than an income source for public order officers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/26/raids-prostitution-merely-039income-source-officials039.html |title=Raids on prostitution merely 'income source for officials' |last1=Winarti |first1=Agnes |date=26 December 2008 |work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] estimates that 30 percent of the female prostitutes in Indonesia are below 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/indonesia/protection.html|title=Overview - Child Protection  |publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Labour Organization (ILO) puts the total number of child prostitutes in [[Jakarta]] at 5,000; according to the Jakarta city government, this is concentrated in Prumpung ([[North Jakarta]]), Grogol ([[West Jakarta]]) Tanah Abang ([[Central Jakarta]]), Block M ([[South Jakarta]]), as well as Jatinegara and Ciracas (both [[East Jakarta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/07/25/child-prostitutes-big-problem-jakarta.html |title=Child prostitutes big problem in Jakarta |date=25 July 2005 |work=[[The Jakarta Post]] |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Child sex tourism]] is a problem, especially on the resort islands of [[Bali]] and [[Batam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesiamatters.com/1464/bali-sex-tourism/ |title=Bali Sex Tourism|publisher=Indonesiamatters.com|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crin.org/violence/search/closeup.asp?infoID=19897|title=Violence Study - INDONESIA: Child sex tourism 'rampant' in S.E Asia|publisher=CRIN|accessdate= 30 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption and police misconduct==
{{main|Corruption in Indonesia}}
[[Corruption]] is a known and increasing issue [[Corruption in Indonesia|in Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/world/asia/31iht-indonesia31.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Plague of Corruption Rises Anew in Indonesia |date=May 30, 2013 |last=Cochrane |first=Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two key areas in the public sector in which [[political corruption|corruption]] in [[Indonesia]] can be found. These are the justice and civil service sectors. While hard data on corruption is difficult to collect, corruption in Indonesia is clearly seen through [[public opinion]], collated through surveys as well as observation of how each system runs.&lt;ref name="Lateef, S. (2003)"&gt;Lateef, S. ''et al''; ''Combating Corruption in Indonesia'', World Bank East Asia Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit 2003 [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is regarded as a huge expense to the Indonesian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/corruption-costs-indonesia-238m-in-2011/494558   | title=Corruption Costs Indonesia $238m in 2011| author=Ezra Sihite| publisher=[[Jakarta Globe]]| date=January 39, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian police force is known to go overboard and there have been reports of assaults against demonstrators in the country. The misuse of ferocity has been panned by the London-based [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120426-342144.html |title=Amnesty condemns police brutality in Indonesia |date=April 26, 2012 |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes==
Indonesia has put to death a handful of individuals convicted of the crime of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/indonesia-executes-three-men-premeditated-murder-20130517 |date=May 17, 2013 |title=Indonesia executes three men for premeditated murder }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching [[porn]] is against the law, with effect of March 2008.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov 1"/&gt;

==Punishment==
Crime is segmented into two broad classifications: "Crimes" and "Offenses".&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Graeme R.|title=Crime and Punishment around the World: [Four Volumes]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uK6bR9byVIC|date=30 October 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35134-1|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few methods to punish one for crime; this includes imprisonment and fine.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov 1"/&gt; The [[death penalty]] executed by a firing squad is available and very frequently used, as a deterrent against crime. They say that this gives the firing squad some practice. This has raised concerns from bodies like [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/world/asia/11iht-indo.1.14421132.html?_r=0 |title=Indonesia widens use of death penalty |last=Gelling |first=Peter |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mualang''' (also '''Moealang''' or '''Dayak Mualang''') are an indigenous people of [[West Kalimantan]] from the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] group and a sub-ethnic of the [[Iban people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Suryadinata, Evi Nurvidya Arifin &amp; Aris Ananta|title=Indonesia's Population: Ethnicity and Religion in a Changing Political Landscape|year=2003|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=981-230-212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Mualang language]] and they are mostly concentrated in areas in the [[Sekadau Regency]] and [[Sintang Regency]] of [[West Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. The specific districts where the Mualang people live include:
# Belitang Hilir district, Sekadau
# Belitang district, Sekadau
# Belitang Hulu district, Sekadau
# Sepauk, Sintang and its surrounding region

==Language==
The language spoken by the Mualang people belongs to the [[Ibanic languages]] branch along with other Ibanic dialects such as Kantuk, Bugao, Desa, Seberuang, Ketungau and Sebaruk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnny Tjia|title=A Grammar of Mualang: An Ibanic Language of Western Kalimantan, Indonesia|year=2007|publisher=LOT Publications|isbn=978-90-78328-24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dialects mainly differ from one another in their pronunciations of specific phonemes. For example, words that end with "i" can be pronounced as "e" or "y" where "''kediri''" becomes "''kedire''", "''rari''" becomes "''rare''", "''[[henna|inai]]''" becomes "''inay''", and "''pulai''" becomes "''pulay''". These words still carry the same meaning eventhough they are pronounced differently. These dialects also have some lexical variation between them.

The '''demography of Germany''' is monitored by the ''Statistisches Bundesamt'' ([[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]]). According to the first census since [[German reunification|reunification]], [[Germany]]'s population was 82,790,700 (31 September 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressekonferenzen/2013/Zensus2011/bevoelkerung_zensus2011.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|format=PDF|title=Zensus 2011|website=Destatis.de|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the sixteenth-most populous country in the world and the most populous in the European Union. The [[total fertility rate]] was rated at 1.59 in 2016&lt;ref name="destatis.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/Geburten/Tabellen/GeburtenZiffer.html|title=Zusammengefasste Geburtenziffer nach Kalenderjahren|website=Destatis.de|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the highest value since 1972&lt;ref name="destatis.de" /&gt;) and in 2011, was even estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpg.de/4411213/1_6_Children_per_Woman?filter_order=LT&amp;research_topic=KG-SW |title=1.6 children per woman - Joshua Goldstein and Michaela Kreyenfeld, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, fertility was related to educational achievement (women with lower levels of education were having more children than women who had completed higher education).&lt;ref name="Statistisches Bundesamt 2008"&gt;Statistisches Bundesamt.

According to the 2008-2010 German Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, 51.5% of males and 47.7% of females over the age of 15 were married. The separation rate was 6 per 10 marriages.

The [[United Nations Population Fund]] lists Germany as host to the [[List of countries by immigrant population|second-highest number of international migrants worldwide]], behind the United States.&lt;ref name="International Migration Report 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2015_Highlights.pdf|title=International Migration Report 2015 - Highlights |publisher =UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 16,000,000 people are descended from immigrants (first and second generation, including mixed heritage and ethnic German repatriates and their descendants). 96.1% of those reside in western Germany and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: "Die soziale Situation in Deutschland: Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000,000 of them are foreign residents, which is defined as those not having German citizenship. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the [[Turkish people|Turkish]]. Since the 1960s, [[West Germany|West]] and later [[Reunification of Germany|reunified]] Germany has been attracting immigrants primarily from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as well as [[Turkey]], many of whom (or their children) acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as [[Gastarbeiter|guest workers]], Germany has also been a prime destination for refugees who have applied for [[asylum in Germany]], in part because the German constitution long had a clause guaranteeing [[refugee|political asylum]] as a human right, but restrictions over the years have since limited the scope.

Germany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of [[World War II]], the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] income of about $41,370 in 2012,&lt;ref name="Länderdatenbank Deutschland"&gt;[http://www.weltbevoelkerung.de/oberes-menue/publikationen-downloads/zu-unseren-themen/laenderdatenbank/info-laender.html Länderdatenbank Deutschland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045329/http://www.weltbevoelkerung.de/oberes-menue/publikationen-downloads/zu-unseren-themen/laenderdatenbank/info-laender.html |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in [[poverty in Germany|poverty]]. Whereas in 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls. By 2007, one child in 6 was on the welfare rolls, although these children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.&lt;ref&gt;"Sozialhilfe: Kinderarmut nimmt zu". Focus. 15.11.2007&lt;/ref&gt; Germans are typically very well-travelled people, with millions travelling overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for [[universal health care]], [[unemployment compensation]], [[child benefits]] and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s. This led the government to adopt a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, [[Agenda 2010]], including the labour market reforms known as [[Hartz concept|Hartz I - IV]].

==History==
{{Main article|Census in Germany}}
The contemporary demographics of Germany are also measured by a series of full [[Census in Germany|censuses]], with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a ''micro census''.

===[[Total Fertility Rate]] from 1800 to 1899===
The [[Total fertility rate|total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

After the [[World War II]] [[Territorial changes of Germany|border shifts]] and [[Expulsions of Germans after World War II|expulsions]], the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|Germans from Central and Eastern Europe]] and the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] moved westward to [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]]. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from [[East Germany]] fled to [[West Germany]] for political and also economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern ''[[New states of Germany|New Länder]]'' to the western ''Old Länder'' for economic reasons.

The federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic&lt;ref&gt;Holger Wunderlich. Springer VS. Familienpolitik vor Ort - Strukturen, Akteure und Interaktionen auf kommunaler Ebene. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.
Fertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer "biographic options", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.&lt;ref name="berlin-institut.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/online-handbuchdemografie/bevoelkerungsdynamik/regionale-dynamik/ostdeutschland.html|title=Berlin-Institut für Bevölkerung und Entwicklung: Ostdeutschland|website=Berlin-institut.org|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–today===
{{Main article|New states of Germany}}
About 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population,&lt;ref name="nyt0609"/&gt; a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.&lt;ref name="sp07"&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Lack of Women in Eastern Germany Feeds Neo-Nazis |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,485942,00.html |publisher=Spiegel International |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2009-10-11|newspaper=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to the fact that there was a "demographic shock" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.&lt;ref name="berlin-institut.org"/&gt;

In the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990&lt;ref name="destatis.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/projects_publications/publications_1904/mpidr_working_papers/east_germany_overtakes_west_germany_recent_trends_in_order_specific_fertility_dynamics__4016.htm|title=East Germany overtakes West Germany: recent trends in order-specific fertility dynamics|website=Demogr.mpg.de|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213632/http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/projects_publications/publications_1904/mpidr_working_papers/east_germany_overtakes_west_germany_recent_trends_in_order_specific_fertility_dynamics__4016.htm|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR of East Germany was 1.64, while TFR in the West – 1.60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/EN/FactsFigures/SocietyState/Population/Births/Tables/BirthRate.html|title=State &amp; society - Births - Average number of children per woman - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|website=Destatis.de|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because of a scarcity of children.&lt;ref name="nyt0609"&gt;{{cite news |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |title=In East Germany, a Decline as Stark as a Wall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/europe/19germany.html |work= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= 2009-06-19|accessdate=11 October 2009 | first=Nicholas | last=Kulish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="nyt0609"/&gt; In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).

Until 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the ''Erziehungsgeld'') than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called "Elterngeld" was introduced. According to [[Christoph Butterwegge]] the Elterngeld was meant to "motivate highly educated women to have more children", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Butterwegge, Michael Klundt, Matthias Zeng: Kinderarmut in Ost- und Westdeutschland. 2., erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-531-15915-7}}, p. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.&lt;ref&gt;§ 10 Abs. 5 BEEG, BGBl. I, S. 1885, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:&lt;ref&gt;Bujard, Martin (Hrsg.) (2013): Elterngeld und Elternzeit in Deutschland: Ziele, Diskurse und Wirkungen. Schwerpunktheft der Zeitschrift für Familienforschung, 25. Jg., Band 2,  Leverkusen: Verlag Barbara Budrich&lt;/ref&gt;

* The income of families having young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit
* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off their jobs (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.
* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to.
* The birth rate of college educated women has risen.

In the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesintitut für Bevölkerungsforschung 2012.

While most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage, a growing number of children are born out-of-wedlock. In 2010 the out-of-wedlock-rate was 33%, more than twice of what it was in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[[Handelsblatt]] (12 August 2011): "Familienplanung: Uneheliche Babys im Vormarsch" [https://www.handelsblatt.com/lifestyle/gesellschaft/uneheliche-babys-im-vormarsch/4493378.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.&lt;ref name="Statistisches Bundesamt 2008"/&gt;
In Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.
In Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.

The reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an "educated mother scheme" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should "present at least one child to socialism" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,{{When|date=March 2015}} 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.

The more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.

A study done in 2005 in the western German state of [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]] by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Auferkorte-Michaelis, Sigrid Metz-Göckel, Jutta Wergen, Annette Klein. 2005: "Junge Elternschaft und Wissenschaftskarriere - Wie kinderfreundlich sind Deutschlands Universitäten".

==Ethnic minorities and migrant background (''Migrationshintergrund'')==
The [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany|Federal Statistical Office]] defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.

In 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005&amp;nbsp;– the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background&amp;nbsp;– the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/EN/Publications/STATmagazin/Population/2012_03/2012_03MigrantBackground.html|title=Publikation - STATmagazin - Population - Families with a migrant background: traditional values count - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|date=27 August 2012|work=destatis.de|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2016/09/PD16_327_122.html Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund auf Rekordniveau]&lt;/ref&gt;(number includes ethnic German repatriates)

Most of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Families with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the [[Soviet Union]] (including a large number of [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Russian-speaking ethnic Germans]]), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of [[Yugoslavia]] including 200.000 Albanians and 1.5 million had Polish roots.&lt;ref&gt;Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: "Die soziale Situation in Deutschland&amp;nbsp;— Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad. Median age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 33.8 years, while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 44.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland: "Leichter Anstieg der Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund".

Four other sizable groups of people are referred to as "national minorities" (''nationale Minderheiten'') because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: [[Danes]], [[Frisians]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]], and [[Sorbs]]. There is a [[Denmark|Danish]] minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Eastern and Northern [[Frisians]] live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of [[Lower Saxony]]. They are part of a wider community ([[Frisia]]) stretching from Germany to the northern [[Netherlands]]. The [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic people]] with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the [[Lusatia]] region of [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg]]. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.

Until [[World War II]] the [[Poles]] were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the [[Union of Poles in Germany]] had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization [[Association of National Minorities in Germany]]. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now [[Poland]]) to join the newly established Polish nation after [[World War I]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann Göring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.

After the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles.  The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|subsequently fled or were expelled by force]].  With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival.  In contrast, [[Germans in Poland|Germans living in Poland]] are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries.  Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.

[[Romani people|Roma people]] have been in Germany since the [[Middle Ages]]. They were persecuted by the [[Nazis]], and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as "persons without migrant background" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from [[Kosovo]]. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as [[immigrants]] or [[refugee]]s.

After World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]] from the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories of Germany]] and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these ''[[Heimatvertriebene]]'' in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.

Since the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and [[Soviet Union]] (especially from [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]), have come to Germany. During the time of [[Perestroika]], and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321130252/http://www.iza.org/iza/en/papers/transatlantic/1_locher.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa3.org/journal/pohl.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Deportation and Destruction of the German Minority in the USSR|author=J. Otto Pohl|website=Odessa3.org|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany now has Europe's third-largest [[Jews|Jewish]] population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics settled in Germany as in [[Israel]], bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html|title=Jewish Population of the World - Jewish Virtual Library|work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews have a voice in German public life through the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]] (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage.

[[File:Turkisch-day-in-Berlin.jpg|thumb|Turkish parade in [[Berlin]]]]

In 2000 there were also around 300,000–500,000 [[Afro-Germans]] (those who have German citizenship)&lt;ref&gt;Nina Zimnik: Nicht jeder Deutsche ist automatisch weiß Hamburger Abendblatt" vom 15. August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000+ African nationals. Most of them live in [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]]. Numerous persons from [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves "Afro-Germans," nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.

Germany's biggest East Asian minority are the [[Vietnamese people in Germany]]. About 40,000 Vietnamese live in Berlin and surroundings. Also there are about 20,000 to 25,000 [[Japanese people]] residing in Germany. Some [[South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n immigration has taken place. Nearly 50,000 [[Indians in Germany|Indians live in Germany]].

Numerous descendants of the so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' live in Germany. The ''Gastarbeiter'' mostly came from [[Chile]], [[Greece]], [[southern Italy]], Morocco, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], Tunisia, [[Turkey]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].
Also included were [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], [[North Korea]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cuba]] when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?id=235|title=Germany: Immigration in Transition|work=migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=23 October 2015|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Lanz: "Berlin aufgemischt&amp;nbsp;— abendländisch&amp;nbsp;— multikulturell&amp;nbsp;— kosmopolitisch?

==Geography==
With an estimated more than 81.8&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants in late 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/EN/FactsFigures/SocietyState/Population/CurrentPopulation/CurrentPopulation.html|title=State &amp; society - Current population - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|work=destatis.de|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the [[List of countries by population|16th largest country]] in the world in terms of population.

===States===
Germany comprises [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] that are collectively referred to as ''Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;The individual denomination is either ''Land'' [state], ''Freistaat'' [free state] or ''Freie (und) Hansestadt'' [free (and) Hanseatic city].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/laender-en-node.html?__nnn=true|title= The Federal States|publisher=[[Bundesrat of Germany]]|website=Bundesrat.de|accessdate=17 July 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/Terminologie/Bundeslaender/Uebersicht_node.html|title = Amtliche Bezeichnung der Bundesländer|website=Auswaertiges-amt.de|publisher = [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]]|language = German|trans-title=Official denomination of federated states|format = PDF|accessdate = 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to differences in size and population the [[States of Germany#Further subdivisions|subdivision of these states]] varies, especially between [[city-state]]s (''Stadtstaaten'') and states with larger territories (''Flächenländer'').

||The metropolitan area is part of the pan-European [[Blue Banana]] mega region and is a significant industrial and commercial hub, home to many of Germany's biggest corporations and contributing as much as 15% to the German GDP. Included in the rather polycentric conurbation are the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Bonn]], [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]] served by two of the countries largest airports [[Düsseldorf Airport]] and the [[Cologne Bonn Airport]]. Particularly among young Germans, Cologne and Düsseldorf are known for their nightlife and open-minded atmosphere.

||Berlin is the capital and largest city. It lies in the eastern part of the country, completely surrounded by the rather sparsely populated state of [[Brandenburg]]. Berlin is regarded as one of Europe's most open, vibrant and ever changing capitals. The city is arguably the most diverse city in Germany regarding culture and ethnicity. Regarded as an economically weak region of Germany for a long time, it is now transforming itself into the entrepreneurial center of Europe. Dubbed the "Silicon Allee" by insiders of the tech industry, Berlin is home to countless [[startup companies]] and one of Germany's densest knowledge hubs with 4 public universities and countless research centers.

Almost all of Germany's big banks and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] have their HQ located inside the city of Frankfurt. Despite not having a population of over a million, it is Germany's only city with a large, visible cluster of [[skyscraper]]s. The city is one of Europe's biggest transit hubs with Europe's 4th busiest airport ([[Frankfurt airport]]), Germany's second busiest [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|railway stations]] and one of the [[EU]]'s most heavily used [[Frankfurter Kreuz|interchanges]].

Over ten million people living in Germany today were born outside of Germany; equivalent to 12% of the German population. Most immigrants come from other European countries, particularly from [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]] and [[Italy]]. Germany is the second-most popular destination for immigrants in the world after the United States.&lt;ref name=WPR2018/&gt; The German Government has been keen to encourage immigration over the past fifty years.&lt;ref name=WPR2018/&gt;

Germany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of [[Turkey]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.

As of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Greece]]; notably, in the case of [[Turkey]], German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Migrationsberichte/migrationsbericht-2012.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|title=See page 21 of this report|website=Bamf.de|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were 476,649 asylum applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2016/01/asylantraege-dezember-2015.html|title=2015: Mehr Asylanträge in Deutschland als jemals zuvor|website=Bundesministerium des Innern|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main article|Education in Germany}}
[[File:MSM-sporthalle.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule Mürwik.]]

Responsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual [[States of Germany|federated states]]. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' ("dual education") allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.&lt;ref name="ED"/&gt;

Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.&lt;ref name="ED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Germany.pdf |title=Country profile: Germany |publisher=Library of Congress |date=April 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the ''[[Realschule]]'' for intermediate students lasts six years; the ''[[Hauptschule]]'' prepares pupils for vocational education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.cuesta.edu/intlang/german/education.html |title=The Educational System in Germany |publisher=Cuesta College |date=31 August 2002 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513042500/http://academic.cuesta.edu/intlang/german/education.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition [[Germany]] has a comprehensive school known as the ''[[Gesamtschule]]''. While some German schools such as the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Realschule]] have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the [[Hauptschulabschluss]], the [[Realschulabschluss]] or the [[Abitur]] depending on how well they did in school.
The percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by [[States of Germany|Bundesland]]. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Dr. Valentin Merkelbach|title=Gesamtschulen und Grundschulen sind das Beste in unserem Schulsystem|url=http://bildungsklick.de/a/55873/gesamtschulen-und-grundschulen-sind-das-beste-in-unserem-schulsystem/|website=Bildungsklick.de|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.

The general entrance requirement for university is [[Abitur]], a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 World Universities |publisher=[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] |url=http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822124509/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A%28EN%29.htm |archivedate=22 August 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of €500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.

===Literacy===
Over 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the [[University of Bremen]] in coorporation with the "Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.&lt;ref&gt;Teachers News: "Funktionaler Analphabetismus"&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Germany}}

The national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of [[faith]] and [[religion]]; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be [[discrimination|discriminated]] against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see [[Freedom of religion in Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Basic Law Art. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German language|German]] is the only official and most widely spoken language. [[Standard German]] is understood throughout the country.

===Minority languages===
[[File:Rosenthal Straßenschilder.JPG|thumb|Bilingual German-Sorbian city limit signs]]
[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Low German]], [[Low Rhenish]], the [[Sorbian languages]] ([[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] and [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]), and the two [[Frisian languages]], [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterfrisian]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in their respective regions. With speakers of [[Romani language|Romany]] living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only [[Hesse]] has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.

Implementation of the Charter is poor. The monitoring reports on charter implementation in Germany show many provisions unfulfilled. {{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===High German dialects===
[[File:Ortsschild Emlichheim - Emmelkamp.jpg|thumb|right|City limits sign; this city is called ''Emlichheim'' in [[High German]] and ''Emmelkamp'' in [[Low German]]]]

[[German dialects]] &amp;ndash; some quite distinct from the standard language &amp;ndash; are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the [[Upper German]] varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.

The social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.

===Low Saxon dialects===

[[Low German|Low Saxon]] is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a "model project" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example [[Ohnsorg-Theater]]).

Use of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.

The Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.

===Foreign languages===
English is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, [[Italian language|Italian]], Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is taught in states bordering the [[Netherlands]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in the eastern states bordering [[Poland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] are part of the [[Classics|classical education]] syllabus offered in many secondary schools.

According to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="984">'''Economic activism''' involves using economic power for change. Both conservative and liberal groups use economic activism to [[boycott]] or "greedily" [[Auction|outbid]] companies and organizations that do not agree with their particular political, religious, or social values. Conversely, it also means purchasing from those companies and organizations that do. The idea behind the concept is two-fold. First, you will reinforce "good" behavior and allow those companies that think like you to succeed. Second, you will punish "bad" behavior and hope that those companies that do not think like you do will fail or will adopt your "correct" way of thinking.

In Estonia, religion has never played an important role on the political or ideological battlefield. The institutional religious life was dominated by foreigners until the early 20th century. The tendencies that prevailed in the late 1930s for closer relations between the state and Lutheran church [...] ended with the Soviet occupation in 1940.

'''Estonians''' ({{lang-et|eestlased}}) are a [[Finnic people|Finnic]] ethnic group native to [[Estonia]] who speak the [[Estonian language]].

==History==

===Prehistoric roots===
Estonia was first inhabited about 10,000 years ago, just after the [[Baltic ice lake]] had retreated from Estonia. While it is not certain what languages were spoken by the first settlers, it is often maintained that speakers of early [[Uralic languages]] related to modern Estonian had arrived in what is now Estonia by about 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virpi Laitinena|year=2002|title=Y-Chromosomal Diversity Suggests that Baltic Males Share Common Finno-Ugric-Speaking Forefathers|work= Human Heredity| pages= 68–78|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ArtikelNr=57985&amp;Ausgabe=228324&amp;ProduktNr=224250&amp;filename=57985.pdf|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in the same area for more than 5,000 years would put the ancestors of Estonians among the oldest permanent inhabitants in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rWB3Bv3vuyMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA141,M1 Unrepresented Nations and peoples organization By Mary Kate Simmons; p141] {{ISBN|978-90-411-0223-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some recent linguistic estimations suggest that Finno-Ugrian language arrived around the Baltic Sea considerably later, perhaps during the [[Early Bronze Age]] (ca. 1800 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Petri Kallio 2006: Suomalais-ugrilaisen kantakielen absoluuttisesta kronologiasta. — ''Virittäjä'' 2006. (With English summary).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Häkkinen, Jaakko|year= 2009|title=Kantauralin ajoitus ja paikannus: perustelut puntarissa. – Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Aikakauskirja |page=92|url=http://www.sgr.fi/susa/92/hakkinen.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known [[endonym]] of the Estonians is {{lang|et|Maarahvas}}.&lt;ref name="ariste"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ariste | first1 = Paul | year = 1956 | title = Maakeel ja eesti keel. ''Eesti NSV Teaduste Akadeemia Toimetised'' 5: 117–24; Beyer, Jürgen (2007). Ist ''maarahvas'' (‚Landvolk'), die alte Selbstbezeichnung der Esten, eine Lehnübersetzung? Eine Studie zur Begriffsgeschichte des Ostseeraums | url = | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 566–593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Eesti'', the modern endonym of Estonia, is thought to be derived from the word ''[[Aestii]]'', the name given by the ancient [[Germanic people]] to the [[Balts|Baltic people]] living northeast of the [[Vistula River]]. The Roman historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in 98 AD was the first to mention the "''Aestii''" people, and early [[Scandinavia]]ns called the land south of the Gulf of Finland "''Eistland''" ({{lang|is|Eistland}} is also the current word in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] for Estonia), and the people "''eistr''". Proto-Estonians (as well as other speakers of the Finnish language group) were also called ''[[Chud]]s'' ({{lang|sla|чудь}}) in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]] [[chronicle]]s.

The Estonian language belongs to the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages, as does the [[Finnish language]]. The first known book in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] was printed in 1525, while the oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th-century chronicles.

===National consciousness===
Although Estonian national consciousness spread in the course of the 19th century during the [[Estonian national awakening]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gellner | first1 = Ernest | year = 1996 | title = Do nations have navels? | url = | journal = [[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 365–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some degree of ethnic awareness preceded this development.&lt;ref name="raun2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raun | first1 = Toivo U | year = 2003 | title = Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Estonian nationalism revisited | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1469-8219.00078 | journal = [[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 129–147 | doi=10.1111/1469-8219.00078}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century the self-denomination {{lang|et|eestlane}} spread among Estonians along with the older {{lang|et|maarahvas}}.&lt;ref name="ariste"/&gt; [[Anton thor Helle]]'s [[Bible translations into Estonian|translation of the Bible]] into Estonian appeared in 1739, and the number of books and brochures published in Estonian increased from 18 in the 1750s to 54 in the 1790s. By the end of the century more than a half of adult peasants could read. The first university-educated intellectuals identifying themselves as Estonians, including [[Friedrich Robert Faehlmann]] (1798–1850), [[Kristjan Jaak Peterson]] (1801–1822) and [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803–1882), appeared in the 1820s. The ruling elites had remained predominantly [[Baltic Germans|German]] in language and culture since the conquest of the early 13th century. [[Garlieb Merkel]] (1769–1850), a Baltic-German [[Estophile]], became the first author to treat the Estonians as a nationality equal to others; he became a source of inspiration for the Estonian national movement, modelled on Baltic German cultural world before the middle of the 19th century. However, in the middle of the century, the Estonians became more ambitious and started leaning toward the [[Finnish people|Finns]] as a [[Fennoman movement|successful model of national movement]] and, to some extent, toward the neighbouring [[Young Latvians|Latvian national movement]]. By the end of 1860 the Estonians became unwilling to reconcile with German cultural and political hegemony. Before the attempts at [[Russification]] in the 1880s, their view of [[Imperial Russia]] remained positive.&lt;ref name="raun2003"/&gt;

Estonians have strong ties to the [[Nordic countries]] stemming from important cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germany|German]] rule and settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Piirimäe, Helmut. Historical heritage: the relations between Estonia and her Nordic neighbors. In M. Lauristin et al. (eds.), ''Return to the Western world: Cultural and political perspectives on the Estonian post-communist transition''. Tartu: Tartu University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Estonians consider themselves Nordic rather than [[Baltic states|Baltic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/220/eesti_elu.pdf Estonian foreign ministry report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013626/http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/220/eesti_elu.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/273/Eesti%20elu.pdf  Estonian foreign ministry report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307050758/http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/273/Eesti%20elu.pdf |date=7 March 2008 }}, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in particular because of close ethnic and linguistic affinities with the Finns.

After the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] (1920) recognised Estonia's 1918 independence from Russia, ethnic Estonians residing in Russia gained the option of opting for Estonian citizenship (those who opted were called ''optandid'' - 'optants') and returning to their fatherland. An estimated 40,000 Estonians lived in Russia in 1920. In sum, 37,578 people moved from [[Soviet Russia]] to Estonia (1920–1923).&lt;ref&gt;

==Emigration==
During [[World War II]], when Estonia was [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|invaded by the Soviet Army]] in 1944, large numbers of Estonians fled their homeland on ships or smaller boats over the [[Baltic Sea]]. Many refugees who survived the risky sea voyage to [[Sweden]] or [[Germany]] later moved from there to [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] or [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Past|first=E.|title=By Land and By Sea|website=booklocker.com|year= 2015|url=http://booklocker.com/books/7900.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these refugees and their descendants returned to Estonia after the nation regained its independence in 1991.

Over the years of independence, increasing numbers of Estonians have chosen to work abroad, primarily in Finland, but also in other European countries (mostly in the UK, Benelux, Sweden, and Germany), making Estonia the country with the highest emigration rate in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2112rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook Country Comparison of net migration rate|website=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is at least partly due to the easy access to oscillating migration to Finland.

Recognising the problems arising from both low birth rate and high emigration, the country has launched various measures to both increase the birth rate and to lure migrant Estonians back to Estonia. Former president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] has lent his support to the campaign ''Talendid koju!'' ("Bringing talents home!")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talendidkoju.ee/|title=Toome talendid Eestimaale tagasi - Talendid Koju! |work=talendidkoju.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to coordinate and promote the return of Estonians who have particular skills needed in Estonia.

===Estonians in Canada===
One of the largest permanent Estonian community outside Estonia is in Canada with about 24,000 people&lt;ref name="canadainternational.gc.ca"/&gt; (according to some sources up to 50,000 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estemb.ca/estonia_and_canada|title=Estonian Embassy in Ottawa|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s and early 1950s, about 17,000 arrived in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt51.html|title=The Estonian Presence in Toronto|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312043108/http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt51.html|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto]] is the city with the largest population of Estonians outside of Estonia. The first Estonian World Festival was held in Toronto in 1972. Some notable Estonian Canadians include [[Endel Tulving]], [[Elmar Tampõld]], [[Alison Pill]], [[Uno Prii]] and [[Andreas Vaikla]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19744">In [[Judaism]], especially in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] tradition, there are a number of settings in which men and women are kept separate in order to conform with various elements of [[halakha]] and to prevent men and women from mingling. Other forms of Judaism rarely separate genders any more than secular western society.

==Background==
There are a variety of reasons in Judaism that are used to justify gender separation to varying degrees.

In [[Pirkei Avot]] 1:5, Yosi ben Yochanan says that a man who spends too much time talking to women, even his wife, neglects the study of Torah and will inherit gehinnom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/pirkei-avot-ethics-of-the-fathers-3/|title=Pirkei Avot- Ethics of the Fathers - My Jewish Learning|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 152 of [[Shlomo_Ganzfried#Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] details a series of laws forbidding interaction between persons of the opposite sex who are not married or closely related.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur152.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the prohibitions include [[negiah|physical contact]], [[yichud|isolation with members of the opposite sex]], staring at women or any of their body parts or attire, or conversation for pleasure.

==By setting==

===Synagogues===
{{Main article|Mechitza}}
During prayer services in Orthodox synagogues, seating is always separate. A [[mechitza]] is used to divide the men and women, and often to block the view from one section to the other.

The first mention of a [[Mechitza]] is in the context of the second temple itself, the temple contained an inner court and a Women's court. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/197736169/|title=FOUCAULT AND JEWISH FEMINISM:  THE MEHITZAH AS DIVIDING PRACTICE|last=Wolosky|first=Shira|date=2009|website=Proquest|publisher=Proquest|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation was first instituted just for the once-a-year celebration of the annual “Water-Drawing Ceremony,” ''simḥat beit hashoevah'', held on the second night of the autumn Sukkot festival. However, women regularly entered the Beit Hamikdash Holy area at all other times just as any Israelite man could to bring their personal sacrifices.

Separation of men and women also was established later within the Rabbinic Law, which established daily communal prayers binding to men only, and the central area of the synagogue was only allowed to be occupied by men as well. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However during the early modern period, Moshe Rosman noted that, women began attending synagogue more often, which reflected on the changes to synagogue architecture. Changes that occurred to synagogue architecture included, the construction of the ''weibershule''-separate rooms in which women conducted their own prayers, also ''erzot nashim''– separate women's section in the synagogue, in which women prayer leaders mediated between the main services and the women's prayers, in a manner again very much determined by the initiatives of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Today, some more liberal Orthodox congregations have enacted innovations allowing women a greater sense of participation, as long as they remain on their side of the [[Mechitza]]. Mechitza, are not only found in synagogues during prayer services, but in other aspects of Jewish life such as festivities, like weddings, lectures, concerts, and bar mitzvahs.

Conservative, Reform, and other types of synagogues generally do not have separate seating.

===[[Western Wall]]===

While during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/130878/the-womens-wall The Women's Wall] Tablet Magazine, 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship. In recent years the Western Wall in Jerusalem has become a site of conflict and contention between liberal and feminist Jews.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/183425|title=The Political Transformation of Gender Traditions at the Western Wall in Jerusalem|last=Charme|first=Stuart|date=April 2005|publisher=Journal of Feminist studies in Religion|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Wall has been defended by the orthodox faith for generations, which is why many of the patriarchal traditions have been maintained such as gender segregation. Many orthodox Jews believe that in order to keep the sanctity of the wall proper gender roles must be adhered. Eventually a [[mechitza]] was set up at the wall to maintain and enforce gender separation, this caused conflict between the ultra orthodox Jews and the Arabs. &lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/183425|title=The Political Transformation of Gender Traditions at the Western Wall in Jerusalem|last=Charme|first=Stuart|date=April 2005|website=Project muse|publisher=Journal of Feminist studies in Religion|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mechitza]] that was installed during the mid twentieth century it has a men's section and then a women's section which is half the size of the men's section. The progressives responded to these actions by the orthodox sector, by claiming that "the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2015/04/24/news-opinion/the-telegraph/from-the-archive-when-the-western-wall-battles-began From the Archive: First rumblings in the battle for pluralism at the Western Wall] JTA, 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Women of the Wall]] launched a campaign for recognition of women's right to pray at the Wall in their fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/mission-statement/ |title=Mission Statement |work=Women of the Wall - נשות הכותל |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308072412/http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/mission-statement/ |archivedate=March 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/history/|title=History|work=Women of the Wall - נשות הכותל}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were initially banned from holding services at the site. In response to the repeated arrests of women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], trying to exercise their [[freedom of religion]], the [[Jewish Agency]] observed 'the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife."  The Israeli high court finally affirmed in 2000 the right to have women pray at the wall according to their custom whether it be Reformed, Conservative, or Orthodox. This new law included the right for women to be able to pray aloud, read from the Torah, and wear a [[tallitot]], the supreme court also recognized that the wall was "owned" by the orthodox sector, but felt that women had the right to pray how they wish. After the supreme court ruled upon this some ultra orthodox Jewish men tried to petition the court to criminalize women who read from the Torah, wore a tallitot, or blow [[shofar]] at the Wall. In 2003 this petition was looked at by the Israeli court and the court appealed the previously passed bill, the reasoning behind the repeal was because women praying at the wall would be a threat to public safety.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt;  The courts decision to once again limit women's rights at the Wall came from a place of fear, that if they did not limit their rights that there would be an uprising by the ultra orthodox sector.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershner|first= Isabel|title= Court Rules for Women in Western Wall Dispute |date=April 11, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/world/middleeast/israeli-court-rules-for-women-at-western-wall.html|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of the Wall has also protested the fact that at  [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men’s section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act.” In 2014 the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were initially confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.' (18 Dec 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.632612&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Weddings and Bar Mitzvahs===
At many Orthodox weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs, seating at the ceremony and often the reception is separate, sometimes with a mechitza.

===Swimming===
[[File:Beaches of Tel Aviv, 1927 - detail P1080422.JPG|thumb|235px|A sign forbidding men entering the women's section a Tel-Aviv beach, 1927]]
In Orthodox Judaism, many believe that men and women should not swim together. The laws prohibiting [[mixed bathing]] are derived from the laws of [[tzniut]]. This is due to concerns that [[bathing suit]]s are inherently immodest, and do not meet ''tzniut'' requirements. In particular, a woman who comes dressed in a bathing suit to a pool is appearing publicly not meeting the requirements of tzniut, and a man who comes to a pool where women are dressed in bathing suits will inevitably see women dressed in this manner. Indeed, many pools within Jewish communities have separate hours for male and female swimming to accommodate those who follow this law.

Some women following the laws of tzniut will wear a long T-shirt style dress over their bathing suit that meets tzniut requirements, considering this to be sufficient for swimming in the presence of men. Men, though, are more strict about the presence of immodestly-dressed women, due to concerns over the possibility of arousal.

[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and other forms of Judaism do not have any restrictions on mixed swimming. Some [[Modern Orthodox]] Jews will also participate in mixed swimming.

===Streets===
Some ultra-Orthodox communities enforce or attempt to enforce gender segregation on sidewalks. In New Square, N.Y., signs remain posted telling women to abide by modesty rules, and streets are strictly separated by gender, with women on the opposite side as men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/144987/sex-segregation-spreads-among-orthodox/ Sex-Segregation Spreads Among Orthodox] The Forward, October 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mea Shearim]] section of Jerusalem, some ultra-Orthodox Jews have also tried to segregate sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4145922,00.html Gender segregation on rise in Israel] YNET, Nov 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks and athletic facilities===
At Kiryas Joel, a Hasidic community in New York, a public park was opened that included separate sections for boys and girls, with a great distance between. Rabbi Gedalia Segdin, the town's treasurer, announced the park would be under the scrutiny of the town "Modesty Committee" to ensure gender segregation. [[Yiddish]] signs distributed throughout the park making sure everyone kept to their specified section. Civil rights organizations protested gender segregation in a public space in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/orthodox-village-kiryas-joel-will-stop-sex-segregating-public-park-it-claimed-didnt-exist-6662335 ORTHODOX VILLAGE KIRYAS JOEL WILL STOP SEX-SEGREGATING PUBLIC PARK IT CLAIMED DIDN'T EXIST] The Village Voice, April 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dancing===
Orthodox Jews do not participate in mixed dancing, since dancing in most forms involves some contact between dancers.

In 2013, the Rabbinical Court of the Ashkenazi Community in the ultra-Orthodox settlement of [[Beitar Illit]] ruled against [[Zumba]] (a type of dance fitness) classes, although they were held with a female instructor and all-female participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.546014|title=Haredi Rabbis Ban All-female Zumba Classes|first=Allison Kaplan|last=Sommer|date=9 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/183625/haredi-rabbis-outlaw-women-only-zumba-classes/#ixzz2glRtEXy5|title=Haredi Rabbis Outlaw Women-Only Zumba Classes|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said in part, "both in form and manner, the activity [Zumba] is entirely at odds with both the ways of the Torah and the holiness of Israel, as are the songs associated to it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/183625/haredi-rabbis-outlaw-women-only-zumba-classes/#ixzz2glSM5ru6|title=Haredi Rabbis Outlaw Women-Only Zumba Classes|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
Some followers of [[Haredi Judaism]] have taken on the practice of separate seating while traveling. These range from abstaining to sitting adjacent to a member of the opposite sex, to having separate vehicles altogether.

When Haredi have attempted to enforce gender segregation on public transportation such as buses and airlines, conflict with anti-discrimination laws have sometimes ensued. There have been complaints by airline passengers such as [[Renee Rabinowitz]] who have been subjected to Orthodox male passengers attempting to impose gender segregation on flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50494/t/0/blastContent.jsp?email_blast_KEY=1306981 IRAC Newsletter] " Rights on Flights" 5 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times interviewed [[Anat Hoffman]] on the phenomenon on ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move. IRAC had started a campaign urging women not to give up their seats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/aboard-flights-conflicts-over-seat-assignments-and-religion.html When a Plane Seat Next to a Woman Is Against Orthodox Faith] The New York Times, 9 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Al]] airlines has future plans to fly single-gender flights for Haredi Jews following this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3654758,00.html|title=Ynetnews - News - sorry page|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Jerusalem Magistrates Court ruled that employees of airlines could not request female passengers change their seats just because men wish them to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldman |first=Paul |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/israeli-court-rules-el-al-airline-cannot-ask-women-move-n775391 |title=Israeli Court Rules El Al Airline Cannot Ask Women to Move Seats |publisher=NBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, members of the ultra Jewish orthodox sector began making requests for public transport services be compatible with what they claimed was the character of their community in Israel. This entailed the segregation of men and women on public transportation such as buses. When this movement first began private transport services emerged and began to cater to the Orthodox Jewish requests.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/493711|title=Balancing Women's Rights and Religious Rights: The Issue of Bus Segregation|last=Feldheim|first=Miriam|date=December 2013|publisher=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Due to these new bus lines a new committee was instituted in the Ministry of Transportation and the committee was led by [[Nahum Langental|Nachum Langenthal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Langenthal committee decided that segregation was to be voluntary and could be adhered by the ultra orthodox Jews, but it was not to be enforced. Though on city run buses it was not enforced the private buses could enforce these segregation rules, these buses were called [[Mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]] bus lines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 2010 there were approximately fifty public bus services designated as [[Mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]], although this represented a small portion of the total public buses it allowed for tensions to grow between the orthodox community and the rest of the population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Private bus lines were established all across Israel which caused more issues to arise especially as sometimes that would be the only form of transportation in the area. [[Mehadrin bus lines|Mehadrin]] bus lines became more prevalent in areas that had a high concentration of ultra orthodox communities. Due to the segregation rules the status of women became a direct issue in the Israeli community. Not only did the rest of the public have issues about the [[Mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]] buses, but because they were the only form of transportation in some communities the orthodox community began having issues with the overcrowding of the buses. When many of the buses became overcrowded, enforcing the segregation rules became harder and many of the ultra orthodox men complained about having to touch passengers of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

When the [[Mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]] buses became more popular the Israeli women's network petitioned the high court arguing that the segregation policy on mehadrin lines discriminated against women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The Israeli Supreme Court denied the application of the Israel Women's Network on the grounds that the gender segregation on buses was supported by the religious community and should be respected. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  After the denial of the Israeli women's network, modesty guards began to appear on the buses, some super ultra orthodox men thought that they were responsible for enforcing the segregation rules and took it upon themselves to do so. In some cases women were forced off the bus or subjected to physical or verbal abuse when passengers were not appropriately dressed, or sitting near the front of the bus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although a myriad of protests occurred to stop the segregation it was defended by many. The bus segregation was defended by rabbinic leaders and some members of the ultra-Orthodox community as intrinsic to the ultra-Orthodox way of life.

'''''Glamorous Night''''' is a 1937 British [[drama film]] directed by [[Brian Desmond Hurst]] and starring [[Mary Ellis]], [[Otto Kruger]] and [[Victor Jory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/34809|title=Glamorous Night (1937)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an adaptation of the play ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' by [[Ivor Novello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/glamorous-night-v93288|title=Glamorous Night (1937) - Brian Desmond Hurst - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mythical European kingdom, King Stefan clashes with his prime minister and falls in love with the gypsy loving Melitza.

==Cast==
* [[Mary Ellis]] ...  Melitza Hjos
* [[Otto Kruger]] ...  King Stefan

==Critical reception==
''[[Sky Movies]]'' wrote, "The story creaks like a dowager's stays in this torrid tale of Ruritanian romance and skulduggery based on Ivor Novello's stage success. There are compensations, however, in the tuneful music and elegant production values, to say nothing of gipsies who appear to be addicted to ballet dancing. Victor Jory plays the villainous prime minister with steely determination and an American accent, Mary Ellis is suitably lively although she is hardly a believable Romany. Barry Mackay stands out as an English oil prospector, the role originally played on stage by Novello."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sky.com/tv/movie/glamorous-night-1937|title=Glamorous Night|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5477">'''Hot saucing''' is the practice of [[Child discipline|disciplining]] a child or teenagers by putting [[hot sauce]] in the child's mouth. Some pediatricians, psychologists and experts on child care strongly recommend against this practice&lt;ref name="wpFeeling"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52899-2004Aug9.html |title=Feeling the Heat |last=Buckholtz |first=Alison |date=10 August 2004 |page=HE01 |quote=Some Parents Apply Hot Sauce to a Child or teenage's Tongue as Punishment.

==Popularity==
Former child star [[Lisa Whelchel]] advocates hot saucing in her parenting book ''Creative Correction''.&lt;ref name="Creative"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelchel |first=Lisa |authorlink=Lisa Whelchel |title=Creative Correction: Extraordinary Ideas for Everyday Discipline |publisher=[[Tyndale House]] |location=[[Wheaton, Illinois]] |series=[[Focus on the Family]] Books |isbn=1-56179-901-7 |year=2000 |page=149 |chapter=Toolbox |quote=For lying or other offenses of the tongue, I 'spank' my kids' tongues.

(It's the memory that lingers!)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Whelchel claims the practice is more effective and humane than traditional [[corporal punishment]]s, such as [[spanking]]; she repeated this opinion when promoting her book on ''[[Good Morning America]]'',&lt;ref name="GMA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Actress Weighs In on Latest Discipline Tactics |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=318267#.Tr2T0Wp4be4 |work=[[Good Morning America]] |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she said in raising her own child she found the technique successful where other measures had failed. Whelchel's book recommends using only "tiny" amounts of hot sauce, and lists alternatives such as [[lemon juice]] or [[vinegar]].&lt;ref name="wpFeeling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=127607&amp;page=1#.Tr2DAWp4be4 |title=Is It OK to 'Hot Sauce' Kids? |date=24 August 2004 |work=[[Good Morning America]] |publisher=[[ABC News]] |quote=The actress-turned-home-schooling mom suggests using just a dab of hot sauce, placing it on your finger, then touching your finger to the child's tongue. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice had also been suggested in a 2001 article in ''Today's Christian Woman'' magazine,&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/spankin9a.htm |title="Hot Saucing" as a method of child corporal punishment |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |date=29 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christian"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can We Talk? 6 ways to boost better communication with your child |year=2001 |last=Yates |first=Susan Alexander |journal=[[Christianity Today|Today's Christian Woman]] |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=14 |publisher= |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2001/july/canwetalk-julaug01.html |accessdate=20 December 2012 |quote=When our children were young and tried talking back, we simply washed out their mouths with yucky-tasting soap.

'''Kenzi''' (Kenuzi), also known as '''Mattokki''', is a [[Nubian language]] of [[Egypt]]. It is spoken north of [[Mahas]] in Egypt.
It is closely related to [[Dongolawi language|Dongolawi or Andaandi]], a Nubian Language of [[Sudan]]. The two have historically been considered two varieties of one language. More recent research recognizes them as distinct languages without a "particularly close genetic relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Bechhaus-Gerst, Marianne. ''The (Hi)story of Nobiin — 1000 Years of Language Change''. Peter Lang, 2011, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; With population displacement due to the [[Aswan High Dam]] there are communities of speakers in [[Lower Egypt]]. Recent linguistic research on the Kenzi language has been conducted by Ahmed Sokarno Abdel-Hafiz.&lt;ref name="Abdel-Hafiz 1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdel-Hafiz |first1=Ahmed Sokarno |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~gerdts/teaching/Abdel-HafizNubian.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Reference Grammar of Kunuz Nubian |location=Buffalo |publisher=State University of New York |year=1988 |accessdate=2015-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) were translated into the Kunuzi dialect of Nubian. They were translated by Samuel Ali Hisen, a Nubian evangelist in the service of the German Sudan Pioneer Mission, under the supervision of Heinrich Schäfer, a professor in the Egyptian Department of the Royal Museum, Berlin.  They were published in Berlin by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in 1912.

'''Land grabbing''' is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions: the buying or leasing of large pieces of land by domestic and [[Multinational corporation|transnational companies]], governments, and individuals. While used broadly throughout history, land grabbing as used in the 21st century primarily refers to large-scale land acquisitions following the [[2007–08 world food price crisis]].&lt;ref name=Borras&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borras Jr.|first=Saturnino M. |author2=Ruth Hall |author3=Ian Scoones |author4=Ben White |author5=Wendy Wolford|title=Towards a better understanding of global land grabbing: an editorial introduction|journal=[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]|date=24 March 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=209|doi=10.1080/03066150.2011.559005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining water resources is usually critical to the land acquisitions, so it has also led to an associated trend of [[water grabbing]].&lt;ref name=PNAC-2013-110-03&gt;Maria Cristina Rullia, Antonio Savioria, and Paolo D’Odorico, [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/01/02/1213163110 Global Land and Water Grabbing], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 110, no. 3 (2013): 892–97.&lt;/ref&gt; By prompting [[food security]] fears within the developed world and new found economic opportunities for agricultural investors, the food price crisis caused a dramatic spike in large-scale agricultural investments, primarily foreign, in the [[Global South]] for the purpose of industrial [[food production|food]] and [[biofuel]]s production. Although hailed by investors, economists and some developing countries as a new pathway towards agricultural development, investment in land in the 21st century has been criticized by some [[non-governmental organization]]s and commentators as having a negative impact on local communities. [[International law]] is implicated when attempting to regulate these transactions.&lt;ref name=Regulating&gt;[[Lea Brilmayer]] and William J. Moon, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2395461 Regulating Land Grabs: Third Party States, Social Activism, and International Law], book chapter in ''[https://www.springer.com/environment/sustainable+development/book/978-94-007-7777-4 Rethinking Food Systems],'' February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The term "land grabbing" is defined as very large-scale land acquisitions, either buying or leasing.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The size of the land deal is multiples of [[Orders of magnitude (area)#108 to 1014 sqm|{{convert|1000|km2}}]] or {{convert|100000|ha}} and thus much larger than in the past.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave/&gt;  The term is itself controversial. In 2011, Borras, Hall and others wrote that "the phrase 'global land grab' has become a catch-all to describe and analyze the current trend towards {{Sic|hide=y|large| |expected=large-}} scale (trans)national commercial land transactions."&lt;ref name=Borras /&gt; Ruth Hall wrote elsewhere that the "term 'land grabbing', while effective as [[activist]] terminology, obscures vast differences in the [[legality]], structure, and outcomes of commercial land deals and deflects attention from the roles of domestic elites and governments as partners, [[intermediaries]], and [[beneficiaries]]."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Ruth|title=Land grabbing in Southern Africa: the many faces of the investor rush|journal=Review of African Political Economy |date=June 2011|volume=38|pages=193–214|doi=10.1080/03056244.2011.582753 |issue=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portuguese, Land Grabbing is translated as "grilagem": "Much is said about grilagem and the term may be curious ... document aged by the action of insects &lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 28 -  https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania: "I suggest the expression may have another setting. Just as the grileiro disguises his deeds and often produces a physical document that seems legally good and valuable in spite of everything - even though it does not withstand more careful analysis - the insects that inspire the word "grilagem" also live in the garden or hidden under foliage, emitting natural sounds and, thus, giving signs of their existence, and they can be located " &lt;/ref&gt; ... However, for those who live in the interior of the country, the expression effectively reveals a dark, heavy, violent meaning, involving abuses and arbitrary actions against the former occupants, occasionally with forced loss of possession by the taking of land " &lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 16 -  https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania&lt;/ref&gt;  The term grilagem applies to irregular procedures and / or illegal private landholding with violence in the countryside, exploitation of wealth, environmental damage and the threat to sovereignty&lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 21 - https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania
: "How far is the idea of national sovereignty compromised by land grabbing?" &lt;/ref&gt;, given their gigantic proportions.

== Situation in the 21st century ==

===Land Area===
The [[Overseas Development Institute]] reported in January 2013, that with limited data available in general and existing data associated with NGOs interested in generating media attention in particular, the scale of global land trade may have been exaggerated. They found the figures below provide a variety of estimates, all in the tens of millions of hectares.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;Joseph Holden and Margarethe Pagel, Jan 2013, Transnational land acquisitions, ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES, 49p, http://partnerplatform.org/?azrv33t9&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) estimated in 2009 between 15 and 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries had changed hands since 2006.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/13692889 | work=The Economist | title=Outsourcing's third wave | date=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{as of|January 2013}} the [[Land Portal]]’s [[Land Matrix]] data totalled 49 million hectares of deals globally, although only 26 million hectares of these are transnational.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
*A 2011 World Bank report by Klaus Deininger reported 56 million hectares worldwide.&lt;ref name=Rising-Global-Interest-Farmland&gt;{{cite news| url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Rising-Global-Interest-in-Farmland.pdf | work=The World Bank | title= Rising Global Interest in Farmland | date=March 2015}},&lt;/ref&gt;
*Friis &amp; Reenberg (2012) reported in 2012 between 51 and 63 million hectares in Africa alone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
*The [[GRAIN]] database&lt;ref name=graindb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grain.org/article/entries/4479-grain-releases-data-set-with-over-400-global-land-grabs|title=GRAIN — GRAIN releases data set with over 400 global land grabs|author=|date=|website=www.grain.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in January 2012, quantified 35 million hectares, although when stripping out more developed economies such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]], the amount in the GRAIN database reduces to 25 million hectares.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
* Between 1990 and 2011, in the [[West Bank]] ([[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]) 195 km2 of land was expropriated by [[Israel]], without compensation for the local owners, and allocated to immigrants for new settlements and for the establishment of mostly large farms. Water for the local population became extremely sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/200205_land_grab|title=Land Grab|author=|date=|website=B'Tselem|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, as a part of a permanent process 300 acres of land were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/charlotte-silver/israels-west-bank-land-grabs-biggest-decades|title=Israel's West Bank land grabs biggest in decades|first=Charlotte|last=Silver|date=30 March 2016|website=electronicintifada.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most seem to arrive at a ballpark of 20-60 million hectares. Given that total global farmland takes up just over 4 billion hectares,&lt;ref&gt;Byerlee, Derek and Deininger, Klaus (2011), Rising Global Interest in Farmland, The World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} these acquisitions could equate to around 1 per cent of global farmland. However, in practice, land acquired may not have previously been used as farmland, it may be covered by forests, which also equate to about 4 billion hectares worldwide, so transnational [[land acquisitions]] may have a significant role in ongoing [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The researchers thought that a sizeable number of deals remain questionable in terms of size and whether they have been finalised and implemented. The land database often relies on one or two media sources and may not track whether the investments take place, or whether the full quantity reported takes place. For example, a number of deals in the GRAIN database&lt;ref name=graindb/&gt; appear to have stalled including -
*1 million hectares taken between US firms [[Arc Cap]] and [[Nile Trading and Development Inc]] in [[Sudan]]
*A 400,000 hectare deal between [[China]] and [[Colombia]] that seems to have stalled
*The 325,000 hectare investment by [[Agrisol]] in [[Tanzania]]
*A 324,000 hectare purchase of land by the [[UAE]] in [[Pakistan]]
*A suspended 320,000 hectare purchase by Chinese investors in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The researchers claim these are only those that have been checked, and already amount to nearly 10 per cent of the GRAIN database transnational land acquisitions. Deals are reported that use the estimate of the full extent of land that the firm expects to use. For example,
*Indian investment in [[Tanzania]] is reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 1,000 hectares
*[[Olam International]]’s investment in [[Gabon]] reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 50,000
*Three investments amounting to 600,000 hectares in [[Liberia]], with [[Equatorial Palm Oil]]’s deal reported at 169,000 hectares, despite their plans to reach just 50,000 by 2020.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===Land Value===
The researchers found that in terms of value of transnational land acquisitions, it is even harder to come across figures. Media reports usually just give information on the area and not on the value of the land transaction. Investment estimates, rather than the price of purchase are occasionally given&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

They found a number of reports in land databases are not acquisitions, but are long-term leases, where a fee is paid or a certain proportion of the produce goes to domestic markets. For example:&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*An Indian investment in Ethiopia, where price per hectare ranged from $1.20 to $8 per hectare per year on 311,000 hectares
*Indian investors paid $4 per hectare per year on 100,000 hectares.
*Prince [[Bandar Bin Sultan]] of Saudi Arabia was reported to be paying $125,000 per year for 105,000 hectares in South Sudan, less than $1 per year on a 25-year lease.
*A South Korean investor in Peru was reported to be paying $0.80 per hectare.

The estimated value has been calculated for [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]]’s 2009 data to be 15 to 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries, worth about $20 billion-$30 billion.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave/&gt;

Researchers discovered global investment funds are reported to have sizeable funds available for transnational land investments.
*One estimate suggests “$100 billion waiting to be invested by 120 investment groups” while already “[[Saudi Arabia]] has spent $800 million on overseas farms”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westerninvestor.com/index.php/news/55-features/764-land-values&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a farm consultancy [[HighQuest]] told [[Reuters]]  “Private capital investment in farming in expected to more than double to around $5-$7 billion in the next couple of years from an estimated $2.5-$3 billion invested in the last couple of years”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/farm-private-investment-seen-doubling-in-two-years/1000408695|title=Farm private investment seen doubling in two years - Alberta Farmer Express|author=|date=|website=www.albertafarmexpress.ca|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant uncertainty around the value of transnational land acquisitions, particularly given leasing arrangements. Given the quantity of land and the size of investment funds operating in the area, it is likely that the value will be in the tens of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===Land destinations===
Researchers used the Land Portal’s Land Matrix database of 49 billion hectares of land deals, and found that Asia is a big centre of activity with [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] counting for a quarter of international deals by hectares. [[India]] contributes a further 10 per cent of land deals. The majority of investment is in the production of [[palm oil]] and other [[biofuels]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

They determined that the Land Portal also reports investments made by investors within their home country and after stripping these out found only 26 million hectares of transnational land acquisitions which strips out a lot of the Asian investments. The largest destination countries include
*[[Brazil]] with 11 per cent by land area
*[[Sudan]] with 10 per cent
*[[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Ethiopia]] with 8 per cent each
*[[Mozambique]] with 7 per cent
*[[Indonesia]] with 6 per cent.
&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

They found the reason seems to be biofuels expansion with exceptions in [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]], which sees a trend towards growth of food from [[Middle East]]ern and [[India]]n investors. Represented in the media as the norm they seem to be more the exception.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

===Land origins===
The researchers found a mixed picture in terms of the origins of investors. According to the [[Land Portal]], the [[United Kingdom]] is the biggest country of origin followed by the [[United States]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and [[Malaysia]], with [[China]] a much smaller player. The [[GRAIN]] database&lt;ref name=graindb/&gt; says:
*[[United States]], the [[UAE]] and [[China]] all constitute around 12 per cent of deals
*[[India]] with 8 per cent
*[[Egypt]] and the [[UK]] with 6 per cent
*[[South Korea]] with 5 per cent
* [[South Africa]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] all with 4 per cent.
Both the [[Land Portal]] and the GRAIN database show that the UK and the US are major players in transnational land acquisitions. This is agribusiness firms, as well as investment funds, investing mostly in [[sugar cane]], [[jatropha]] or [[palm oil]]. This trend has clearly been driven by the [[biofuels targets]] in the [[European Union|EU]] and US, and greater [[vertical integration]] in [[agribusiness]] in general.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

The smaller trend is the picture of Middle Eastern investors or State-backed Chinese investments. While the [[UAE]] has done some significant deals by size, some driven by food deals, with Saudi Arabia a smaller number, this is not the dominant trend. While this aspect of land trade has gathered lots of media attention, it is not by any means a comprehensive story.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"/&gt;

===Other deals===
Other estimates of the scope of land acquisition, published in September 2010 by the [[World Bank]], showed that over [[Orders of magnitude (area)#108 to 1014 sqm|{{convert|460000| km2}}]] or {{convert|46000000|ha}} in large-scale farmland acquisitions or negotiations were announced between October 2008 and August 2009 alone, with two-thirds of demanded land concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=Deininger&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Of the World Bank’s 464 examined acquisitions, only 203 included land area in their reports, implying that the actual total land covered could more than double the World Bank’s reported 46 million ha. The most recent estimate of the scale, based on evidence presented in April 2011 at an international conference convened by the Land Deal Politics Initiative, estimated the area of land deals at over 80 million ha.&lt;ref name="Borras Scoones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borras|first=Jun|title=Small-scale farmers increasingly at risk from 'global land grabbing' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/15/risks-over-increasing-global-land-deals |accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian.co.uk: Poverty Matters Blog|date=15 April 2011|author2=Ian Scoones|author3=David Hughes|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these deals, the median size is [[Orders of magnitude (area)#100 to 107 sqm|{{convert|40000|ha}}]], with one-quarter over 200,000 ha and one-quarter under 10,000 ha.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; 37% of projects deal with [[food crops]], 21% with [[cash crops]], and 21% with [[biofuels]].&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; This points to the vast diversity of investors and projects involved with land acquisitions: the land sizes, crop types, and investors involved vary wildly between agreements. Of these projects, 30% were still in an exploratory stage, with 70% approved but in varying stages of development. 18% had not started yet, 30% were in initial development stages, and 21% had started farming.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; The strikingly low proportion of projects that had initiated farming signifies the difficulties inherent in large-scale agricultural production in the developing world.

Investment in land often takes the form of long-term [[lease]]s, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as “non-private" as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease.&lt;ref name="Borras Franco"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borras|first=Saturnino|title=Regulating land grabbing?|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/69648|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=Pambazuka News|date=16 December 2010|author2=Jennifer Franco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries’ constitutional bans on [[Economic nationalism|outright sales of land to foreigners]].

The methods surrounding the negotiation, approval, and follow-up of contracts between investors and governments have attracted significant criticism for their opacity and complexity. The negotiation and approval processes have been closed in most cases, with little public disclosure both during and after the finalization of a deal. The approval process, in particular, can be cumbersome: It varies from approval by a simple district-level office to approval by multiple national-level government offices and is very subjective and discretionary.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In Ethiopia, companies must first obtain an investment license from the central government, identify appropriate land on the district level and negotiate with local leaders, then develop a contract with the regional investment office. Afterwards, the government will undertake a project feasibility study and capital verification process, and finally a lease agreement will be signed and land will be transferred to the investor.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al."&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotula |first=Lorenzo |title=Land grab or development opportunity? Agricultural investment and international land deals in Africa|year=2009|publisher=FAO, IIED, IFAD|location=London/Rome|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/land/land_grab.pdf|author2=Sonja Vermeulen|author3=Rebeca Leonard|author4=James Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, even though the Tanzania Investment Centre facilitates investments, an investor must obtain approval from the TIC, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Lands and Housing Development, and the Ministry of Environment, among which communication is oftentimes intermittent.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt;

== Target countries ==
One common thread among governments has been the theme of [[economic development|development]]: Target governments tout the benefits of agricultural development, [[job creation]], [[cash crop]] production, and infrastructure provision as drivers towards [[economic development]] and eventually modernization. Many companies have promised to build [[irrigation]], roads, and in some cases hospitals and schools to carry out their investment projects. In return for a below-market-rate $10/ha annual payment for land, [[Saudi Star]] promised "to bring clinics, schools, better roads and electricity supplies to [[Gambela Region|Gambella]].”&lt;ref name="Butler 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Ed|title=Land grab fears for Ethiopian rural communities|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11991926|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=BBC World Service|date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments also count new job creation as a significant feature of land acquisitions.

The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The [[Ethiopia]]n government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for [[food security]] than having [[local food|local]] farmers produce crops by themselves.&lt;ref name=Davison&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison|first=William|title=Ethiopia Plans to Rent Out Belgium-Sized Land Area to Produce Cash Crops |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-26/ethiopia-plans-to-rent-out-belgium-sized-land-area-to-produce-cash-crops.html|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as "underdeveloped" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an inadequate form of food production.

On a smaller scale, some deals can be traced to a personal stake in the project or possibly due to [[corruption]] or [[rent-seeking]]. Given the ad hoc, decentralized, and unorganized approval processes across countries for such transactions, the potential for lapses in [[good governance|governance]] and openings for corruption are extremely high. In many countries, the [[World Bank]] has noted that investors are often better off learning how to navigate the bureaucracies and potentially pay off corrupt officers of governments rather than developing viable, sustainable business plans.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

=== Responses ===
Since 2010 [[Brazil]] enforces in a stricter way a long-existing law that limits the size of farmland properties foreigners may purchase, having halted a large part of projected foreign land purchases.&lt;ref name= Brazil&gt;{{cite news|title= Farmland Investment| publisher= Peer Voss, a farmland brokerage|url = http://www.argentina-estancias.com/inflationhedge-farmland.htm|quote= restrictions now limiting the size of farm land...|accessdate = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Argentina]], as of September 2011, a projected law is discussed in parliament that would restrict the size of land foreign entities can acquire to 1000 hectare.&lt;ref name= Argentina&gt;{{cite news|title= Farmland Investment|publisher= Peer Voss, a farmland brokerage|url = http://www.argentina-estancias.com/inflationhedge-farmland.htm|quote= discussed in congress that would limit the maximum...|accessdate = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of land investment ==
[[Investor]]s can be generally broken down into three types: [[agribusiness]]es, governments, and [[speculation|speculative]] investors. Governments and companies in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] have been very prominent along with [[East Asian]] companies. Many European- and American-owned investment vehicles and agricultural producers have initiated investments as well. These actors have been motivated by a number of factors, including cheap land, potential for improving agricultural production, and rising [[food prize|food]] and [[biofuel]] prices. Building on these motivations, investments can be broken down into three main categories: food, biofuel, and speculative investment. [[Forestry]] also contributes to a significant amount of large-scale land acquisition, as do several other processes: Zoomers&lt;ref&gt;Zoomers, A. (2010) ‘Globalization and the foreignization of space: The seven processes driving the current global land grab’. Journal of Peasant Studies. 37:2, 429-447.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions drivers such as the creation of protected areas and nature reserves, residential migration, large-scale tourist complexes and the creation of [[Special_economic_zone|Special Economic Zones]], particularly in Asian countries.

=== Food ===
[[Food]]-driven investments, which comprise roughly 37% of land investments worldwide, are undertaken primarily by two sets of actors: [[agribusiness]]es trying to expand their holdings and react to market incentives, and government-backed investments, especially from the Gulf states, as a result of fears surrounding national [[food security]].&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

Agricultural sector companies most often view investment in land as an opportunity to leverage their significant monetary resources and [[market access]] to take advantage of underused land, diversify their holdings, and vertically integrate their production systems. The [[World Bank]] identifies three areas in which multinational companies can leverage economies of scale: access to cheap international rather than domestic [[capital market|financial markets]], risk-reducing [[diversification (finance)|diversification of holdings]], and greater ability to address [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] roadblocks.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In the past few decades, [[multinational company|multinationals]] have shied away from direct involvement in relatively unprofitable [[primary production]], instead focusing on inputs and [[food processing|processing]] and distribution.&lt;ref name=Selby&gt;{{cite book |last=Selby |first=A. |title=Institutional Investment into Agricultural Activities: Potential Benefits and Pitfalls|year=2009|publisher=Presented at the conference "Land Governance in support of the MDGs: responding to New Challenges," World Bank|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the food price crisis hit, risk was transferred from primary production to the price-sensitive processing and distribution fields, and returns became concentrated in primary production. This has incentivized agribusinesses to vertically integrate to reduce supplier risk that has been heightened by the ongoing food price volatility.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; These companies hold mixed attitudes towards food imports and exports: While some concentrate on food exports, others focus on domestic markets first.

While company-originated investments have originated from a wide range of countries, government-backed investments have originated primarily from the food-insecure Gulf States. Examples of such government-backed investments include the government of [[Qatar]]’s attempt to secure land in the [[Tana River District|Tana River Delta]] and the [[Saudi]] government's King Abdullah Initiative.&lt;ref name="Cotula Outlook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotula |first=Lorenzo|title=The outlook on farmland acquisitions |year=2011|publisher=International Land Coalition, IIED |url=http://www.landcoalition.org/publications/outlook-farmland-acquisitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIAN 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Land grabbing in Kenya and Mozambique |year=2010 |publisher=FIAN |url=http://www.fian.org/resources/documents/others/land-grabbing-in-kenya-and-mozambique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s acting as the investments arms of governments have initiated a number of agreements in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the population of the Gulf states is set to double from 30 million in 2000 to 60 million in 2030, their reliance on food imports is set to increase from the current level of 60% of consumption.&lt;ref name=Woertz&gt;{{cite news|last=Woertz |first=E. |title=Gulf food security needs delicate diplomacy |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d916f8e2-08d8-11de-b8b0-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|accessdate=22 August 2011 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development echoed the sentiment of many Gulf leaders in proclaiming, “the whole Arab World needs of cereal, sugar, fodder and other essential foodstuffs could be met by Sudan alone.”&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt;

=== Biofuels ===
[[Biofuel]] production, currently comprising 21% of total land investments, has played a significant, if at times unclear, role. The use and popularity of biofuels has grown over the past decade, corresponding with rising [[oil price]]s and increased [[environmental awareness]]. The total area under biofuel crops more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, expanding to 36 million ha by 2008.&lt;ref name="UNEP 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Towards sustainable production and use of resources assessing biofuels|year=2009|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rise in popularity culminated in [[Renewable Energy Directive|EU Directive 2009/28/EC]] in April 2009, which set 10% mandatory targets for renewable energy use, primarily biofuels, out of the total consumption of fuel for transport, by 2020.&lt;ref name="Graham et al."&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham|first=Alison|title=The Impact of Europe's Policies and Practices on African Agriculture and Food Security |year=2010 |publisher=FIAN|url=http://www.fian.org/resources/documents/others/report-on-land-grabbing/pdf|author2=Sylvain Aubry |author3=Rolf Künnemann |author4=Sofia Suarez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken as a whole, the rise in biofuels popularity, while perhaps beneficial for the environment, sparked a chain reaction by making biofuels production a more attractive than food production and drawing land away from food to biofuel production.

The effect of the rise in popularity in biofuels was two-fold: first, demand for land for biofuel production became a primary driver of land sales in Sub-Saharan Africa; second, demand for biofuels production crowded out supply of traditional food crops worldwide. By crowding out food crops and forcing conversion of existing food-producing land to biofuels, biofuels production had a direct impact on the [[food supply]]/demand balance and consequently the food price crisis. One researcher from the [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] estimated that biofuels had accounted for 30 percent of the increase in weighted average grain prices.&lt;ref name=Rosegrant&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosegrant|first=Mark|title=Biofuels and Grain Prices: Impacts and Policy Responses|year=2008|publisher=Testimony for US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Large-scale investments in land since 2007 have been scrutinized by civil society organizations, researchers, and other organizations because of issues such as [[land insecurity]], local consultation and compensation for land, [[development-induced displacement|displacement]] of local peoples, employment of local people, the process of negotiations between investors and governments, and the environmental consequences of [[industrial agriculture|large-scale agriculture]]. These issues have contributed to critics' characterization of much large-scale investment since 2007 as "land grabbing," irrespective of differences in the types of investments and the ultimate impact that investments have on local populations.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

=== Land insecurity ===
One of the major issues is [[land tenure]]: In a 2003 study, the World Bank estimated that only between 2 and 10 percent of total land in Africa is formally tenured.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; Much of the lack of private ownership is due to government ownership of land as a function of national policy, and also because of complicated procedures for registration of land and a perception by communities that customary systems are sufficient.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; World Bank researchers have found that there existed a strong negative statistical link between land tenure recognition and prospective land acquisitions, with a smaller yet still significant relationship for implemented projects as well.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; They concluded that “lower recognition of land rights increased a country’s attractiveness for land acquisition,” implying that companies have actively sought out areas with low land recognition rights for investment.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

=== Local consultation and compensation ===
While commonly required by law in many host countries, the consultation process between investors and local populations have been criticized for not adequately informing communities of their rights, negotiating powers, and entitlements within land transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, F. (2012). The land grabbers: The new fight over who owns the Earth. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultations have been found extremely problematic due to the fact that they often reach just village chiefs but neglect common villagers and disenfranchised groups. World Bank researchers noted that “a key finding from case studies is that communities were rarely aware of their [[land rights|rights]] and, even in cases where they were, lacked the ability to interact with investors or to explore ways to use their land more productively.”&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; When consultations were even conducted, they often did not produce written agreements and were found to be superficial, glossing over environmental and social issues.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In Ghana and elsewhere, chiefs often negotiated directly with investors without the input from other villagers, taking it upon themselves to sell common land or village land on their own.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Moreover, investors often had obtained approval for their projects before beginning consultations, and lacked any contractual obligation to carry out promises made to villagers.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

There is a [[knowledge gap]] between investors and local populations regarding the land acquisition process, the [[legal enforceability]] of promises made by investors, and other issues. The inability of villagers to see and study the laws and regulations around land sales severely deteriorates communities’ agency in consultations. When consultations do occur with communities, some take place in spans of only two to three months, casting doubt on whether such short time frames can be considered as adequate consultation for such large, wide-reaching, and impactful events.&lt;ref name="Cotula Outlook" /&gt;

An additional concern with consultations is that [[women]] and underrepresented populations are often left outside during the process. Large-scale projects in [[Mozambique]] rarely included women in consultations and never presented official reports and documents for authorization by women.&lt;ref name="Nhantumbo Salomao"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nhantumbo|first=I.|title=Biofuels, land access and rural livelihoods in Mozambique |year=2010|publisher=IIED |location=London |url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12563IIED.pdf|author2=A. Salomao }}&lt;/ref&gt; This holds true when women are the primary workers on the land that is to be leased out to companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duvane |first=L|title=Mozambique Case Study |year=2010 |publisher=2010 Institute for Poverty Land and Agrarian Studies: Regional Workshop on Commercialization of Land in Southern Africa|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, pastoralists and internally displaced people were oftentimes intentionally excluded from negotiations, as investors tried to delegitimize their claims on land.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; This led to a lack of awareness on the part of these vulnerable groups until lease agreements have already been signed to transfer land. This oversight in consultations further disenfranchises previously overlooked communities and worsens power inequities in local villages.

===Displacement===
Another criticism of investment in land is the potential for large-scale [[development-induced displacement|displacement]] of local peoples without adequate [[Financial compensation|compensation]], in either land or money. These displacements often result in [[Population transfer|resettlement]] in marginal lands, loss of livelihoods especially in the case of [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], gender-specific erosion of social networks.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Villagers were most often compensated as according to national guidelines for loss of land, loss of improvements over time on the land, and sometimes future [[harvest]]s.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; However, compensation guidelines vary significantly between countries and depending on the types of projects undertaken. One study by the [[International Institute for Environment and Development|IIED]] concluded that guidelines for compensation given to displaced villagers in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Ghana]] was insufficient to restore livelihoods lost through dislocation.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt;

There are a number of issues with the process of relocating locals to other areas where land is less [[soil fertility|fertile]]. In the process of relocation, often changed or lost are historical methods of farming, existing [[social ties]], sources of income, and livelihoods. This holds drastic impacts especially in the case of women, who rely greatly upon such informal relationships.&lt;ref name="Behrman et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Behrman |first=Julia|title=The Gender Implications of Large-Scale Land Deals |year=2011|publisher=IFPRI |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01056.pdf |author2=Ruth Meinzen-Dick |author3=Agnes Quisumbing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
When not displaced, the conversion of local farmers into [[laborer]]s holds numerous negative consequences for local populations. Most deals are based on the eventual formation of plantation-style farming, whereupon the investing company will own the land and employ locals as laborers in large-scale agricultural plots. The number of jobs created varies greatly dependent on commodity type and style of farming planned.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In spite of this volatility, guarantees of [[job creation]] are rarely, if ever, addressed in contracts. This fact, combined with the intrinsic incentives towards mechanization in [[plantation]]-style production, can lead to much lower employment than originally planned for. When employed, locals are often [[underpaid|paid little]]: In investments by [[Karuturi Global]] in Ethiopia, workers are paid on average under $2 a day, with a minimum wage of 8 [[Ethiopian birr|birr]], or $0.48, per day, both of which are under the World Bank [[poverty limit]] of $2 per day.&lt;ref name=McLure&gt;{{cite news|last=McLure|first=Jason| title=Ethiopian Farms Lure Investor Funds as Workers Live in Poverty |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aeuJT_pSE68c# |accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government negotiations ===
In addition to the lack of coordination between ministries, there is a wide knowledge gap between government-level offices and investors, leading to a rushed and superficial investment review. Many government agencies initially overwhelmed by the deluge of investment proposals failed to properly screen out non-viable proposals.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Due to the knowledge gaps between government agencies and investors, “in most countries it is implicitly presumed that investors will have the right incentive and be the best qualified to assess [[economic viability]],” leading to a lack of reporting requirements or monitoring arrangements, key information on land uses and value of the investment, and checks on economic viability.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; The Sudanese government has been noted as having paid minimal attention to existing land rights and neglecting to conduct any economic analysis on potential projects.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In addition, many countries, including Cambodia, Congo, Sudan, and Ghana, have neglected to catalog and file even general geographical descriptions of land allocation boundaries.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

One addition to many contracts between governments and investors is a Stabilisation Clause, which insulates investors from the effect of changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government’s ability to change any regulations that would have a negative economic impact on the investment.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; While advantageous for businesses, these stabilization clauses would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project.

=== Environmental impact ===
Land investment has been criticized for its implicit endorsement of large-scale [[industrial agriculture]], which relies heavily on costly machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other inputs, over smallholder agriculture.&lt;ref name=Magdoff-MR-2013-11&gt;[http://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs/ Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs] (November 2013), Fred Magdoff, ''[[Monthly Review]],'' Volume 65, Issue 06&lt;/ref&gt;   As foreign investors begin to develop the land, they will, for the most part, start a shift towards [[industrial agriculture|large-scale agriculture]] to improve upon existing “unproductive” agricultural methods. The threat of the conversion of much of Africa’s land to such large-scale agriculture has provoked a severe pushback from many civil society organizations such as [[GRAIN]], [[La Via Campesina]], and other lobbyists for small-scale agriculture.&lt;ref name="Protest FIAN GRAIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fian.org/fileadmin/media/publications/2010_04_StopLandgrabbingNow.pdf|title=Stop Land Grabbing Now!|publisher=FIAN, LRAN, GRAIN|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are exemplified by Ethiopia’s Abera Deressa, who claims that “foreign investors should help boost agricultural output by as much as 40%” throughout Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Butler 2010" /&gt; However, large-scale mechanized agricultural production often entails the use of fertilizers and [[intensive farming]] techniques that have been criticized by numerous civil society actors as extremely [[ecological health|ecologically detrimental]] and [[environmental damage|environmentally harmful]] over the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balehegn|first=Mulubrhan|date=2015-03-04|title=Unintended Consequences: The Ecological Repercussions of Land Grabbing in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|volume=57|issue=2|pages=4–21|doi=10.1080/00139157.2015.1001687|issn=0013-9157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRAIN 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seized: The 2008 land grab for food and financial security|url=http://www.grain.org/article/entries/93-seized-the-2008-landgrab-for-food-and-financial-security|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=GRAIN|date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, such intensive farming threatens to degrade the quality of topsoil and damage local waterways and ecosystems. As such, civil society actors have widely accused land investors for promoting “not agricultural development, much less rural development, but simply agribusiness development.”&lt;ref name="GRAIN 2008" /&gt; This trend towards large-scale agriculture that overrides local knowledge and [[sustainable]] local farming runs directly counter to the recent [[IAASTD]] report, backed by the [[FAO]], [[UNDP]], World Bank, and others, that to increase [[food security]] over the long term, sustainable peasant agriculture must be encouraged and supported.&lt;ref name=IAASTD&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture at Crossroads: International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, Science, and Technology |year=2008 |publisher=IAASTD|url=http://www.agassessment.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neocolonialism ===
Foreign investment in land has been criticized by many civil society actors and individuals as a new realization of [[neocolonialism]], signifying a renewed economic imperialism of developed over developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Fears for the world's poor countries as the rich grab land to grow food |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/03/land-grabbing-food-environment|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed to the acquisitions of large tracts of land for economic profit, with little perceived benefit for local populations or target nations as a whole, as a renewal of the economically exploitative practices of the colonial period.

==Laws and Regulations Concerning Reporting of Foreign Investment in Land==

A 2013 report found no available literature giving recommendations for how the UK could change its laws and regulations to require UK companies investing in land in developing countries to report relevant data.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a"&gt;Walton, O., 2013, [http://partnerplatform.org/?0pj89g19 Laws and Regulations Concerning Reporting of Foreign Investment in Land, Economic and Private Sector Professional Evidence And Applied Knowledge Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher looks at a literature review by [[Global Witness]], the [[Oakland Institute]], and the [[International Land Coalition]] from 2012 which states that there is little sustained focus on the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalwitness"&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, [http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher found most available literature and policy on transparency in land investment focusing on:
*Facilitating community engagement in planning decisions and enhancing community rights
*Upgrading obligations/capacities of host governments to improve regulation of foreign-funded land deals.
*Developing international frameworks to improve transparency in land deals.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found this focus was confirmed by a range of other documents reviewing address international efforts to promote responsible investment in agriculture and recommended the International Working Group paper&lt;ref&gt;International Working Group on the Food Security Pillar of the G20 Multi-Year Action Plan on Development (2011) ‘Options for Promoting Responsible Investment in Agriculture’, Report to the High-Level Development Working Group http://archive.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs//diae_dir_2011-06_G20_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
and Smaller &amp; Mann.&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H. (2009) ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The researcher mentions a report by the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] stating a ‘significant lack of concrete and verifiable’ empirically-based policy and legal work on the issue of foreign investment in agricultural land&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, pp2, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher saw Smaller and Mann&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, pp8, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; note that in many host states like the UK ‘there is either no, or insufficient or unclear domestic law concerning land rights, water rights, pollution controls for intensive agriculture, human health, worker protection and so on.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher did find that international law framework provides hard rights for foreign investors with two primary sources of international law relating to this issue: [[international contracts]], which are commercial in nature; and [[international treaty law]] on investment, with both bodies acting on a commercial perspective and focusing on economic interests of foreign investors, rather than social or environmental dimensions&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He discussed the UN’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights&lt;ref name="business-humanrights"&gt;UN (2011) ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which address the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises and finds the principles do not provide any detailed discussion of the UK case, or of timeframes and costs.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

===Extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas businesses===

The researcher studied a report by [[Global Witness]], the [[Oakland Institute]] and the [[International Land Coalition]] which identifies four key entry points for improving transparency in large-scale land acquisition:&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt;
*transparent land and natural resource planning;
*free, prior and ‘informed’ consent;
*public disclosure of all contractual documentation;
*multi-stakeholder initiatives, independent oversight and grievance mechanisms’
*a range of additional entry points for future policy work and campaigning, which includes addressing the ‘extra-territorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises’.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found the report stresses that ‘further analysis is needed to identify the benefits and opportunities of each entry point, as well as potential limitations, challenges, and risks around future campaigns which would need to be addressed from the start’ and notes that as of early 2013 there is a gap between the extent to which individual states fulfill their obligations to regulate businesses overseas, and ‘the extent to which such regulations cover transparency and information disclosure’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp48 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher found that the UN’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, written by the former UN Special Representative to the Secretary General for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie&lt;ref name="business-humanrights" /&gt;  provide some discussion of how business enterprises need to undertake human rights due diligence suggesting that states ‘should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations’ and notes that ‘at present States are not generally required under international human rights law to regulate the extraterritorial activities of businesses domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He claims that they are not generally prohibited from doing so either, provided there is a recognised jurisdictional basis’&lt;ref&gt;UN (2011) pp7 ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and says the report notes that some states have introduced domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. ‘Examples include requirements on “parent” companies to report on the global operations of the entire enterprise; multilateral soft-law instruments such as the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; and performance standards required by institutions that support overseas investments.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher found other approaches amount to direct extraterritorial legislation and enforcement including criminal regimes that allow for prosecutions based on the nationality of the perpetrator no matter where the offence occurs’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN (2011), pp7, ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He read that the UN’s Guiding Principles&lt;ref name="business-humanrights" /&gt;  propose that ‘contracts should always be publicly disclosed when the public interest is impacted; namely cases where the project presents either large-scale or significant social, economic, or environmental risks or opportunities, or involves the depletion of renewable or non-renewable natural resources’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp30 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He found Global Witness et al.&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt; state that governments and businesses often claim that confidentiality is necessarily to protect commercially sensitive information contained in investment contracts.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

===Other relevant international Principles, Guidelines and Instruments===

The researcher states that the Global Witness et al. paper&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp12 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; details a number of international instruments that ‘create obligations and responsibilities throughout all stages of decision-making around large-scale land investments’,  including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]; the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]; and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found several thematic binding agreements also examined in the report: the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] and the 1994 [[Convention to Combat Desertification]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The UK encourages companies to abide by OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct for multinational corporations operating in or from countries adhering to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, including detailed guidance concerning information disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2011) ‘OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises’, 2011 Edition, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.oecd.org/daf/internationalinvestment/guidelinesformultinationalenterprises/48004323.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However they do not, provide any specific recommendations on land.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher read the Global Witness et al.&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt; report also finds that ‘a number of instruments offer companies the opportunity to associate themselves with a set of principles or goals that demonstrate [[corporate social responsibility]]’ but most of these are largely ‘declarative’.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

Overall, he summaries that the report notes that although these various instruments ‘recognise secrecy and lack of access to information to be a problem, they give almost no detail as to how it should be tackled in practice, nor do any mandatory provisions yet exist to ensure such an implicit aspiration is met’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp19 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information issues ==
In a joint research project between the FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and that “researchers needed to make multiple contacts…to access even superficial and incomplete information.”&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; The World Bank’s own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching individual land acquisitions.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

The European project [http://www.ejolt.org/ EJOLT] (Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade) is building a global map of land grabbing, with the aim to make an interactive online map on this and many other environmental justice issue by 2013. The project also produces in-depth resources on land grabbing, such as [http://www.ejolt.org/2011/10/ejolt-video-on-landgrabbing-in-gambela/ this video on land grabbing in Ethiopia].

== Notable cases ==
In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land, to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted considerable attention there and led to protests against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stwr.org/food-security-agriculture/land-grabbing-the-end-of-sustainable-agriculture.html |title=Land Grabbing: the End of Sustainable Agriculture? |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sudan, numerous large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former GRAPE partner named [[Ilip Cybourg]], garnered attention by playing in ''Rolling Stone''. Ilip, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of Sudan's top civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding Africa and land grabbing) that "the whole place is like one big sewer &amp;mdash; and I'm like a plumber."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Funk|first=McKenzie|title=Meet the New Capitalists of Chaos |url=http://news.haverford.edu/blogs/ourschool/files/2010/06/Capitalists-of-Chaos-Mckenzie-Funk.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leon Botstein''' (born December 14, 1946 in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]]) is a [[Jewish Americans|Jewish-American]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2009/05/29/profile-leon-botstein/ Profile: Leon Botstein], ''Hadassah Magazine'', "Botstein is a proud secular Jew not ambivalent or defensive about his identity. In I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl (Jewish Lights), he writes:  "In Judaism, learning is prayer, for it celebrates the human capacity for language and thought." He waxes nostalgic for the days of "exceptional Jewry," arguing that "Jews have entered the indistinguishable middle class…. We are no longer the people of the book; we are a people of ordinary vulgarity. The real tragedy of American Jewry—and Israel—is that we've used privilege to become absolutely ordinary.""&lt;/ref&gt; [[conducting|conductor]] and scholar, and the President of [[Bard College]].

==Career==
Botstein is the music director and principal conductor of the [[American Symphony Orchestra]] (ASO) and conductor laureate of the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]] (JSO), where he served as music director and principal conductor from 2003-2010. He is also the founder and co-Artistic Director of the [[Bard Music Festival]]. He is a member of the Board of Directors of The After-School Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tascorp.org/ |title=tascorp.org |publisher=tascorp.org |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding educational opportunities for all students. Botstein also serves as the Board Chairman of the [[Central European University]], a graduate-level, English-language university accredited in the United States and Hungary and located in [[Budapest]]. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Open Society Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opensocietyfoundations.org/people/leon-botstein|title=Leon Botstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Austria's [[Grafenegg Festival]], a major international Austrian festival for classical music, appointed Botstein artistic director of the Grafenegg Campus and Academy, effective in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Susan|title=Leon Botstein Adds Grafenegg Festival|url=http://www.musicalamerica.com/news/newsstory.cfm?storyid=36576&amp;categoryid=2&amp;archived=0|website=MusicalAmerica.com|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botstein is the author of ''Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture'' and ''Judentum und Modernitaet''. He graduated at age 16 from the [[The High School of Music and Art|High School of Music and Art]] in [[New York City]], and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in music history. He credits [[David Landes]] and [[Harold Farberman]] as his mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/pictures-institution|title=The Duke of Bard|last=Gregory|first=Alice|date=2014-09-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-25|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botstein became the youngest (or possibly second youngest) college president in U.S. history at age 23, serving from 1970 to 1975 at the now-defunct [[Franconia College]], after which he was named president of [[Bard College]].
[[File:"Intolerance" Performed by the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall (26711512508).jpg|thumb|left|Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra after a performance of ''[[Intolleranza]]'' by [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 2018.]]

As music director of the [[American Symphony Orchestra]], Botstein emerged as a significant proponent of "thematic programming," which attempts to assemble concert programs having a common theme grounded in literature, music history, or art.  He also focused the ASO's programming on the performance of infrequently-performed works by major composers and the best examples of works by lesser-known composers, with a particular emphasis on U.S. premiere performances, many of which have been recorded by the ASO for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASO|url=http://www.americansymphony.org/downloads|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the orchestra's main concert series at [[Carnegie Hall]], Botstein inaugurated the [[Bard Music Festival]] with the participation of the ASO, a summer series which focuses on one composer each summer for an intensive series of concerts, lectures, and panel discussions.  He also presents a series called "Classics Declassified," devoting each program to a piece from the standard orchestral repertory.  Botstein lectures about the piece for about an hour, using the orchestra to provide illustrations for his talk, then performs the entire piece, then opens the floor to questions from the audience directed at him and at members of the orchestra.  This series, originally presented at Columbia University's Miller Theater, proved so popular that it was moved to [[Symphony Space]] for the 2007–2008 season. He also inaugurated an important series of recordings of neglected masterpieces with the Telarc label, using the ASO and a variety of European orchestras. In addition to his work with the ASO and JSO, Botstein has performed as a guest conductor with, among many others, the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[New York City Opera]], [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[NDR Symphony Orchestra]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called 2013's [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] performance under Botstein "the all-around most compelling performance of anything I've heard all summer at the Bowl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swed|first=Mark|title=Music review: Botstein has last laugh with L.A. Phil at the Bowl|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-botstein-hollywood-bowl-review-20130829|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2013, Botstein also conducted the Sinfónica Juvenil de Caracas in Venezuela and Japan, making him the first non-Venezuelan conductor invited by El Sistema to conduct on a tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezuelasinfonica.com/eventos/oportunidad-unica-la-sinfonica-juvenil-de-caracas-dirigida-por-leon-botstein|title=Oportunidad única!… la Sinfónica Juvenil de Caracas dirigida por Leon Botstein|work=Venezuela Sinfónica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many live recordings of his performances, including the prestigious operas performed every summer during the [[Bard SummerScape]] festival, are widely available on compact disc and on Internet sites such as [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Spotify]].

Botstein's many books, essays, and articles on music and culture have earned him a reputation as a leading musicologist. His essays in the [[Princeton University Press]] series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bfs.html |title=Princeton University Press Books in The Bard Music Festival |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of books devoted to composers featured during the annual [[Bard Music Festival]] exemplify his efforts to address the complex social, political, and artistic influences and context of his subject. Of his recent essay in this series, on [[Jean Sibelius]], the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that Sibelius's "critical reputation is epitomized by Leon Botstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=David|title=Refuge in the Forest|newspaper=Times Literary Supplement|date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written extensively about music and culture in 19th-century Vienna, Jewish European culture, and modernism. His book ''Judentum und Modernität: Essays zur Rolle der Juden in der deutschen und österreichischen Kultur, 1848–1938'' was written in German and has been translated into Russian.

Botstein's unique position as a leading music scholar, performer, and founder and coartistic director of the [[Bard Music Festival]] has enabled him to have an extraordinary impact on both music scholarship and performance. As the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'''s Barrymore Laurence Scherer observes, "the Bard Music Festival…no longer needs an introduction. Under the provocative guidance of the conductor-scholar Leon Botstein, it has long been one of the most intellectually stimulating of all American summer festivals and frequently is one of the most musically satisfying. Each year, through discussions by major scholars and illustrative concerts often programmed to overflowing, Bard audiences have investigated the oeuvre of a major composer in the context of the society, politics, literature, art and music of his times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scherer|first=Barrymore|title=Undeniable Influence|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320190510992778?KEYWORDS=%E2%80%9Cone+of+the+most+intellectually+stimulating+of+all+American+summer+festivals%E2%80%9D|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bard College==
Botstein became Bard College's 14th and current president in 1975. Botstein, who is also Bard's Leon Levy Professor in the Arts and Humanities, has been a pioneer in linking the liberal arts and higher education to public secondary schools. In 1979, Botstein oversaw Bard's acquisition of [[Bard College at Simon's Rock]], the oldest [[early college entrance program]] and the only [[NEASC|accredited]] [[Bachelor's degree|four-year]] early college to date. Along with administrators from Simon's Rock, he was instrumental in the founding of New York City's [[Bard High School Early College]] in 2001. During Botstein's 40-year tenure, one of the [[List of longest serving higher education presidents|longest in the nation]], Bard has established eight graduate schools, the [[Bard College Conservatory of Music]], and the [[Levy Economics Institute]] of Bard College. With the purchase of the {{convert|380|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Montgomery Place]] estate to the south of the college in 2016, Bard's campus consists of nearly 1,000 park-like acres in the Hudson River Valley.

Botstein has greatly extended Bard's reach internationally, leading the creation of new programs on several continents. In partnership with [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Bard established in 1997 the first liberal arts college program in Russia, [[Smolny College]], which offers dual degrees from Saint Petersburg State University and Bard. In 1998, the Institute for International Liberal Education (IILE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iile.bard.edu/ |title=iile.bard.edu |publisher=iile.bard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was formed at Bard to advance the theory and practice of international liberal arts education. Bard's other international programs include the Al-Quds Bard Partnership,&lt;ref name="alqudsbard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alqudsbard.org/ |title=alqudsbard.org |publisher=alqudsbard.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration in Jerusalem between Bard College and [[Al-Quds University]] that was established in 2008 to improve the Palestinian education system; the International Human Rights Exchange (IHRE);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihre.org/ |title=ihre.org |publisher=ihre.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Program in International Education (PIE); [[Bard College Berlin]]: A Liberal Arts University; and joint programs with [[American University of Central Asia]] and [[Central European University]].

Botstein has also led Bard to become a regional and national leader in art and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320190510992778?KEYWORDS=%E2%80%9Cone+of+the+most+intellectually+stimulating+of+all+American+summer+festivals%E2%80%9D | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Undeniable Influence | date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Bard opened the [[Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture]], which includes the Hessel Museum of Art. In 1993, Bard opened the [[Bard Graduate Center]]: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture in Manhattan. In 2003, the college opened the [[Frank Gehry]]-designed [[Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts]] at Bard College, which houses two theaters, as well as dance and theater studios that provide rehearsal space for undergraduates. The Fisher Center is the home of the [[Bard Music Festival]] as well as [[Bard SummerScape]], an annual festival of music, film, dance, and drama.

In February 2009, Botstein was accused by [[Joel Kovel]] of terminating Kovel from his position as professor at Bard in retaliation for the latter's political views, an accusation which Botstein denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/02/19/kovel |title=''Anti-Israel Prof Loses Post at Bard |publisher= Inside Higher Ed |date=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joelkovel.org/#bardstatement |title=Statement of Joel Kovel Regarding His Termination from Bard College |publisher=Joelkovel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Botstein's written work includes ''Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture'', in which he argues that high school-level education after the tenth grade should be abolished in favor of a national early college system, as well as several other books in the fields of [[musicology]] and [[education]]. He is editor of [[The Musical Quarterly]] and a frequent contributor to periodicals focusing on music and education.

]]
In addition to [[English language|English]], literature has been written in a wide variety of [[Languages of the United Kingdom|other languages in Britain]], that is the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]] (the [[Isle of Man]] and the Bailiwicks of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] are not part of the [[United Kingdom]], but are closely associated with it, being [[British Crown Dependencies]]). This includes literature in [[Scottish Gaelic literature|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh]], [[Latin literature in Britain|Latin]], [[Cornish literature|Cornish]], [[Anglo-Norman literature|Anglo-Norman]], [[Guernésiais]], [[Jèrriais literature|Jèrriais]], [[Manx literature|Manx]], and [[Irish literature|Irish]] (but only [[Irish language in Northern Ireland| in Northern Ireland]] after 1922). Literature in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon (Old English)]] is treated as [[English literature]] and literature in [[Scots language|Scots]] as [[Scottish literature]].

==British identity==
The nature of [[Britishness|British identity]] has changed over time. The island that contains [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] has been known as [[Great Britain|Britain]] from the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Pliny the Elder]] (c. AD 23–79).&lt;ref name=PlinyE(4.41)&gt;Pliny the Elder's ''Naturalis Historia'' Book IV. Chapter XLI [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+4.41&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138 Latin text] and
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D30 English translation], numbered Book 4, Chapter 30,
at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original inhabitants spoke mainly various [[Celtic languages]], [[English language|English]] as the national language had its beginnings with the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion]] of c.450 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Casey 1988:367–98 "The Gallic Chronicle Restored: a Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain"&lt;/ref&gt;

The various constituent parts of the present [[United Kingdom]] joined at different times. Wales was annexed by the [[Kingdom of England]] under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Acts of Union]] of 1536 and 1542, and it was not until 1707 with [[Treaty of Union|a treaty]] between England and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], that the Kingdom of England became the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. This merged in 1801 with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Until fairly recent times Celtic languages were spoken in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and still survive, especially in parts of Wales

Subsequently the impact of [[Irish nationalism]] led to the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island of Ireland]] in 1921, which means that literature of the [[Republic of Ireland]] is not British, although literature from [[Northern Ireland]], is both Irish and British.&lt;ref name=Deane&gt;{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Seamus|title=A Short History of Irish Literature|year=1986|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=0091613612}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the relationship between England and Wales and Scotland, has changed, through the establishment of parliaments in both those countries, in addition to the British parliament in London.

==Early Britain: 450 – 1100 A.D.==
{{main article|Anglo-Latin literature|Celtic literature|Scottish literature in the Middle Ages|Welsh language literature|Early Irish literature|Old Norse literature}}

[[Latin literature]], mostly ecclesiastical, continued to be written in the centuries following the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire]] at the beginning of the fifth-century, including [[Chronicle]]s by [[Bede]] (672/3–735),  ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', and [[Gildas]] (c. 500–570),  ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]''. 

Various [[Celtic language]]s were spoken by many of British people at this time and among the most important written works that have survived are  ''[[Y Gododdin]]'' i and the [[Mabinogion]]. ''Y Gododdin'' is a medieval [[Welsh language|Welsh]] poem consisting of a series of [[elegy|elegies]] to the men of the [[Britons (historical)|Britonnic]] kingdom of [[Gododdin]] and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the [[Angles]] of [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] and [[Bernicia]] at a place named ''[[Battle of Catraeth|Catraeth]]'' in c. AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard [[Aneirin]], and survives only in one manuscript, known as the [[Book of Aneirin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1969)—the work is titled ''The Gododdin: the oldest Scottish poem''.&lt;/ref&gt; The name [[Mabinogion]] is a convenient label for a collection eleven [[prose]] stories collated from two [[medieval Welsh]] [[manuscript]]s known as the [[White book of Rhydderch]] (''Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch'') (c. 1350) and the [[Red Book of Hergest]] (''Llyfr Coch Hergest'') (1382–1410). They are written in Middle Welsh, the common literary language between the end of the eleventh century and the fourteenth century. They include the four tales that form Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi ("The Four Branches of the Mabinogi"). The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs, and early medieval historical traditions.

From the 8th to the 15th centuries, [[Viking]]s and [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlers and their descendents [[Scandinavian Scotland|colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland]]. Some [[Old Norse poetry]] survives relating to this period, including the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''  an historical narrative of the history of the [[Orkney Islands]], from their capture by the Norwegian king in the ninth century onwards until about 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orkneyjar.com/history/|title=Orkneyjar - The History and Archaeology of the Orkney Islands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Norman conquest]] in 1066, the [[Norman language]] became the language of England's nobility. During the whole of the 12th century the [[Anglo-Norman language]] (the variety of Norman used in England) shared with [[Latin]] the distinction of being the [[literary language]] of England, and it was in use at the court until the 14th century. It was not until the reign of Henry VII that [[English language|English]] became the native tongue of the kings of England.

Works were still written in Latin and include [[Gerald of Wales]]'s late-12th-century book on his beloved Wales, ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae]]'', and following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, [[Anglo-Norman literature]] developed in the Anglo-Norman realm introducing literary trends from [[Continental Europe]], such as the ''[[chanson de geste]]''. However, the indigenous development of Anglo-Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental [[Oïl languages|Oïl]] literature.&lt;ref name=Companion&gt;''Language and Literature'', Ian Short, in ''A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'', edited Christopher Harper-Bill and Elisabeth van Houts, Woodbridge 2003, {{ISBN|0-85115-673-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] was one of the major figures in the [[English historians in the Middle Ages|development of British history]] and the popularity for the tales of [[King Arthur]]. He is best known for his chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (History of the Kings of Britain) of 1136, which spread [[Celtic mythology|Celtic motifs]] to a wider audience. [[Wace]] (c. 1110 – after 1174), who wrote in [[Norman-French]], is the earliest known poet from [[Jersey]], also developed the [[Arthurian legend]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, ed., xiii;&lt;/ref&gt;) At the end of the 12th century, [[Layamon]] in ''[[Layamon's Brut|Brut]]'' adapted Wace to make the first English language work to use the legends of [[King Arthur]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. 

[[Early English Jewish literature]] developed after the Norman Conquest with Jewish settlement in England. [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] is known chiefly as the author of a 13th-century set of over a hundred fables, called ''Mishle Shualim'', (Fox Fables).&lt;ref name="Adventures in Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adiphiljewish2.htm#Berachyah |title=Adventures in Philosophy: A Brief History of Jewish Philosophy |publisher=Radicalacademy.com |accessdate=6 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901205624/http://www.radicalacademy.com/adiphiljewish2.htm |archivedate=1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Jewish literature in mediaeval England ended with the [[Edict of Expulsion]] of 1290.

The multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of [[John Gower]] (c. 1330 – October 1408). A contemporary of [[William Langland]] and a personal friend of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], Gower is remembered primarily for three major works, the ''Mirroir de l'Omme'', ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', and ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', three long poems written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], Latin and, Middle English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gower, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Scottish writers from the 15th century include [[Robert Henryson|Henrysoun]], [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]], [[Gavin Douglas|Douglas]] and [[David Lyndsay|Lyndsay]], wrote in [[Middle Scots]], often simply called English, the dominant language of Scotland.

In the [[Cornish language]] ''Passhyon agan Arloedh'' ("The Passion of our Lord"), a poem of 259 eight-line verses written in 1375, is one of the earliest surviving works of [[Cornish literature]]. The most important work of literature surviving from the Middle Cornish period is ''An Ordinale Kernewek'' ("The Cornish [[Ordinalia]]"), a 9000-line religious drama composed around the year 1400. Three plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]] have survived from this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26192/26192-h/26192-h.htm A Handbook of the Cornish Language, by Henry Jenner] A [[Project Gutenberg]] eBook;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590 A brief history of the Cornish language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225172227/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590 |date=2008-12-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Elizabethan literature|Jacobean era literature}}
The [[Global spread of the printing press|spread of printing]] affected the transmission of literature across Britain and Ireland. The first book printed in English, [[William Caxton]]'s own translation of ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]]'', was printed abroad in 1473, to be followed by the establishment of the first printing press in England in 1474. The establishment of a printing press in Scotland under royal patent from [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature.&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp26-9&gt;P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84384-096-0}}, pp. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The first printing press in Ireland followed later in 1551. Although the first book in Welsh to be printed was produced by [[John Prise]] in 1546, restrictions on printing meant that only clandestine presses, such as that of Robert Gwyn who published ''Y Drych Cristionogawl'' in 1586/1587, could operate in Wales until 1695. The first legal printing press to be set up in Wales was in 1718 by Isaac Carter.&lt;ref name=WalesCompanion&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Meic|title=The New Companion to the Literature of Wales|year=1998|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=0708313833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed work in Manx dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book [[catechism]] in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson. Printing arrived even later in other parts of Britain and Ireland: the first printing press in Jersey was set up by Mathieu Alexandre in 1784.&lt;ref name=Balleine&gt;{{cite book|title=Balleine's History of Jersey|year=1998|publisher=Société Jersiaise|isbn=1860770657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest datable text in [[Manx language|Manx]] (preserved in 18th-century manuscripts), a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of Christianity, dates to the 16th century at the latest.

The [[Elizabethan era|reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England (1558–1603)]] and [[Jacobean era| of King James I (1603–162)]] ([[James VI of Scotland]]), saw the development of Britishness in literature. In anticipation of James VI's expected inheritance of the English throne, court [[masque]]s in England were already developing the new literary imagery of a united "Great Britain", sometimes delving into Roman and Celtic sources.&lt;ref name="British Identities"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Identities and English Renaissance Literature|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521189682}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Camden]]'s ''[[Britannia (Camden)|Britannia]]'', a county by county description of Great Britain and Ireland, was an influential work of [[chorography]]: a study relating landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. [[Britannia]] came to be viewed as the personification of Britain, in imagery that developed during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

The Renaissance in Wales was marked by humanism and scholarship. The [[Welsh language]], its grammar and lexicography, was studied for the first time and biblical studies flourished. Welsh writers such as [[John Owen (epigrammatist)|John Owen]] and [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] wrote in Latin or English to communicate their ideas outside Wales, but the humanists were unsuccessful in opening the established practices of professional Welsh poets to Renaissance influences.&lt;ref name=WalesCompanion /&gt; From the Reformation until the 19th century most literature in the Welsh language was religious in character. [[Morgan Llwyd]]'s ''Llyfr y Tri Aderyn'' ("The Book of the Three Birds") (1653) took the form of a dialogue between an eagle (representing secular authority, particularly Cromwell); a dove (representing the Puritans); and a raven (representing the [[Church of England|Anglican]] establishment).

===The Reformation and vernacular literature===
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the translation of [[liturgy]] and Bible into vernacular languages provided new literary models. The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the ''[[Authorized King James Version]]'' of the Bible have been hugely influential. The King James Bible, one of the biggest translation projects in the history of English up to this time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. 

The earliest surviving examples of Cornish prose are ''Pregothow Treger'' (The Tregear Homilies), a set of 66 [[sermon]]s translated from English by John Tregear 1555–1557.

In 1567 [[William Salesbury]]'s Welsh translations of the New Testament and Book of Common prayer were published. [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan's]] translation of the whole Bible followed in 1588 and remained the standard [[Bible translations into Welsh|Welsh Bible]] until well into the 20th century.

The first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by [[Nicholas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory)|Nicholas Walsh]], [[Bishop of Ossory]], continued by John Kearney (Treasurer of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's, Dublin]]), his assistant, and [[Nehemiah Donnellan|Dr. Nehemiah Donellan]], Archbishop of Tuam, and finally completed by William O'Domhnuill ([[William Daniel (archbishop)|William Daniell]], Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebc.com/Projects/odomhnuills_nt.htm William O'Domhnuill's (Daniel's) Translation of the New Testament into Irish]. Retrieved on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by [[William Bedell]] (1571–1642), [[Bishop of Kilmore]], who completed his translation within the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles the First]]. However, it was not published until 1685, in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638–1713), [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasures of the Irish Language: Some early examples from Dublin City Public Libraries |url=http://www.dublinheritage.ie/historic_collections/irish_language_treasures.html |year=2006 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309074657/http://www.dublinheritage.ie/historic_collections/irish_language_treasures.html |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedell's Irish Old Testament|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/specialcollections/bible/european-bible/bedells-irish-old-testament|publisher=[[King's College London]]|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Book of Common Order]]'' was translated into Scottish Gaelic by [[Séon Carsuel]] (John Carswell), [[Bishop of the Isles]], and printed in 1567. This is considered the first printed book in Scottish Gaelic though the language resembles classical Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Heal Reformation in Britain and Ireland – Page 282 2005 "In Irish the catechism long preceded the printing of the New Testament, while in Scottish Gaelic the Form of Common Order was printed in 1567, the full Bible not until 1801.

Those difficulties were real and by no means imaginary or due to fastidious pedantry on Kirk's part."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Common Prayer was translated into French by Jerseyman Jean Durel, later Dean of Windsor, and published for use in the Channel Islands in 1663 as Anglicanism was established as the state religion after the Stuart Restoration.

The Book of Common Prayer and [[Bible translations into Manx|Bible were translated into Manx]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. The printing of ''prayers for the poor families'' was projected by [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Thomas Wilson]] in a memorandum of Whit-Sunday 1699, but was not carried out until 30 May 1707, the date of issue of his ''Principles and Duties of Christianity ... in English and Manks, with short and plain directions and prayers'', 1707. This was the first book published in Manx, and is often styled the ''Manx Catechism''. ''The Gospel of St. Matthew'' was translated, with the help of his vicars-general in 1722 and published in 1748 under the sponsorship of his successor as bishop, [[Mark Hildesley]]. The remaining Gospels and the Acts were also translated into Manx under his supervision, but not published. Hildesley printed the New Testament and the Book of Common Prayer, translated, under his direction, by the clergy of the diocese, and the Old Testament was finished and transcribed in December 1772, at the time of the bishop's death.&lt;ref name="Hildesley"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hildesley, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manx Bible established a standard for written Manx. A tradition of Manx ''carvals'', religious songs or [[Carol (music)|carols]], developed. Religious literature was common, but secular writing much rarer.

Translations of parts of the [[Bible translations into Cornish|Bible into Cornish]] have existed since the 17th century. The early works involved the translation of individual passages, chapters or books of the Bible

===Latin literature===
Latin continued in use as a language of learning, long after the [[Reformation]] had established the vernacular as the liturgical language. In Scotland, Latin as a literary language thrived into the 17th century as Scottish writers writing in Latin were able to engage with their audiences on an equal basis in a prestige language without feeling hampered by their less confident handling of English.&lt;ref name=ScotlandsBooks /&gt;

''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is a work of fiction and [[political philosophy]] by [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535) published in 1516. The book, written in [[Latin]], is a [[frame narrative]] primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, [[sociology|social]] and political customs. ''[[New Atlantis]]'' is a [[utopian]] novel by [[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), published in Latin (as ''Nova Atlantis'') in 1624 and in English in 1627. In this work, Bacon portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge, expressing his aspirations and ideals for humankind. The novel depicts the creation of a utopian land where "generosity and enlightenment, dignity and splendour, piety and public spirit" are the commonly held qualities of the inhabitants of the mythical Bensalem. The plan and organisation of his ideal college, [[Salomon's House]] (or Solomon's House), envisioned the modern research university in both applied and pure sciences.

Scotsman [[George Buchanan]] (1506–1582) was the Renaissance writer from Britain (and Ireland) who had the greatest international reputation, being considered the finest Latin poet since classical times.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Roderick|title=The Literature of Scotland|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills|isbn=9780333666647}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he wrote mostly in Latin, his works travelled across Europe as did he himself. His Latin paraphrases of the Hebrew Psalms (composed while Buchanan was imprisoned by the Inquisition in Portugal) remained in print for centuries and were used into the 19th century for the purposes of studying Latin
Amongst English poets who wrote poems in Latin in the 17th century were [[George Herbert]] (1593–1633) (who also wrote poems in Greek), and [[John Milton]] (1608–74).

Philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''Elementa Philosophica de Cive'' (1642–1658) was in Latin. However, things were changing and by about 1700 the growing movement for the use of national languages (already found earlier in literature and the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] religious movement) had reached academia, and an example of the transition is [[Isaac Newton]]'s writing career, which began in [[New Latin]] and ended in English: ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in Latin ''[[Opticks]]'', 1704, in English.

==The Restoration: 1660–1700==

[[Iain Lom]] (c. 1624 – c. 1710) was a Royalist Scottish Gaelic poet appointed poet laureate in Scotland by Charles II at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]]. He delivered a eulogy for the coronation, and remained loyal to the Stuarts after 1688, opposing the [[Williamite]]s and later, in his vituperative ''Oran an Aghaidh an Aonaidh'', the 1707 Union of the Parliaments.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; 

''[[Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin]]'' is an account of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] which "reflected the Ulster Catholic point of view" written by [[Tarlach Ó Mealláin]]. 

[[Nicholas Boson]] (1624–1708) wrote three significant texts in Cornish, ''Nebbaz gerriau dro tho Carnoack'' (A Few Words about Cornish) between 1675 and 1708; ''Jowan Chy-an-Horth, py, An try foynt a skyans'' (John of Chyannor, or, The three points of wisdom), published by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707, though written earlier; and ''The Dutchess of Cornwall's Progress'', partly in English, now known only in fragments. The first two are the only known surviving Cornish prose texts from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornish writings of the Boson family: Nicholas, Thomas and John Boson, of Newlyn, circa 1660 to 1730'', Edited with translations and notes by [[O.

In Scotland, after the 17th century, [[anglicisation]] increased, though [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] was still spoken by the vast majority of the population, and [[Scottish Gaelic]] by a minority. At the time, many of the oral [[Border ballads|ballads from the borders]] and the North East were written down. The 17th century probably also saw the composition in [[Orkney]] of the only original literary work in the [[Norn language]], a ballad called "[[Hildina]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Michael |date=1984 |chapter=Orkney and Shetland Norn |editor1-last=Trudgill |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-link=Peter Trudgill |title=Language in the British Isles |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=358 |isbn=0521284090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers of the period include [[Robert Sempill]] (c. 1595 – 1665), Lady Wardlaw and Lady [[Grizel Baillie]].

==18th century==
The Union of the Parliaments of Scotland and England in 1707 to form a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the creation of a joint state by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] had little impact on the literature of England nor on national consciousness among English writers. The situation in Scotland was different: the desire to maintain a cultural identity while partaking of the advantages offered by the English literary market and English literary standard language led to what has been described as the "invention of British literature" by Scottish writers. English writers, if they considered Britain at all, tended to assume it was merely England writ large; Scottish writers were more clearly aware of the new state as a "cultural amalgam comprising more than just England".&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Robert|title=Devolving English Literature|year=1992|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198119550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellis Wynne]]'s ''Gweledigaetheu y Bardd Cwsc'' ('Visions of the Sleeping Bard'), first published in London in 1703, is regarded as a Welsh language classic. It is generally said that no better model exists of such 'pure' idiomatic Welsh, before writers had become influenced by English style and method.

A mover in the classical revival of Welsh literature in the 18th century was [[Lewis Morris (1701–1765)|Lewis Morris]], one of the founders in 1751 of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]], a Welsh literary society in London—at that time the most important centre of Welsh publishing.&lt;ref name=WalesCompanion /&gt; He set out to counter the trend among patrons of Welsh literature to turn towards English culture. He attempted to recreate a classic school of Welsh poetry with his support for [[Goronwy Owen (poet)|Goronwy Owen]] and other Augustans. Goronwy Owen's plans for a Miltonic epic were never achieved, but influenced the aims of eisteddfodau competitions through the 19th century.&lt;ref name=WhenWales&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gwyn A.|title=When was Wales?|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0140225897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Gaelic [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] figure [[Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair]] compiled the first secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be printed: ''Leabhar a Theagasc Ainminnin'' (1741), a Gaelic-English glossary. The second secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be published was his poetry collection ''Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich'' (The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Language). Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair was the most overtly nationalist poet in Gaelic of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=ScotlandsBooks&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Robert|title=Scotland's Books|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140299403}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by James Thomson's ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' as well as by Gaelic "village poets" such as Iain Mac Fhearchair (John MacCodrum). As part of the [[oral literature]] of the Highlands, few of the works of such village poets were published at the time, although some have been collected since.&lt;ref name=ScotlandsBooks /&gt;

Scottish Gaelic poets produced laments on the Jacobite defeats of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. [[Mairghread nighean Lachlainn]] and [[Catriona Nic Fhearghais]] are among woman poets who reflected on the crushing effects on traditional Gaelic culture of the aftermath of the Jacobite uprisings. A consequent sense of desolation pervaded the works of Scottish Gaelic writers such as [[Dugald Buchanan|Dughall Bochanan]] which mirrored many of the themes of the [[graveyard poets]] writing in England.&lt;ref name=ScotlandsBooks /&gt; A legacy of Jacobite verse was later compiled (and adapted) by [[James Hogg]] in his ''Jacobite Reliques'' (1819).

In the [[Scots language|Scots]]-speaking areas of [[Ulster]] there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These included [[Alexander Montgomerie]]'s ''The Cherrie and the Slae'' in 1700, over a decade later an edition of poems by [[Sir David Lindsay]], and nine printings of [[Allan Ramsay (1686–1758)|Allan Ramsay]]'s ''The Gentle shepherd'' between 1743 and 1793.

==19th century==
The Welsh novel in English starts with "''[[The adventures and vagaries of Twm Shon Catti|The Adventures and Vagaries of Twm Shon Catti]]''" (1828) by T. J. Ll. Prichard, and novelists following him developed two important genres: the [[industrial novel]] and the rural romance. Serial fiction in Welsh had been appearing from 1822 onwards, but the work to be recognisable as the first novel in Welsh was William Ellis Jones' 1830 "''Y Bardd, neu y Meudwy Cymreig''". This was a moralistic work, as were many of the productions of the time. The first major novelist in the Welsh language was [[Daniel Owen]] (1836–1895), author of works such as ''[[Rhys Lewis (novel)|Rhys Lewis]]'' (1885) and ''[[Enoc Huws]]'' (1891).&lt;ref name=WalesCompanion /&gt;

The first novel in [[Scottish Gaelic]] was John MacCormick's ''[[Dùn Aluinn|Dùn-Àluinn, no an t-Oighre 'na Dhìobarach]]'', which was serialised in the ''People's Journal'' in 1910, before publication in book form in 1912. The publication of a second Scottish Gaelic novel, ''An t-Ogha Mòr'' by Angus Robertson, followed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/4586/1/09kidd.pdf |title=The forgotten first: John Maccormick's DÙN-ÀLUINN |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]]'s Jèrriais tales of Bram Bilo, an innocent abroad in Paris, were an immediate success in Jersey in 1889 and went through a number of reprintings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Ewen MacLachlan]] (Gaelic: Eoghan MacLachlainn) (1775–1822) was a Scots poet of this period who translated the first eight books of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] into [[Scottish Gaelic]]. He also composed and published his own ''Gaelic Attempts in Verse'' (1807) and ''Metrical Effusions'' (1816), and contributed greatly to the 1828 Gaelic–English Dictionary.

[[Denys Corbet]] published collections of Guernésiais poems ''Les Feuilles de la Forêt'' (1871) and ''Les Chànts du draïn rimeux'' (1884), and also brought out an annual poetry anthology 1874–1877, similar to [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]]'s annual in Jersey 1868–1875.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[File:Plaque poetry Writers Square Belfast Robert Huddlestone.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] poetry, [[Robert Huddlestone]] (1814–1887) in paving, Writers' Square, Belfast]]
Increased [[literacy]] in rural and outlying areas and wider access to publishing through, for example, local newspapers encouraged regional literary development as the 19th century progressed. Some writers in lesser-used languages and dialects of the islands gained a literary following outside their native regions, for example [[William Barnes]] (1801–86) in [[Dorset]], [[George Métivier]] (1790–1881) in [[Guernsey]] and [[Robert Pipon Marett]] (1820–84) in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''La Grève de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 {{ISBN|2-905385-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:George Métivier.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[George Métivier]] (1790–1881), Guernsey's "national poet"]]
George Métivier published ''Rimes Guernesiaises'', a collection of poems in [[Guernésiais]] and French in 1831 and ''Fantaisies Guernesiaises'' in 1866. Métivier's poems had first appeared in newspapers from 1813 onward, but he spent time in Scotland in his youth where he became familiar with the Scots literary tradition although he was also influenced by [[Occitan literature]]. The first printed anthology of Jèrriais poetry, ''Rimes Jersiaises'', was published in 1865.

The so-called "[[Cranken Rhyme]]" produced by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of [[Boswednack]], one of the last people with some traditional knowledge of the language,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Berresford Ellis|Ellis, P. B.]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=davey+zennor#v=onepage&amp;q=davey%20zennor&amp;f=false The Cornish language and its literature]''; p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; may be the last piece of traditional Cornish literature.

[[John Ceiriog Hughes]] desired to restore simplicity of diction and emotional sincerity and do for Welsh poetry what Wordsworth and Coleridge did for English poetry.

[[Edward Faragher]] (1831–1908) has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. He wrote poetry, reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and translations of selected [[Aesop]]'s Fables.

The development of Irish literary culture was encouraged in the late 19th and early 20th century by the [[Irish Literary Revival]] (see also The [[Celtic Revival]]), which was supported by [[William Butler Yeats]] (1865–1939), [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]], and [[John Millington Synge]]. The Revival stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature. This was a nationalist movement that also encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of Irish, as distinct from British culture. While drama was an important component of this movement, it also included prose and poetry.

==20th century==
[[Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna]] was a Scottish Gaelic poet who served in the First World War, and as a [[war poet]] described the use of poison gas in his poem ''Òran a' Phuinnsuin'' ("Song of the Poison"), but is perhaps most widely known for his love poem ''An Eala Bhàn'' ("The White Swan"). Welsh poet [[Hedd Wyn]], who was killed in World War I although producing comparatively few war poems as such,&lt;ref name=WalesCompanion /&gt; was later the subject of an Oscar-nominated Welsh film. ''[[In Parenthesis]]'', an [[epic poem]] by [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] first published in 1937, is a notable work of the [[World War I in literature|literature of the First World War]], that was influenced by Welsh traditions, despite Jones being born in England. Poetry reflecting life on the home-front was also published; Guernésiais writer [[Thomas Henry Mahy]]'s collection ''Dires et Pensées du Courtil Poussin'', published in 1922, contained some of his observational poems published in ''La Gazette de Guernesey'' during the war.

In the late 19th century and early twentieth-century, [[Welsh language literature|Welsh literature]] began to reflect the way the Welsh language was increasingly becoming a political symbol. Two important literary nationalists were [[Saunders Lewis]] (1893–1985) and [[Kate Roberts (author)|Kate Roberts]] (1891–1985), both of whom began publishing in the 1920s. Kate Roberts' and Saunders Lewis's careers continued after World War II and they both were among the foremost Welsh-language authors of the twentieth century.

The year 1922 marked a significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland, with the setting up of the [[Irish Free State]] in the predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] South, while the predominantly Protestant [[Northern Ireland]] remained part of the United Kingdom. Nationalist movements in Britain, especially in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], also significantly influenced writers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Referenda held in Wales and in Scotland eventually resulted in the establishment of a form of self-government in both countries.

The [[Scottish Gaelic Renaissance]] (Scottish Gaelic: ''Ath-Bheòthachadh na Gàidhlig'') is a continuing movement concerning the revival of the [[Scottish Gaelic language]]. Although the Scottish Gaelic language had been facing gradual decline in the number of speakers since the late 19th century, the number of young fluent Gaelic speakers is rising due to Gaelic-medium education.&lt;ref name=www.scotsman.com&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/royalnationalmod/Mods-fluent-youth-speaks-volumes.3471169.jp], Scotsman,2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has its origins in the [[Scottish Renaissance]], especially in the work of [[Sorley MacLean]], [[George Campbell Hay]], [[Derick Thomson]] and [[Iain Crichton Smith]]. [[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]] is sometimes seen as being a product of this renaissance. Although many of the products of the Renaissance are in poetry, or in traditional music, many such as MacLean and [[Iain Crichton Smith]], and more recently [[Aonghas MacNeacail]] have blended these with modern international styles.

==21st century literature==
Contemporary writers in Scottish Gaelic include [[Aonghas MacNeacail]], and [[Angus Peter Campbell]] who, besides two Scottish Gaelic poetry collections, has produced two Gaelic novels: ''An Oidhche Mus Do Sheol Sinn'' (2003) and ''Là a' Deanamh Sgeil Do Là'' (2004). A collection of short stories ''P'tites Lures Guernésiaises'' (in Guernésiais with parallel English translation) by various writers was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''P'tites Lures Guernésiaises'', edited Hazel Tomlinson, Jersey 2006, {{ISBN|1-903341-47-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006 [[Brian Stowell]]'s ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' (''The vampire murders'') was published—the first full-length novel in Manx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomonline.co.im/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1143&amp;ArticleID=1397570 |title=''Isle of Man Today'' article on ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' |publisher=Iomonline.co.im |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826083707/http://www.iomonline.co.im/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1143&amp;ArticleID=1397570 |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some production of [[modern literature in Irish]] in Northern Ireland.

The theatrical landscape has been reconfigured, moving from a single national theatre at the end of the twentieth-century to four as a result of the devolution of cultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dickson|first=Andrew|title=Edinburgh festival 2011: where National Theatres meet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/02/edinburgh-national-theatre-wales-scotland|accessdate=4 November 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the revival of [[Cornish literature|Cornish]] there have been newer works written in the language. The first full translation of the Bible into [[Bible translations into Cornish|Cornish]] was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;An Beybel Sans: The Holy Bible in Cornish [http://www.evertype.com/books/beybel.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Telugu Malaysians''' or '''Malaysian Telugus''' ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]: Orang Telugu Malaysia), ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: 
మలేషియా తెలుగువారు) consists of people of full or partial [[Telugu people|Telugu]] descent who were born in or immigrated to [[Malaysia]]. Most of [[Malaysia]]n Telugus today are 4th or 5th generation who migrated during the colonial period. While most of current Malaysian Telugu ancestors originated from what is now [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] (then known as Madras state), substantial number of them originated from area of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Bengal]] state. While most Telugus come to Malaysia as labourers, some were professionals and traders who arrived as refugees. In 1930s anti Indian riots in [[Burma]] results in large number of ethnic Telugus fleeing from Burma either back to [[India]], [[Thailand]] or [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. Another wave of Telugu migration from Burma occurs during world war two, when Japanese invaded Burma.

In recent years new wave of migration of Telugu speaking population from India results in some rejuvenation of Telugu linguistic interest in Malaysia.
In 1981 the [[World Second Telugu Conference]] was held in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. [[Telugu Association of Malaysia]], a non profit NGO serves as representative of Malaysian Telugus and is platform for Telugus to voice their opinions. The Telugu Association was first formed in the region of Lower Perak District in Malaysia on 17 July 1955, under the banner of Malaya Andhra Sangamu and officially registered on 17 February 1956. On 16 December 1963 it was renamed as Malaysia Andhra Sangamu. The association name evolved from 1983 onwards as Telugu Association of Malaysia (TAM) which is also known as Malaysia Telugu Sangamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telugu.org.my/Association.php |title=Association |publisher=Telugu Association of Malaysia |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is formally registered and operates under the banner of as Persatuan Telugu Malaysia in Bahasa Malaysia.

== History ==
Telugus along with other Indians from the east coast of India and the Bengal Bay arrived to the shores of ancient ''Suvarnabhumi'' (referring to [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Lower Burma]], meaning "Land of Gold" in [[Telugu language]]) and other parts of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="POEDASC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chinna Rao Yagati|contribution=Kurmana Simha Chalam|title=Perspectives on Economic Development and Social Change: Essays in Honour of Professor K.S. Chalam|year=2009|publisher=Rawat Publications|isbn=81-316-0246-X|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians from Godavari basin arrived in ancient Malay peninsular, trading and settling down, thus influencing local customs and culture. ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'' addressed India as Benua Keling and Indians as "Keling", a word taken from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], an ancient Indian kingdom which is likely the source of Indian influence over Southeast Asia. Kalinga is located at the northern part of [[Andhra Pradesh]] covering Godavari basin and the southern part of [[Orissa]] and people of this region now speak either Telugu or Oriya. 

The current population of Malaysian Telugus are mostly third and fourth generation Telugus who descended from indentured laborers under the [[kangani system]] who arrived in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kwen Fee Lian, Md Mizanur Rahman &amp; Yabit bin Alas|title=International Migration in Southeast Asia: Continuities and Discontinuities|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=98-128-7712-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some also paid their own passage after the Kangani system ended in the early 20th century.  Most of the Telugus migrants to the Malay peninsula during the colonial era were from northern coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh,&lt;ref name="POEDASC"/&gt; often recruited by ''maistries'' or ''kanganis'' (foremen) from the [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and [[Srikakulam]] regions, with some from the [[East Godavari]] and [[Chittoor]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkwsMTyShi8C&amp;pg=PA94 |title =Global Indian Diasporas: Exploring Trajectories of Migration and Theory|editor= Gijsbert Oonk |page=94 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=9 February 2014|isbn=978-9053560358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The migrants usually shared the same neighbourhood background, blood ties or caste connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nMxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Contentious Connections: Social Imagination in Globalizing South Asia|editors= Sirpa Tenhunen, Klaus Karttunen | page=185 |isbn= 9781443858342 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Telugus who arrived during British colonial era were mainly non-Brahmin middle-ranking or low caste Hindus from the [[Kamma (caste)|Kamma]] and [[Reddy]] to the untouchables,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-AR-V3ymAzoC&amp;pg=PA150|title= Malaysian World-view|editor= Mohd.

As the Telugus formed only a small minority of Indians in British Malaya with Tamils the great majority, they weren't particularly visible as a group and thus their identity was subsumed into the larger group of South Indians. They were referred to as [[Keling|Klings]] or [[Madrasi]]s used as general terms for South Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nMxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Contentious Connections: Social Imagination in Globalizing South Asia |editors= by Sirpa Tenhunen, Klaus Karttunen|page=171 |author=Satyanarayana Arapa  |isbn= 9781443858342 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, the Malaya Andhra Sanghamu (later Malaysia Andhra Sanghamu) was formed to support the Telugu community, foster their culture and promote their language.&lt;ref name="oonk"/&gt;

More recently, an increasing number of Telugu expatriates have arrived from India.{{CN|date=September 2018}}

== Population ==
The Malaysian Telugus form the third largest group of [[Indians in Malaysia]]. In British Malaya they formed around 4% of the Indian population. As the early Telugu migrants tended to bring their womenfolk with them, they had the highest sex ratio among Indian migrants with 1.5 males to 1 female according to the 1921 census.&lt;ref name="sirpa"/&gt; The Telugu population is estimated to be 118,000 in 2018.&lt;ref name="joshua"/&gt;

== Language ==
Telugu language is the native language of Malaysian Telugus, It is the world's most spoken [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and it comes under the category of "South Central Dravidian" language family. Until late 1980s there were few primary Telugu medium schools{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}}. These schools were poorly maintained and there were support by the estate owners only. The last of Telugu school were closed in 1990 due to socioeconomic reasons and urbanization of Telugu people .There was no Indian political party in Malaysia to voice out Telugu people concerns. Some Telugus (along with other Indian minority groups) also had start adopting and assimilating into the majority Tamil language and culture due to tamil dominance{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}}. There was resurgence in learning Telugu language following political and financial support from the Malaysian government .There was a increase in students enrollment in Telugu classes conducted by Telugu Association of Malaysia with partial financial support from  government of Malaysia. Today there are more than 5000 new generation of students who can read and write in Telugu language{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}}.

A '''miner''' is a person who extracts [[ore]], [[coal]], or other [[mineral]] from the earth through [[mining]]. There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock [[face (mining)|face]]; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock.&lt;ref name="Hill 1920"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hill|first=Albert H.|title=miner|work=A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry|year=1920|publisher=United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines|location=Washington D.C.|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofmining00fayauoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond 1881"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Raymond|first=R.W.|title=miner|work=A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms|year=1881|publisher=American Institute of Mining Engineers|location=Easton, Pa.|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofmining00raymrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, a "miner" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.&lt;ref name="Hill 1920" /&gt;

Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/mining-dangerous-job/story?id=10301377 |title=Mining: The Most Dangerous Job? - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.

In regions with a long mining tradition, many communities have developed cultural traditions and aspects specific to the various regions, in the forms of particular equipment, symbolism, music, and the like.

==Roles==
Different functions of the individual miner. Many of the roles are specific to a type of mining, such as coal mining.
Roles considered to be "miners" in the narrower sense have included:
*[[Hewer]] (also known as "breaker" or "pickman"), whose job was to hew the rock.
**Collier, a hewer who hews coal with a [[pickaxe|pick]].
*Driller, who works a rock drill to bore holes for placing dynamite or other explosives.

Other roles within mines that did not involve breaking rock (and thus fit the broader definition) have included:
*Loader (also called a "bandsman"), who loads the mining carts with coal at the face.
*Putter (also known as a "drags-man"), who works the carts around the mine.
*Barrow-man, who transported the broken coal from the face in wheelbarrows.
*[[Hurrier]], who transported coal carts from a mine to the surface.
*Timberer, who fashions and installs timber supports to support the walls and ceiling in an underground mine.

In addition to miners working underground, a [[mining|mine]] employs other workers in duties at the surface. In addition to office staff of various sorts, these may include:
*Brakesman, who operate the [[winding engine]].
*[[Breaker boy]] who breaks coal.
*Emergency Structure Engineer, who makes sure that cave ins are dealt with when called

==Modern miners==

[[Mining Engineering|Mining engineers]] use the principles of math and science to develop economical solutions to technical problems for miners.
In most cases, a bachelor's degree in engineering, mining engineering or geological engineering is required. Because technology is constantly changing, miners and mining engineers need to continue their education.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/mining-and-geological-engineers.htm|title=Mining and Geological Engineers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basics of mining engineering includes finding, extracting, and preparing minerals, metals and coal. These mined products are used for [[electric power]] generation and manufacturing industries. Mining engineers also supervise the construction of underground mine operations and create ways to transport the extracted minerals to processing plants.

==Cryptocurrency miners==
In [[cryptocurrency]] a [[Bitcoin#Mining|miner]] is a computer or group of computers 'searching' for cryptocurrency. They constantly verify transactions and as an incentive they get rewarded with cryptocurrency.

A '''mommy track''' is a path in a woman's life that puts priority to being a [[mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It can also specifically refer to work arrangements for [[women in the workforce]] that facilitate motherhood, such as flexible hours, but at the same time usually provides fewer opportunities for career advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition. 2011 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/us/mommy-career-track-sets-off-a-furor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Mommy Career Track Sets Off a Furor |author=Tamar Lewin |date=8 Mar 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to the mommy track often go along with being a [[housewife]], "opting out" of the workforce, temporarily or even permanently. Women following the mommy track may be contrasted to [[career women]] who prioritize their careers more than having children.

==Origins of 'mommy track'==
Writer [[Jennifer A. Kingson]] introduced the term "mommy track" in an August 8, 1988, article in [[The New York Times]], in which she described the career hurdles faced by law firm associates who sacrificed advancement potential once they had children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/us/women-in-the-law-say-path-is-limited-by-mommy-track.html?pagewanted=&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Schwartz]]’s 1989 article in the ''Harvard Business Journal'' is sometimes called the first discussion of the mommy track phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/03/the_mommy_track_turns_21.html |title=The 'Mommy Track' turns 21 |author=Angie Kim |date=31 March 2010 |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz claims in the article that while “the cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; this greater cost is due primarily to gendered expectations of the workplace and women’s duties in raising children.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz wrote:
{{quote|The misleading metaphor of the [[glass ceiling]] suggests an invisible barrier constructed by corporate leaders to impede the upward mobility of women beyond the middle levels. A more appropriate metaphor, I believe, is the kind of cross-sectional diagram used in geology. The barriers to women’s leadership occur when potentially counterproductive layers of influence on women—maternity, tradition, socialization—meet management strata pervaded by the largely unconscious preconceptions, [[stereotypes]], and expectations of men. Such interfaces do not exist for men and tend to be impermeable for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schwartz's assertions generated widespread publicity and a new conversation about women in the workplace. ''[[The New York Times]],'' having coined the term in 1988, described ''mommy track'' in greater detail in a March 8, 1989 article, "Mommy Career Track Sets Off Furor" which discussed Schwartz's article and the response to it in the public sphere. The article described the mommy track as a phenomenon "in which women with family responsibilities are shunted into dead-end, lower-paying jobs."&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

==Wage gap for mothers==
{{Main|Motherhood penalty}}
Across different pay levels and [[socioeconomic]] groups, women’s earnings tend to plateau after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Even when controlling for variables, on average mothers in all groups earn lower wages than non-mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this general drop in earnings, though, there are significant differences in mothers’ [[Gender pay gap|wage gaps]] between high-earning women and low-earning women.

===High-earning women===
High-earning women appear to bear much higher costs of [[childbirth]] than low-earning women. In the US, choosing to have children will force a woman to give up 21 to 33 percent of her lifetime earnings, a loss that could cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after having children, a highly skilled woman with children remains at a pay level 24% lower than non-mothers even when time out of the workforce is taken into account.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"&gt;Wilde et al, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This group of women also seems to face greater discrimination within the workplace; only 16% of all law firm partners are women, a discrepancy absent from lower-skilled professions.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-skilled women tend to have flatter wage-earning trajectories than their low-skilled counterparts after giving birth, primarily seen in a lack of wage growth.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"&gt;Kornberg, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-earning women===
Low-earning women who have children are sacrificing about 10 to 14 percent of their total lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Even ten years after having children, a mother in the US in this income bracket earns wages that are about 12% lower than non-mother, low-skilled women.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"/&gt; This group of mothers tends to experience a one-time fall in pay immediately after childbirth of about 6%, but after that initial fall the wage gap between women with children and those without does not continue to grow over time.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"/&gt;

==Part-time work and flexibility==
A theory frequently cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women that is the fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/miarticle.htm?id=7342 |title=Women Prefer the Mommy Track |author=Kay S. Hymowitz |date=4 August 2011 |work=[[Manhattan Institute]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report in 2014 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working [[part-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time work and [[flextime]] or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more people—men and women alike—choose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

==Cultural pressures and influences==
In the years since the women’s liberation movement and [[second-wave feminism]], [[gender roles]] have become more complicated and less dogmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Blair-Loy, Mary. "Cultural Constructions of Family Schemas: The Case of Women Finance Executives." Gender and Society. Sage Publications, Inc. 15.5 (Oct. 2001), p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the modern ideal of “intensive parenting,” first described by Sharon Hays, ensures that mothers continue to take primary responsibility for raising children due to the engrained [[social norm]] that women are better nurturers.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Sharon. The Cultural Conditions of Motherhood. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996, p. 129. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the reasons that while both men and women report having increased trouble with their [[work-life balance]] after having a baby, women are the only ones whose hours working decrease as a response to this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, Mary E. and Mary C. Noonan. "The Mommy Track and Partnership: Temporary Delay or Dead End?" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The American Academy of Political and Social Science 596 (Nov. 2004), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who cannot afford to pay someone else to take care of [[domestic work]] are faced with the [[double burden]] of working outside of the home while continuing to complete the majority of domestic work in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie, with Anne Machung. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York, NY: Viking, 1989. Print. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cultural influence on mothers' decreased presence in the workforce is [[gender discrimination]] within the U.S. tax code. Since domestic labor in one’s own home is unpaid and untaxed, and women continue to do a majority of domestic labor as a result of societal norms, in many households it may seem less expensive for a woman to take care of this labor than to go to work and pay someone else to cook, clean, and care for children.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The tax code also sees men as the primary earners and women as secondary earners, so men benefit from joint filing while women’s earnings are frequently subject to higher taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many [[feminist]]s saw the idea of the mommy track as divisive to women and therefore one that could have a detrimental effect to the feminist cause. Since Schwartz’s initial article proposed sorting women into two categories based on their devotion to careers,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; some saw this as a division between women that both forced them into narrow categories and ignored any existing differences between men.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

There is also an ongoing discussion of whether the wage gap that results from a mommy track is any sort of societal discrimination against women, or basically an effect of mothers choosing to spend more time away from work.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"/&gt;

==Mommy track in different countries==

===United States===
In a 2005 study, in the US, it has been estimated that 31% of working mothers left the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell,S (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Suriname]]) that does not have laws that require employers to provide paid [[maternity leave]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-industrialized-nation-paid-maternity-leave/story?id=30852419&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan’s social norms, like those of the U.S., help to cause many women to move into part-time work upon having children. However, unlike the U.S., Japanese mothers rarely return to full-time work after having children.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Even more so than other developed countries, Japan has an especially high proportion of women who work part-time, and a majority of those women are mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Common business practices in Japan further penalize mothers who may have taken leave from the workplace at some point, due to companies choosing to only recruit directly from universities and setting upper limits on age for full-time positions.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] women have entered the workforce relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the [[marriage bar]] and the [[marital power]] of the husband, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0e&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, according to ''[[The Economist]]'',  "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' found that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women [[part time job|work part time]]. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/131205_country_profile_netherlands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Kingdom===
The UK has less working mothers than many other Western countries. Lack of sufficient childcare and social stigma against working mothers have been cited as reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/you-want-career-and-a-baby&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women in the UK have one of the highest rate of part-time work in Europe. A report by [[OECD]] which looked at the OECD members, as well as at other countries from inside and outside Europe, found that only the Netherlands and Switzerland had a higher percentage of women working part-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the UK face one of the worst [[motherhood penalty|motherhood penalties]] among Western countries: "[mothers] find significant motherhood wage  penalties  in  several  Continental  Northern  European  countries  (Austria,  the  Netherlands  and Germany)  and  Anglophone  countries  (Canada,  the  UK and  the  US)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_206235.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Council]], in a recommendation to the UK (which is non-binding), has criticized the UK because "The difference in the share of part-time work between women (42,6 % in 2013) and men (13,2 % in 2013) is one of the highest in the Union. The percentage of women who are inactive or work part-time due to personal and family responsibilities (12,5 %) was almost twice as high as the EU average (6,3 %) in 2013...[e]ven if supply in the childcare system has increased recently, the availability of affordable, high-quality, full-time childcare remains a key issue."&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2015.272.01.0021.01.ENG&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In the [[Nordic countries]], marriage and having children have far greater effects on women than on men, partly due to the expectation that women will continue unpaid domestic labor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nordic countries have worked to make the dual-earner household the norm, with nationalized childcare, parental leave, and flexible working hours making it possible for women to continue to work.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 UNICEF report, in Sweden, although parents are given 12 months of parental leave time that can be divided between the two as each couple sees best, gender norms continue to have an effect: mandated maternity leave combined with Sweden allowing women to reduce work hours after giving birth means that nearly half of mothers in dual-income families work less than full-time.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF. 2007. “A Call for Equality,” in The State of the World’s Children. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Although women in Nordic countries have a high overall labour participation, there is a strong segregation by gender with women being often found in certain work sectors, which have a working culture adapted to family life, with flexible hours and offers of part-time jobs, and men working in other sectors. According to the Nordic Information on Gender "The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why women are more likely to work part time in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons  there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time - as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of  0 - 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only  48% of Norwegian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/wp-content/uploads/NIKKpub_deltid1_temanord.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate). This compared with the EU28 rate of 58.8% female vs 69% male.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Employment_rates_for_selected_population_groups,_2004%E2%80%9314_%28%25%29_YB16.png&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mummy Laid an Egg: or, Where do Babies Come From?''''' is a children's book by English author [[Babette Cole]]. It was published in 1994 and won the [[British Illustrated Children's Book of the Year]] in that year.

It has also been published as ''Mommy Laid an Egg'' in the United States.  Under that title it was listed as number 82 in the American Library Association's "100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm|title=The 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990–2000|work=American Library Association|accessdate=2009-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sC3hcGt2?url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm|archivedate=2010-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suecia 1-055 ; Stockholms Stadsmuseum 1691.jpg|thumb|Construction work in Stockholm 1691; likely the first time the Mursmäckas are depicted]]
'''Mursmäcka''', also called ''bruksmäcka'' or only ''smäcka'', was an historical profession for women in Sweden. A mursmäcka was a female [[construction worker]] with the task to hand [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] during construction work. The profession is recorded from at least 1691 (though it is not confirmed by name until the 1830s) and discontinued in 1922. This was a very hard but common work for a poor uneducated woman during the 19th century, particularly in [[Stockholm]]. In July 1888, the Mursmäcka of Stockholm performed a great [[strike action]] which attracted considerable attention in contemporary Sweden.

==History==
It is unknown when the profession was first practiced. The first illustration of female construction workers in Sweden are from 1691, and they are frequently mentioned in the [[payroll]]s in the 18th century. The name Mursmäcka is first recorded in the 1830s, when they were apparently already long established as a regular part of a construction site work force. During the 19th century, they were common in all cities in Sweden, especially in Stockholm, where there was a building boom in the latter half of that century.

Their task was to manufacture the mortar, during the work and carry it to the [[bricklayer]]s. The work was very hard, badly reputed and, though the salary was possible to live on, it was very low. According to an investigation from 1897, most of the women active in the profession were uneducated destitute unmarried women, often unmarried mothers. As they were very little construction work during winter time, the mursmäckas, just as their male colleagues, were forced to live on other work, in their case often charring.

In 1888, the mursmäckas launched a strike in Stockholm to raise their salary. This attracted a great deal of attention because of their gender, and the newspapers called it The Women's Strike. They succeeded and their salary was raised, though it was lowered again just a few years later. Mursmäckas became members of the Bricklayers' Union after it was founded in 1897. In 1904, a new work regulation was enforced in which an entire construction work team was paid according to how much they could work, which in effect meant that they could raise their salaries and split it among them if they could keep up a high work speed. The consequence was that the male workers became less willing to include women in their teams, as they doubted that they could keep the same work speed as their male colleagues, which because of the new regulation would affect the income of the whole team. This meant that the mursmäckas had to start to compete with male rivals performing the same tasks as they in the work team.

During [[World War I]], no buildings were erected, and when the war was over and there was a great deal of people unemployed, male workers were [[employment discrimination|favored over]] females and the task previously belonging to women in construction work teams were given to men, thereby ending the profession of mursmäcka. The last mursmäcka retired in 1922.

{{Sexual orientation}}
[[Sexual orientation]] is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]],&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Heterosexuality, Homosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --&gt; the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsychiAssn-Sexual orientation"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|accessdate=January 1, 2013|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archivedate=July 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080052/http://www.healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in [[neuroscience]] explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.

== Developmental neurobiology ==
Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.03.002 |title=The neurodevelopment of human sexual orientation |year=2005 |last1=Rahman |first1=Q |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=29 |pages=1057–66 |pmid=16143171 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, [[sexual dimorphisms]] in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal [[androgens]] as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;  This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including [[Digit ratio|2D:4D finger ratios]], [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|auditory evoked potentials]], fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt;

Other evidence supporting the role of [[testosterone]] and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with [[cloacal exstrophy]] who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swaab DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research directions ==
As of 2005, research directions included:&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; 
* finding markers for sex steroid levels in the brains of fetuses that highlight features of early neuro-development leading to certain sexual orientations
* determine the precise neural circuitry underlying direction of sexual preference
* use animal models to explore genetic and developmental factors that influence sexual orientation
* further population studies, genetic studies, and serological markers to clarify and definitively determine the effect of maternal immunity
* neuroimaging studies to quantify sexual-orientation-related differences in structure and function in vivo
* neurochemical studies to investigate the roles of sex steroids upon neural circuitry involved in sexual attraction

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}

'''Old money''' is "the inherited wealth of established upper-class families (i.e. [[gentry]], [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]])" or "a person, family, or lineage possessing inherited wealth".&lt;ref&gt;"Old Money" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. 5 Nov. 2008. Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oldmoney&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically describes a class of the rich who have been able to maintain their wealth over multiple generations, often referring to perceived members of the ''de facto'' aristocracy in societies that historically lack an officially established aristocratic class (such as the US).

''[[Wealth]]''—assets held by an individual or by a household—provides an important dimension of [[social stratification]] because it can pass from generation to generation, ensuring that a family's offspring will remain financially stable. Families with "old money" use accumulated assets or savings to bridge interruptions in income, thus guarding against downward [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

Old Money was typically associated with [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] ("WASP") status.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Lewis Allen,  "WASP—From Sociological Concept to Epithet", ''Ethnicity,'' 2.2 (1975): 153-162. &lt;/ref&gt;

"Old money" applies to those of the upper class whose wealth separates them from lower social classes. According to anthropologist [[W. Lloyd Warner]], the upper class in the United States during the 1930s was divided into the upper-upper and the lower-upper classes.&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower-upper were those that did not come from traditionally wealthy families. They earned their money from investments and [[business]] like [[John D. Rockefeller]], whose father was a traveling [[peddler]], rather than [[inheritance]]. In contrast to the ''[[nouveau riche]]'', the upper-upper class were families viewed as "quasi-aristocratic" and "high-society".&lt;ref name=warner /&gt; These families had been rich and prominent in American politics for generations in many cases since before the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] when their ancestors had accumulated fortunes as members of the elite [[planter class]], or as merchants, slave traders, ship owners, or fur traders. In many cases, especially in [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and the [[Carolinas]] the source of these families wealth were vast tracts of land granted to their ancestors by [[the Crown]] and or acquired by [[headright]] during the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]].  These families sometimes known as [[American gentry]] produced several [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and a number of early U.S. Presidents including [[George Washington]], who with an estimated net worth of $525 million (in 2016 dollars) due to his vast holdings of land and [[slaves]], was the wealthiest man to hold the office prior to the election of [[billionaire]] [[Donald Trump]] in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/george-washington-richest-president-in-us-history-2016-6&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the early 20th century, the upper-upper class were seen as more prestigious than the nouveau riche.&lt;ref name=warner /&gt;During the late 19th century and early 20th century the nouveau rich flaunted their wealth by building [[List of Gilded Age mansions|Gilded Age mansions]] that emulated the palaces of European royalty while old money was more conservative.

Some families with "old money" include:

* The [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]] is descended from [[William Randolph]] an American [[colonist]], who accumulated a vast fortune including over 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land as a planter and merchant, and played an important role in the history and government of the English [[colony of Virginia]].

* The [[Roosevelt family]] of Manhattan arrived from the [[Netherlands]] as colonists and later became prominent in politics, producing presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]].
* The [[Cabots]] arrived in Salem from the Isle of Jersey in 1700 and made fortunes in shipping. At the age of 21, Godfrey Lowell Cabot (see Lowells below) founded the [[Cabot Corporation]], the largest producer of carbon black in the country.
* The [[Lowell family]] are descended from Boston colonists. [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] began the fortune in shipping and later textiles. The family has produced several noteworthy individuals, including [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], who presided over [[Harvard]] for 24 years.
*The [[Du Pont family]] fortune began in 1803, but they became an extraordinarily wealthy family by selling [[gunpowder]] during the [[American Civil War]].

From a [[Wealth management|private wealth manager]]'s perspective, "old money" can be classified into two: active "old money" and passive "old money". The former includes inheritors who, despite the inherited wealth at their disposal or that which they can access in the future, choose to pursue their own career or set up their own businesses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Knowledge for IT in Private Wealth Management: A Complete Handbook for IT Professionals|last=Essvale Corporation Limited|first=|publisher=Essvale Corporation Limited|year=2008|isbn=9780955412493|location=London|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Stelios Haji-Ioannou|Sir Stelios Iaonnou]] are examples of this category. On the other hand, passive "old money" are those who are the idle rich or those who are not wealth producers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

"Old money" contrasts with the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' and ''[[parvenus]]''. These fall under the category "new money" (those not from traditionally wealthy families). 

Economists assert that the largest transfer of wealth{{clarify|date=June 2015}} will be as the older generation leaves wealth to the [[baby boomer]]s. Inheritance has been estimated to make up 6% of the US GDP each year.&lt;ref name="haseler" /&gt;{{rp|16}} The current generation is wealthier than any generation before.{{clarify|date=April 2016}}{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This increase in wealth and inheritance indicates a rise of "old money" in American families. [[Stephen Haseler]] argues that America is becoming an inheritance culture in which much economic opportunity is from family inheritance and not personal achievement.&lt;ref name="haseler" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

== Europe ==
The [[Rothschild family]], as an example, established finance houses across Europe from the 18th century and was ennobled by the [[Habsburg]] Emperor and [[Queen Victoria]]. Throughout the 19th century, they controlled the largest fortune in the world, in today's terms many hundreds of billions. The family has, at least to some extent, maintained its wealth for over two centuries. The Rothschilds were not, however, considered "old money" by their British counterparts. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the term generally exclusively refers to the [[landed gentry]], usually the [[Hereditary peer|aristocracy and nobility]] who traditionally live off the land inherited paternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In France, the "200 families" controlled much of the nation's wealth after 1815. The "200" is based on the policy that of the 40,000 shareholders of the [[Bank of France]], only 200 were allowed to attend the annual meeting and they cast all the votes.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France 1848-1945, Vol. 1: Ambition, Love, and Politics'' (1973) pp 53-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of a nation of 27 million people, only 80,000 to 90,000 were allowed to vote in 1820, and the richest one-fourth of them had two votes.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Spitzer, "Restoration Political Theory and the Debate over the Law of the Double Vote" ''Journal of Modern History'' 55#1 (1983) pp. 54-70 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878978 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on popular culture ==

The ITV television series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' frequently contrasts the differences between Old Money and [[Nouveau riche|New Money]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the early 20th century. Notably between the newspaperman Sir Richard Carlisle and the heiress Lady [[Mary Crawley]], the distinction being the aggression of the ''[[parvenu]]'' Sir Richard and the ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' of the Crawleys.

Perhaps the greatest literary critique of the tension between Old Money and New Money can be found in [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. The characters in possession of old money represented by the "Tom Buchanan" family (Tom and Daisy), get away with (literally) murder; while those with new money, represented by Gatsby himself, are alternately embraced and scorned by other characters in the book. Fitzgerald vastly critiques people in possession of old money through his narrator Nick Carraway: ''“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”''

[[File:Giving Victims a Voice - Victims By Area Map.svg|thumb|upright|250px|Geographical locations of the reported offences according to ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', a report of the investigations]]

'''Operation Yewtree''' is a police investigation into [[sexual abuse]] allegations, predominantly [[child sexual abuse|the abuse of children]], against the British media personality [[Jimmy Savile]] and others.  The investigation, led by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], started in October 2012. After a period of assessment it became a full criminal investigation, involving inquiries into living people, notably other celebrities,&lt;ref name="spindler" /&gt; as well as Savile.

The report of the investigations into the activities of Savile himself was published, as ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', in January 2013. Operation Yewtree continued as an investigation into others, some but not all linked with Savile.  By October 2015, 19 people had been arrested by Operation Yewtree;&lt;ref name="79yo" /&gt; seven of these arrests led to convictions. The "Yewtree effect" has been credited for an increase in the number of reported sex crimes,&lt;ref name="yewtree effect"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yewtree Effect: Trials of Dave Lee Travis, Rolf Harris and Bill Roache Led to Surge in Reported Sex Crimes |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/yewtree-effect-trials-dave-lee-travis-rolf-harris-bill-roache-led-surge-reported-sex-crimes-1433645 |work=International Business Times |date=24 January 2014 |first=Lewis |last=Dean |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the operation also sparked [[#Reactions and analysis|a debate]] on police procedure and rights of those accused of sex crimes.

==Background==
[[File:Jimmy Savile 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jimmy Savile]] in July 2006]]
{{main|Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal}}
An [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary, ''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile]]'', researched and presented by former police detective [[Mark Williams-Thomas]], was broadcast on 3 October 2012, almost a year after Savile's death. The programme contained several allegations by women who said that, as teenagers, they had been sexually abused by radio and television personality [[Jimmy Savile]], who had gained access to them through the television programmes he had presented and his charity work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Neil | last = Midgley | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/9585422/Jimmy-Savile-Exposure-ITV1-review.html | title = Jimmy Savile: Exposure, ITV1, review | work = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date = 4 October 2012 | accessdate = 20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the broadcast, many other people came forward to make allegations about Savile's conduct towards young people, including sexual abuse that had taken place on [[BBC]] premises and in hospitals to which Savile had access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Beckford | first2 = Richard | last2 = Alleyne | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9588692/Met-investigate-Sir-Jimmy-Savile-as-dozens-more-abuse-allegations-are-made.html | title = Met investigate Sir Jimmy Savile as dozens more abuse allegations are made | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date = 5 October 2012 | accessdate = 5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial assessments==
On 4 October 2012, the Metropolitan Police said it would take the national lead in a process of assessing the allegations.&lt;ref name=met041012&gt;{{cite news | url = http://content.met.police.uk/News/Met-to-lead-on-Savile-allegations/1400012072110/1257246745756 | publisher = Metropolitan Police | title = Met to lead on Savile allegations | date = 4 October 2012 | accessdate = 20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19837906 | title = Met Police to assess Jimmy Savile claims |publisher=BBC News  | date = 4 October 2012 | accessdate = 4 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment was undertaken by the Serious Case Team of the service's [[Child Abuse Investigation Command]], led by Detective Superintendent David Gray working closely with the BBC. The police said, "Our priority will be to ensure a proportionate and consistent policing response putting the victims at the heart of our enquiries", and that "it is not an investigation at this stage".&lt;ref name=met041012/&gt;

The Metropolitan Police announced on 9 October that the inquiry into the allegations would be called ''Operation Yewtree'', and would be undertaken jointly with the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]].  The police had formally recorded eight allegations against Savile, but announced they were following 120 lines of inquiry, covering up to 25 victims of abuse, mainly girls aged between 13 and 16. The allegations covered four decades, from 1959 until the 1980s, and were on "a national scale". Commander Peter Spindler, head of specialist crime investigations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.met.police.uk/about/charts/mps-orgchart-oct2012.pdf | publisher = Metropolitan Police | title = Organisational Structure | date = October–November 2012 | accessdate = 20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; said, "At this stage it is quite clear from what women are telling us that Savile was a predatory sex offender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19887019 | title = Savile abuse claims: Police pursue 120 lines of inquiry |publisher=BBC News| date = 9 October 2012 | accessdate = 9 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Yewtree" was chosen from a list of names which are intended to be neutral and unrelated to each particular case. This system, dating back to the 1980s, is used for operations which are started to handle specific crimes, as opposed to more general, pro-active operations with names connected to their intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7288489.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = How do police operations get their names? | date = 25 March 2008 | accessdate = 20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Giving Victims a Voice''==

The joint report prepared by the Metropolitan Police Service and the NSPCC, ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', was published in January 2013, and marked the end of investigations under Operation Yewtree into Savile alone. It reported that sex offences were committed by Savile on 450 people&lt;ref name="stv farrell 2013" /&gt; (328 being children at the time),&lt;ref name="shropshirestar 2013-01-11" /&gt; across England and&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt; Scotland,&lt;ref name="stv farrell 2013" /&gt; with allegations also made in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name="smh laville 2013" /&gt; The vast majority of offences occurred in his home town of [[Leeds]] and in London, his main place of work.&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt;

Allegations associating Savile with abuse at Jersey children's home [[Haut de la Garenne]] were made in 2008, during Savile's lifetime. He commenced legal action against ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in response; Savile's lawyer said "The reported events are the antithesis of everything Sir James has worked tirelessly to prevent". No action was taken against Savile at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jimmy Savile turns to Fox Hayes for action against The Sun |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/jimmy-savile-turns-to-fox-hayes-for-action-against-the-sun/131780.article |work=The Lawyer |date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims were "mainly not known to each other".&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph rayner 2013" /&gt; His youngest victim was aged {{nowrap|8 years}}, the oldest 47.&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt; Most were aged 13{{ndash}}16,&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt; with 73% being under 18&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt; and the majority being [[minor (law)|minor]]s.&lt;ref name="radiotimes report 2013" /&gt; The attacks included 18 girls and 10 boys under the age of 10,&lt;ref name="shropshirestar 2013-01-11" /&gt; and were mostly against young girls aged under 16.&lt;ref name="standard randhawa 2013" /&gt;

The offences were mostly opportunistic, although [[child grooming]] was involved in some cases.&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt; The first and final known offences were in 1955 and 2009 respectively.&lt;ref name="stv farrell 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt; The period containing most frequent offending was between 1966 and 1976 (when he was aged 40{{ndash}}50),&lt;ref name="shropshirestar 2013-01-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt; coinciding with his "peak [celebrity] status".&lt;ref name="guardian laville2 2013" /&gt; The most frequent offending was during 1975 and 1976 with each year having 15 offences recorded in it.&lt;ref name="telegraph swinford 2013" /&gt;

Most allegations had not previously been reported to authorities, with victims stating reasons of fear of disbelief or distrust of the [[judicial system]].&lt;ref name="guardian walker 2013" /&gt; At least seven allegations&lt;ref name="smh laville 2013" /&gt; of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked.&lt;ref name="smh laville 2013" /&gt; The [[Crown Prosecution Service|CPS]] said prosecutions "might have been possible" in connection with allegations made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt;

Savile's celebrity status meant that he was considered to have been "hiding in plain sight".&lt;ref name="stv farrell 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc keypoints 2013" /&gt; Operation Yewtree's senior investigating officer, [[Detective Superintendent|DSI]] David Gray, said Savile used ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'' "as a vehicle to gain access to victims".&lt;ref name="telegraph rayner 2013" /&gt;

Approximately 600 people had provided information at the time of the publication of the Savile report, ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', of which 450 related to Savile.&lt;ref name="telegraph rayner 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mps gvv 2013" /&gt; A total of 214 criminal offences were formally recorded&lt;ref name="radiotimes report 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mps gvv 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc live keypoints 2013" /&gt; across 28 police forces.  The NSPCC described Savile as "one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history".&lt;ref name="bbc decades 2013" /&gt; The BBC restated a "sincere apology to the victims".&lt;ref name="bbc decades 2013" /&gt;

===Operation Hydrant===
In response to a large increase of complainants coming forward in the summer of 2014 in the wake of the Savile scandal, [[Operation Hydrant]], a new operation into historic child sex abuse allegations was launched by the [[National Police Chiefs' Council]] (NPCC). As of 20 May 2015, 1433 suspects - including 261 of "public prominence" (135 from TV, film or radio) and 666 from institutions (including 154 from schools, 75 from children's homes, 40 from religious institutions and 14 medical establishments) - have been identified.  Operation Hydrant is not responsible for conducting independent investigations; it gathers information from other inquiries, including Operation Yewtree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1,400 child abuse suspects identified |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32812449 |work=BBC News |location=London |date=20 May 2015| accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Ravine===  
Operation Ravine is an investigation by [[Surrey Police]] into alleged sexual abuse connected to the [[Walton Hop]] disco.  A previous investigation into the Walton Hop disco, Operation Arundel, resulted in the convictions of Chris Denning and music mogul [[Jonathan King]] for child sex offences in the early 2000s. In January 2014, [[Merseyside Police]] carried out an independent review of Operation Arundel and related materials were shared with Operation Yewtree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walton Hop disco probed again as Chris Denning jailed |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/walton-hop-disco-probed-again-8304000 |publisher= Get Surrey.

In an article for ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Rod Liddle]] criticised the handling of these cases by police, especially in the case of Freddie Starr, who was arrested four times and bailed nine times before being told he would not be charged, claiming: "the way the police have conducted the process is hugely unfair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liddle |first=Rod |title=The Nigel Evans case proves that juries are smarter than our liberal elite |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/rod-liddle/9185661/the-nigel-evans-case-proves-that-juries-are-smarter-than-our-liberal-elite/ |work=The Spectator |date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of [[Cliff Richard]]'s August 2014 property search, human rights barrister [[Geoffrey Robertson]] wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the long delays before announcing charges amounted to "outrageous treatment", adding: "This has been one of the most intolerable features of other high-profile arrests for 'historic' offences, namely the inability of police and prosecutors to deliver [[Magna Carta]]’s truly historic promise that justice will not be delayed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-way-the-police-have-treated-cliff-richard-is-completely-unacceptable-9672367.html |title=The way the police have treated Cliff Richard is completely unacceptable |date=16 August 2014 |work=The Independent |first=Geoffrey |last=Robertson |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After others, including [[Jim Davidson]] and Gambaccini, were left on bail for many months before being told they would not face charges, then-Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] proposed that bail time be limited to 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29624498 |title=Police bail time limit for suspects considered |publisher=BBC News|date=15 October 2014|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1394048/bail-limit-planned-after-celebrities-delays |title= Bail Limit Planned After Celebrities' Delays |publisher=Sky News |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 28-day limit came into effect in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/28-day-police-bail-limit-suspects-charged-new-police-rule-comes-into-force-today-a7663196.html |title=Police bail for suspects capped at 28 days |last=Peck |first=Tom |work=The Independent|date=2 April 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference in July 2014, comedian and friend of Gambaccini [[Stephen Fry]] criticised the operation, pointing out that fewer than half of those accused at the time had been found guilty, and called for tougher laws to prevent false sex abuse allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Withnall |first=Adam |title=Fry 'criticises Operation Yewtree in dinner party rant' calling for tougher laws to deter false sex abuse allegations |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/fry-criticises-operation-yewtree-in-dinner-party-rant-calling-for-tougher-laws-to-deter-false-sex-abuse-allegations-9602686.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MP [[Nigel Evans]], who was cleared of unrelated sexual assault charges, has called for individuals to receive anonymity until charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2014-10-10/gambaccini-case-reinforces-the-need-to-protect-identities-before-charge/ |title=Nigel Evans: Paul Gambaccini ordeal reinforces need to protect identities before charge |publisher=ITV News |date=10 October 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosie Millard]] criticized the operation after [[Dave Lee Travis]] was convicted on one count of indecent assault for groping a woman's breast for 15 seconds in 1995, saying: "one has to ask whether the Operation Yewtree fervour, fuelled no doubt by the frustration that one of Britain’s sickest and most evil perverts died before he could come to justice, has simply gone a bit crazy. If we started jailing every man who has ever squeezed a breast, there would be no time for any other sort of case in our courts, and our prisons would be the size of a small city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/theres-no-excuse-for-dave-lee-traviss-behaviour-but-we-need-to-keep-a-sense-of-proportion-9758891.html |title=There's no excuse for Dave Lee Travis's behaviour, but we need to keep a sense of proportion |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 September 2014 |first=Rosie |last=Millard |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carole Malone]] claimed the case against Travis was a "witch-hunt", adding "if police spent more of their limited time and resources hunting dangerous sex criminals – and less on celebrity gropers – the world would be a safer place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dave-lee-travis-witch-hunt-4334126 |title= Dave Lee Travis witch hunt is a sideshow which insults real victims of sexual abuse |work=Daily Mirror |date=27 September 2014 |location=London |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', the failed Metropolitan Police investigation, [[Operation Midland]], was "forged by the experience of the Jimmy Savile scandal, and the subsequent Operation Yewtree inquiry";  in particular, the use of a high-profile press conference to get additional victims to come forward to corroborate each other’s stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/21/operation-midland-met-police-paedophile-ring |last1=Rajeev |last2=Laville |first1=Syal |first2=Sandra |title=  Operation Midland: how the Met lost its way  |work=The Guardian |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the late Irish Supreme Court Judge [[Adrian Hardiman]] criticised the methods used by Operation Yewtree, particularly the treatment of Paul Gambaccini, as well as the investigations of Cliff Richard and the Midland cases of [[Leon Brittan]] and [[Edwin Bramall]], for what he described as the radical undermining of the [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/hardiman-questions-methods-of-uk-sex-claim-inquiries-1.2533054 | work=[[Irish Times]]| title=Hardiman questions methods of UK sex-claim inquiries | date=13 February 2016 | accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by Sir [[Richard Henriques]] into the Metropolitan Police's sexual abuse investigations was critical of the handling of Operation Midland but reserved praise for Operation Yewtree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bernard-hogan-howe-met-police-vip-paedophile-ring-failures-commissioner-a7404821.html |last=Walker |first= Peter | work=[[The Independent]]| title=Met Police admits Scotland Yard made catalogue of errors over false VIP sex abuse investigation | date=8 November 2016 | accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambaccini, Bramall and [[Harvey Proctor]], who had been investigated by Operation Midland, sued the Metropolitan Police for £3m in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/victims-of-abuse-inquiry-blunders-sue-met-for-3m-fx59stc2h |last1=O'Neill |last2=Hamilton |first1= Sean |first2= Fiona | work=[[The Times]]| title=Victims of abuse inquiry blunders sue Met for £3m | date= 14 February 2017 | accessdate= 15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, Gambaccini reached an out-of-court settlement with the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] and received an undisclosed amount in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-4608009 | publisher=[[BBC News]]| title=Paul Gambaccini secures CPS payout over unfounded abuse claims | date= 3 November 2018 | accessdate= 3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Yewtree was the inspiration for a drama, ''[[National Treasure (TV drama)|National Treasure]]'', starring [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Julie Walters]] and [[Andrea Riseborough]]. Coltrane played Paul Finchley, a fictional light-entertainment performer accused of rape, Walters played Finchley's wife Marie, and Riseborough played their daughter Danielle ("Dee"). The four-part series, by [[George S. J. Faber|The Forge]], was broadcast September–October 2016 on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=Guardian_Coltrane&gt;{{cite news | last = Ross | first = Peter | title = 'This is for the people who were abused': Robbie Coltrane on his Yewtree-inspired drama | url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/06/for-the-people-abused-robbie-coltrane-yewtree-inspired-national-treasure-channel-4 |work= [[The Guardian]] |date=6 September 2016 |accessdate= 13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Order of Merit of the Kingdom of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Érdemrend}}) was established on 14 June 1922 by [[Miklós Horthy]] the [[Regent]] of the  [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On 23 December 1935 it was transformed into an official distinction. Since then if is known as '''Order of Merit of the Kingdom of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Érdemrend}}). After the Hungarian monarchy was abolished, on 14 September 1946 the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] disestablished the order and replaced it by the '''Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Köztársasági Érdemrend}}). After the promulgation of the new Hungarian constitution on  20. August 1949, the order was disestablished. After the collapse of the communist regime in Hungary, the order was reestablished as the second-highest distinction of the country. Since 2012 the official name is '''Order of Merit of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Érdemrend}}).

Originally the order was instituted as the Order of Merit in three grades: gilt, silver and bronze. Eventually the order was expanded to include the following seven classes: Collar, Grand Cross with Holy Crown, Grand Cross, Grand Commander, Commander, Officer and Knight.

== History ==
The '''Order of Merit of the Kingdom of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Érdemkereszt}}) was established on 14 June 1922 by the [[Regent]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], Vice Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]]. After its establishment, the rules of the order were changed numerous times. On 23 December 1935 it became an official distinction recognizing both civil and military accomplishments. From on 1939 to 1944 the highest degree of the order, the Grand Cross with the Holy Crown of Stephen (Istvan), was awarded to both chiefs of state (i.e. monarchs of presidents) or heads of government (i.e. prime ministers and chancellors). In addition, the class of the Holy Crown and the Collar was instituted which was awarded exclusively to chiefs of state. All classes of the order could be awarded in recognition of military distinction, the military "division" of the order having crossed swords and a different ribbon which was mostly red rather than the green of the civil division.

After the Hungarian monarchy was formally abolished following the abdication of Admiral Horthy and the defeat of Hungary in [[World War II]], on 14 September 1946 the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] disestablished the order and replaced it by the '''Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Köztársasági Érdemrend}}). After the Communist take over of Hungary and the promulgation of the new Hungarian constitution on  August 20, 1949, the new order was disestablished.

Following the collapse of the Communist regime in Hungary in 1989 a new order, known as ''Order of Merit of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Érdemrend}}), was established. Though it has a similar appearance, this is a new order and not a re-establishment of the previous order.

==Recipients==
* Vice Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]]
* Grand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]]

'''Peshawari turban''', also '''Peshawari pagri''' or '''Peshawari lungee''' ({{lang-ps|پېښورۍ لونګۍ}}), is the traditional [[Pashtun dress|Pashtun]]-style [[turban]] worn in [[Peshawar]] and its surrounding regions. It is traditionally worn not only by the [[Muslims]], but was also used by the local [[Hindus|Hindu community]].&lt;ref&gt;Sweet Chillies, Balraj Khanna
Constable, 1991 Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a two-piece headgear. One piece is a dome-shaped hard cap or kulla, generally embroidered with golden thread.&lt;ref&gt;The Turbans (Pugrees) of Pakistan, September 24, 2008, All Things Pakistan,  http://pakistaniat.com/2008/09/24/turban-pugree-pug-pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;  The other piece, called lungi, consists of a long and narrow piece of cotton cloth (not to be confused with a waist cloth wrapped in some regions). It has a fan-shaped [[turra]] (crest) and a tail termed shamla.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan: an introduction, Herbert Feldman,
Edition	2, Oxford University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subhas Chandra Bose]] had used a Peshawari turban to [[Subhas Chandra Bose#Escape from British India to Nazi Germany and Japan|disguise himself]] as a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] in 1941 to flee from the British territory.&lt;ref&gt;Subhas Chandra Bose: Netaji's passage to immortality, Subodh Markandeya,
Arnold Publishers, Dec 1, 1990, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British rule a similar turban was part of the dress for some  government peons.&lt;ref&gt;In The Districts Of The Raj,  
Y.D. Gundevia,1992, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pagri in ancient [[Gandhara]]==

Wearing a turban was common in ancient Gandhara as well in other part of India (see [[Pagri (turban)#Pagri in Ancient India: from major museums|Pagri in Ancient India]]). See the gallery of images below. Most of them are from the Kushana period.  During centuries the Kushana has changed into the name of the traditional [[Pashtun dress|Pashtun]]-style turban. In the ancient Gandhara turban, the turra was in the center, behind a kalgi ornament.

==Description==
The news report aired a six-part series stemming from [[child sexual abuse]] allegations against deacon Mark Foeller and associate pastor Timothy Leonard (a graduate of [[Hyles-Anderson College]], an [[school accreditation|unaccredited]] institution), of North Sharon Baptist Church near Ann Arbor."&lt;ref name="Grand Rapids"&gt;{{cite news|title=7 accused of abuse linked to preacher|work=The Grand Rapids Press|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|date=May 17, 1993|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard, "North Sharon's associate pastor and a graduate of Hyles Anderson College of Schererville, was charged in Michigan with first- and second-degree sexual assault of children."&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;Debra Gruszecki [http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/fbi-won-t-continue-with-church-sex-abuse-probe-not/article_d413af23-4162-5db1-bac7-4fd65d9dc481.html FBI won't continue with church sex abuse probe. Not enough] ''Northwest Indiana Times.'' May 19, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' noted "the news report found seven U.S. churches - all with ties to [[Jack Hyles]], it said - involved in sex scandals."&lt;ref name="San Diego" /&gt; Thus, the TV station noted alleged child molestations at a church "appeared to be part of a pattern among 'churches that follow the teachings and philosophy' of Hyles, [[First Baptist Church of Hammond|First Baptist]] and its related Hyles-Anderson College of [[Crown Point, Indiana]]"&lt;ref name=Linked&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann|first=Daniel J.|title=Pastor Linked to Sex Abuse Lashes Out|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 2, 1993|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mini-series "showed footage during its report of [Hyles] brandishing a rifle from the pulpit", along with "people with guns and walkie-talkies patrolling the outside of the church at times." &lt;ref name="conversation"&gt;[http://nwitimes.com/articles/1993/05/30/export191146.txt A conversation with the Rev Jack Hyles] ''Northwest Indiana Times'' May 30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally "the station also recapped a sermon in 1990 in which Hyles pretended to pour poison into a glass and asked an associate pastor, Johnny Colsten, to drink from it. Colsten said he would."&lt;ref name="dictator"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/hyles-i-m-no-dictator-first-baptist-leader-defends/article_fc79e105-a9e7-507e-bd03-d3834d335a1f.html | title=Hyles: I'm no dictator.

The report also described the links of "a deacon at First Baptist, A.V. Ballenger, [who] was found guilty of one count of child molestation dating from 1991."&lt;ref name=Linked/&gt;  Also discussed in the news report was the comments Hyles made to the parents of the girl molested by Ballenger. The ''Chicago Tribune'' in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl molested by Ballenger. The paper reported the "lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school." This stemmed from their mentioning the molestation to Hyles who then promised to "investigate". After two months of nothing being done, the parents went to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Beeler.

== Investigation  ==
The Detroit news program was not the only one to study if there was a connection between deacon Ballenger at Hyles' church and the North Sharon associate pastor, who graduated from Hyles-Anderson College. The prosecuting attorney for [[Washtenaw County, Michigan]] went to the Ballenger trial "to watch, listen to testimony and observe similarities between this case and other cases involving a rural church [in] Michigan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gruszecki|first=Debra Gruszecki|title=Deacon's trial draws interest of Michigan prosecutors|url=http://nwitimes.com/articles/1993/03/24/export200497.txt|work=Northwest Indiana Times|date=March 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1993 "the FBI was asked to look into allegations minors were taken from Michigan to Northwest Indiana by employees or officials of North Sharon Baptist Church near Ann Arbor for events sponsored by Hammond First Baptist Church."&lt;ref name="FBI" /&gt; The FBI concluded, "there is insufficient evidence to probe allegations."&lt;ref name="FBI" /&gt; On Friday, May 19, 1993 Sgt. Charles Hedinger, a Hammond police detective, described the Hyles investigation as "open-ended."&lt;ref name="FBI" /&gt;

Jack Hyles said that he welcomed an investigation by the police and he attended a meeting with city officials to discuss it.  Hyles emerged from the meeting saying that there was no investigation.  Confirmation of this came on Wednesday, May 24, 1993, the Chief of Police detectives, Capt. Bill Conner was quoted in the ''Tribune'' saying that, "There is no investigation of the First Baptist Church of Hammond or Jack Hyles".&lt;ref name="No Investigation"&gt;{{cite news|title=No Investigation of Church in Abuse Cases, Police Say|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 1, 1993 The [[Lake County, Indiana]] prosecutor's office stated that it did not have any cases involving Hyles or the First Baptist Church of Hammond.&lt;ref name=Linked/&gt;On the same day, the Hammond Police Department reaffirmed the statement it made the previous month when it confirmed that there was no investigation of Hyles or the church.&lt;ref name="Linked" /&gt;

== Criticism of WJBK ==
Hyles told his congregation that WJBK's news anchorman was fired and 12 sponsors had dropped the evening news, but Mort Meisner, news director for WJBK, said neither of those statements were true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/minister-discusses-abuse-allegations/article_78b800e2-4edc-52be-bcef-c60ef62f1157.html | title=Minister discusses abuse allegations  | publisher= [[The Times of Northwest Indiana]] |date= May 17, 1993  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2012-10-17 | archiveurl= http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/minister-discusses-abuse-allegations/article_78b800e2-4edc-52be-bcef-c60ef62f1157.html | archivedate= 2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1993, ''[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]'' ran a story entitled ''Baptism by innuendo'', which criticized WJBK-TV's reporting. The ''Times'' wrote, "If one were to take the insinuations of Detroit television station WJBK-TV seriously, one could get the impression that the First Baptist Church of Hammond is a sex-crime factory and that its pastors school in Hammond and the affiliated Hyles Anderson College in Schererville are institutions where people minor in molestation."&lt;ref name="innuendo"&gt;[http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/baptism-by-innuendo/article_734ba969-8b7c-52c0-a53f-5961b8f43f07.html Baptism by innuendo] ''[[Northwest Indiana Times]]'' May 19, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The Times also suggested that the May ratings period, which is traditionally known for such similar sensationalized stories, was not a good enough excuse to make up for the poor journalism the stories displayed, concluding that the stories were "a monstrous overreach".  The Times went on to say: "There is no large institution of any kind where some wrongdoers cannot be found. First Baptist and its affiliated institutions are no exception. To tar an entire congregation or student body and alumni with indiscriminate innuendo is highly irresponsible."&lt;ref name="innuendo" /&gt;

Soon afterwards, Hyles gave a speech in which he disputed the latest reports point by point.&lt;ref name="Linked"/&gt; 
During that speech, Hyles said that those that the report indicated had attended Hyles-Anderson College really had not even attended the school.&lt;ref name="Linked" /&gt;  Several hundred people signed a statement supporting Hyles' in an advertisement placed in the Tuesday June 1, 1993  ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;ref name="Linked" /&gt;

'''Psychological dependence''' is a form of dependence that involves emotional–motivational [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms (e.g., [[dysphoria|a state of unease or dissatisfaction]], [[anhedonia|a reduced capacity to experience pleasure]], or [[anxiety]]) upon cessation of drug use or exposure to a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].&lt;ref name="Addiction glossary" /&gt; Physical and psychological dependence are sometimes classified as a facet or component of [[addiction]], such as in the [[DSM-IV-TR]];&lt;ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw" /&gt; however, some drugs which produce dependence syndromes do not produce [[addiction]], and vice versa, in humans.&lt;ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 364–368| edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= The defining feature of addiction is compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Addictive drugs are both rewarding and reinforcing.&amp;nbsp;... Familiar pharmacologic terms such as tolerance, dependence, and sensitization are useful in describing some of the time-dependent processes that underlie addiction.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;br /&gt;''Dependence'' is defined as an adaptive state that develops in response to repeated drug administration, and is unmasked during ''withdrawal'', which occurs when drug taking stops. Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria.  While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction because they do not occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena.  Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfortunate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addiction and psychological dependence are both mediated through [[reinforcement]], a form of [[operant conditioning]], but are associated with different forms of reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Addiction glossary" /&gt; Addiction is a compulsion for rewarding stimuli that is mediated through [[positive reinforcement]].&lt;ref name="Addiction glossary" /&gt; Psychological dependence, which is mediated through [[negative reinforcement]], involves a desire to use a drug or perform a behavior to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal syndrome that results from cessation of exposure to it.&lt;ref name="Addiction glossary" /&gt;

Psychological dependence develops through consistent and frequent exposure to a stimulus. Behaviors which can produce observable psychological withdrawal symptoms (i.e., cause psychological dependence) include physical exercise, shopping, sex and self-stimulation using pornography, and eating food with high sugar or fat content, among others. [[Behavioral therapy]] is typically employed to help individuals overcome psychological dependence upon drugs or [[maladaptive behavior]]s that produce psychological dependence.

Ghausi was born in  [[Ahmedabad]], in the state of [[Gujarat]], India. His father was a sessions judge at [[Junagadh]] High Court and also served as revenue commissioner in [[Manavadar]]. After the partition in 1947, the family migrated to [[Pakistan]]. Ghausi received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A]] degree from Islamia College, Karachi and [[Master of Arts|M.A]] degree from the [[University of Karachi]]. He began his career as an officer at  [[HBL Pakistan|Habib Bank]], but he resigned from the bank and joined journalism in 1970.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

==Career==
Ghausi started his journalistic career joining ''Daily Sun'', his first newspaper job in 1970. He also worked for [[Pakistan Press International]] (PPI), [[Business Recorder]], ''Morning News'' and ''Muslim'' newspapers. Later he joined the daily [[Dawn (newspaper)]] in 1988 and worked there for past two decades.&lt;ref name=TheNation/&gt;
He was respected for his credibility, courage and commitment by the Karachi's journalism community. He was elected four times as  president of [[Karachi Press Club]] and  two times as president of Karachi Branch of [[Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists]].&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://archives.dawn.com/archives/141746|title=Veteran reporter Sabihuddin Ghausi Passes Away|newspaper=Dawn (newspaper)|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghausi was  jailed during [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]]’s military rule and lost his job. He still remained active and also took part in protests against the former military ruler [[Pervez Musharraf]]’s crackdown on the media. He was also a good speaker, and he never hesitated to ask shocking questions.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

Journalist Amir Zia wrote:

{{blockquote|"He often painted a bleak and dismal picture of the state of affairs in Pakistan. His sense of loss of the disappearances of all the values dear to him – from social and individual liberties to freedom of expression, democracy and human rights – was great. Stories by [[Qurratulain Hyder]], the poetry of [[Habib Jalib]], tales of his favourite city [[Mumbai]], the tragedy of [[Bangladesh]], military rule in Pakistan and democratic system of government were some of Ghausi’s favourite and recurring topics."&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;}}

==Death==
He died in [[Karachi]] on 26 March 2009 at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/27-Mar-2009/veteran-journalist-sabihuddin-ghausi-dead-at-65|title=Veteran journalist Sabihuddin Ghausi dead at 65|newspaper=The Nation (Pakistan newspaper)|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daneilshöhle1_(1).jpg|thumb|Billboard at [[Daneil's Cave]]]]
'''Simon Bingelhelm '''(born 1565 in [[Halberstadt]] - June 2, 1600 in [[Gröningen]]), called "Thousand Devils of [[Halberstadt]]", was a [[Germany|German]] robber and [[serial killer]] who was executed for multiple crimes in today's area of [[Saxony-Anhalt]].

== Capture ==
In the spring of 1600, a man was arrested who was believed to be the "Thousand Devils of Halberstadt". He was brought to Gröningen, the then residence of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]], Duke [[Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Henry Julius of Brunswick]], where he was imprisoned and interrogated several times, sometimes under torture.

== Confessions ==
In the course of the interrogations, the man stated that his civil name was Simon Bingelhelm and that he was born in Halberstadt.

He confessed to numerous burglaries and theft offenses, primarily in Halberstadt, but also in [[Wernigerode]], [[Reddeber]], [[Falkenstein, Saxony-Anhalt|Falkenstein]], [[Hoym]], [[Aschersleben]], [[Seehausen, Altmark|Seehausen]], [[Ballenstedt]], Eilenstedt, [[Heimburg]], Klein Quenstedt, [[Westerhausen]], Dardesheim, [[Prenzlau]], [[Salzwedel]], [[Haldensleben]], Neuhaldensleben, [[Calvörde]], [[Derenburg]], [[Herzberg, Ostprignitz-Ruppin|Herzberg]], [[Oschersleben]], [[Schermcke]], Krottorf and [[Quedlinburg]].

He is alleged to have boasted that in 1599 he was the arsonist behind the fire of [[Drübeck Abbey]] monastery, which he watched from the neighboring mountain. He also had a chalice from Rade church and stolen eleven talers from the poverty box of St. George's Church in Derenburg. In addition, he had broken into the Martinique Church with others and stolen the [[poor box]]. In [[Helmstedt]] he stabbed a man for two groschen and a pawn near [[Bernburg]]. At [[Benzingerode]] he killed a young woman eight days before the [[Pentecost]] in 1599. In the forest between [[Hornburg]] and [[Osterwieck]] he tried to rape a 18-year-old girl and later killed her.

In the interrogations, which also took place under torture, the man confessed to a total of 71 different crimes, including involvement in 26 murders. Among other things, he is said to have attacked a pregnant woman, whom he killed with his [[cronies]]. Then they would have slashed her body to get to the unborn child, from whose entrails he then made candles for his next burglary. He was also involved in the robbery and killing of at least five infants.

During the interrogation, this was noted:{{Quote|text="Admit that he, Black Hans, Pothans, Rickel and the fat Marten zu Hessen [on the highway from Halberstadt to Wolfenbüttel] took a child of 3 or 4 years before the gates of a man. The same is a Jew to Berßel want to sell, but which, because it was a Medlein not keep the child. If they had taken it and buried it on the Huy in the Long Meadow in the ground up to the armpit and thrown after it with beards, Pothans had thrown off the child's head. The head at Huy-Neinstedt put back in a cave and the other buried in the ground. The child would always have laughed when thrown at it.
He confesses that he, Schwartze Hanß, Pothans, and Rickel, had four children of three and four years old, stolen, [...] hetted the children to the eight days in the Danneils cave in the Huy, and asked him to negotiate with the Jews to help, but which children do not want the Jews. Derwegen beaten the same death, three in Jürgen Holtz about Schwanebeck and in the Warta one Sarckstedt buried."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citebook|title=A thousand devils, the long Jörg and other bad boys|authors=Jonas Eberhardt and Jörg Brückner|publisher=Neue Wernigeröder Zeitung|volume=12|date=2001|page=22|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Execution ==
On his execution on June 2, 1600 in Gröningen, he was: "attacked with pinces for honor, dragged to the town court, then [[quartered]]."

'''''The Adventures of Quentin Durward''''',  known also as '''''Quentin Durward''''', is a 1955 historical film released by [[MGM]]. It was directed by [[Richard Thorpe]] and produced by [[Pandro S. Berman]]. The [[screenplay]] was by [[Robert Ardrey]], adapted by [[George Froeschel]] from the novel ''[[Quentin Durward]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]].

It was the third in an unofficial trilogy made by the same director and producer and starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. The first two were ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1952) and ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1953). All three were made at MGM's British Studios at [[Elstree]], near London. The film had the distinction of a soundtrack composed by studio music mainstay [[Bronislau Kaper]] rather than [[Miklos Rozsa]], who was busy on other projects at the time the film was ready for scoring.

It was the first big-budget film for the British actress [[Kay Kendall]], and it featured a large contingent of distinguished British players, including [[Robert Morley]].

==Plot==
In 1465, honorable but penniless Scottish knight Quentin Durward (Robert Taylor) agrees to go to France to find out if the beautiful young heiress, Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy (Kay Kendall), would be a suitable wife for his aged uncle (that is, if she is as rich as is claimed). The marriage has been arranged by [[Charles the Bold|Charles, Duke of Burgundy]] ([[Alec Clunes]]) for his [[Ward (law)|ward]] to cement an alliance with Scotland, but she wants nothing to do with it, so she runs away and seeks the protection of Charles' great rival, [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] (Robert Morley), King of France. Quentin pursues and manages to foil an attempted robbery by brigands under the command of Count [[William de La Marck]] ([[Duncan Lamont]]), though Isabelle continues on her way unaware of her protector's identity.

Nearing the court of King Louis, Quentin tries, but fails, to save the life of a gypsy. However, the dead man's brother, Hayraddin ([[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]]), is grateful for his efforts. Louis, who had ordered the man's hanging as a Burgundian spy, and distrusts such honest men as Quentin, orders him to leave France. However, the Scotsman is not easily deterred. He sneaks into the heavily guarded castle and awakens the King in his bed with a dagger at his throat. Louis is impressed and enlists Quentin in his service.

Upon the unexpected arrival of Count Phillip de Creville ([[Marius Goring]]), a Burgundian ambassador seeking Isabelle, Louis orders Quentin to guard her and to keep her presence secret. During the time they spend together, she and Quentin begin to fall in love.

Having lied about Isabelle being there, Louis commands her to depart. She tells him that she will seek sanctuary with an old friend, the [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège|Bishop of Liege]] ([[Harcourt Williams]]). Louis concocts a plan to have De la Marck kidnap and forcibly marry Isabelle to keep her strategically important lands out of Burgundian hands. He has Hayraddin, who is a spy in his employ, take the information and a large bribe to De la Marck. Louis provides Isabelle with a detailed itinerary (the better for De la Marck to find her). He also lends her a few guards, including Quentin, so that when they are killed, it will divert any suspicion away from him. Hayraddin is also sent as a guide. However, when he discovers that Quentin is to be one of the victims, he warns the Scotsman. The three manage to escape the trap and reach [[Liège]], though Quentin is wounded.

When he has recovered, he finally tells Isabelle of his obligation to his uncle, which prevents him from courting her himself, and leaves. De la Marck attacks the castle, captures Isabelle, and kills the bishop when he refuses to marry them. Hearing the sounds of battle, Quentin rescues his love. He slays De la Marck in an unusual duel involving the combatants in the burning bell tower, swinging from the ropes used to ring the church bells.

Meanwhile, the Duke of Burgundy arrests Louis when he comes to continue peace negotiations, accusing him of orchestrating the murder of the bishop. However, Quentin arrives and exonerates the King, providing as proof De la Marck's severed head. Out of gratitude (and in France's best interests), Louis tricks Charles into letting Isabelle decide whom she will marry. Quentin has received news that his uncle has died, so he is free to follow his heart.

==Production==
In 1951, MGM filmed an adaptation of ''Ivanhoe'' by Sir Walter Scott in Britain, starring Robert Taylor and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The studio was so pleased with the results that even before the film was released they were looking at a follow up for Taylor, and ''Quentin Durward'' was suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drama: Young Bids for Goddard in Thriller; Blackmer Set for 'Congressman' |author=Edwin Schallert |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=22 December 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project became a certainty when ''Ivanhoe'' became one of the biggest hits of Taylor's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pledge On Loyalty Sought Of Studios: AMVETS Oppose Employment of Anyone Not Cooperating in Investigations of Films |author=Thomas M. Pryor |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 August 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was scheduled to make the film after completing ''Knights of the Round Table''.

Producer Berman thought that audiences would accept romance if it was presented "at face value, on a pure basis, as a clean unsmutty kind of thing and without sexy overtones. I haven't got any rules to lay down for successful pictures, but one fact is sure today - people want something besides words, beside conversation pieces from the screen. Once in a while you have a 'Streetcar', in which all the actors talk their fool heads off, and it's a hit anyway, but for myself I'm committed to pictures with action and scenic and pictorial scope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More Supercolossals Planned by Berman: Producer of 'Ivanhoe' Schedules Walter Scott Tale and 'King Arthur' |author=Philip K. Scheuer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=14 September 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of female stars were mentioned as possibles to appear opposite Taylor, including [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Ann Blyth]] and [[Grace Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking at Hollywood: Ann Blyth and Robert Taylor to Star in 'Quentin Durward' |author=Hedda Hopper |newspaper=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]] |date=25 July 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Robert Taylor's busy schedule saw [[Stewart Granger]] emerge as a contender to replace him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Michener Project Tempts Robson; Duse Feature Aimed at Kerr |author=Edwin Schallert |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=17 February 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Taylor ended up playing the part.

==Reception==
===Critical===
[[Bosley Crowther]] gave the film a poor review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing, "it lacks for excitement when ... the intrigues of France's Louis XI and the Duke of Burgundy are placed upon the screen in such lengthy and ponderous complexity that they exhaust and befuddle the mind." "The times when this heavily stuffed contrivance does have a tendency to move are when Mr. Taylor is working to get himself out of jams ... And the big terminal fight ... swinging on bell-ropes ... is pretty good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Derring-Do, but Not Enough; Robert Taylor Stars in 'Quentin Durward' |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 November 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506E6D6113AE73ABC4C51DFB767838E649EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
In contrast with ''Ivanhoe'' and ''Knights of the Round Table'' the film did not perform well at the box office - according to MGM records it made $658,000 in the US and Canada and $1,517,000 elsewhere resulting in a $1,226,000 loss.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

'''Transition management''' is a governance approach that aims to facilitate and accelerate sustainability transitions through a participatory process of visioning, learning and experimenting.&lt;ref name=rotmans2001 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]{{cite journal|last=Foxon|first=T|date=September 2008|title=Transition pathways for a low carbon energy system in the UK: assessing the compatibility of large-scale and small-scale options|url=http://www.lowcarbonpathways.org.uk/lowcarbon/.../Sust_Transitions_Conf_paper_Foxon.pdf|journal=7th BIEE Academic Conference, St Johns College|author2=G.P.

== History ==

There have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to motorised cars and the change from physical [[telegraphy]] to the electric [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzen|first=B|title=System innovation and the transition to sustainability: theory, evidence and policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within [[population dynamics]] and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=K|title=The world demographic transition cited by Rotmans et al 2001 "More Evolution than Revolution: Transition Management in Public Policy"|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1945|volume=237|issue=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within [[systems theory]] and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shove|first=E|author2=Walker, G |title=Caution! Transitions ahead: politics, practice and sustainable transition management|journal=Environment and Planning|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=763–770|doi=10.1068/a39310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management for Sustainable Development: A prescriptive, complexity-based governance framework|journal=Governance|year=2010|volume=23|issue=1|pages=161–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt; It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.&lt;ref name=rotmans2001 /&gt;

== Definition ==

Transition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux.&lt;ref name="kemp78"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R |author2=Loorbach, D |author3=Rotmans, J|title=Transition management as a model for managing processes of co-evolution towards sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology|year=2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=78–91|doi=10.1080/13504500709469709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics consider that the current [[political system]] is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="kemp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Loorbach, D |title=Governance for sustainability through transition management|journal=IHDP-conference|year=2003|url=http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/openmtg/docs/kemp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society&lt;ref name="loorbach2007"/&gt; (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging [[Grassroots|bottom-up]] approaches that are supported in a [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.

Unlike traditional forms of regulation that use [[command and control]] techniques, transition management does not seek to '''control''' the uncertainties of change but '''steer''', indirectly '''influence''' and '''redirect''' the choices of actors towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management: New mode of governance for Sustainable Development|year=2007|publisher=International Books|location=Utrecht, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of [[creative destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpter|first=J|title=The Theory of Economic Development|year=1934|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.
&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verbong|first=G|author2=Geels, F |title=Exploring sustainability transitions in the electricity sector with socio-technical pathways|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|year=2010|volume=77|issue=8|pages=1214–1221|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels within sociotechnical systems ===
Most literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.&lt;ref name="kemp2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foxon|first=J |author2=Geoffrey P. Hammond |author3=Peter J. Pearson |author4=Jacquelin Burgess |author5=Tom Hargreaves|title=Transition pathways for a UK low carbon energy system: exploring different governance patterns|journal=Paper for 1st European Conference on Sustainability Transitions: "Dynamics and Governance of Transitions to Sustainability", Amsterdam|year=2009|url=http://www.lowcarbonpathways.org.uk/lowcarbon/publications/Sust_Transitions_Conf_paper_Foxon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Landscape''' (Macro) refers to the overall socio-technical setting that encompasses both the intangible aspects of social values, political beliefs and world views and the tangible facets of the built environment including institutions and the functions of the marketplace such as prices, costs, trade patterns and incomes.

These processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.

* '''Regime''' (Meso) refers to the dominant practices, rules and technologies that provide stability and reinforcement to the prevailing socio-technical systems.

Technological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp106/sewp106.pdf Berkhout, F., Smith A. and Stirling, A. (2003). Socio-technological regimes and transition contexts.] SPRU Electronic Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt; The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Niche''' (Micro) is the level or 'area' at which the space is provided for radical innovation and experimentation. This level is less subject to market and regulation influences and can facilitate the interactions between actors that support product innovation.

Radical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;

Multi-level Perspective
Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.

Figure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png
Geels and [[Johan Schot|Schot]]: 2007&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and [[Johan Schot|Schot, J.W.]], 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass.  The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt;

=== Actors ===

Each level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:

* '''[[Government]]''' which creates top-down pressure from regulation, and the use of market incentives, while also encouraging the 'collective learning process' by supporting innovation financially and providing access to information provided by advisory boards&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotmans|first=J |author2=René Kemp |author3=Marjolein van Asselt|title=More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy|journal=Foresight|year=2001|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=874125&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;
* '''Market-based actors,''' who interact both vertically through the [[supply chain]] and horizontally with other industry leaders to share [[best practice]] and create innovative ideas.
* '''[[Civil society]]''' which is both the user of the end product provided by the market but also [[non-governmental organisations]] which can also provide pressure for change and space for innovation

=== Power and relationships ===

Power within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual [[adaptation]] towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Parto, S |title=Governance for sustainable development: moving from theory to practice|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development|year=2005|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://kemp.unu-merit.nl/pdf/IJSD%208(1)%2002%20Kemp%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== A multi-level framework ==

Kemp ''et al.''&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.

'''Strategic activities''' encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations)&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.

'''Tactical activities''' relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.

Finally the '''operational activities''' constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0–5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform "societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).

A further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change.  One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).

== Practice ==

There are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon ''et al.'' 2009) constitutes the following methodology:

A problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape '''pressures'''. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the '''shared visions''' and goals of the actors.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; The visions outlined are '''long term''' in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and [[blueprints]]. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a [[carbon-neutral]] future include; the [[hydrogen economy]], the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"/&gt;
Although each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.

Once the pathways have been created '''short-term 'interim' objectives''' can be formed through [[Backcasting]] (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt; Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. '''Experiments''' within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options [[snowball]] down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==

Although being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong [[lock-in (decision-making)|lock-in]], socially, politically and technically.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as [[offshore wind power|offshore wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[tidal power]].

At the regime level, institutions such as the [[European Investment Bank]] are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the [[Renewables Obligation]] channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More [[Renewable Obligation Certificates]] are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC|title=Renewables Obligation|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/eligibility/eligibility.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919160717/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/Eligibility/Eligibility.aspx|archivedate=2010-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC |title=The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314173910/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |archivedate=March 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt;

The '''[[Trial (law)|trial]]''' of [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|president]] [[Joseph Estrada]] ('''''People of the Philippines v. Joseph Estrada, et al.''''', 26558 Sandiganbayan, September 12, 2007) took place between 2001 and 2007 at the [[Sandiganbayan]]. Estrada, popularly called Erap, was ousted from office in 2001 during a [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|popular uprising in Metro Manila]] after an aborted impeachment trial in which he was charged with [[plunder]] and [[perjury]]. Soon after his ouster, the same charges were filed against him at the Sandiganbayan.

After a lengthy trial, the Sandiganbayan ruled Estrada not guilty of perjury while ruling him as guilty of plunder and sentenced him to [[reclusión perpetua]]. All of his co-accused were [[acquittal|acquitted]].

==The trial==

===Charges filed===
A few months after the January 2001 popular uprising that ousted Estrada, the [[Philippine Ombudsman]] filed two charges at the Sandiganbayan on April 4, 2001; one for plunder and the other for perjury.
The plunder case consisted of four separate charges: acceptance of 545 million [[Philippine peso|pesos]] from proceeds of [[jueteng]], an illegal gambling game; misappropriation of 130 million pesos in excise taxes from tobacco; receiving a 189.7-million-peso commission from the sale of the shares of Belle Corporation, a real-estate firm; and owning some 3.2 billion pesos in a bank account under the name ''Jose Velarde''.
The minor charge of perjury is for Estrada under-reporting his assets in his 1999 [[statement of assets, liabilities and net worth]] and for the illegal use of an alias, namely for the Jose Velarde bank account.

Estrada's son, [[Jinggoy Estrada]], an incumbent [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]], and [[Edward Serapio]], his personal lawyer were his co-accused. Also charged were [[Charlie Ang]], Yolanda Ricaforte, Alma Alfaro, Eleuterio Tan, Delia Rajas, and Jaime Dichaves, who was later added.

The plunder charge was based upon a complaint filed before the ombudsman by Dante Jimenez, human rights lawyer Romeo Capulong, trial lawyer Leonard de Vera, 1971 Constitutional Convention delegate Ramon A. Gonzales, lawyers [[Antonio T. Carpio]] and [[Dennis B. Funa]]. One complaint was docketed as OMB-0-00-1756 (Romeo T. Capulong, Leonard de Vera and Dennis B. Funa v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada et al.; see Victor Tan Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman et al., G.R. No. 156399-400, June 27, 2008). On January 22, 2001, two days after his implied resignation from office, President Estrada was ordered by the ombudsman to file his counter-affidavit in answer to the complaints. Finding probable cause, the complaint would be filed as Criminal Case No. 26558.

===Arraignment and plea===

===Prosecution's case===
The Philippine government's prosecution team was led by Special Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio and other government lawyers.  Their case against Joseph Estrada was based on the following:

===Defense's case===
Former President Joseph Estrada's defense panel, led by Atty. Estelito Mendoza, and composed of former Supreme Court justices and other celebrated Philippine lawyers based their defense on the following points:

President Estrada recalls the Arroyos plotting with the civil society and the military in January 2000, to take over a year later; 
The House of Representatives impeaching him without debate and voting; 
The Senate blue-ribbon committee not hearing him out; 
The Impeachment Court not citing for contempt the losers in a democratic debate and voting; 
and the Supreme Court conniving with the elite to swear in then-Vice-President Gloria Arroyo at noon of January 20, 2001, 
-(Manila Times, September 30, 2007)

1. The whole process is against the constitution.
a) the legal possibility of removing a sitting president is by impeachment.
Paguia, one of Estrada's lawyers, argues
former President Estrada was not convicted and removed by the Senate acting as an Impeachment Court,  therefore it is unconstitutional to subject him to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. 
-(Manila Times, September 14, 2007)

b) the Supreme Court relied on a biblical, not constitutional passage, with President Estrada still in the Palace

c) the same Court created a special division for President Estrada (not done in the case of the Marcoses and the cronies and the military).

d) Actually, the plot to oust President Estrada was planned by the then-Vice president Arroyo, who met with some political and religious leaders calling for a what she called "Transition Government" under her rule.

2. The Sandiganbayan did not find him guilty of stealing a single centavo of public money. (Manila Times, September 30, 2007)

Lead counsel Estelito Mendoza insisted there is no evidence Estrada received bribe money from jueteng lords. There was also no evidence he received commission money or checks from the Belle transactions.
The one who admitted to receiving bribe money from gambling lords was former governor Chavit Singson of Ilocos Sur. But he was not charged as a co-conspirator. He ran for senator in May 2007 but lost.

3. Fabrication of evidence:
Manrique, a former action officer of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC),  narrated in his affidavit how he, sometime in the last week of October 2001, was contacted by a lawyer(State Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio) who represented himself as a member of the prosecution team in the Estrada cases.

Manrique said the lawyer convinced him to file another perjury case against the deposed president since the original case filed
by the Ombudsman was deemed to be weak and insufficient in evidence.
The lawyer added Manrique’s complaint against Estrada had to be antedated to make it appear that even before the Ombudsman had filed his own case,

4. Saguisag, one of Estrada‘s lawyers said the defense will base its legal argument on the prosecution’s failure to indicate in the information that Estrada had received jueteng money “by reason of his public office,”
“There was no allegation that it was received by reason of his public office. That’s one of the elements of plunder,” (inquirer, September 2007)

5. The Sandigan special graft court has an image problem. It is not perceived as being impartial or independent or even fair.
Reynato Puno has one of the worst trust ratings for a public figure.
(Manila Times September 12, 2007)

===Verdict===
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}
Initial reports of the nature of the conviction pronounced Estrada guilty of the PHP 545 million [[jueteng]] case and the Belle Corporation case, while the other two charges were dropped.

The sentence of [[reclusión perpetua]] also includes the return to the government of the over PHP 200 million Erap Muslim Youth foundation and PHP 189 million Jose Velarde monies, the penalty of civil interdiction, and perpetual absolute exclusion from public office.

The Court has also ordered the arrest of all the other co-defendants in the case.

On September 12, 2007, [[Joseph Estrada]] was acquitted of [[perjury]] but found [[Guilty (law)|guilty]] of [[plunder]] and sentenced to [[reclusion perpetua]] with the accessory [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] of perpetual disqualification from [[public office]] and [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of ill-gotten [[wealth]].

On September 12, 2007, [[Sandiganbayan]]'s Presiding [[Justice]] Teresita De Castro and two other [[magistrates]] unanimously [[acquitted]] his son, Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]], and a [[lawyer]] Edward Serapio of [[plunder]] charges. The [[Fallo]] of the 262-page [[Judgment (law)|Decision]] declared the [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] in favor of the [[government]]: P542.701 million ([[bank]] [[Deposit account|accounts]] including [[interest]]), P189 million (Jose Velarde accounts including interest) and the [[Boracay]] [[mansion]] in New Manila, [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60116/Sandigan-forfeits-Eraps-Velarde-accounts-Boracay-mansion  GMA NEWS.TV,  Sandigan forfeits Erap's 'Velarde' accounts, Boracay mansion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/world/asia/12filip.html?ref=world  New York Times,  Philippines Ex-President Convicted]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the fallo or dispositive part of two [[judgments]] were read (resulting to only 15 minutes [[judicial]] [[proceedings]]).&lt;ref name="Reuters20070912-deadpan"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gopalakrishnan| first =Raju | title =Philippines' Estrada deadpan when sentenced to life| work =International| publisher =Reuters| date =2007-09-12 | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSMAN13152320070912 | accessdate = 2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the reading of the judgment, witnesses said Joseph Estrada cried; his wife, [[Luisa Ejercito Estrada]], Jackie Ejercito Lopez, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] Mayor Joseph Victor "JV" Ejercito, (Estrada's son with Guia Gomez), other family members and [[mistress (lover)|mistresses]] (including, Laarni Enriquez) all [[wept]] during the [[promulgation]] by the clerk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60122/Erap-plunder-drama-The-wife-cried-and-mistress-too  GMA NEWS. TV, Erap plunder drama: The wife cried, and mistress, too]&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrada's lawyer Estelito Mendoza stated that Estrada will file a [[Motion (legal)|motion]] for reconsideration (before September 27) of the 262-page [[Judgment]] and then [[appeal]] the [[verdict]] to the High Tribunal. The Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it will support a [[presidential pardon]] for Estrada. [[Jinggoy Estrada]] said "The people will receive this with moral outrage and disgust. The time of reckoning will come. That time may not be too far now. This verdict is intended to legitimize the occupancy of an illegal tenant in Malacanang."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=asGMIlNrNYB0&amp;refer=home  Bloomberg, Philippines' Estrada Guilty of `Plunder,' Faces Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=88134  Inquirer.net, Estrada to file motion for reconsideration--lawyers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517213115/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=88134 |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrada, in Filipino ''[[barong tagalog]]'' ([[pineapple]] fibre dress shirt and [[cream (colour)|cream]] trousers) with his [[trademark]] [[wristband]] stated that "I thought the role of justice would prevail here but really it's a kangaroo court." President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] stated that the court's [[Judgment (law)|decision]] must be accepted: "We hope and pray that the rule of law will prevail." Estrada's [[counsel]] Rene A.V. Saguisag issued the statement:"It's victors' justice. It's ruling class justice. The special division (of the court) was programmed to convict. We never had a chance." Estrada will [[appeal]] the [[verdict]] and would be under automatic review at the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Reuters20070912-Getslife"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mogato| first =Manny | title =Philippines' Estrada gets life| work =International| publisher =Reuters| date =2007-09-12 | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSMNT00044820070912 | accessdate = 2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrada told [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] that he was resigned for the latest [[drama]] in his [[presidency]]: "last and best performance of my life." The [[prosecution]]'s lead counsel Dennis Villa-Ignacio proudly asserted: "It shows that our judicial system really works. This is the last chance for the state to show that we can do it, that we can charge, prosecute and convict a public official regardless of his stature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/11/philippines.estrada.ap/index.html  CNN.com, Deposed Philippine president given life sentence for plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Estrada rose from obscurity to having been top [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino film]] star, then hit the mark, by claiming the [[presidency]] until [[destiny]] sent him to [[jail]]. He stated to [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] "I feel depressed, but it's my style not to show it." Before the release of the fatalistic [[Judgment (law)|judgment]], he warned that he prevent his fans from making street [[protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJBcBYTMdVCy3vA-o-Z-sJPqjDDg  AFP.google.com,  Estrada: from movie star to Philippine president -- to jailbird] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001232516/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJBcBYTMdVCy3vA-o-Z-sJPqjDDg |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrada returned to his [[villa]] in [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Rizal]] (driven on from a [[golf cart]]), to the [[helicopter]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=88137  Inquirer.net, Estrada back in Tanay resthouse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517213131/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=88137 |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court permitted him to return to his villa, "until further orders".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/11/AR2007091102206.html  Washington Post,  Philippines' Estrada gets life]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}
On September 26, 2007, Joseph Estrada appealed by filing a 63-page [[Motion (legal)|motion]] for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan judgment penned by [[Teresita de Castro]] (submitting 5 legal grounds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder  Monstersandcritics.com, Philippines' ex-president Estrada appeals conviction for plunder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207190457/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder |date=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6271706.html  English.people.com, Convicted Philippine ex-president files reconsideration motion]&lt;/ref&gt; Estrada alleged that the court erred "when it convicted him by acquitting his alleged co-conspirators."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90841   Inquirer.net,   Estrada asks Sandiganbayan to reverse conviction, Cites acquittal of co-accused] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814030420/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90841 |date=2009-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2007, the Sandiganbayan's Special Division ruled to have set for October 19, [[oral argument]] (instead of a defense reply) on Joseph Estrada’s motion for reconsideration. Estrada asked court permission to attend the hearing, since it ordered the prosecution to file comment before October 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/MAIN20071007105086.html  ManilaBulletin, Erap wants to attend Sandigan oral arguments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardon and release from detention===
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}
On October 22, 2007, Acting Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera stated that Joseph Estrada is seeking a "full, free, and unconditional pardon" from President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].  Estrada's lawyer Jose Flaminiano wrote Arroyo: "The time has come to end President Estrada's fight for justice and vindication before the courts. Today [Monday], we filed a withdrawal of his Motion for Reconsideration." Estrada, 70, stressed the "delicate condition" of his mother in asking for pardon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/22/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Estrada.php  IHT, Ousted Philippine president withdraws appeal for his plunder conviction, seeks pardon]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted [[executive clemency]] to Joseph Estrada based on the recommendation by the Department of Justice. Acting Executive Secretary and Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye quoted the signed order: "In view hereof in pursuant of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant Executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights."
Bunye noted that Estrada committed in his application not to seek public office, and he would be free from his Tanay resthouse on October 26, noon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1368473.php/Philippine_leader_pardons_ex-president_Estrada__1st_Lead_  news.monstersandcritics.com,   Philippine leader pardons ex-president Estrada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96730  Inquirer.net, Arroyo grants pardon to Estrada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814075726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96730 |date=2009-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/65884/Estrada-granted-pardon  Gmanews.tv,  Estrada granted executive clemency]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2007, after almost seven years of detention, Joseph Estrada was finally released after the Sandiganbayan promulgated the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96897  Inquirer.net, Sandigan approves Estrada release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814031645/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=96897 |date=2009-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}
On September 14, 2007, chief presidential [[legal counsel]] Sergio Antonio Apostol officially stated that Sandiganbayan Justices [[Teresita de Castro]], Diosdado Peralta and Francisco Villaruz Jr. should decline [[Judicial and Bar Council]] nomination and await other vacancies to ease pressure on President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo: "Para hindi na maipit ang Presidente (In order to spare the President from pressure), they should withdraw their nomination. Parang iyong nangyari kay Justice (Gregory) Ong (Remember what happened in Justice [[Gregory S. Ong]]’s case) ...It’s a sacrifice on her part..Hindi niya maiwanan (ang posisyon) (She cannot leave the Sandiganbayan) because of the case of Joseph Estrada - Erap (Estrada’s nickname)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60521/Palace-urges-Sandigan-justices-to-decline-SC-nomination  GMA NEWS.TV, Palace urges Sandigan justices to decline SC nomination]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[wiktionary:aftermath|aftermath]] of the verdict, De Castro, Villaruz and Peralta are now at the receiving end of two unsolicited advices from key officials. [[Senate of the Philippines]] Majority Leader [[Francis Pangilinan]], [[ex-officio]] member, [[Judicial and Bar Council]] stated that the three Sandiganbayan justices "should have the delicadeza [gentleness] not to accept a promotion to the highest tribunal to dispel any suspicion that they pronounced Mr. Estrada guilty expecting a reward from Palace ... We do not want to see a cloud of suspicion over the appointees to the Supreme Court. They should always be above suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=felMaragay_sept17_2007  ''Manila Standard Today'', A no-win situation]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2007, Senator Jinggoy Estrada, in a privileged speech vowed to block the appointment to the Supreme Court of Sandiganbayan Justices [[Teresita De Castro]] and Francisco Villaruz, Jr. (who convicted his father - President Joseph Estrada). Jinggoy said that: "Such a promotion would seem like a reward in exchange for the guilty verdict against the deposed President. We are convinced, then and now, that the special court created to exclusively try the case of President Estrada was established precisely to convict him, which is what exactly happened."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/67275/Jinggoy-vows-to-block-Sandigan-justices-appointment-to-SC  gmanews.tv,  Jinggoy vows to block Sandigan justices' appointment to SC]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Joseph Estrada opposed court seizure of his assets, stating that: "These properties are mine. I acquired them way back when I was still a movie actor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g0EgxN69JO6hI8K4uh7pDzI7twxA  Afp.google.com,  Estrada blocks Philippine court order to seize assets]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, Sandiganbayan Special Division chairperson Teresita de Castro was appointed as the new associate justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/71299/De-Castro-takes-oath-as-new-SC-justice De Castro takes oath as new SC justice] GMANews.TV&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2008, Edgardo Urieta, Sandiganbayan chief of the Sheriff and Security Services Office released the two-page report (based on thirteen-page [[Banco de Oro]] to the Sandiganbayan Special Division) which discovered intact due to the 2001 levy by BIR distraint - P 1.107 billion ($1 = P 41) account of [[Joseph Estrada]]: P500 million - "promissory note and chattel mortgage"; 450 million shares of Waterfront Philippines valued at P 427.5 million; and 300 million shares of Wellex Industries worth P 84 million; cash deposits in a common trust fund investment account of P 95.76 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/76021/P1-billion-alleged-Erap-fund-discovered-in-Banco-de-Oro   GMA NEWS.TV, P1-billion alleged Erap fund discovered in Banco de Oro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine government, through Presidential Spokesperson Ignacio Bunye has issued a statement to the effect of the government's respect and deference to the authority of the Sandiganbayan, and the hope that this "sad" episode in the country's history will not "permanently distract" the country from peace and progress.

President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] canceled a scheduled attendance at a gathering of business leaders in Makati City that afternoon due to security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60134/Security-threats-thwart-Arroyo-attendance-in-econ-briefing Security threats thwart Arroyo attendance in econ briefing] GMANews.tv.

The '''Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina''', also known as '''Bosnian Turks''', are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] who form the oldest [[Demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ethnic minority]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name=coe&gt;{{cite web|author=Council of Europe|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Bosnia and HerzegovinaLANGUAGES|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/PeriodicalReports/Bosnia%20and%20HerzegovinaPR1_en.pdf|accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish community  began to settle in the region in the 15th century under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, however many Turks emigrated to [[Turkey]] when Bosnia and Herzegovina came under [[Austro-Hungarian]] rule.&lt;ref name=coe/&gt;

==History==
When the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered the [[Bosnian kingdom]] in 1463, a significant [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community arrived in the region. The Turkish community grew steadily throughout the Ottoman rule of Bosnia; however, after the Ottomans were defeated in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13), the majority of Turks, along with other Muslims living in the region, left their homes and migrated to [[Turkey]] as "[[Muhacir]]s" (Muslim refugees from non-Muslim countries).

==Culture==
In 2003 the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Law on the Protection of Rights of Members of National Minorities. According to the Law, the Turkish minority's cultural, religious, educational, social, economic, and political freedoms are protected by the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OSCE|title=National Minorities in BiH|url=http://www.oscebih.org/default.aspx?id=53&amp;lang=EN|accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The [[Turkish language]] is officially recognized as a minority language of Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the 2010 ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Council of Europe|title=List of declarations made with respect to treaty No. 148|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=23/01/05&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2013 census, 1,233 people (817 males, 416 females), 887 of whom lived in the [[Sarajevo Canton]], declared Turkish as their mother tongue whereas 1,108 (738 males, 370 females), 970 of whom lived in the Sarajevo Canton, declared themselves as ethnic Turks.&lt;ref name="popis"/&gt; 

===Religion===
The Turkish minority practice the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]] but tend to be highly [[secular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Minahan|first=James|year=1998|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|place=|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313306109|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community===
Turkish community in Bosnia is well provided, due to historical strong bond between both countries.

==Demographics==
According to the [[1991 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1991 population census]] 267 Turks were living in Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref name=FederalOfficeofStatistics&gt;{{cite web|author=Federal Office of Statistics|title=Population grouped according to ethnicity, by censuses 1961-1991|url=http://www.fzs.ba/Dem/Popis/NacPopE.htm|accessdate=2011-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926213349/http://www.fzs.ba/Dem/Popis/NacPopE.htm|archivedate=2011-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[2013 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina |2013 Bosnian census]] gave a number of 1,108, almost all in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1,097 people).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pop-stat.mashke.org/bosnia-ethnic2013.htm Census 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; More than eighty percent of all Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina live in the capital [[Sarajevo]] (887 people).

==Context==
[[File:D859-072.jpg|thumb|[[Jewish Agency]] representatives meeting Yemenite immigrants, upon arrival at [[Lod airport]] 1949]]

The Yemenite community was well established in [[Ottoman Palestine|Ottoman]] and then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]] by the turn of the century. The State of Israel was created in 1948 and almost immediately began to receive refugees who included both several hundred thousand [[Holocaust survivors]] and Jews who had become refugees as a result of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], which resulted in about 700,000 new immigrants from the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands |last=Shulewitz |first=Malka Hillel |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-4764-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, the population of Israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_01&amp;CYear=2006 |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=7 August 2007 |year=2006 |title=Population, by Religion and Population Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, food, clothes, and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in Israel|Austerity Period]]. Between 1948–1970, approximately 1,151,029 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel.&lt;ref name=bard&gt;{{cite book|last=Bard|first=Mitchell|title= The Founding of the State of Israel|year=2003|publisher=Greenhaven Press|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many arrived as penniless refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ''[[ma'abarot]]''; by 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |title= Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions in the 1950s and After |last=Hakohen |first=Devorah |year=2003 |publisher= Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2969-6}}; for ma'abarot population, see p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearances==

Many of the complaints have common characteristics:

* Almost all the missing children were under the age of 3, they were the children of new immigrants who were less than a year in Israel and who arrived at the newly founded country in the immigration waves of those years (see also [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]), and almost all were descendants of [[Mizrahi Jews]]—especially descendants of [[Yemenite Jews|immigrants from Yemen]].
* Almost all disappeared while in hospitals or when they were allegedly taken to hospitals.
* Almost all the parents received only a spoken explanation that their children had died. The spoken message was only given to the parents when they inquired about the cause of their children's disappearance and in most instances they were told of their child's sudden death only after the funeral (or the alleged funeral) was held in their absence. In addition, the death records were incomplete and many parents never received a [[death certificate]] stating the death of their children.
* Almost all the parents of the children who disappeared received a [[Conscription in Israel|recruitment order]] from the [[Israel Defense Forces]] at a time when their children were supposed to approach the age of recruitment.
[[File:EIN SHEMER - Nurse, mother and baby.jpg|thumb|Nurse with Yemenite mother and child at [[Ein Shemer]] kibbutz 1950]]

The mystery surrounding the disappearance of these children has led to the claim that while many children were recorded as having died, in fact they were either kidnapped or were adopted by rich Ashkenazi Jews in Israel or abroad. The affair has been widely covered in the Israeli media through the decades, and so far four official investigating committees have been established to investigate the claims. The committees have investigated many hundreds of cases, and determined that the vast majority of children actually died and only in a minority cases they did not find enough evidence to determine what really happened.

The peak of the public outcry on the matter occurred in 1994 when Yemenite Rabbi [[Uzi Meshulam]] established an "armed sect" of radical Yemenite Jews in his garden, who barricaded themselves in his home and violently resisted Israeli law enforcement while demanding that the Israeli government establish a State Commission of Inquiry to examine the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yemeni Jews describe their holocaust: Sarah Helm in Yehud reports on claims that Israelis stole 4,500 children from immigrants |author=Sarah Helm |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/yemeni-jews-describe-their-holocaust-sarah-helm-in-yehud-reports-on-claims-that-israelis-stole-4500-children-from-immigrants-1370515.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=April 17, 1994 |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry committees ==
Since the 1960s, the Yemenite children affair has repeatedly been the subject of public debate every few years. As a result, through the years three formal inquiry committees and one public inquiry committee were established to investigate the matter and to expose the truth on this issue.

=== The Bahlul-Minkowski Committee ===
In 1967, the Bahlul-Minkowski Committee was established. After examining 342 cases of disappearances, the committee determined that in 316 of these cases the children died for certain, and that in 2 instances the children were adopted; the other 24 cases were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green light to open Yemenite Jewish graves for genetic tests |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/241060 |website=Israel National News |accessdate=24 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shalgi committee ===
The Israeli government led by [[Yitzhak Shamir]] established a commission headed by Justice Moshe Shalgi which lasted four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Affair - The Yemenite, Eastern and Balkan Children Affair |url=https://www.edut-amram.org/en/the-kidnappings/ |website=The Yemenite, Eastern and Balkan Children Affair |accessdate=24 August 2018 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz Three commissions"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=he:שלוש ועדות חקירה הוקמו ב-25 שנה |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1537277 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=November 4, 2001 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Three commissions were established in 25 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee received new evidence on 301 children, and determined that in 65 of these cases their fate was unknown.

Knesset member and chair of the interior committee, Dov Shilanski, who had overseen testimony given said, ‘I personally believe, in contradiction to the Shalgi report, that there were more than a few cases of kidnapping of Yemenite babies.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Madmoni-Gerber |title=stampata Biblioteca personale     La mia cronologia Libri su Google Play  Israeli Media and the Framing of Internal Conflict: The Yemenite Babies Affair |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780230623217 |page= |pages=99-100 |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=jbLFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=Shalgi+committee+findings&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ibHwd3NZUT&amp;sig=T04LFY-1-bWGFq5xHoCqM3oa0Fw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjv9bz81obdAhUEyRoKHfSlB0sQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Shalgi%20committee%20findings&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kedmi Commission ===
In 1995, immediately after publication of the Shalgi Committee's conclusions, and following a public uproar, the [[Kedmi Commission]] was established.&lt;ref name="Haaretz Three commissions" /&gt; Its conclusions were published in 2001. It found that in the state’s first 6 years, as many as 5000 children may have disappeared. Hundreds of thousands of documents relevant to testimonies and evidence were placed under lock for 70 years and will not be available to the public until 2071.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The shocking story of Israel's disappeared babies |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/shocking-story-israel-disappeared-babies-160803081117881.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee examined more than 800 cases, and did not manage to reach absolute conclusions in 56 of these cases. The committee determined that in 750 cases the children actually died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=State commission: Missing Yemenite babies not kidnapped |author=Moshe Reinfeld |url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/state-commission-missing-yemenite-babies-not-kidnapped-1.73778 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=November 4, 2001 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-examination ===
In June 2016, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] appointed [[Tzachi Hanegbi]], a government minister, to re-examine the evidence in the three previous inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Jonathan|title=The shocking story of Israel's disappeared babies|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/shocking-story-israel-disappeared-babies-160803081117881.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netanyahu said it would "right an historic wrong", and marked a new era of transparency. The government opened up nearly all of the archives of the inquiries putting them online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knell |first1=Yolande |title=The affair of the missing Israeli babies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-40342143 |website=BBC News |accessdate=24 August 2018 |date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disturbing revelations followed in a special Knesset committee about medical experiments that had been carried out on the Yemenite children. Prior testimony given under oath during the previous inquiries revealed that many children had died as a consequence of medical negligence. Further testimony revealed that four undernourished babies died after being administered an experimental protein injection. Violating Jewish tradition, post-mortem examinations were carried out on children who were then buried in mass graves. Children's hearts were removed in some cases and given to US doctors researching the near absence of heart disease found in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knell |first1=Yolande |title=The affair of the missing Israeli babies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-40342143 |website=BBC News |accessdate=24 August 2018 |date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public admission ==
In 2016 after having re-examined evidence given to a commission of inquiry in the late 1990s, Cabinet Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israeli TV: "They took the children and gave them away. I don't know where." The minister admitted that at least "hundreds" of children were taken without their parent’s consent, marking the first time such a public admission had been made by a government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The shocking story of Israel's disappeared babies |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/shocking-story-israel-disappeared-babies-160803081117881.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hundreds of Yemenite Children Were Abducted in State's Early Years, Says Israeli Cabinet Minister |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/hundreds-of-yemenite-kids-were-abducted-1.5418281 |website=Haaretz |accessdate=24 August 2018 |language=en |date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events since ==
After the issue resurfaced, a ''[[Haaretz]]'' investigation found that dozens of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] children vanished in a manner similar to the way the Yemenite children did.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.736574&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2018, after staging a mass demonstration in [[Petah Tikva|Petach-Tikvah]], Yemenite families of children believed to have been abducted were given permission by the State Attorney's Office to exhume 18 graves said to be those of their missing loved ones. Their hope is that, by exhuming their bodies for [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]], if the graves should prove to be empty or that the genetic findings do not match those of their siblings, it would give undisputed evidence of a cover-up in the disappearance of these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yarketzi |first= Dana |coauthors= |title=The Yemenite Children's Affair: The State Attorney's Office Authorized the Opening of Children's Graves - and to Conduct Tests |work= |pages= |language=Hebrew |publisher= Walla News |date= 23 January 2018 |url=https://news.walla.co.il/item/3129488 |accessdate= 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
