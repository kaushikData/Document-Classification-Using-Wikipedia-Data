'''Ambonese Malay''' or simply '''Ambonese''' is a [[Malay language|Malay]]-based [[creole language]] spoken on [[Ambon Island]] in the [[Maluku Islands]] of [[Indonesia]]. It was first brought by traders from Western Indonesia, then developed when the [[Dutch Empire]] [[Dutch East Indies|colonised]] the [[Maluku Islands]]. This was the first example of the transliteration of Malay into the [[Latin script]] and it was used as a tool by [[missionaries]] in Eastern Indonesia. Malay has been taught in schools and churches in Ambon, and because of this it has become a [[lingua franca]] in Ambon and its surroundings.

Christian speakers use Ambonese Malay as their [[mother tongue]], while Muslims speak it as a second language as they have their own language. Muslims on Ambon Island particularly live in several areas in the city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], dominant in the Salahutu and Leihitu Peninsulas. While in the Lease (/leɪ-a-seɪ/) Islands, the Christian Ambonese-speaking community is dominant in parts of [[Haruku]], [[Saparua]] and [[Nusa Laut]] islands. Ambonese Malay has also become lingua franca in [[Buru]], [[Seram]], Geser-Gorom and the south-western Maluku Islands, though with different accents.

While originally based on Malay, Ambonese Malay has been heavily influenced by European languages (Dutch and Portuguese) as well as the vocabularies or grammatical structures of indigenous languages. It is famous for its melodious accent. Muslims and Christian speakers tend to make different choices in vocabulary. [[Papuan Malay]], a Malay creole spoken on the Indonesian part of [[New Guinea]], is said to be derived from Ambonese Malay or [[Manado Malay]] or a mixture of both.

==Morphology==

===Pronouns and person markers===
In Ambonese Malay, personal [[pronoun]]s typically have a full form, as well as another one or more shortened and/or variant forms.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"&gt;Minde, D. (1997). Malayu Ambong (p. 68). Leiden, the Netherlands: Research School CNWS&lt;/ref&gt; The pronouns vary in terms of [[number]] - singular and plural, as well as [[clusivity]], such as exclusive forms which exclude the addressee and inclusive forms which include the addressee. Such distinction is relatively typical of [[Austronesian language]]s. The following table provides a summary of all the pronouns found in Ambonese Malay:

===Etymology===

A number of observations can be made from the pronouns of Ambonese Malay which demonstrate etymology of certain pronouns:

1) A number of pronouns are historically compounded. They are:

* ''Bat'ong''
Derives from ''beta'' 'I (1SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

* ''Kat'ong''
Derives from *''kita'' 'we (1PL) + ''orang'' 'people; man' &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

* ''Dorang''
Derives from ''dia'' 'he; she; it (3SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

2) The 2nd person singular form ''ose'' is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]  pronoun ''voce'', meaning 'you; thou'.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

3) The 2nd person singular form ''ale'' is derived from a vernacular language.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

===Politeness===

Similarly to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the 2nd person singular and one of the 3rd person singular pronouns in Ambonese Malay vary in their degree of politeness. They are summarised in the following table:&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
! Person
! Politeness marking
! Full singular form
! Short singular form
|-
| 2nd
| Markedly impolite
Used in familiar and intimate relationships and when no outspoken respect needs to be expressed

Expresses intimacy. Used among peers, or to people of lower status.
| style="font-style: italic;" | ose

Ale
| style="font-style: italic;" | os
se

al
|-
| 3rd
| Markedly polite. Used by people of younger age to refer to adults and by adults to refer to people of equal or higher social rank.
| style="font-style: italic;" | Ontua; ongtua; antua; angtua
| style="font-style: italic;" | 
|}

It is also important to note that although in Ambonese the 1st person singular form ''beta'' is the standard form, in Classical Malay, it is used only by royal persons speaking to equals of rank.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

===Syntactic positions===

As previously mentioned, Ambonese pronouns consist of a full and one or more variant form. Full forms occur in every syntactic position. Variant form have a more restricted distribution and may be functionally different.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt; The following table summarises the set of full personal pronouns plus (in brackets) their variant forms according to context and syntactic function:

| 3P
| style="font-style: italic;" | dorang (dong)
| style="font-style: italic;" | dorang (dong)
| style="font-style: italic;" | dorang (dong)
|}

From this table it follows that two factors determine whether a personal pronoun can be shortened: syntactic construction and syntactic position:

* Except for the first person singular ''beta'', first person plural ''kat'ong'' and third person singular ''dia'', all pronouns can be shortened in one-word sentences. Third person singular neuter ''akang'' cannot form a one-word sentence altogether.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;
* In clauses all personal pronouns in Subject position may be shortened, except for third person singular neutral ''akang''.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;
* In clauses all personal pronouns in Object position may be shortened, except for first person singular ''beta'', first person plural ''kat'ong'', second person ''ale'' and third person singular ''dia''.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;
* Likewise, as preposition object all personal pronouns except for ''beta'', ''ale'', ''kat'ong'' and ''dia'' may be shortened.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

These facts show that ''se'', ''os'' 'you', ''dong'' 'you', ''ont'o, ant'o, ant'u'' 'he; she' and ''dong'' 'they' have developed into doublets which are functionally (but not semantically) on a par with their full forms, while other short forms (''bet, al, kang, ang'') are phonological variants with a more restricted distribution.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

It is also important to note a number of syntactic variations within the functions of personal pronouns in Ambonese:

1) The 3rd person single ''dia'' 's/he; it' can be shortened to ''di'' or ''de'' when it is in Subject position, or when it is head of a Noun Phrase (NP) in object position.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

2) The 3rd person single ''antua'' (and ''angtua, ontua, ongtua'') is also a modifier of head nominals in a phrase, thereby adding an aspect of deference. It adds a feature respect.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

'''Examples:'''

    (1) ''Ant'o Onggo''
         3S O.
         Mr. Onggo &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

    (2) ''Antua parangpuan sana tu''
         3S woman yonder that
         the woman overthere &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

3) The third form, ''akang'', is a neater pronoun 'it', which also functions as a determiner. This form links up with the demonstratives ''ini'' and ''itu'' for deictic reference: it occurs as a single attribute before nouns, and in combination with postnominal ''tu''.

'''Examples:'''

    (1) ''Akang barang tu''
         3Sn things that
         those goods &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

    (2) ''Akang gunting di mana?''
         3Sn scissors where
         Where are the scissors?&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

4) The short form of ''dorang'', which is ''dong'', also functions as a modifier in NPs to create collective plurals.&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

'''Examples:'''

    (1) ''mama dong''
         mother 3P
         mother and the others (i.e. the children, her family, friends, etc.)&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

    (2) ''Okto dong''
          O. 3P
          Okto and people who are like him &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;
 
    (3) ''Anis dong''
         A. 3P 
         Anis and his friends &lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

===Reduplication===

Reduplication with personal pronouns is not frequent. The following examples denote a concept "referent of pronoun plus persons who are alike":&lt;ref name="Mindep130"/&gt;

'''Examples:'''

    (1) ''De seng datang lia kat'ong-kat'ong''
         3S not come see Red#1P
         He doesn't come to visit people like us &lt;ref name=Mindep130 /&gt;

    (2) ''Macang ose-ose bagini seng bisa dapa akang''
          kind Red#2S like this not can get 3Sn
          People like you now can't get it &lt;ref name=Mindep130 /&gt;

== Phonology ==
Ambonese Malay has phonemic [[word stress]], by which is meant that the position of stress within a word is unforeseeable (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;21) . Van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;22) uses the term “lexically reduplicated morphemes” which means that both of the roots that compose the morpheme contain an important (e.g. stressed) syllable. However, in the case of duplicated [[monosyllable]]s, neither of the roots are perceptible as regards stress. Each accent on the syllables will be marked even if the morpheme is made up of a duplicated monosyllable. The reason being is to differentiate them from morphemes that are '''monomorphemic''' (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;22). Examples of this would be (p.&amp;nbsp;22): 
 ''/g’igi/ ‘tooth’; /pomp’om/ in: /s’agu pomp’om/ k.o sago-cake roasted in cartridge-cases.''

Compare the examples with the following (p.&amp;nbsp;23): 
 ''/’ eleK’ eleK/ ‘oil-lamp made from glass jar’; /t’omit’ omi/ k.o. cherry-like fruit.''

Wordstress is the only different feature in a number of [[minimal pair]]s (p.&amp;nbsp;23): 
 ''/b’acaŋ/ Bacan (island) - /bac’aŋ/ k.o. fruit;''

 ''/p’araŋ/ ‘machete’ - /par’aŋ/ ‘war’;''

 ''/t’are/ ‘to attract s.t.’ - /tar’e/ ‘tight''

=== Vowel phonemes ===
Ambonese contains 5 [[Phoneme|vowel phonemes]] as illustrated in the chart (van Minde 1997, p. 24):

Ambonese Malay do not have phonemic glottal stop /ʔ/ but phonetically the [[glottal stop]] is noticed word-initially, morpheme-initially after a vowel, and morpheme-medially between like vowels (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;24). Examples are (p.&amp;nbsp;24): 
 ''/’ose/ [''ʔ''’ ose] ‘you’;''

 ''/baku’atur/ [baku#''ʔ’atur] ‘to arrange with one another’
In addition, there might be borrowed words from other indigenous languages, there is individual variation, and [ʔ] is occasionally heard (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;24): 
 ''/pa’isal/ [pa''ʔ ‘''isal] = [pa’isal]'' k.o. small proa;

 ''/n’oul. [n’o''ʔ''ul] = [n’oul]'' k.o. fish 
[[Nasal vowel|Nasalised vowels]] happen expectedly before nasal consonants belonging to the same syllable. Due to this, van Minde considers nasalization as a “phonetic phenomenon”. He gave some examples as well (1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25): 
 ''/’aNbo''ŋ/ [ʔ’''ām.bõŋ] ‘Ambon; Ambonese’;''

 ''/kaNp’iNjaŋ/ [kãm.p’ĩñ.jãŋ] ‘churchbell’''

Nasalisation is invalid past syllable-boundaries like for example (p.&amp;nbsp;24-25): 
 ''/an’ioŋ/ [''ʔ''a.n’i.yõŋ] ‘rolled up cloth to support load carried on head’''

 ''/ba#’aNbur/ [ba.'' ʔ''’āmbur] ‘to strew, scatter (repeatedly)''

==== High front unrounded /i/ ====
According to van Minde (1997, p. 25), the high front unrounded vowel /i/ is always perceived as [i], and it always take place in non-final and final closed and open syllables. /i/ in final syllables (whether they are open or closed) can be replaced by /e/ however this only applies in some polysyllabic morphemes. Though /i/ can be replaced by /e/, it does not work in reverse thus it can’t be said the conflict between these two phonemes is negated in that position and environment (van Minde 1997, p. 25).

Besides position and stress, further restrictions on the alternation /i ≈ e/ is given in two [[phonological rule]]s (PR). The change in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not attested in (van Minde, 1997 p. 25):&lt;blockquote&gt;PR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: final syllables ending in /s/;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable contains /u/ or /i/&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Van Minde (1997, p. 25) regards /i/ as a ‘heavy phoneme’ wherever there is a change /i ~ e/, which means in environments that are different from those interpreted by PR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The definition of ‘heavy phoneme’ is defined as “consists of one or more optional distinctive features in addition to the basic distinctive features, whereas a basic phoneme consists of basic distinctive features only” (Ebeling 1967; Stokhof 1975). Van Minde deduces that /i/ is a heavy phoneme in environments excluded by PR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; /e/ being its basic phoneme and [relative highness] is a voluntary feature. Examples are given in the following (p.&amp;nbsp;25):
 ''/katiNd’isaŋ/ [katĩnd’isāŋ] ‘to talk or rave while sleep’''

 ''/ir/ [ʔir] ‘drunk’'' 
* '''closed final syllables''' (p.&amp;nbsp;26)''':''' 
 ''/k’ukis/ [k’ukis *k’ukes] ‘biscuit’''

 ''/kac’il/ [kac’il *kac’el] ‘small’''
* '''open final syllables''' (p.&amp;nbsp;26)''':'''
 ''/p’uti/ [p’uti *p’ute] ‘white’''

 ''/h’ari ≈ h’are/ ‘day’''

==== Mid front unrounded vowel /e/ ====
The mid front unrounded vowel /e/ is perceived as [e] (or [ē] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&amp;nbsp;26): 
 ''/b’esi/ [b’esi] ‘iron/steel’''

  ''/b’erkaT/ [b’erkat-] ‘divine blessing’''
The phonemic status of /e/ versus /i/ is attested by the followed minimal pairs (p.&amp;nbsp;26):
 ''/’ina/ ‘mother’ - /’ena/ ‘tasty, delicious’''

 ''/p’ici/ ‘to peel’ - /p’eci/ ‘mud’'' 
The examples illustrated distinctly that /i/ is resistant to /e/ in morpheme-final syllables, hence the change /i ≈ e/ in final syllables under the previous restrictions stated in the phonological rules cannot be clarified as neutralization (van Minde 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27).

==== Low central vowel /a/ ====
The low central vowel in Ambonese Malay is perceived as [a] (or [ā] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&amp;nbsp;27):
 ''/’añer/ [ʔ’añer] ‘bad fishy smell’''

 ''/kal’apa/ [kal’apa] ‘coconut’''

The minimal pairs attest the resistance between /a/ and /i/ (p.&amp;nbsp;27):
 ''/s’atu/ ‘one’ - /s’itu/ ‘there’''

 ''/bal’a/ ‘to split s.t.’ - /bal’i/ ‘to buy s.t.’''

The opposition between /a/ and /e/ is shown by the presented minimal pairs (p.&amp;nbsp;27):
 ''/cak’a/ ‘to strangle s.o.’ - /cak’e/ ‘(vulg) to eat, stuff o.s.’''

 ''/b’aca/ ‘to read’ - /b’eca/ ‘pedicab’''

==== High back rounded vowel /u/ ====
/u/ happens in non-final and final closed and open position. This high back rounded vowel is always perceived as [u] (or [ũ] due to nasalization). However, /u/ in final unstressed syllables (whether open or closed) consistently alternates with /o/ when in certain polysyllabic morphemes (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;27). In addition, not all /o/ in this position and environment alternates with /u/, thus these two phonemes are not balanced. According to van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;27), the change /u ≈ o/ in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not proven in (p.&amp;nbsp;27):&lt;blockquote&gt;PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable have /u/ or /i/&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This situation is alike to the change between the high and mid front vowels /i ≈ e/, where /u/ is seen as a heavy phoneme, /o/ as the basic phoneme and [relative phoneme] is the optional feature. The following examples prove this assertion (p.&amp;nbsp;28): 
 ''/t’obu/ [t’obu] ≈ /t’obo/ [t’obo] ‘sugar cane’''

 ''/’uNpaŋ/ [ʔ’ ũmpãŋ] ‘bait’''
* '''Closed final syllables''' (p.&amp;nbsp;28)''':'''
 ''/c’aNpur ≈ c’aNpor/ ‘to mix’''

 ''/c’abuT ≈ c’aboT/ ‘let’s go!’''
* '''Open final syllables''' (p.&amp;nbsp;29)''':'''
 /tapar’egu ≈ tapar’ego/ ‘to do s.t. hurriedly’

 /cap’atu ≈ cap’ato/ ‘shoe’ 
* '''Minimal pairs shown to the resistance between /u/ and /i/''' (p.&amp;nbsp;29)''':'''
 /k’utu/ ‘louse’ - /k’uti/ ‘snap’

 /g’ula/ ‘sugar’ - /g’ila/ ‘mad’ 
* '''The resistance between /u/ and /e/ can be shown by''' (p.&amp;nbsp;29)''':'''
 /b’ulaŋ/ ‘moon, month’- /b’elaŋ/ in: /aruNb’ aI b’elaŋ/ k.o. large proa

 The resistance between /u/ and /a/ is attested by:

 /’uru/ ‘to massage’ – /’aru/ ‘Aru Islands’

==== Mid back rounded vowel /o/ ====
The mid back rounded vowel /o/ is seen as [o] (or [õ] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&amp;nbsp;29): 
 ''/’oraŋ/ [‘orãŋ] ‘man, human being’''

 ''/b’odo/ [b’odo] ‘stupid’''
* '''The minimal pair show the phoneme status of /o/ vis-à-vis /i/''' (p.&amp;nbsp;30)''':''' 
 ''/b’oŋko/ ‘bowed (of persons)’ – /b’eŋko/ ‘bend sideways (of persons)’'' 
* '''The phoneme status of /o/ against /a/ is shown by''' (p.&amp;nbsp;30)''':'''
 ''/kat’oŋ/ ‘we’ - /kat’ aŋ/ ‘crab’'' 
* '''The resistance between /o/ and /u/ is proven by''' (p.&amp;nbsp;30)''':'''
 ''/h’ori/ ‘to wander about’ – /h’uri/ ‘having lost its original shape’''

==== Archiphoneme /U/ ====
[[Archiphoneme]] /U/ is proposed in unstressed position after a vowel other than /u/ and instantly before a syllable or morpheme boundary by van Minde (1997). This is because there is '''no opposition between /u/ and /w/ in this environment''' (p.&amp;nbsp;31)'':'' 
 ''/l’aUtaŋ/ [l’autãŋ] ‘deep-sea’''

The second reason propoed by van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;32) is that '''/U/ occurs after a consonant and directly before a stressed vowel''' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): 
 ''/bU’aya/ [bu’aya] ‘crocodile’''

Nevertheless, '''not every pattern /Cw’V/ is collateral by a sequence /CU’V/''' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): 
 ''/swaK/ [swak-] ‘weak, feeble’''

==== Archiphoneme /I/ ====
This results from the neutralization of the resistance /i/-/y/ in unstressed position after a vowel or instantly before a stressed vowel (p.&amp;nbsp;32): 
 ''/m’uI/ [m’ui, muy] ‘aunt’'' 
* Van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;32) showed some examples of '''/I/ before a stressed vowel:''' 
 ''/I’a/ [I’a, iy’a] ‘yes (formal)’''

 ''/bI’asa/ [bi’asa] ‘normal, usual’'' 
* '''The resistance of /i/ and /y/''' is shown by (p.&amp;nbsp;33): 
 ''/t’iU/ [t’iyu] ‘uncle’''

=== Consonants ===
There are '''19 [[consonant]]s phonemes''' and '''4 consonant [[archiphoneme]]s''' in Ambonese Malay and they are charted below (van Minde 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–41):

==== Archiphonemes /P, T, K, N/ ====
These archiphonemes is a consequence from the neutralization of the opposition between /p/- /b/, /t/-/d/, and /k/-/g/ respectively in two positions and under certain conditions (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;40):

1.    Frequency of /P, T, K/ is especially high in word-final position. Most words with /P, T, K/ in this position are borrowed words from Dutch (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;41). This is due to the many words of Malay origin to have lost final stops *p, *t, *k, or *ʔ. Example: ''*tutup &gt; tutu ‘to close’.''

Wordfinally the archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization. Examples are shown (p.&amp;nbsp;41): 
 ''/keP/ [kep-] ‘notch, nick’ (&lt;Dukeep)''

 ''/’aNbaK/ [ʔ’ãmbak-] ‘character, habit’''

A significant number of polysyllabic words with non-final stress have a doublet without final /P, T, K/ in non emphatic speech (p.&amp;nbsp;41):
 ''/r’unuT ≈ runu/ ‘fibroid material growing on palm trees’''
In addition, van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;42) states that /P, T, K/ are “heavy archiphonemes” in this position and environment.

2.    The archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization in syllable-final position right before a stop, a nasal, fricative /s/, or the lateral /l/. Example is shown (p.&amp;nbsp;42): 
 ''/b’aKso/ [b’ak-so] ‘(Chinese) meatball’''

Archiphoneme /N/ is also developed from the neutralization of the opposition between /m, n, ñ/ and /ŋ/ before their own homorgonaic obstruents /l/ (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;42). Example is followed (p.&amp;nbsp;42): 
 ''/naNl’ohi/ [nãnl’ohi] Nanlohi (clan name)''

==== Stops ====
The [[Stop consonant|voiceless and voiced stops]] of the series /p, b, t, d, c, j, k, g/ are found in word-medial position and word-initial. /p, b/ are bilabials, /d/ is an apico-alveolar, /c, j/ are laminal-palatals, /t/ is an apico-alveodental, /k, g/ are dorsal-velars. Relevant (near) minimal pairs are shown below (van Minde 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44):
* ''p: b /t’aNpa/ ‘place stop’; /t’aNba/ ‘to add s.t.’''
* ''p: t /p’aku/ ‘nail’; /t’aku/ ‘afraid’''
* ''p:d /b’apa/ ‘term of address’; /bad’a/ ‘skin powder’''
* ''p:c /p’ipi/ ‘cheek’; /p’ici/ ‘to give money’''
* ''p:j /p’ari/ ‘ray (fish)’; /j’ari/ ‘finger’''
* ''p:k /p’ele/ ‘to obstruct’; /k’ele/ ‘to press under arm’''
* ''p:g /p’araŋ/ ‘machete’; /g’araŋ/ ‘salt’''
* ''b:t /b’aru/ ‘new’; /t’aru/ ‘to place’''
* ''b:d /b’apa/ ‘term of address’; /d’apa/ ‘to obtain’''
* ''b:c /b’ole/ ‘may’; /c’ole/ ‘bodice’''
* ''b:j /b’aNbaŋ/ ‘to warn’; /j’aNbaŋ/ ‘beard’''
* ''b:k /b’ore/ ‘posionous extract’; /k’ore/ ‘to fumble’''
* ''b:g /b’aru/ ‘new’; /g’aru/ ‘to scratch’''
* ''t:d /t’ulaŋ/ ‘bone’; /d’ulaŋ/ ‘wooden tray’''
* ''t:c /t’ari/ ‘dance’; /c’ari/ ‘to search’''
* ''t:j /t’ari/ ‘dance’; /j’ari/ ‘finger’''
* ''t:k /t’anaŋ/ ‘to plant’; /k’anaŋ/ ‘right (side)’''
* ''t:g /t’ali/ ‘rope’; /g’ali/ ‘to dig’''
* ''d:c /d’aro/ ‘from’; /c’ari/ ‘to search’''
* ''d:j /d’aro/ ‘from’; /j’ari/ ‘finger’''
* ''d:k /d’aki/ ‘dirt’; /k’aki/ ‘foot’''
* ''d:g /d’oti/ ‘to work magic’; /g’oti/ ‘trough for preparing sago’''
* ''c:g /c’ari/ ‘search’; /j’ari/ ‘finger''
* ''c:k /coK/ ‘choke’; /koK/ ‘owl’''
* ''c:g /c’ili/ ‘chili’; /g’ilig’ili/ ‘tickle’''
* ''j:k /j’aNji/ ‘to agree’; /k’aNji/ ‘starch’''
* ''j:g /j’aga/ ‘to keep watch’; /g’aga/ ‘beautiful’''
* ''k:g /k’araŋ/ ‘coral’; /g’araŋ/ ‘salt’''
In certain lexical items there is an unexplained change between the voiceless stop and its homorganic voiced counterpart (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;44): 
 ''/cigulu/ = /jigulu/ ‘riddle’''

==== Nasals ====
The nasals /m, n, ñ, ŋ/ are separated on the basis of the following (near-) minimal pairs (van Minde 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45):
* ''m:n /m’ani/ ‘bead’; /n’ani/ ‘bamboo hoe’''
* ''m:ñ /m’adu/ ‘honey’; /ñ’adu/ ‘brother/sister in-law’''
* ''m:ŋ /m’ana/ ‘where’; /ŋ’ana/ ‘(inter.) gee!’''
* ''n:ñ /ne/ in /b’ubur ne/ k.o. porridge; /ñe/ in” /m’uka m’acaŋ ñe/ ‘look disappointed’''
* ''m:ŋ /’ina/ ‘mother’; /’iŋa/ ‘to remember’''
* ''ñ:ŋ /t’aña/ ‘to ask’; /t’eŋa/ ‘middle’''

The prevalence and functional load of these nasal contrasts differently. They take place word-initially and word-medially before vowels. However, in the environment of word-initially, the functional load of /ñ/ and /ŋ/ is low. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;45): 
 ''/ñ’amu/ [ñ’amu] ‘mosquito’''

 ''/ñoŋ/ [ñõŋ] ‘term of address for boys’''
In morpheme-final position, nasals other than /ŋ/ are barely proven and thus van Minde (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;46) finds it hard to find minimal pairs that are different in morpheme-final nasal phoneme.

==== Fricatives ====
The labio-dental [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] /f/ takes place only in borrowed words and in words of unknown origin. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;46):
 ''/f’ader/ [f’ader] ‘term of address for men’''
The alveolar fricative /s/ happens in word-initial, -medial, and –final position. Examples are shown (p.&amp;nbsp;47): 
 ''/saw’aI/ [saw’ai] ‘awry’''

 ''/rab’us/ [rab’us] ‘to boil’''
The glottal fricative /h/ takes place word-medially and word-initially. However, in the use of interjections such as /ih/ ‘Hey!’ and /ah/ ‘Oh no!’- /h/ occur word-finally (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;47) .

Also, word-medial /h/ is optional in certain words; when /h/ is removed between like vowels, one of the two adjacent vowel segments is also deleted. Examples are illustrated below (p.&amp;nbsp;47): 
 ''/bah’asa/ ≈ /basa/ ‘language’''

 ''/mas’ohi/ ≈ /mas’oI/ ‘mutual aid’''

==== Liquids ====
The liquids /l/ and /r/ take place in word-initial, -medial, -final position, just like the [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar fricative]] /s/. Example is shown (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;48): 
 ''/t’ari/ [t’ari] ‘dance’''

==== Semivowels ====
The [[semivowel]]s /w/ and /y/ happen in word-initial and word-medial position before a vowel. Example are shown below (van Minde 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;48):
 ''/hay’al/ [hay’al] ‘to flirt’''

 ''/kal’uyu/ [kal’uyu] ‘shark’''

== Samples ==
Examples:
* ''Beta pung nama Ahmad'' = My name is Ahmed
* ''Ose su tau Ahmad pung maitua?'' = Do you know Ahmed's wife?
* ''Jang bakudapa deng dia dolo, dia ada gagartang deng ose'' = Don't meet with him for a moment, he's angry with you.
* ''Susi dong pung kaka mo pi kamari'' = Susi's brother will come
* ''Ini beta kasi akang voor ose'' = This is for you.
* ''Ale badiang jua, beta cumang mo tipu-tipu Tuang Ala'' = Shut up, I am tricking God (for joking)
* ''Beta seng tau'' = I don't know

Ambonese word samples:
* ''Beta''		   = I
* ''Ose, Ale''	           = you (ose is derived from the Portuguese ''voce'')
* ''Dia''		   = he, she
* ''Akang''		   = (may) it
* ''Katong''	           = we (cut from ''kita orang'')
* ''Dong''	           = they (cut from ''dia orang'')
* ''Kamong'', ''kamorang'' = you (pl) (cut from ''kamu orang'')
* ''Antua''		   = he, she (respectful form)
* ''iyo''		   = yes
* ''seng''		   = no
* ''bakubae''              = peace
* ''nanaku''               = pay attention to something
* ''su''                   = already (indicating something has already happened or has been done)

A '''baserri''' ({{IPA-eu|bas̺eri}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''caserío vasco''; [[French language|French]]: ''maison basque'') is a traditional [[half-timbered]] or stone-built type of [[housebarn]] [[farmhouse]] found in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in Northern [[Spain]] and [[Southern France|Southwestern France]]. The baserris, with their gently sloping roofs and entrance portals, are highly characteristic of the region and form a vital part in traditional Basque societal structures.&lt;ref name=Mad&gt;Madariaga, Nikola de ''Baserrietxea eta Eusko Etxegintza Errikoia'' Bizkaiko Aurrezki Kutxa: 1983&lt;/ref&gt; They are also seen to have played an important role in protecting the [[Basque language]]&lt;ref name=Gar&gt;Garate, G. ''27.173 Atsotitzak'' [[Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa]] Fundazioa: 1998 {{ISBN|84-89476-68-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in periods of persecution by providing the language with a very dispersed but substantial speaker base.

==Origins and historical development==
[[Image:BaserriLizarralde.jpg|thumb|The half-timbered baserri of Lizarralde in [[Bergara]]. This is a ''hiruarriko'' with the extension on the left of the main building.]]
The term baserri is derived from the roots ''basa'' "wild" and ''herri'' "settlement"&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denotes a farmstead not located in a village or town. People who live on a baserri are referred to as ''baserritarrak'' ({{IPA-eu|bas̺eritarak}}), a term which contrasts with ''kaletarrak'' ({{IPA-eu|kaletarak}}) (street people), i.e., people who live in a town or city.

The present-day term baserri in Basque has a fairly restricted meaning, denoting the building and its occupants, especially in the [[Gipuzkoan]] dialect. Originally, however, it denoted the building (still called in some places ''baserri-etxea'' 'baserri house'), its dwellers and the whole estate. The originally wide connotation of the term is related to the inherent ambiguity of the Basque word ''herri'' which can be translated as "land", "home", "people" or "settlement" depending on the context.

In Spanish, mostly the term ''caserío vasco'' is used but note that a ''[[Hamlet (place)|caserío]]'' may also denote an entire settlement in parts of the Spanish speaking world. In [[French language|French]], the term ''maison basque'' is commonly encountered, although this overlaps to some extent with the Basque concept of [[etxea]] (the house).

Overall, they are almost non-existent in the flatter terrains of [[Álava]] and central and southern [[Navarre]] (''Ager Vasconum''). These areas went through a more thorough period of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]], in which the ancient Roman ''[[wikt:fundus|fundi]]'' provided the grounds for the new small population clusters and villages that dotted the whole region at the turn of the first millennium, after Muslim raids stopped. They are often named after an old landowner, e.g. [[Barbarin (surname)|Barbarin]], [[Andoin]], [[Amatrain]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Caro Baroja, Julio | year = 1985 | title = Los vascones y sus vecinos | publisher = Editorial Txertoa | location= San Sebastian | isbn = 84-7148-136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Navarre, parts of Álava and parts of the Northern Basque Country, baserris often form rather spaced out settlements, but virtually never wall-to-wall to minimise fire risks.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Baserris in [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Biscay]] on the whole are solitary buildings, but generally within view of another baserri.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

[[Image:BaserriGizaburuaga.jpg|thumb|left|A stone-built baserri in [[Gizaburuaga]].]]
The predecessor of the baserri was the farming community of the late Middle Ages in the hilly Atlantic area, who at one point had learnt and taken up sowing and harvesting (cf. the legend of [[San Martin Txiki]]). The families didn't live in baserri buildings as we know today, but in clusters of small wooden fragile shacks with room enough for the family, the cattle and the stored hay.&lt;ref name="Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bertan.gipuzkoakultura.net/bertan4/ing/1.php | title = Baserria. The Basque Farmhouse in Gipuzkoa | publisher = Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia | accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the press house, granaries, pigsty and sheepfolds were located in separate buildings.&lt;ref name="Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia"/&gt; At this stage, the baserri stands clearly for the whole community behind the economic unit. This period also saw the development of the linguistic counterpart to the baserri for religious matters, the ''baseliza'' or "wild church".

During the 14th and 15th century, as the population began to grow, agricultural activity increased and so did the linking of agricultural activities and animal husbandry on a baserri, leading to an increase in the number of baserris. The late 15th and the 16th century are a period of peace among warring nobiliary factions after years of clashes, in which exactions and abuses on farmers had been rife, leading to a time of optimism and stability. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American]] and Andalusian conquest opened new opportunities, with small fortunes made by Basque venturers, which propelled the construction of baserris, thriving in the hundreds.&lt;ref name="Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia"/&gt; [[Maize]] from the Americas substituted less productive [[millet]], taking its Basque name ''arto''. While private land ownership had been known if not widespread in the southern parts of Álava and Navarre since Roman times, most land further north was still [[common land]] in this period.&lt;ref name=Kasper&gt;Kasper, M. ''Baskische Geschichte'' Primus: 1997 {{ISBN|3-89678-039-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Councils fostered the building activity with tax exemption on tree chopping for baserri construction, which enabled Basque farmers to develop swathes of common land into privately owned baserris.&lt;ref name=Kasper/&gt;
Several of these new baserris were named simply ''[[Etxeberria]]'', "the new house".

At this transitional stage, the baserri buildings consisted of timbered structures that are barely reminiscent of dwellings, made up often in oak from the surrounding forests. In fact, the central position in the house was occupied by the press, since cider was a very important economic activity for the family's economy. Then, families started to move in for the initially [[sagardotegi|cider producing mill]], cattle stall and granary, eventually complementing or even replacing its original function with the dwelling. A well-known example of this type of baserri is the [http://www.euskonews.com/0278zbk/gaia27804eu.html Igartubeiti] baserri (built 1530), now an interactive museum and exhibition space, hosting events related to cider making (e.g. [[txalaparta]]) and traditional rural live.

The first stone farmhouses in Gipuzkoa (which entailed timber frames anyway) were built during the 15th century and brought admiration and envy from their neighbours. Only the richest farmers could permit themselves the luxury of building a house ''"de cal y canto"'' ("of lime and stone"), paying a team of stonemasons who dug out and worked the stone. Oakwood was, on the other had, cheap and available.&lt;ref name="Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia"/&gt; The increased building activity led to some of the earliest recorded [[environmental law]]s concerning [[deforestation|de-]] and [[reforestation]], such as the law passed by the [[Elizate|Batzar]] of [[Azkoitia]] in 1657 which forbade the cutting of young trees and required anyone felling a tree to plant two new trees in its place.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

[[Image:San Juan Iturriotz1.jpg|thumb|The Baseliza (hermitage) of Iturriotz in [[Aia]].]]
In the [[Northern Basque Country]] these are often called ''borda'', a term that originally referred to shepherding shelters. The extension, both structurally and terminologically, of the term to refer to a farmhouse rather than shelter occurred in the 17th and 18th century when further increases in the population led to the development of such summer pasture shelters into farmhouses.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

The 17th century is also the last period in which baserris with [[half-timbered]] façades were constructed.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Later constructions are virtually all in solid stone (except for the central section above the recessed portal to avoid structural problems).&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; From the 18th century onwards, the remaining half-timbered elements were replaced by using stone arches above the entrances.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

==Significance==
[[Image:ateburu.jpg|thumb|left|The lintel stone above a baserri in [[Aria]]; note the [[lauburu]] on the bottom left and the [[sun symbol]] on the bottom right]]
A baserri represents the core unit of traditional Basque society,&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt; as the ancestral home of a family. Traditionally, the household is administered by the ''etxekoandre'' (lady of the house) and the ''etxekojaun'' (master of the house), each with distinctly defined rights, roles and responsibilities. When the couple reaches a certain age upon which they wish to retire, the baserri is formally handed over to a child. Unusually, the parents were by tradition free to choose any child, male or female, firstborn or later born, to assume the role of ''etxekoandre'' or ''etxekojaun'' to ensure the child most suitable to the role would inherit the ancestral home.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

[[Image:OrbeArmarria.jpg|thumb|The crest stone above the Orbe baserri in Angiozar, Spain, displaying the coat of arms of the [[Marquessate of Valdespina]]]]
The baserri [[Fuero|under traditional law (the ''fueros'')]] cannot be divided or inherited by more than one person. This is still the case in the [[Southern Basque Country]] but the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code]] in France, under which such practices are illegal, greatly upset this tradition in the North.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt; Although the Basques in the north chose to be "creative" with the new laws, it overall resulted in the breakup and ultimate financial ruin of many baserris.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

In practice the tradition of not breaking up baserris meant that the remaining children had to marry into another baserri, stay on the family baserri as unmarried employees or make their own way in the world (''Iglesia o mar o casa real'', "Church or sea or royal house").

As such, most baserris have a large stone-carved sign built into the front wall called ''armarriak'' (crest-stones) and a decorative [[lintel]] stone above the entrance called ''ate-buru'' or ''[[atalburu]]'' (door head).  The lintel stone usually states who built the house and the year in which it was built. The ''armarria'' either states the name of the village or valley or the family's surname and is often in the style of a [[coat of arms]], a sign of the universal [[Hidalgo (nobility)|gentry]] enjoyed in Biscay. The latter practice of displaying the surname is mostly found in the Southern Basque Country.&lt;ref name=Orh&gt;Etxegoien, J. ''Orhipean'' Xamar: 1996 {{ISBN|84-7681-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are often also carved with Basque symbols, many of them pre-Christian, such as the [[lauburu]], animals, plants and mythical figures.

Many [[Basque surnames]] stem from place-names and more especially from baserris. However, these surnames are deceptively older than the baserri-etxe, i.e. the baserri building, referring to the community and site preceding the building.&lt;ref name="Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia"/&gt;

A considerable number also have apple-presses and barrel storage facilities built into the structure of the baserri for the production of Basque [[sagardotegi|cider]].

==Structure==
Although different building styles exist with features specific to each region, most share a common core design. Most have three floors with stables within the building and a gently sloping roof, stone supporting walls and internal constructions made largely from wood.

===Basic types===
The baserri is designed to be modular in the sense that additional wings can be added onto the primary structure to allow the building to be extended if necessary. The core building is referred to as ''biarriko'' ("two stone one"), comprising two main supporting walls; a ''hiruharriko'' ("three stone one") with an extension on one side and a ''lauarriko'' ("four stone one") with two extensions, one on either side of the original building.&lt;ref name="Orh"/&gt;

===Floorplan===
The floorplan is almost invariably rectangular, with a narrow end forming the façade. The façade usually has windows on all three floors and at least one large entrance, often two.

The conventional floor distribution usually has:
* The stables for cattle on the ground floor on one side of the building, the kitchen, washroom and sitting room on the other
* Sleeping quarters on the first floor, usually above the stable to minimise the need for heating. On the outside, this floor often also has one or more balconies.
* A large attic for storing produce and indoor activities requiring more space; this attic space is often open or partially open to the outside on the front of the house to ensure ventilation.&lt;ref name="Orh"/&gt;

===Kitchen and ovens===
[[Image:LabritEtxea.jpg|thumb|Labrit Extea in [[Itzalle]] with an external oven on the first floor.]]
Indoors, the kitchen (''sukalde'' in Basque) was the centre of activity and social interaction. Originally the fire was located in the centre of the kitchen (similar to Scottish [[blackhouse (building)|blackhouse]]s) with a wall-mounted iron rotatable arm but were eventually replaced by fireplaces built into the wall with a [[chimney]].&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

Although commonly encountered on the ground floor, it is not uncommon for kitchens to be located on the 1st floor. If this was the case in the colder regions of the Basque Country, the compulsory [[Masonry oven|bread oven]] was built on a little [[balcony]], with only the opening facing into the kitchen to minimise fire risks.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; In the more temperate regions, the bread oven was usually separate from the main baserri building.

===Roof===
Historically, the roofing material was [[Roof shingle|wood shingles]] made from [[beechwood]] but today in most regions baserri have tiled roofs. The [[Basque surname]] ''[[Telletxea]]'' ("the tile house") is seen to stem from that era when [[terracotta]] [[tile]]s replaced the earlier shingled roofs and the first person to have a tiled roof being singled out for this fact.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Wood-shingle roofs mainly survive in the mountainous parts of [[Navarre]] and [[Soule]] suffering from high snowfall, as wooden roofs allow for more steeply angled roofs which prevent buildup of snow.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

The [[eaves]] are characteristically large, in particular on the front façades, but usually much smaller or non-existent on the opposite side. To reduce wind resistance, the north-facing aspect of the roof is often built in a style called ''miru-buztana'' ([[Kite (bird)|kite]] tail) - essentially a [[hip-roof]].&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

===Entrance portal and façade===
[[Image:Ossès Maison.jpg|thumb|An urban baserri with red-stained wood in [[Ossès|Ortzaize]]. Note also the lack of a recessed portal.]]
On older baserris, the entrance portal can take up up to a third of the façade's surface, often requiring one or more supporting pillars.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; It almost invariably faces south-east (i.e. opposite to the [[Windward and leeward|weather side]]) and irrespective of the views.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Along with the disappearance of half-timbered façades in the 18th Century, the portals which were originally built in wood gradually disappeared and were replaced by stone-built portals.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

The wood in half-timbered façades was traditionally stained red with a paint made from olive oil, [[ochre]] and ox blood,&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; although today commercial paints are often used. The white between the timbers was achieved by painting the surface with [[lime plaster]].&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

The portal (''ataria'' in Basque) had a central role in the everyday life of the baserritarras, being home to activities ranging from a wide variety of social activities to grinding flour and animal slaughtering.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

In areas where baserris grouped together in loose settlements, the portal was transformed into a large doorway, usually with a two-wing door which was also split horizontally.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

===Granaries===
[[Image:GereixaIbarguren.jpg|thumb|left|The granary in of the Ibarguren baserri in [[Markina-Xemein]].]]
Although on most baserris produce is stored inside the main building, some have stand-alone [[granary|granaries]] called ''garai'' in Basque. These are small, wooden or stone-built structures on [[staddle stones]]&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; and very reminiscent of such granaries in other parts of the world.

==Tower farmhouses==
[[Image:ArangurenDorretxea.jpg|thumb|right|The Aranguren baserri in [[Orozko]], converted from a fortified tower.]]
Some baserris seem to defy the normal definition of a baserri. In many cases, these are the result of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay and Gipuzkoa ordering the [[tower house]]s (''dorretxeak'' in Basque) razed following centuries of [[History of the Basque people#Late Middle Ages|Basque partisan wars]].&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Many were converted into non-military buildings, resulting in rather unusual baserris.

==Modern developments==
Traditionally, [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[pastoral]] activities formed the mainstay of the inhabitants of a baserri but due to recent economic and societal changes, [[agrotourism]] has also become a major activity on baserris.

==Traditions and superstitions==
[[Image:Eguzkilorea.jpg|thumb|right|A silver thistle on the door of the Igartubeiti baserri.]]
Various cultural traditions and superstitions surround the baserri.

One is the habit of fixing dried [[Carlina acaulis|silver thistles]] (called ''eguzkilore'' or "sunflower" in Basque) to the doors of a baserri for good fortune. Folklore has it that certain unwelcome spirits such as [[Lamia (Basque mythology)|laminas]], witches or devils only operate at night and attaching this flower to the door would lead these beings to assume the sun was shining on the baserri and therefore stay away.&lt;ref name=Orh/&gt; By a similar extension of belief, they were also supposed to protect against lightning strikes and storm damage.&lt;ref name=Orh/&gt;

'''Bernard S. Benson''' (28 January 1922 – 15 May 1996) was an inventor and British author and writer of ''The Peace Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cv4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,3462405&amp;dq=bernard-benson+the-peace-book&amp;hl=en|title=Greene acquires a Canadian publisher |date=30 January 1982|publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|''Montreal Gazette'']]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a fighter pilot during World War II, and later worked on the design of early British missiles. He emigrated to the United States where at Douglas Aircraft Co., in Santa Monica, CA, he worked on the Douglas F4D Delta wing fighter and various Douglas missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Social Security Death Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VSVY-X44|publisher=familysearch|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 1950s, he founded [[Benson-Lehner Corporation]] with George F. G. Lehner, a psychology professor at UCLA.  Soon after its founding, futurist [[Donald Prell]] joined the company as Vice President, Application Engineering.  The new company was successful, as it filled a niche designing systems that were used to provide data input and output to and from the early computers.  The B/L machines semi-automatically read oscillograph and photographic flight test data producing punched tape and IBM punch cards which were then entered into computers.  After being processed, the data was then automatically printed on large flatbed graph-plotters.  This process automated the formerly manual reading and subsequent hand-plotting of data.  B/L plotters soon became the industry standard, and were sold worldwide. After an [[IPO]] the company expanded into the field of high speed photography.  Two photo-mechanical engineers, Guy Hearon and Harry Katt, were hired, who designed a series of 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm high speed cameras and accessories.

In 1961, Benson was one of the first persons to warn against the privacy risks raised by computers, claiming that digital data could one day be fed into a single system, leaving individuals at the mercy "of who or what controls the machine".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Fuster, Gloria González. 2014. The Emergence of Personal Data Protection as a Fundamental Right of the EU. Springer Science &amp; Business. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B.Benson.JPG|thumb|left|Bernard Benson whilst living in France]]

Early in the 1960s, Benson retired and moved to France, where he purchased the Chateau de Chaban located in the Dordogne.  While living there with his first wife Jane Lysbeth Saville Sneath and their seven children, he began writing children's books based on the philosophy of a group of Tibetan monks, who shared his estate.  Benson tried to make their philosophy readily understandable to both young and old. He then married Maryse Lheureux and had three daughters.

Books that were published included: ''The Minstrel'', an allegorical story about Elvis Presley, ''Alice in Plunderland'', ''Strictly Birdsmanship (or how to lay the egg that kills the golden goose)'', and  ''On Being an Egghead; or Engineersmanship for the Shell of it''.

In 1699 group of the [[Dörbet (Choros clan)|Dörbets]] of [[Oirats|Oirat]], a Choros clan within the [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribe, migrated from the [[Buddhist]] Kalmyk people in the [[Volga River]] area to join the [[Don Cossacks]] people. They eventually became called the Buzava Kalmyks. 

They resettled with the Don Cossacks along the middle and lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in Kalmykia.

In 2017, Hungary had 92 homicides at a rate of 0.94 per 100,000 according to the office of the prosecutor general.&lt;ref&gt;http://ugyeszseg.hu/pdf/ogy_besz/ogy_beszamolo_2017_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===General===
Between 2008-2013, there were an average of 4,000 crimes against every 100,000 members of the population, of which at least 50% were considered serious crimes.&lt;ref name="budapestreport"&gt;[http://www.budapestreport.com/2011/02/14/hungary-to-boost-police-force/] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3871">'''Cyberpolitics''' is a term widely employed across the world, largely by academics interested in analyzing its breadth and scope, of the use of the [[Internet]] for political activity. It embraces all forms of [[social software]]. Cyberpolitics includes:   [[journalism]], [[fundraising]], [[blog]]ging, volunteer recruitment, and organization building. 

The campaign of [[Howard Dean]], in which a previously little-known former Democratic governor of a small state emerged for a while as the front runner for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic presidential nomination]] on the strength of his campaign's skill in cyberpolitics, was a wake-up call to the American political establishments of political parties around the United States as to the importance of cyberpolitics as both a concept and as a series of organizational and communications strategies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''''Diana of the Crossways''''' is a novel by [[George Meredith]] which was published in [[1885 in literature|1885]].  It is an account of an intelligent and forceful woman trapped in a miserable marriage and was prompted by Meredith's friendship with society beauty and author [[Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton|Caroline Norton]].

The heroine Diana Warwick says: "we women are the verbs passive of the alliance, we have to learn, and if we take to activity, with the best intentions, we conjugate a frightful disturbance.  We are to run on lines, like the steam-trains, or we come to no station, dash to fragments.  I have the misfortune to know I was born an active.  I take my chance."  Her efforts to advance her husband, through cultivating a friendship with Cabinet Minister Lord Dannisburgh, leads to scandal and alienation from her husband, Augustus Warwick. Her intention to live "independently" through writing, are initially successful, but her involvement in politics brings her to grief, both personal and public.

Diana, beautiful, charming and intelligent but hotheaded, becomes embroiled in a political as well as a social scandal (the politics are based on the troubled history of [[Robert Peel]]'s administration, and the 1845 [[Corn Laws]] in particular).

==Adaptation==
In 1922 the novel was adapted into a film ''[[Diana of the Crossways (film)|Diana of the Crossways]]'' directed by [[Denison Clift]] and starring [[Fay Compton]] and [[Henry Victor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6812">'''Diaosi''' ({{zh|c=屌丝 |p=Diǎosī}}) is a Chinese slang term, often used in a comedic manner, that refers to a young male of mediocre appearance and social standing. Born in a humble family, he has no car, no house, and no connections. Yet as the term went viral on the Internet, Chinese youth (regardless of sex) from all backgrounds began to embrace it. It is slowly transforming into a descriptor of the ordinary Chinese citizen who faces everyday struggles and hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Clair|title=Hip, Young, and Wired: China's 'Diaosi', in Charts|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/06/hip-young-and-wired-chinas-diaosi-in-charts/277359/|work=The Atlantic|date=2013-06-29|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903081933/https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/06/hip-young-and-wired-chinas-diaosi-in-charts/277359/|archive-date=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The term ''diaosi'' (屌丝) – literal meaning "dick hair" – first appeared in an online dispute between two sub-forums of the BBS [[Baidu Tieba]] in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Xu|first=Zidong|title="A Q Spirit" in Diaosi|url=http://v.ifeng.com/news/society/201303/c976ee26-201a-4633-983b-0e203b959986.shtml|language=zh-hans|publisher=v.ifeng.com.cn|date=2013-02-28|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309155721/http://v.ifeng.com/news/society/201303/c976ee26-201a-4633-983b-0e203b959986.shtml|archive-date=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Thunder’s Big Three forum were insulted by the term, "diao" (a [[swear word]] or an offensive expression for "penis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/18/js/5C4C.htm|title=屌的解释|language=zh-hans|website=汉典 zdic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so they threw ''diaosi'' (dick hair) back at the [[Li Yi (footballer)|Li Yi]] forum, suggesting that Li Yi’s membership were inferior. Rather than take offence, Li Yi’s membership incorporated the term and identified with it.

The slang term emerged as a comedic insult, similar to the Western equivalent of "living in your mother's basement" – shorthand for "You're brave enough in a web forum but who are you in real life?" &lt;ref name=red&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=CHINA POWER: Could This Be China's Youth Movement?|url=https://thediplomat.com/2013/03/could-this-be-chinas-youth-movement/|publisher=The Diplomat|date=2013-03-30|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324123830/https://thediplomat.com/2013/03/could-this-be-chinas-youth-movement/|archive-date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese term, [[otaku]], also has a lot of similarities with diaosi.

The term became a buzzword, referring to a young man born in a humble family, with mediocre appearance and standing and working in a dead-end job. He has few prospects, is unable to purchase luxuries; he is an [[Outcast (person)|outcast]] from the social mainstream. Their time is mostly spent on the computer, especially online games.  [[Programmers]] and media industry workers have the highest percentage of self-identified ''diaosi''.  He also dreams of having a "goddess" as a girlfriend, but when interacting with said "goddess" he feels inferior and behaves awkwardly, knowing the "goddess" belongs with a "gaofushuai", his polar opposite: tall, rich and handsome.

Like many insults, an initially vulgar epithet became a self-ascribed identity, in a classic example of a group on the outskirts of society claiming a once derogatory term as their own.&lt;ref name=pink&gt;{{cite web|last=Marquis|first=Chris|title=Diaosi: Evolution of a Chinese Meme|url=http://www.civilchina.org/2013/07/diaosi-evolution-of-a-chinese-meme/|publisher=Civil China|date=2013-06-27|language=en|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123152346/http://www.civilchina.org/2013/07/diaosi-evolution-of-a-chinese-meme/|archive-date=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diaosi has become an almost universal identity among Chinese [[netizen]]s. A survey conducted by Internet giant Sohu found that 64, 81 and 70 percent of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, respectively, can identify themselves with the feeling of being a diaosi.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite web|last=Song|first=Sophie|title=Chinese 'Diaosi' May Have More Purchasing Power Than The Nation's Super-rich|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-diaosi-may-have-more-purchasing-power-nations-super-rich-1555676|publisher=International Business Times|date=2014-02-14|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324125337/http://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-diaosi-may-have-more-purchasing-power-nations-super-rich-1555676|archive-date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another report carried out by the Chinese gaming company Giant, in April 2013, says that some 529 million young people (approximately 40 percentage of the total population of China) across the country now embraces the term diaosi.&lt;ref name="Thatsshenzhen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kan|first=Karoline|title='Diaosi': Understanding China's Generation X  Karoline Kan|url=http://online.thatsmags.com/post/diaosi-understanding-chinas-generation-x|website=That’s Shenzhen|date=2013-10-18|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330051104/http://online.thatsmags.com/post/diaosi-understanding-chinas-generation-x|archive-date=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although diaosi is often translated as "loser" in English, this is becoming less and less apt, with the growth of diaosi's popularity. Loser remains an indisputably negative term, personal in its injury, while diaosi is a true [[meme]]: dynamic, complex, and current, cultural rather than personal.&lt;ref name="pink"/&gt;  The ambiguous meaning of diaosi – both as an insult and tribal term – is similar to the American term, redneck, whose poverty and unrefined behavior can not only be a source of pride, but a culture in and of itself.&lt;ref name="Thatsshenzhen" /&gt;

== Social background ==
{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2014}}
Today, it is common to hear Chinese people proclaim that it’s nearly impossible for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain entry to the country’s upper class. The rate of students of rural background in a renowned university continues to decline. At the same time, the implementation of compulsory education means that more and more youngsters go to college, creating a surplus of educated young men who find it hard to enter the labour market. So not only do physical labourers feel they are marginalised by the society, the young men with a higher education background also feel helpless.

{{World economy}}
The '''economy of South America''' comprises approximately 410 million people living in twelve nations and three territories. It encompasses 6 percent of the world's population.

From the 1930s to 1980s, countries of South America used [[Import substitution industrialization|Import Substitution]], an economic policy which replaces foreign businesses as well as imports with domestic production. This was a policy made to produce more development and help grow domestic businesses, which are not competitive with other international industries. However, this policy created a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/South-America/The-economy|website=South America|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South America was falling farther behind the Western countries over the past two centuries. This can be explained by South America´s high concentration on primary commodities as well as the state of the educational system and institutional structure, some of which are still related to its colonial past, others to recent political developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=153|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only from the 1990s when countries in South America switched over to the system of [[Market economy|Free-Market economy]]. This eventually pulled countries in South America out of the debt crisis. Now, major economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[forestry]], and [[mining]].

In 2016, four countries, which include [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela|República Bolivariana de Venezuela]] experienced decline in output. Other countries in the region were observing slowdown in [[Economic growth|growth rates]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/852411493655498052/Global-Economic-Prospects-June-2017-Latin-America-and-Caribbean-analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil saw this decline in output due to increasing [[unemployment]] level, worsening financial conditions and [[Politics|political]] issues, which, in turn, lead to decrease in [[Consumption (economics)|private domestic consumption]] and [[investment]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Argentina also experienced [[recession]] in private consumption and investment, however it was because of removal of [[public service]] [[Subsidy|subsidies]] due to short-term rise in [[inflation]]. In contrast, [[Peru]] differed from other countries in the region - demonstrating increase in growth rates thanks to [[copper]] production.

In 2017, the economy has started to recover for the first time since 2014. The main contributors to economic growth is private consumption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/125721512062602134/Global-Economic-Prospects-Jan-2018-Latin-America-and-Caribbean-analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[retail trade]] and [[industrial production]] in Brazil has led to expansion of its economy by 1% in 2017. Higher [[Government spending|public investments]] and private consumption have resulted in growth of economy of Argentina compared to its recession in 2016.

In 2017, [[inflation rates]] were observed to be in a downward trend in most of the major economies. The reasons are prior [[exchange rate]] appreciations and food price [[deflation]]. Some countries are even expected to lower their target bands in 2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Economic sectors==

===Agriculture===
Through history, since the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial period]], the export of natural resources has been key factor for South America's economy. With a land that can be divided into four [[climatic regions]] ([[tropical]], [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[arid]] and [[cold]]), [[South America]] is a diverse land that is rich in natural resources. It has a wide variety of agricultural products, mineral wealth, plentiful freshwater and rich fisheries.

As one of the most important contributors of the world's agricultural market, [[South America]] accounts for approximately 10% of the global agricultural product export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agria Corp|url=http://www.agriacorp.com/market.asp?id=10|website=South American Market|publisher=Agria Corporation.|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different [[climatic regions]] are home for diverse types of [[crops]]. In the tropical climatic regions, two of the most important [[cash crops]] are [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cacao]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/south-america-resources/|website=South America Resources|publisher=National Geographic.|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; South America dominates the global market in [[coffee production]], having Brazil as the world's largest exporter of coffee. A report from the Council of Brazilian Coffee Exporters showed that the coffee industry earned US$5.4 billion in 2016, with the exports of different coffee varieties exceeding 34 million 60&amp;nbsp;kg bags. This accounts to 6.4% of Brazil's total annual [[agrobusiness]] exports of US$84.9. The report showed that by December 2016, the Brazilian coffee industry generated US$557 million in revenue by exporting 3.07 million bags of [[coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BrazilGovNews|url=http://www.brazilgovnews.gov.br/news/2017/01/brazil-breaks-another-record-in-coffee-exports|website=Brazil breaks another record in coffee exports|publisher=BrazilGovNews.|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2016 [[soybeans]], grown in South America's [[temperate climates]], had an export value of US$19B for [[Brazil]] , representing 10.4% of the total exports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Observatory of Economic Complexity|url=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/bra/|website=Brazil|publisher=The Observatory of Economic Complexity|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of US$3.23B for [[Argentina]], representing 5.7% of the country's total exports.&lt;ref name="atlas.media.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Observatory of Economic Complexity|url=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/arg/|website=Argentina|publisher=The Observatory of Economic Complexity|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[soybean meal]] exportation represent 17.5% of Argentina's total exports, with an export value of $9.96B.&lt;ref name="atlas.media.mit.edu"/&gt;

Other exports from the [[tropical regions]], such as the [[Amazon rainforest]] (contained within [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] [[French Guiana]] and [[Suriname]]), include [[cashews]] and [[Brazil nuts]], globally regarded as delicacies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-America/Precious-metals-and-gemstones#ref41832|website=Agriculture|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sugar ([[sugarcane]]), [[avocados]], [[bananas]], [[pineapples]], [[oranges]], [[grapefruits]], and [[mangoes]].  The [[sugarcane]] cultuivation has been since early colonial times the backbone of the economy, and Ecuador is the world's largest banana exporter ([[Banana production in Ecuador|Banana Production in Ecuador]])

In the [[temperate regions]], [[corn]] is produced and it is the second most exported product in Argentinas.&lt;ref name="atlas.media.mit.edu"/&gt; Additionally in cold climatic regions such as the Andes, there is a high production of crops such as quinoa, increasingly valued internationally, as well as the grazing of llamas, vicuñas and alpacas. These animals are bred for their wool and it is exported globally as a high-quality textile.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"/&gt;

===Industry===
80% of manufacturing of the Latin America region falls on Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-gbc-latin-america-economic-outlook-july-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]] has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, [[aircraft]] ([[Embraer]]), and consumer durables.

===Mining===
[[Chile]] contributes about a third of the world [[copper]] production. Brazil is the world's leading producer of [[niobium]] and [[tantalum]], and Peru is the largest silver producer and the second-ranked producer of bismuth and copper.

The current census now includes household information.

The most recent census (as of 2011) emphasized reaching rural and remote areas to map the most accurate population count in the country. The 2010 census was conducted in November and December, and its results were published January 27, 2011.

'''Emergency circulating notes''' were currency printed by the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] [[Government in exile]] during [[World War II]]. These "guerrilla pesos" were printed by local government units and banks using crude inks and materials. Due to the inferior quality of these bills, they were easily mutilated.

The Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]] under [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[José P. Laurel]] outlawed possession of guerrilla currency and declared a [[monopoly]] on the issuance of money and anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested or even executed.

===Apayao===
[[File:5 centavo emergency circulating note, Apayo, Philippines, during the Japanese occupation - Spurlock Museum, UIUC - DSC06073.jpg|thumb|right|5 centavo emergency circulating note, Apayo]]

Apayao was one of the sub-provinces which comprised the [[Mountain Province]] during World War II. In the remote sub-province of Apayao, Deputy Governor Milton Ayochok assumed, the authority granted by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] to print emergency currency. On September 11, 1942, the Apayao Provincial Board authorized the printing of currency to provide for the budget for fiscal year 1942-1943. A Currency Committee was formed composed of Deputy Governor Ayochok as Chairman, with Deputy Treasurer M. Medina and Deputy Auditor F.A. Enciso as members.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====First Issue (1942)====
The First Issue was printed from hand-engraved plates. Records state that a total of [[Philippine peso|₱]]105,495 was issued. Printing probably took place at [[Kabugao, Apayao|Kabugao]], its provincial capital in conjunction with the printing of the [[Cagayan]] fourth issue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Second Issue (1943)====
The Second Issue was produced by [[mimeograph]]. Official records of this issue were captured by the [[Japan]]ese. Known serial numbers would indicate that this issue equaled or possibly exceeded the previous issue and was probably intended for the fiscal year 1943-1944 budget.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Bohol===
On May 22, 1942, Japanese occupation forces established garrisons at [[Tagbilaran]], the provincial capital, and [[Guindulman, Bohol|Guindulman]] where they operated manganese mines. On January 9, 1943, resistance officers and provincial officials who had not surrendered established a "free" government with Conrado D. Marapao as governor. Eventually its jurisdiction was established over 34 of the 35 municipalities. Just prior to the surrender, President Quezon had authorized Bohol to issue ₱150,000 in emergency currency. This authority was the basis for printing currency to finance the free government and the resistance force. The Currency Board consisted of Provincial Auditor Dalmatio Ramos as Chairman, with Provincial Fiscal José C. Borromeo and Acting Provincial Treasurer Doreteo Toledo as members. 

In June 1943, radio contact was established with President Quezon, who authorised an additional ₱200,000. In September, President Quezon authorised an additional ₱1 million. The printing took place in the town of [[Carmen, Bohol|Carmen]]. Notes were printed in black on [[manila paper]] of varying thickness, except for a few hundred notes on [[white paper]]. Serial numbers were applied in two different styles of type.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Reflecting the changing political climate, the representation of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic]] minorities in [[comic books]] have also evolved over time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} This article is intended to document and discuss historical and contemporary racial and ethnic [[stereotypes]] in the medium of mainstream comics.

==Sociopolitical impact of comics==
Throughout history, comics have reflected the [[sociopolitical]] attitudes of their writers and readers. In America, early comics consisted primarily of short, [[humorous]] comic strips printed in [[newspapers]]. In the 1930s, comics evolved into longer, [[Action genre|action]]-oriented storylines and transitioned into the comic medium format. It began addressing important contemporary political issues. For example, some have suggested that the [[Wonder Woman]] character and title evolved as a vehicle to communicate pro-American attitudes during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Emad, M.C. [http://www.d.umn.edu/~memad/ReadingWonderWomanPaperFinal.htm "Reading Wonder Woman’s Body: Mythologies of Gender &amp; Nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514124858/http://www.d.umn.edu/~memad/ReadingWonderWomanPaperFinal.htm |date=2006-05-14 }}. ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', 2004 (Author notes: 
Reading Wonder Woman’s Body: "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-Men]] creator, [[Stan Lee]] has frequently cited{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as the inspiration for his mutant team of superheroes, and has translated many of the tensions of majority-minority race politics into the X-Men title.

Nonetheless, for many years, comic book characters noticeably lacked racial and ethnic diversity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Comics writer and artist [[Kev F. Sutherland]] said "...when you look at the shelves and see half the titles on sale are characters like [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] - dammit, these characters weren't even allowed to be Jewish like their creators, let alone be black." &lt;ref&gt;http://comicsbulletin.com/black-couples-in-comics/&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the influence of comics on [[popular culture]], some members of ethnic and racial communities have focused their attention on stereotypes within comics, and have begun lobbying to change them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} This is accomplished in many ways, frequently{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} by either writing new character of color or "trans-racializing" existing characters from Whites to racial or ethnic minorities (e.g. the changing of [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]'s race from White to Asian{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}).

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:MELUScov.jpg|thumb|right|MELUS Vol. 32, No. 3 (Fall 2007)]]  --&gt;Given the recent popularity of injecting characters of color into popular comic titles,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} a new concern has arisen regarding possible [[tokenism]], and many writers advocate not just the inclusion of characters of color into predominantly White casts of characters, but that these minority characters defy the racial and ethnic stereotypes so prevalent in the history of comics, as well as maintaining the high standard of comic book writing. Daley Osiyemi, creator of ''[[Brodie's Law]]'' and co-founder of Pulp Theatre Entertainment said, "...we don't just want black characters or superheroes in comics as mere tokens, they have to be strong characters in their own right and have strong stories built around them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2007 the scholarly journal ''MELUS'' (publication of the [http://www.melus.org Society for the Study of Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States]) devoted an entire issue to the literary and sociological representations of race and ethnicity in comics.  The issue was guest edited by Derek Parker Royal, and it included essays on older graphic narratives (such as Jackie Ormes's ''[[Torchy Brown]]'' and Miné Okubo's ''Citizen 13660''), more recent graphic novels ([[Ho Che Anderson]]'s ''King'', [[Ben Katchor]]'s ''The Jew of New York'', and Mark Kalesniko's ''Mail Order Bride''), as well as various comic book series (Dwayne McDuffie's ''[[Deathlok]]'', [[Adrian Tomine]]'s ''Optic Nerve'', and Los Bros Hernandez's ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'').  [[Gilbert Hernandez]] illustrated the cover, and the issue included an interview with him as well.

==Black==
An early black character to be incorporated into a syndicated comic strip was Lothar, who appeared in [[Mandrake the Magician]] in the 1930s. He was Mandrake's sidekick: the circus strongman, who wore a [[Tarzan]]-style costume, was drawn in the [[Little Black Sambo|Sambo]]-style of the time (see below) and was poor, and uneducated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbr.com/issue-35-6/ |title=Afros, Icons, and Spandex: A Brief History of the African American Superhero |last=Hogan |first=Eric |date=5 February 2004 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=2 September 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040316102202/http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=oym&amp;article=1835 |archivedate=16 March 2004 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coloring the Comic Books"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2003/07/coloring-the-comic-books/ |title=Coloring the Comic Books |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |date=19 July 2003 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=2 September 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918080837/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/07/59683 |archivedate=18 September 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of Lothar, black characters have received a variety of treatments in comics, and not all of them positive.

===Physical caricatures===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ww blackcaricature.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a caricature of African Americans in DC's ''Wonder Woman''.]] --&gt;
Early graphic art of all kinds often depicted Black characters in a stylized fashion, emphasizing certain physical features to form a recognizable racial caricature of Black faces. These features often included long unkempt hair, broad noses, enormous red-tinted lips, dark skin and ragged clothing reminiscent of those worn by Black [[Slavery|slaves]]. These characters were also depicted as speaking accented English. In the early 20th century [[United States]], these kinds of representations were seen frequently in newspaper comic strips and [[political cartoons]], as well as in later comic magazines, and were also present in early cartoons by [[Disney]] and [[Looney Tunes]]. In comics, nameless Black bystanders and even some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including [[The Spirit]]'s sidekick [[Ebony White]] (see next section) and [[Billy Batson]]'s valet Steamboat.

====Ebony White====
[[Writer]]-[[artist]] [[Will Eisner]] is sometimes criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the young [[African American]] [[sidekick]] of Eisner's 1940s and 1950s character The Spirit. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with "responsibility", and argued that "at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity".&lt;ref&gt;''Time''.com (Sept. 19, 2003): [http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,488263,00.html Will Eisner interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xJHSYosY?url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,488263,00.html |date=2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced black characters (such as the plain-speaking Detective Grey) who defied popular stereotypes.

In a 1966 ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' feature by his former office manager-turned-journalist, Marilyn Mercer wrote, "Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early [[Minstrel Show]], he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of [[Tom Sawyer]] and [[Penrod]], with a touch of [[Horatio Alger]] hero, and color didn't really come into it".&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Marilyn, "The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter", ''New York'' (Sunday supplement, ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''), Jan. 9, 1966; reprinted ''Alter Ego'' #48 (see under References below)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savages===
{{See also|African characters in comics}}
Critics of the portrayal of early Black characters note the frequency with which Black characters were shown as uncivilized savages, frequently shown with bones in their ears, noses, and hair.&lt;ref name="Coloring the Comic Books"/&gt;

====Tintin in the Congo====
{{Main|Ideology of Tintin}}
The artist [[Hergé]] received much{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} criticism for his first comics. ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', from 1930, presented the typical colonial view [[Belgium|Belgians]] had about the people in [[Belgian Congo]], including the [[missionary]] bringing civilization to the uneducated blacks. According to one reviewer, "the Africans are portrayed as primitive, simple-minded folk".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0867199024 Amazon editorial review]&lt;/ref&gt; Hergé, 23 years old at the time, defended himself as being naïve instead of intentionally racist. Nevertheless, the album wasn't translated into English until very recently, due to those concerns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Animals===
The historian [[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]], author of ''Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945'', argues that the need for comic strips to appeal to diverse national audiences in the USA meant that the outright racial caricatures of minstrelsy did not translate to the comic strips with any commercial success. Instead artists and writers developed "de-raciate" Black stereotypes in the form of funny animal characters the first of which Felix the Cat owed his existence directly to the [[racialized]] humor of a strip named "Sambo and His Funny Noises." Other examples of such characters include [[Krazy Kat]], created by [[George Herriman]] who was born creole but died white, and [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Ian. ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1588340317 Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945]. (Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blaxploitation era===
{{See also|List of black superheroes}}
In the late-1960s and throughout the 1970s, several African-American heroes were created in the vein of [[Blaxploitation]]-era movie protagonists, and seemed to be a direct response to the notable [[Black Nationalist]] movement.  These (predominantly male) heroes were often martial artists, came from the [[ghetto]], and were politically motivated. They were frequently pitted against White villains, representing the Black struggle against 'The Man': a catch-all phrase popularized during the Civil Rights Movement to represent the White power structure. However, as much as the Blaxploitation era superheroes contrasted earlier racial caricatures of Blacks in comics, one attribute remained common: hypersexuality; many Blaxploitation heroes were still highly masculinized, reminiscent of the [[Mandingo (person)|Mandingo]] stereotype, and were frequently seen sexually dominating White female characters. Examples of such Blaxploitation characters include [[Luke Cage]], [[Misty Knight]], [[Bronze Tiger]] and [[Black Lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Rupert.  [http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing32/feature4.shtml Fanzing 32, March 2001: Black Power or Blaxploitation?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317000000/http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing32/feature4.shtml |date=March 17, 2008 }}  Accessed June 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Marc.

===Black proteges===
In the 1970s, several African American heroes were created and paired with established white heroes as sidekicks and   [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905192154/http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/niven/142/profiles/pro13.html black proteges].  [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]], for example, became a black and slightly inferior (in terms of scientific ability and combat experience) version of his white mentor.

==Asian==

===Yellow Peril===
Many Asian characters were pitted against White American protagonists in early American comics, capturing America's real-world frustrations and political distrust of foreign Asian powers. Symbolizing America's "phobia of the "[[Yellow Peril]]",&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Sheng-Mei. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816637113 The Deathly Embrace: Orientalism and Asian American Identity], (University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; these characters were frequently of foreign nationality (usually [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]) and often possessed a stereotypically Asian appearance (for example, a long wispy moustache and yellow-tinted skin). They were often highly intelligent or in possession of a powerful, supernatural ability and generally occupied themselves with elaborate plans for world domination, although they were usually thwarted by the American heroes of their time. While usually serious threats, one somewhat humorous Yellow Peril villain was DC's [[Egg Fu]], a giant Communist egg with facial features and a prehensile moustache.

====Fu Manchu====
In the early 20th century, author [[Sax Rohmer]] published a series of novels focusing on the wildly popular Chinese villain, Dr. [[Fu Manchu]]. Attempting to capitalize on this success,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]] both published comic books featuring Chinese villains physically resembling Fu Manchu and possessing the same personality, sexual ambiguity, and ambitions for world domination. Because neither publisher possessed a license for the Fu Manchu character, these early Chinese comic book villains were either unnamed or had a different name than Fu Manchu. Examples include DC's Red Dragon and Marvel's [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]] and [[Mandarin (comics)|The Mandarin]].

In 1938, DC Comics obtained the license for Sax Rohmer's character, and subsequent titles featured Fu Manchu as a recurring villain [http://www.njedge.net/~knapp/comic.htm]. Marvel Comics obtained the rights for Fu Manchu in 1972, and he was notably introduced as the father of Marvel's [[Shang-Chi]], protagonist of the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' title.

Although both DC and Marvel have since declined to renew their license for the Fu Manchu character, Fu Manchu has made brief appearances in modern comics, usually{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} referred to merely as 'The Doctor' (as in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'').

===Coolie===
Several early characters of Asian descent were introduced as the clumsy, foolish and bumbling sidekicks of White male superheroes. These characters were frequently{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} caricatures of the Chinese [[coolie]], appearing short in stature, sporting bucked teeth and a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]], and spoke [[pidgin]] English. These characters often served as [[comedy relief]] or as a convenient hostage for the villain of the day. Examples of such characters include the controversial Chop-Chop (aka Wu Cheng) of DC's [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]] team (see below) and [[Wing-How]]., sidekick of the [[Crimson Avenger]].

====Chop-Chop====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chopchop.jpg|thumb|right|Chop Chop's appearance in early comics.]]  --&gt;Chop-Chop was the youngest member of the Blackhawk team created by [[Will Eisner]], [[Charles Nicholas (comics)#Chuck Cuidera|Chuck Cuidera]], and [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] for [[Quality Comics]] during [[World War II]]. Resembling other Chinese caricatures typical of the era, Chop-Chop was short with bright yellow skin, bucked teeth, and a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]].&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman, Carla B. "From Chop-Chop to Wu Cheng: The Evolution of the Chinese Character in ''Blackhawk'' Comic Books," in ''Ethnic Images in the Comics'', edited by Charles Hardy and Gail F. Stern (The Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies,1986) pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt; His primary role seemed to be as the chef of the Blackhawk team. Strangely, Chop-Chop was also the only member of the Blackhawks who did not wear a Blackhawk uniform; instead, he wore traditional Chinese shirt and pants.

Many members of the [[Asian American]] community found the character of Chop-Chop to be highly controversial and offensive. Addressing the disparity of Asian American characters in the comic industry and the stereotypical images of early characters, noted Asian American comics writer [[Larry Hama]] said, "Many companies were still coloring Asians bright yellow... In the '40s and '50s, the character Chop Chop in the 'Blackhawks' had big buck teeth, a long pigtail and lots of cleavers. It wasn't until sometime in the '60s that he evolved into a short slim guy who was a jaundiced shade of orange." &lt;ref&gt;SFGate.com (June 1, 2006): [http://www.sfgate.com/gate/archive/2006/06/01/apop.DTL Asian pop] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;
The event to which Hama refers occurred in ''Blackhawk'' #197 (June 1964). That issue began the "New Blackhawks", an attempt to modernize the team that included new uniforms. Chop-Chop got a uniform and his own aircraft (he had nearly always ridden with Blackhawk or one of the other team members prior to this time). Chop-Chop was treated and portrayed as a full member of the team from this point on but certain stereotypical factors were still in play. Like most Asian comic book heroes, he was now a martial arts expert.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman /&gt; This was emphasized even more when the Blackhawks tried being super-powered heroes in issues #228 (January 1967) to #241 (Jun-Jul 1968). In that run of stories, Chop-Chop was known as "Dr. Hands."

In the next revival of the Blackhawks (with issue #244, Jan-Feb 1976), Chop-Chop got a new name, Chopper, and was treated pretty much like all the other members of the team. He was no longer an ethnic caricature and the decades of his portrayal as one were simply ignored as if they had never happened.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman /&gt; It took a third revival of the title in 1982 (''Blackhawk'' #251) to finally address that issue.  Writer [[Mark Evanier]] and artist [[Dan Spiegle]] avoided all the racial and ethnic stereotypes that had previously defined Chop-Chop’s character except one.  They put him back in the coolie outfit that the character had worn for a large part of his existence.  This was a deliberate move so they could examine why Chop-Chop was not treated like a full member of the team in a story titled "What’s the Matter with Chop-Chop?" (#265, December 1983). The story has the other Blackhawks examine their attitudes and feelings and, at the end, Wu Cheng gets respect and a uniform.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman /&gt;

[[Howard Chaykin]]'s 1987 ''Blackhawk'' limited series explains the earlier stereotypical representations as a comic-book-within-a-comic-book and the Chop-Chop of that team expresses indignation toward them.

===Martial arts master===
Nearly all Asian characters in mainstream American comics are capable of martial arts, and for several Asian characters, this is their only skill or ability. An overwhelming number of Asian characters, particularly those of Japanese descent, are portrayed as masters of [[ninjutsu]] or the ways of the [[samurai]], and are frequently introduced as teachers of non-Asian protagonists. Examples include Marvel's [[Shang-Chi]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Psylocke]] although she is actually British in an Asian body, [[Silver Samurai]], DC's [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], [[Lady Shiva]], and [[Cassandra Cain]]. Frequently, martial arts masters are associated with Asian religions, such as [[Buddhism]], and a common archetype is that of the elderly, wise [[monk]].

===Dragon lady===
Female Asian characters in comics are frequently depicted as hypersexualized, cold-blooded and untrustworthy, in a racial caricature frequently referred to as the dragon lady.&lt;ref&gt;Prasso, Sheridan. The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, &amp; Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient (2005 Public Affairs)&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype references the popular villainess of the same name who first appeared in the vintage comic strip, ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manaa.org/articles/stereo.html Restrictive Portrayals of Asians in the Media and How to Balance Them] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806104733/http://www.manaa.org/articles/stereo.html |date=2006-08-06 }},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prasso, Sheridan 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and was later popularized in film by roles such as that of [[Anna May Wong]]'s title character in the film, ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]''. In comics, examples of the dragon lady stereotype include Marvel's [[Fah Lo Suee]] (see below), the daughter of [[Fu Manchu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manaa.org/articles/stereo.html Restrictive Portrayals of Asians in the Media and How to Balance Them] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806104733/http://www.manaa.org/articles/stereo.html |date=2006-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fah Lo Suee]] was a character in [[Sax Rohmer]]'s series of pulp novels featuring Dr. [[Fu Manchu]]. Fah Lo Suee's name meant "Sweet Perfume", and she was Fu Manchu's daughter. In [[Marvel Comics]], Fah Lo Suee was [[Shang-Chi]]'s sister, and a hypersexualized temptress with the power of hypnosis. Her loyalties lay only with her own ambitions, and she was willing to turn on anyone, including her own father, if it would benefit her. She eventually joined the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), a top-secret British intelligence agency, where she became a high-ranking official, although she did this only in further pursuit of power for herself.

==Middle Eastern==
On the other hand, [[Jack Shaheen]], professor emeritus of mass communications at [[Southern Illinois University]] has written extensively on the plight of Arabs in the American mass media.  He wrote that due to ignorance, fear, and political beliefs, Arabs are rarely portrayed as anything but [[villain]]s.  Those few positive portrayals are often passive, neither taking the limelight away from the most often [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] protagonists, nor overshadowing the active role of the evil Arabs in the book.&lt;ref name="SHAHEEN"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Comic Book Arab| publisher=AMEU| work=The Link| url=http://www.ameu.org/page.asp?iid=142&amp;aid=186&amp;pg=1| accessdate=29 June 2006| date=November–December 1991| author=Shaheen, Jack| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629164655/http://www.ameu.org/page.asp?iid=142&amp;aid=186&amp;pg=1| archivedate=29 June 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Marvel's [[Fasaud]], [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Shadow King]], [[Living Monolith]], [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], the [[Desert Sword]]s, [[Abdul Alhazred (comics)|Abdul Alhazred]], [[Saracen (comics)|Saracen]], the original [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] and from DC comics [[Ra's al Ghul]] and [[Talia al Ghul]].

'''Global terrestrial stilling''' is the decrease of [[wind speed]] observed near the [[Earth]]'s surface (~10-meter height) over the last three decades (mainly since the 1980s), originally termed "stilling".&lt;ref&gt;Roderick ML, Rotstayn LD, Farquhar GD, Hobbins MT (2007) On the attribution of changing pan evaporation. Geophys Res Lett 34(17): L17403. {{doi|10.1029/2007GL031166}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slowdown of near-surface terrestrial winds has mainly affected mid-latitude regions of both hemispheres, with a global average reduction of −0.140 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (meters per second per decade) or between 5 and 15% over the past 50 years.&lt;ref name="McVicar et al."&gt;McVicar TR, Roderick ML, Donohue RJ, Li LT, Van Niel TG, Thomas A, Grieser J, Jhajharia D, Himri Y, Mahowald NM, Mescherskaya AV, Kruger AC, Rehman S, Dinpashoh Y (2012) Global review and synthesis of trends in observed terrestrial near-surface wind speeds: Implications for evaporation. J Hydrol 416–417: 182–205. {{doi|10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high-latitude (&gt; 75° from the equator) showing increases in both hemispheres. In contrast to the observed weakening of winds over continental surfaces, winds have tended to strengthen over [[ocean]] regions.&lt;ref name="Wentz et al."&gt;Wentz FJ, Ricciardulli L, Hilburn K, Mears C (2007) How much more rain will global warming bring? Science 317(5835): 233–235. {{doi|10.1126/science.1140746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young et al."&gt;Young IR, Zieger S, Babanin AV (2011) Global trends in wind speed and wave height. Science 332(6028): 451–455. {{doi|10.1126/science.1197219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, a break in this terrestrial decrease of wind speed has been detected suggesting a recovery at global scales since 2013.&lt;ref name="Dunn et al."&gt;Dunn RJH, Azorin-Molina C, Mears CA, Berrisford P, McVicar TR (2016) Surface winds. In State of the Climate 2015, Bull Amer Meteor Soc 97 (8): S38-S40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact cause(s) of the global terrestrial stilling are uncertain and has been mainly attributed to two major drivers: (i) changes in large scale [[atmospheric circulation]], and (ii) an increase of [[surface roughness]] due to e.g. [[forest]] growth, [[land use]] changes, and [[urbanization]]. 

Given climate change, changes in wind speed are currently a potential concern for society, due to their impacts on a wide array of spheres, such as [[wind power]] generation, ecohydrological implications for [[agriculture]] and [[hydrology]], wind-related [[hazard]]s and [[catastrophes]], or [[air quality]] and [[human health]], among many others.

==Causes==

The attribution of this weakening of terrestrial near-surface wind speed is not conclusive, probably because of several factors which interact simultaneously, and may change in space in time. Scientists have pointed out various major causes influencing this slowdown in wind speed: 
(i) The increase in land-surface roughness (e.g. forest growth, land use changes and urbanization) near [[meteorological station]] where [[anemometer]] instruments measure wind lead to a reinforcement of [[friction]] force that weaken low-level winds.&lt;ref&gt;Vautard R, Cattiaux J, Yiou P, Thépaut JN, Ciais P (2010) Northern Hemisphere atmospheric stilling partly attributed to an increase in surface roughness. Nat Geosci 3(11): 756–761. {{doi|10.1038/ngeo979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bichet A, Wild M, Folini D, Schär C (2012) Causes for decadal variations of wind speed over land: Sensitivity studies with a global climate model. Geophys Res Lett 39(11): L11701. {{doi|10.1029/2012GL051685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wever N (2012) Quantifying trends in surface roughness and the effect on surface wind speed observations. J Geophys Res – Atmos 117(D11): D11104. {{doi|10.1029/2011JD017118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
(ii) The variability of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]], associated with the poleward expansion of the [[Hadley cell]]&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J., G. A. Vecchi, and T. Reichler, 2007: Expansion of the Hadley cell under global warming. Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L06805, {{doi|10.1029/2006GL028443}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the shifting of [[centers of action]] (i.e. [[anticyclones]] and [[cyclones]]) controlling changes in near-surface wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;Lu J, Vecchi GA, Reichler T (2007) Expansion of the Hadley cell under global warning. Geophys Res Lett 34(6): L06805. {{doi|10.1029/2006GL028443}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Azorin-Molina et al."&gt;Azorin-Molina C, Vicente-Serrano SM, McVicar TR, Jerez S, Sanchez-Lorenzo A, López-Moreno JI, Revuelto J, Trigo RM, Lopez-Bustins JA, Espirito-Santo F (2014) Homogenization and assessment of observed near-surface wind speed trends over Spain and Portugal, 1961–2011. J Climate 27 (10): 3692–3712. {{doi|10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00652.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azorin-Molina C, Guijarro JA, McVicar TR, Vicente-Serrano SM, Chen D, Jerez S, Espirito-Santo F (2016) Trends of daily peak wind gusts in Spain and Portugal, 1961–2014. J Geophys Res – Atmos 121(3): 1059–1078. {{doi|10.1002/2015JD024485}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(iii) The changes in how wind speed is measured, including the deterioration or instrumental drift of anemometer devices; the technological improvement of anemometers; anemometer height changes;&lt;ref&gt;Wan, H., L. W. Xiaolan, and V. R. Swail, 2010: Homogenization and trend analysis of Canadian near-surface wind speeds. J. Climate, 23, 1209–1225, {{doi|10.1175/2009JCLI3200.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; shifts in measurements sites; changes in the environment around the monitoring station; [[calibration]] issues; and measuring time intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Azorin-Molina C, Vicente-Serrano SM, McVicar TR, Revuelto J, Jerez S, Lopez-Moreno JI (2017) Assessing the impact of measuring time interval when calculating wind speed means and trends under the stilling phenomenon. Int J Climatol 37(1): 480–492. {{doi|10.1002/joc.4720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(iv) The "[[global dimming]]", i.e., the decrease in the amounts of [[solar radiation]] reaching the Earth's surface due to increased [[aerosol]] and [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations, forces a stabilization of the atmosphere resulting in weak winds.&lt;ref&gt;Xu M, Chang CP, Fu C, Qi Y, Robock A, Robinson D, Zhang H (2006) Steady decline of East Asian monsoon winds, 1969–2000: evidence from direct ground measurements of wind speed. J Geophys Res-Atmos 111: D24111. {{doi|10.1029/2006JD007337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(v) Other causes, such as increasing trends in available [[soil moisture]]&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth WJ, Serrat-Capdevilla A, Roderick ML, Scott RL (2009) On the theory relating changes in area-average and pan evaporation. Q J R Meteorol Soc 135(642): 1230–1247. {{doi|10.1002/qj.434}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomical changes&lt;ref&gt;Mazzarella A (2007) The 60-year solar modulation of global air temperature: the Earth́'s rotation and atmospheric circulation connection. Theor Appl Climatol 88(3–4): 193–199. {{doi|10.1007/s00704-005-0219-z}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have been put forward.
However, the exact causes of the "global terrestrial stilling" are still unresolved because the uncertainties behind this phenomenon across the world.

==Uncertainties==

The "global terrestrial stilling" is not affecting in the same way the whole Earth's surface across both land and ocean surfaces. Spatially, increasing wind speed trends have been reported for some regions, in particular for high-latitudes,&lt;ref&gt;Minola L, Azorin-Molina C, Chen D (2016) Homogenization and assessment of observed near-surface wind speed trends across Sweden, 1956–2013. J Climate 29(20): 7397–7415.  {{doi|10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0636.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; coastal&lt;ref&gt;Pinard JP (2007) Wind climate of the Whitehorse area. Artic 60(3): 227–237. {{doi|10.14430/arctic215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for ocean surfaces where different authors.&lt;ref name="Wentz et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tokinaga H, Xie SP (2011) Wave- and Anemometer-based Sea-surface Wind (WASWind) for Climate Change Analysis. J Climate 24(1): 267–285. {{doi|10.1175/2010JCLI3789.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young et al." /&gt; have evidenced an increased global trend of wind speed using satellite measurements in the last 30–40 years. Recent studies have shown a break in the negative tendency of terrestrial wind speeds, with a recent widespread recovery / strengthening of wind speed since around 2013.&lt;ref name="Kim &amp; Paik"&gt;Kim J, Paik K (2015) Recent recovery of surface wind speed after decadal decrease: a focus on South Korea. Clim Dyn 45(5): 1699–1712. {{doi|10.1007/s00382-015-2546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn et al." /&gt; This creates uncertainty in understanding the phenomenon.

Most of the uncertainties behind the "global terrestrial stilling" debate resides in (i) the short wind speed data availability, with series starting in the 1960s, (ii) wind speed studies mainly carried on midlatitude regions where the majority of long-term measurements are available;&lt;ref name="McVicar et al." /&gt; and (iii) the low quality of anemometer records as pointed out by the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).

The low quality in wind speed series is mainly due to non-climatic factors (e.g. observing practice changes, station relocation, anemometer height changes) affecting those records, which result to be unrepresentative of the actual wind speed variations over time. Specific [[Homogenization (climate)|homogenization]] protocols for wind speed series have been developed in order to detect and adjust potential inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="Azorin-Molina et al." /&gt;    

==Ongoing research==

The current research on assessing and attributing this phenomenon has focused on reducing the limitation of short availability and low quality of wind speed data. The European funded research project STILLING&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/201175_en.html |title=STILLING: Towards improved understanding of the worldwide decline of wind speed in a climate change scenario |website=CORDIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a current (2016–2018) initiative that aims to reduce this constraint by rescuing, homogenizing and recovering the longest and highest-quality wind speed series across the globe. The project is currently compiling wind speed records starting in the 1880s providing scientists with approximately 130-year records, roughly 80 years more than previous studies available in the scientific literature. The better knowledge of the past wind speed climate is crucial for understanding the present "global terrestrial stilling" phenomenon, detecting if [[climate change]] is behind this slowdown of wind or similar trends-cycles occurred in the past and could be expected for the future. That is with longer records decadal cycles may be detected.

==Implications of wind speed changes==

The "global terrestrial stilling" phenomenon is of great scientific, socioeconomic, and environmental interest because of the key impact of even small wind speed changes on atmospheric and ocean dynamics and related fields such as: (i) renewable wind energy;&lt;ref&gt;Otero C, Manchado C, Arias R, Bruschi VM, Gómez-Jáuregui V, Cendrero A (2012), Wind energy development in Cantabria, Spain. Methodological approach, environmental, technological and social issues, Renewable Energy, 40(1), 137–149, {{doi|10.1016/j.renene.2011.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) agriculture and hydrology due to evapotranspiration;&lt;ref&gt;McVicar TR, Roderick ML, Donohue RJ, Van Niel TG (2012), Less bluster ahead? Ecohydrological implications of global trends of terrestrial near-surface wind speeds, Ecohydrol., 5(4), 381–388, {{doi|10.1002/eco.1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) migration of wind-dispersed plant species;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.E., and G.G. Katul (2013), Implications of nonrandom seed abscission and global stilling for migration of wind-dispersed plant species, Glob. Chang. Biol., 19(6):1720–35, {{doi|10.1111/gcb.12173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (iv) wind-related natural disasters;&lt;ref name="Kim &amp; Paik" /&gt; (v) marine and coastal impacts due to wind-driven storm surges and waves;&lt;ref&gt;Cid A., M. Menendez, S. Castanedo, A.J. Abascal, F.J. Méndez, and R. Medina (2016), Long-term changes in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme storm surge events in southern Europe, Clim. Dyn., 46(5), 1503–1516, {{doi|10.1007/s00382-015-2659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (vi) dispersion of air pollutants;&lt;ref&gt;Cuevas, E., Y. Gonzalez, S. Rodriguez, J.C. Guerra, A.J. Gomez-Pelaez, S. Alonso-Perez, J. Bustos, and C. Milford (2013), Assessment of atmospheric processes driving ozone variations in the subtropical North Atlantic free troposphere, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 13(4), 1973–1998, {{doi|10.5194/acp-13-1973-2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; among many other socioeconomic and environmental spheres. However, for wind energy near-surface wind speeds are mainly observed within 10m of the land surface, and with turbines being located some 60-80m above the land surface more studies are needed here.  More studies are also needed at higher elevation sites, which are often areas that yield much of our freshwater supplies, called water-towers,&lt;ref&gt;Viviroli D, Archer DR, Buytaert W, Fowler HJ, Greenwood GB, Hamlet AF, Huang Y, Koboltschnig G, Litaor MI, Lopez-Moreno JI, Lorentz S, Schadler B, Schreier H, Schwaiger K, Vuille M, Woods R. 2011. Climate change and mountain water resources: overview and recommendations for research, management and policy. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 15(2): 471–504. {{doi|10.5194/hess-15-471-2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viviroli D, Durr HH, Messerli B, Meybeck M, Weingartner R. 2007. Mountains of the world, water towers for humanity: typology, mapping, and global significance. Water Resources Research 43(7):W07447. {{doi|10.1029/2006WR005653}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as wind speeds there have been shown to be decreasing more rapidly than those changes recorded at lower elevation sites,&lt;ref&gt;McVicar TR, Van Niel TG, Roderick ML, Li LT, Mo XG, Zimmermann NE, Schmatz DR (2010). Observational evidence from two mountainous regions that near-surface wind speeds are declining more rapidly at higher elevations than lower elevations: 1960–2006.

The '''Kalhora dynasty''' or '''Kalhoro dynasty''' ({{lang-sd|ڪلهوڙا راڄ}}) was a [[Sunni Muslim]] [[Sindh]] dynasty of [[sindhis tribe  people|''sindhis tribe ]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tm/books?isbn=0691117098|title=Migrants and Militants: Fun and Urban Violence in Pakistan|last=Verkaaik|first=Oskar|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-69111-709-6|location=|pages=94, 99|quote=The area of the Hindu-built mansion Pakka Qila was built in 1768 by the Kalhora kings, a local dynasty of  Baluchi origin that ruled Sindh independently from the decaying Moghul Empire beginning in the mid-eighteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tm/books?isbn=0521405300|title=Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947|last=Ansari|first=Sarah F.

The family line is rooted in the [[Kalhora]] clan. They were assigned to hold authority by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Grand Vizier [[Mirza Ghazi Beg]] and later formed their own dynasty, but they were known as the Kalhora [[Nawab]]s by the [[Mughal Emperors]].&lt;ref name="Ansari1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah F. D. Ansari|title=Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kC421xzMKsC&amp;pg=PA32|date=31 January 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40530-0|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalhora dynasty succumbed to the [[Qizilbash]] during the invasion of [[Nadir Shah]]. [[Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro]] reorganised and consolidated his power, but his son lost control of Sindh and was overthrown by [[Talpur dynasty|Talpurs]] [[Amir]]s. Mian Abdul Nabi Kalhoro was the last Kalhora ruler.&lt;ref name="Ansari1992"/&gt;

Kalhora rule of Sindh began in 1701 when Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro was invested with title of ''Khuda Yar Khan'' and was made governor of Upper Sindh sarkar by royal decree of the Mughals. Later, he was made governor of [[Sibi|Siwi]] through imperial decree. He founded a new city [[Khudabad]] after he obtained from [[Aurangzeb]] a grant of the tract between the Indus and the Nara and made it capital of his kingdom. Thenceforth, Mian Yar Muhammad became one of the imperial agents or governors. Later he extended his rule to [[Sehwan]] and [[Bukkur]] and became sole ruler of Northern and central Sindh except [[Thatta|Thatto]] which was still under administrative control of Mughal Empire.&lt;ref name="Ansari1992"/&gt;

The Kalhora dynasty produced four powerful rulers namely, Mian Nasir Muhammad, Mian Yar Muhammad, Mian Noor Muhammad and Mian Ghulam Shah.

==Rulers==
* [[Mian Nasir Muhammad Kalhoro]] 1696-1701
* [[Yar Muhammad Kalhoro|Mian Yar Muhammad]] 1701-1719
* [[Noor Mohammad Kalhoro|Mian Noor Muhammad]] 1719-1755
* [[Muhammad Muradyab Khan (Nawab Sarbuland Khan)|Muhammad Muradyab Khan]] 1755-1757
* [[Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro]] 1757-1772
* [[Mian Sarfraz Kalhoro (Khudayar Khan)]] 1772-1783

[[Kurds]] settled what is now [[Azerbaijan]] in waves at various times beginning in the ninth century. By the tenth century, [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] and its surroundings were ruled by the [[Shaddadids]], a Kurdish dynasty and the most powerful Kurdish clan of the South Caucasus, that latter also extended its control over present-day Republic of [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Б.

== History ==
According to Russian and later Soviet ethnographer Grigory Chursin, another wave of Kurdish immigration in western parts of modern Azerbaijan may have taken place in 1589, at the time of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)|Ottoman–Safavid War]], when "victorious Safavid soldiers" chose to stay in the conquered lands.&lt;ref name="aristova"&gt;Аристова Т.Ф.

In 1807, amidst the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|Russo-Persian War over the South Caucasus]], a tribe chief by the name of Mehmed Sefi Sultan moved from [[Persia]]n to the [[Karabakh khanate]] followed by 600 Kurdish families. By the second half of the nineteenth century, Kurds were found in large numbers in the uyezds of [[Zangezur Uyezd|Zangezur]], [[Javanshir Uyezd|Javanshir]] and [[Jabrayil Uyezd|Jabrayil]].&lt;ref name="aristova"/&gt; In 1886, they constituted 4.68% of the population of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Елизаветпольская губерния // Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона: В 86 томах (82 т. и 4 доп.). — СПб., 1890—1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations of Kurds were also found in the uyezds of [[Nakhchivan Uyezd|Nakhchivan]], [[Sharur-Daralagoz Uyezd|Sharur-Daralagoz]] and [[Aresh Uyezd|Aresh]].&lt;ref name="volkova"&gt;Н.

Kurdishcenter.ru.&lt;/ref&gt; into mountainous regions of present-day Azerbaijan continued all throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century, until 1920 when Azerbaijan became part of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Kurdish population of the South Caucasus was prone to internal immigration. In the 1920s, a number of Kurds from Azerbaijan relocated to Armenia where they settled mainly in the [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]]-populated regions,&lt;ref name="aristova"/&gt; which led the Kurdish population of Azerbaijan to significantly decrease in numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of World Cultures, David Levinson, G.K.

Sakharov Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; and shared elements of culture led to rapid assimilation of Azerbaijan's Kurdish population already by the end of the nineteenth century. Statistical data from 1886 shows that Kurds of [[Jabrayil Rayon|Jabrayil]], [[Agdash Rayon|Arash]] and partly [[Kalbajar Rayon|Javanshir]] spoke [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] as a first language. According to the first Soviet census of 1926, only 3,100 (or 8.3%) of Azerbaijan's Kurdish population (which at the time numbered 37,200 people) spoke Kurdish.&lt;ref name="volkova"/&gt;

A well-integrated community, Kurds were represented in the government of the shortly independent [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]] in 1918–1920, among them [[Nurmammad bey Shahsuvarov]] who served as Minister of Education and Religious Affairs and [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]], Minister of the Military and Governor General of Karabakh and Zangezur.&lt;ref&gt;Аламдар Шахвердиев Азербайджанские курды (рус.) // Международный Азербайджанский Журнал IRS-Наследие. — С. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the Soviet rule in Azerbaijan, the Central Executive Committee of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] created in 1923 an administrative unit known as [[Kurdistan Uyezd|Red Kurdistan]] in the districts of [[Lachin District|Lachin]], [[Qubadli District|Qubadli]] and [[Zangilan District|Zangilan]], with its capital in Lachin.&lt;ref&gt;The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Philip G.

The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between Armenia and Azerbaijan spilled across the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] into the traditionally Kurdish populated areas in both of these countries. In Armenia, Muslim Kurds were often associated with Azeris due to cultural similarities; hence as many as 18,000 Kurds fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan and later to the [[North Caucasus|Russian Caucasus]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Waal Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War. — New York University Press, 2004. — С. 304, прим. 15. — {{ISBN|0-8147-1944-9}}, 0-8147-1945-7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992–1993, Armenian troops advanced into Kalbajar, Lachin, Qubadli and Zangilan, forcing all the non-Armenian civilian population out.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan.

The '''Ladies Rest Room''' is a historic building in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]], that is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Ladies Rest Room was built by the [[Marshall County, Tennessee|Marshall County]] [[county commission|court]] in 1924 as a place for rural women to relax, rest, and eat during their visits to Lewisburg, the [[county seat]].&lt;ref name=TNenc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=839 |title=Marshall County |work=[[Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture]] |date=December 25, 2009|first=Carroll Van |last=West}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt; During the 1910s and 1920s, there was widespread encouragement in the United States for the establishment of ladies' lounges and rest rooms to accommodate rural women who traveled into county seats and market towns to conduct business. It was suggested that if country women had comfortable in-town accommodations for themselves and their young children, they would visit town more frequently and would buy more consumer products from local stores. Also, agricultural reformers perceived that ladies' rest rooms would provide increased opportunities for [[agricultural extension]] workers and [[home demonstration agent]]s to reach farm women. By 1917, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] reported that there were about 200 rest rooms for rural women around the country, largely in the [[western United States|West]] and [[midwestern United States|Midwest]]; it was not until the 1920s that the concept was widely adopted in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt; Most ladies' rest room facilities were rooms inside stores, [[courthouse]]s, or other civic buildings; the Ladies Rest Room in Lewisburg is unusual for being housed in its own separate building.&lt;ref name=TNenc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform&gt;{{cite web| url=http://digital.mtsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15838coll4/id/1490/rec/10 |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Ladies Rest Room |first1=Trina |last1=Binkley |first2=Megan |last2=Dobbs |first3=Carroll |last3=Van West |date=May 24, 1995 |publisher=Middle Tennessee State University Center for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be the first and possibly the only stand-alone ladies' rest room in Tennessee.&lt;ref name=TNenc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

The building is a one-story rectangular red [[brick]] structure with a basement, built in the [[Colonial Revival]] style. It was designed by A. C. Colley, a [[Nashville]] [[architect]], and constructed by local builder J. L. Sanders. Exterior features include a covered [[porch]] that wraps around the front of the building and part of one side, wooden [[column]]s on brick [[pilaster]]s, a [[Parapet#Parapet roofs|parapet roof]] with a wooden [[cornice]], and wooden [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]]es. The building interior includes a large reception room in the front, a bathroom and hall in the building's midsection, and a private bedroom in the rear (provided for the live-in matron who was hired by the county to maintain the facility and supervise its operation). The basement houses a kitchen and dining area.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

The Ladies Rest Room proved popular. Shortly after it opened in 1924, the county's home demonstration agent reported that "constant use is being made of it by the country people."&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt; It became customary for farm families to travel into Lewisburg on Saturdays and important court days, with the men gathering in the county courthouse and their wives congregating in the Ladies Rest Room.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

The Ladies Rest Room building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; At the time of its listing, it was still being used for its original purpose.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

{{Romani people}}
'''Lyuli''' ({{lang-ru|Люли}}) or Jughi is an ethnic group of [[Romani people|Romani]] living in [[Central Asia]], primarily [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. They speak a Tajik dialect.
The Lyuli practice [[Islam]]. They have a clan organization (the Lyuli word for ‘clan’ is ''tupar'', the Jughi word  - ''avlod''). Division into sub-clans is also practiced. The Lyuli [[community]] is extremely closed towards non-Lyuli.&lt;ref name=besson&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://zigane.pp.ru/Pressa2_4.htm Николай Бессонов. Цыгане и пресса. Эпопея о люли] - Some photos of Lyulis&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional occupations: crafts, including jewelry, cattle trading, [[mendicancy]] and music.

== Etymology ==
There are several names for the Lyuli: Jughi, Multani or Luli. However, they refer to themselves as ''Mugat'' or ''Mughat'' ({{lang-fa|مغان}}, derived from Old Persian ''[[magi]]'', "fire-worshipper"), as well as ''Ghurbat'' ({{lang-ar|غربات}}), which means "lonely". The term ''Multani'' signifies a person who originates from the city of [[Multan]] (in modern-day Pakistan), because some of the Lyuli emigrated from Multan around 1380 AD.

According to Professor Khol Nazarov, the ancestors of the Lyuli belonged to a caste of singers, musicians and dancers. Faced with hardship in their homeland, they were forced to leave and disperse.

==Lyuli in Kyrgyzstan==
The Lyuli live in the south of [[Kyrgyzstan]], in [[Osh Region]]. Their [[Standard of living|living standard]] is extremely low due to discrimination. Many children are not educated in their [[First language|mother tongue]] and many Lyuli have no official documents. Lyuli society is working towards improvement of their living standards and preservation of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.ca-oasis.info/oasis/?jrn=32&amp;id=245 Интернет-Журнал "Оазис" Народ без прав]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyuli in Russia==
Starting from the early 1990s, the Lyuli began [[Urbanization|migrating]] into [[Russia]]n cities, most noticeably around [[Train station|railway stations]] and [[Market (place)|market]]s. At first, [[Russians]] mistakenly identified them as [[Civil War in Tajikistan|Tajik refugees]] or ethnic [[Uzbeks]] due to their traditional Central Asian robes. [[Russian Roma]] emphasize that the Lyuli are distinct from them, however they are considered  to be a subgroup of the [[Romani people|Romani]].&lt;ref name=besson/&gt; They are a frequent target of Russian [[White power skinhead|far right skinheads]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10008515"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10008515 |title=Russia's far-right on rise |author=Osborne, Andrew |date=29 January 2005 |agency=[[The Independent]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goacom.org/overseas-digest/ImAsy&amp;Race%20(EU)/Cases04/russia04.htm Russia 2004]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015060926/http://www.goacom.org/overseas-digest/ImAsy%26Race%20%28EU%29/Cases04/russia04.htm |date=October 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyuli in Uzbekistan==
There are approximately 12,000 Lyuli in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/out-of-eden-walk/articles/2017-01-trading-tresses/ |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |quote=There are about 12,000 Mugats in Uzbekistan. Uzbeks refer to them, often with contempt, as Lyuli or Gypsies, though there is scant genetic evidence linking them to the world’s Roma diaspora. The group divides itself into a caste system that suggests a migration from the Indian subcontinent into Central Asia centuries ago. Traditionally the Mugat were wandering musicians and entertainers. Today they live in tight-knit neighborhoods that are considered no-go zones by other Uzbeks. They are one of the world’s marginal peoples. Many survive by begging, or by recycling scrap metal or plastic bottles. |title=Trading in Tresses |date=January 17, 2017 |first=Paul |last=Salopek |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maritime Sign Language''' (MSL), is a [[sign language]] descended from [[British Sign Language]] and used in [[Canada's]] [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005 |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|location=Dallas, Tex. |publisher=[[SIL International]] |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created through the convergence of [[deaf communities]] from the [[Northeastern United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] immigrating to [[Canada]] throughout the 1700s and 1800s.&lt;ref name="Yoel" /&gt;  It is unknown the extent to which this language is spoken today, though there are linguistic communities found across the Atlantic provinces. MSL is being supplanted by [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] resulting in fewer MSL speakers and a lack of resources (education, interpretation, etc.) for MSL speakers.

The dialect of ASL currently used in the [[Maritimes]] exhibits some lexical influence from MSL. ASL is now the main language that is used by the Deaf community in New Brunswick, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]. Due to the expansion of ASL, there are fewer than 100 MSL users. &lt;ref name=Yoel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoel|first1=Judith|title=Canada's Maritime Sign Language|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4896|website=endangeredlanguages|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Memoria Urbana Berlin''''' (also known as [[Reconstruction (architecture)|Reconstruction]] Bohemian Bethlehem Church) is a [[Public art|public sculpture]] by [[Spanish art]]ist [[Juan Garaizabal]] that stands in the middle of the Bethlehemkirchplatz, [[Mitte]] district, [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was constructed in June 2012 on the [[mosaic]] marking the exact site and size of the original Bohemian or Bethlehem Church ({{lang-de|Böhmische Kirche, Bethlehemskirche}}), which was destroyed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/06/18/actualidad/1371567587_938428.html ElPais.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sculpture]] is made up of 800 [[Metre|meters]] (2,600 [[Foot (unit)|feet]]) of square section (12x12 cm/4.7 in) [[Hollow structural section|steel tube]] and 300 meters (984 feet) of [[Light-emitting diode|LED illumination]] system. Its [[Structural art|structure]] draws in the air the lines of the [[silhouette]] of the lost construction, recreating its [[volume]] in the form of a [[sketch (drawing)|sketch.]] It measures 25 x 15 x 31 metres (82 x 49 x 101 feet) in height and weighs 44 [[short ton]]s (40 [[Ton|metric tons]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/telediario/escultor-espanol-juan-garai-zabal-presenta-proyecto-memorias-urbanas/1451945/ RTVE Garazaibal presents the ''Memorias Urbanas'' project (video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and maintenance==
Originally planned as a [[Installation art|temporary installation]], as of December 2013 the district and [[Local government|municipal authorities]] have decreed permanent status for the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/bezirke/mitte/article122562359/Skulptur-der-Bethlehemskirche-bleibt-nach-Protesten.html Morgenpost.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative proceedings for the permanent allocation on [[public land|public grounds]] are currently ongoing. The Lux-Bethlehem e.V. cultural trust, representing twenty of the public and private institutions that promoted the permanent installation, has been formally created to guarantee the [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] of the [[Monumental sculpture|sculpture]].

==Symbolism==

{{unsourced section|date=April 2018}}

It is a monument dedicated to [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] and to [[immigration]] with the spirit of [[Europeanism]].

The original Bohemian Church otherwise Bethlehem Church was built between 1733 and 1735 in the middle of the [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]] (now the Mitte district) of Berlin, representing one of the most positive chapters of relations between [[Germany]] and [[Bohemia]]. Thanks to King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], [[Czechs|Czech]] [[refugee]]s leaving their homeland for religious reasons were admitted to the Friedrichstadt district of Berlin. It was a monument to the [[Toleration|tolerance]] pervading the foundation of the [[Prussia|Prussian State]].

In 1943, it was badly damaged by bombing. Later, in 1963, the church was demolished and the site incorporated into the facilities of [[Checkpoint Charlie]].

===History and growth===
ATIC was established in 2008.  Through a joint venture, ATIC and [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) created the world's third largest independent [[foundry]] [[GlobalFoundries]] in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atic.ae/leadership/Ibrahim-Ajami/1 "Leadership"], ATIC, accessed June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, ATIC acquired [[Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing]] of Singapore, the world's second largest dedicated independent [[semiconductor foundry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atic.ae/media-center/archive/November2009/10 “Press Release”], ATIC, accessed June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atic.ae/in-the-news/2009-09-07-Financial-Times-Abu-Dhabi-to-Take-on-Taiwans-Chipmakers.pdf  “Abu Dhabi to take on Taiwan’s Chipmakers”], Financial Times, accessed June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In   January 2010, the two  operations were   integrated, and have since functioned as one company under the GlobalFoundries brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atic.ae/media-center/archive/January2010/12 Press Release], ATIC, accessed Juned 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the firm joined with other investors to fund Texas-based [[Calxeda]], a start-up company for producing [[ARM architecture]]-based computers for the server market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20013683-64.html “Green chip start-up gets $48 million in funding”], CNET, accessed June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It  "worked with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop a masters program in microelectronics at the [[Masdar Institute of Science and Technology]] in Abu Dhabi."&lt;ref&gt;[http://allitwares.com/market-news-body-Abu-Dhabi-High-tech-mecca-or-mirage-459.html “Abu Dhabi: High-tech mecca or mirage?”], AllItWares, accessed June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masdar.ac.ae/FastFacts.html “Masdar Institute – Fast Facts”], Masdar Institute, accessed June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, the firm joined a research partnership with the [[Semiconductor Research Corporation]] (SRC) to conduct research in the Abu Dhabi region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=18960.php "Semiconductor Research Corporation and Advanced Technology Investment Company Chart Course for Semiconductor Research in Abu Dhabi"], ''Nanowerk'', November 11th, 2010, accessed June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and development===
ATIC has invested more than Dh100 million in research grants and funds since 2009 for building a globally-competitive technology R&amp;D ecosystem within Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;

It partners with the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a leading university-research consortium, to drive local research towards minimum energy electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/energy-is-the-key-to-technology-but-where-will-we-find-it "The National"], accessed October 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is supporting research initiatives spanning Khalifa University, UAE University, American University of Sharjah, Masdar Institute and New York University Abu Dhabi.

In May 2013, ATIC and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) launched the ATIC-SRC Centre of Excellence for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems (ACE4S), to be hosted jointly in Abu Dhabi by Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, and Masdar Institute of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/atic-launches-centre-of-excellence "The National"], accessed October 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  ATIC is investing Dh17.5 million in the project, an amount matched by Masdar Institute and Khalifa University. The total budget for the center is Dh35m spread during the initial three-year phase.  The center will focus on research in four key areas: energy harvesting, power management, sensor technologies and wireless communications networks.

ATIC and the state of German state of Saxony have invested $4.8 million in twinned laboratories that research 3-D stacking of integrated circuits. The   project consists of one lab hosted at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi and the other based at the Technische Universität Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itp.net/588634-atic-and-saxony-to-open-twin-semiconductor-labs#.Uhr3wRumgnE "ITP"], accessed October 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The labs, which host 10-12 graduate and PhD students, focus on research around three-dimensional chip stacking, a potentially faster and more energy efficient semiconductor technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1266549 "EE Times"], accessed October 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human capital===
To prepare for the development of a high-tech cluster and a Global Foundries manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi, ATIC and other local entities have developed  education programs, ranging  from primary and secondary school education to vocational training and graduate studies.  These  programs have reached over 1,000 Emiratis to date.&lt;ref name="national1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2910 "Wharton UPenn"], accessed October 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mugheri''' (or '''Mughery''', '''Mughairi''', {{lang-ar|المغیری}}) are a social group descended from Arabs, however, in [[Pakistan]] they are considered to be [[Baloch people|Baloch]]. As per research, Mugheri are descended from an Arab Field Marshal called [[Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim]], who was appointed as a Field Marshal for [[Sindh]] by his elder brother and famous [[Governor]] of [[Sindh]] during [[Abbasid Caliphate]] named [[Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim]].&lt;ref name="The History of India As told by its own historians the Muhammadian Period Vol-1"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of India | publisher=Cambridge | author=Henry Miers Elliot | authorlink=History of India | year=1867 | location=Cambridge,Delhi | pages=543, 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daud was appointed as a Governor of Sindh in 800AD (184 [[Hijri]]) by [[Harun al-Rashid|Caliph Haroon-ur-Rashid]] (786-809). Governor Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim governed Sindh for the longest period of nine years and later his son Bashar Bin Daud Bin Hatim became the next successor Governor of Sindh during the caliphate of Mamoon-ur-Rashid. Additionally, the Mughera tribe was at the climax because they ran their business, trade, affairs and matters effectively and were considered as wealthy tribe under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

==== Khair Mohammad Burriro ====
According to this researcher &lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Castes "&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Castes| publisher=Sindhi Language Authority,Hyderabad,Sindh| author=Khair Mohammad Burriro | authorlink=Encyclopedia of Castes | year=2010 | location=Hydearbad,Sindh| pages=6000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mugheri are directly descended from [[Mir Ali Khan]], the second son of [[Mir Jalal Khan]] who is believed to be an ancestor of [[Baloch people|Baloch]]. The researcher further mentions in his book that, in a [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi]] tribe, there was a Hajija Family, which had Mugher Khan and Buland Khan as two brothers. Moreover, Mugheri tribe is descended from Mugher Khan who had three sons Rozi, Khushal and Hassan Mugheri while Rozi had four sons namely Nazar, Feroz, Jaghir and Dighar.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Castes(in Sindhi)By Khair Mohammad Burriro Page no: 1520,1521&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ayaz Bhagat ====
A well known Researcher on Castes living in Sindh [[Pakistan]] found that &lt;ref name="The castes,tribes &amp; nations living in sindh "&gt;{{cite book | title=The castes,tribes &amp; nations living in sindh| publisher=Sindhi adabi board,hyderabad,sindh| author=Ayaz Hussain Bhagat | authorlink=The castes,tribes &amp; nations living in sindh | year=2012 | location=Hydearbad,Sindh| pages=822–824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mugheri are not [[Baloch people|Baloch]] because, Rai bahadur Lala Hetoram, who was a local person and the first historian of Baluchistan did not include Mugheri in any of Baloch tribes. Further, this indicated that, Mugheri do not belong to any Baloch tribe. Ayaz further says that Mugheri are descended from [[Arab]] [[Warrior]] Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim, who came in Sindh in 800AD along his delegation.&lt;ref&gt;The Castes, Tribes and nations living in Sind (in Sindhi) By Ayaz Bhaghat pages 822,823,824&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mansel Longworth Dames ====
The scholar of oriental and Portuguese languages and researcher on Baloch races, an English officer [[Mansel Longworth Dames]] (1850–1922) in his book ''The Baloch Races'' did not mention the Mugheri in the [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi tribe]]. Although, he considered it as 17th sub-caste of Magsi tribe.&lt;ref name="Dames1904"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mansel Longworth Dames|title=The Baloch Race: A Historical and Ethnological Sketch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1ebTdUEcKIC|accessdate=8 June 2013|year=1904|publisher=Royal Asiatic society|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shaikh Sadik Ali Ansari ====
Ansari writes in his book ''The Musalamn Races'' that [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi]] (Buledi) tribe is descendant of Mir Ali the second son of [[Mir Jalal Khan]]. Mir Ali had two sons Zendi Khan and Murad Khan, while Zendi had two sons Sundar and Haji. All Burdi (Buledi) are descendant of Sundar and Haji Khan or in other words Burdi are descendant of Zendi Khan. He further added that Mugheri are descendant of Haji Khan (Hajija) or in other words they are said to be sub-caste of Burdi tribe.&lt;ref name="ʻAlī1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anṡārī ʻAlī Sher ʻAlī|title=A short sketch, historical and traditional, of the Musalman races found in Sind, Baluchistan and Afghanistan, their genealogical sub-division and septs, together with an ethnological and ethnographical account|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQk8AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 June 2013|year=1901|publisher=Printed at the Commissioner's press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rai Bahadur Lala Hetoram ====
The first historian of Baluchistan [[Lala Hoat Ram]] of 1907 in his book “History of Baluchistan” did not consider and mention Mugheri in any Baloch tribes and even &lt;ref&gt;History of Baluchistan By Rai Bahadur Hetoram 1907&lt;/ref&gt; he did not consider Mugheri as sub-caste of Magsi and [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==== Justice(R) Khuda Bux Marri ====
The research work of [[Mansel Longworth Dames]] and his combined English poetry was translated in Sindhi by Justice(R) Khuda Bux Marri, who wrote a book “Baluchistan in the constitution of History” in the last of this book &lt;ref&gt;Baluchistan in the constitution of history By Justice Retired Khuda Bakhsh Marri page: 261&lt;/ref&gt; he made an index of Baloch tribes in which he did not mention Mugheri in [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi]] (Buledi) tribe but he considered them as sub-caste of Magsi.

==== M. K. Pikolin ====
He was an English Researcher and Scholar who also considered Mugheri as sub-caste of Magsi in his book on baloch races.
On the basis of research work of the above Scholars and researchers, it has been clear that Mugheri are not Baloch that is why Lala Hoatu Ram did not mention them in any Baloch tribe. While, Shaikh Sadik Ali Ansari on unknown basis considered them, in [[Burdi (tribe)|Burdi]] (Buledi) tribe. [[Mansel Longworth Dames]], M.K Pikolin and Justice(R) Khuda Bux Marri considered Mugheri as sub-caste of Magsi which is actually a Sindhi tribe. These later Scholars even did not explain anything that when Mugheri became part of the Magsi. On the basis of combined research of various researchers and scholars, it can be concluded that Mugheri are not Baloch.

=== Origin ===
After the review of various above research, it has concluded{{Who|date=October 2017}} that Mugheri are not clan of Baloch or [[Rajput]] or [[Soomra (tribe)|Soomra]] or [[Kalhoro]] or [[Channa]] or [[Bhatti]] or Machi or Muhani or Jat but Mugheri are in fact an [[Arab]] and they are descended from great Field Marshal Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim. Thus descendants of Mughera call themselves as Mugheri (i.e.; Descendant of Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim). In addition, the Caliph Haroon-ur-Rashid, who remained famous caliph in Abbasid Caliphate. In his caliphate Sindhi tribes were fighting for their freedom and Arab tribes who were inhabitants of Sindh such as Yemeni and Hejazi were great opponents of each other. For controlling the critical situations of Sindh in 184 Hijri (800AD) Caliph Haroon-ur-Rashid appointed Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim as a Governor of Sindh.&lt;ref name="The castes,tribes &amp; nations living in sindh "/&gt;

=== Arrival of Mughera in Sindh ===
&lt;ref name="The History of India As told by its own historians the Muhammadian Period Vol-1"/&gt; The Governor Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim before going to Sindh, appointed his brother Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim as Nawab (Naib) or Field Marshal and sent him with the delegation to Sindh for controlling the critical situations of Sindh. Since, the conditions of Sindh were critical, one side there was a war of detention of Sindhi people and on other side two [[Arab]] tribes were opponents of each other. When Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim reached [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Mansura]] the doors of the city were closed by Nazadya tribe and they made one condition for Mughera that he wouldn't take revenge from nazadya so ultimately they would leave the city.

=== The death of Mughera ===
According to the book" History of Yaqoubi" &lt;ref&gt;The History of Yaqoubi By Sindhi lekhak page 41&lt;/ref&gt; when Mughera entered in the city, there was a huge crowd of nazadya tribe who started fighting with Mughera and killed him in that war. Though in other books of history, it is found that when Mughera reached the [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Mansura]] he got defeat from Nazadya tribe, and eventually, he ran and got shelter in mountainous area. Later, who told whole story to his brother Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim, who later came to Sindh and controlled the situations. However, before his arrival in Sindh Mughera was killed. Governor Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim remained ruler of Sindh for the period of nine years. The [[Arab]] warriors and tribes who came along Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim to Sindh, they ascribed their names with him after his death as Mugheri.

=== Rule of Mughera’s tribe ===
According to Scholar and writer Qazi Athar Mubarkapori that&lt;ref name="Abbasid Caliphate and Subcontinent "&gt;{{cite book | title=Abbasid Caliphate and Subcontinent| publisher=Baluchistan| author=Qazi Athar Mubarkapori | authorlink=Abbasid Caliphate and Subcontinent | year=1907 | location=Baluchistan,Pakistan| pages=1500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daud Bin Zaid Bin Hatim, brother of Mughera remained ruler of Sindh for the period of nine years and later his son Bashar Bin Daud Bin Hatim became the next successor Governor of Sindh during Mamoon-ur-Rasheed caliphate. They settled their many people, who then became the inhabitants of Sindh. As Mughera Bin Zaid Bin Hatim was killed in Sindh thus the people his tribe affiliated their names with Mughera. Who later, moved to Northern Sindh and called themselves with their Leader’s name as “Mugheri”.

=== Climax of Mugheri tribe ===
Qazi Athar Mubarkapori in his book “Abbasid Caliphate and Hindustan” writes that&lt;ref name="Abbasid Caliphate and Subcontinent "/&gt; in Abbasid Caliphate Mughera’s tribe was at the climax because they ran their business, affairs and matters in a great way and from this tribe most of the people were considered as riches in the Abbasid Caliphate. As compared to other Islamic countries, in Sindh Mughera’s tribe was a rich, remained rulers and later their population converted into the majority. Thus Governors of Mughera’s tribe contributed a lot for their tribe and they played vital role in the development of Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;The Abbasid Caliphate and Subcontinent By Athar Mubarkapori page: 1251&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlement of Mugheri tribe ===
Mugheri indeed is an Arab race which is still found in the majority of these countries: [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arab]], [[Oman]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Tanzania]], [[Egypt]] etc., while in [[Pakistan]] the huge population of Mugheri tribe lives in [[Baluchistan]],  [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan]]. The major areas occupied by Mugheri tribe are; [[Bhag]], District [[Bolan District|Bolan]], [[Baluchistan]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]], [[Qamber Shahdadkot District]], [[Warah]], [[Warah|Waggan]], [[Nasirabad District]], [[Mehar, Pakistan|Mehar]], [[Dadu District]], [[Warah|La lu Rawnk]], [[Khairpur District]], [[Sanghar District]], [[Nawabshah]], [[Karachi]], and lower [[Punjab, Pakistan]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Engineer Mir Iqbal Ahmed Mugheri|title=Mugheri: A Short Historical and Ethnological Sketch in Urdu|url=http://mugheri.webs.com/MUGHERI-TAREEKHI-TAZKRA-URDU.pdf |accessdate= 10 October 2013|year=2012|publisher=Mugheri Website Publishers|page=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1304">The '''Muthuvan''’ people were loyal subjects of the dynasty of Madurai, according to tribal legend. When the dynasty was deposed, the surviving royal members migrated to [[Travancore]], central [[Kerala]]. On their way to Kerala, the Muthuvas carried the idols of [[Madurai]] [[Meenakshi]], the deity of the royal family, on their backs. The word Muthuvar in tamil is used to denote the same community in Tamilnadu. The word “Muthu” means elder and literal meaning of “Muthuvar” is elders. Muthuvan are the ancient tribes of this land.

The Muthuvans are very independent and reluctant to interact with the outside world. The Muthuva tribe grows [[Finger millet|ragi]], [[cardamom]] and [[lemon grass]]. Now they are also cultivating banana and tapioca for their daily usage.

[[Image:Muenster Lamberti Koerbe 6428.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cages of the leaders of the Münster Rebellion at the steeple of St. Lambert's Church]]

The '''Münster rebellion''' was an attempt by radical [[Anabaptist]]s to establish a [[communism|communal]] sectarian government in the German city of [[Münster]]. The city was under Anabaptist rule from February 1534, when the city hall was seized and [[Bernhard Knipperdolling]] installed as mayor, until its fall in June 1535. It was [[Melchior Hoffman]], who initiated [[adult baptism]] in [[Strasbourg]] in 1530, and his line of [[eschatology|eschatological]] Anabaptism, that helped lay the foundations for the events of 1534–1535 in Münster.

==Rebellion==
[[Image:MuensterHinrichtungTaeufer.jpg|thumb|200px|Historical drawing of the execution of the leaders of the rebellion. In the background the cages are already in place at the old steeple of St. Lambert's church.]]
After the [[German Peasants' War]] (1524–1525), a forceful attempt to establish theocracy was made at Münster, in [[Westphalia]] (1532–1535). Here the group had gained considerable influence, through the adhesion of [[Bernhard Rothmann]], the [[Lutheran]] pastor, and several prominent citizens; and the leaders, [[Jan Matthys]] (also spelled Matthijs, Mathijsz, Matthyssen, Mathyszoon), a baker from [[Haarlem]], and [[John of Leiden|Jan Bockelson]] (or Beukelszoon), a tailor from [[Leiden]]. [[Bernhard Rothmann]] was a tireless and vitriolic opponent of Catholicism and a writer of pamphlets that were published by his ally and wealthy wool merchant [[Bernhard Knipperdolling]]. The pamphlets at first denounced Catholicism from a radical Lutheran perspective, but soon started to proclaim that the [[Bible]] called for the absolute equality of man in all matters including the distribution of wealth. The pamphlets, which were distributed throughout northern Germany, successfully called upon the poor of the region to join the citizens of [[Münster]] to share the wealth of the town and benefit spiritually from being the elect of Heaven.

With so many adherents in the town, at the elections for the magistracy, Rothmann and his allies had little difficulty in obtaining possession of the town, and placing Bernhard Knipperdolling as the mayor after deposing the mainly Lutheran magistrates, who, until then, had seen him as an ally in their own distrust of, and dislike for, Catholics. Matthys was a follower of Melchior Hoffman, who, after Hoffman's imprisonment at Strasbourg, obtained a considerable following in the [[Low Countries]], including Bockelson, who became known as [[John of Leiden]]. John of Leiden and Gerrit Boekbinder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Anabaptism and Spiritualism, 1521–1700|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Roth|editor2-first=James|editor2-last=Stayer|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=2007|page=222|first=Ralf|last=Klötzer|chapter=Chapter 6: The Melchoirites and Münster|isbn=978-90-04-15402-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sYi50ItImHAC&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; had visited Münster, and returned with a report that Bernhard Rothmann was there teaching doctrines similar to their own. Matthys identified Münster as the "[[New Jerusalem]]", and on January 5, 1534, a number of his disciples entered the city and introduced adult baptism. Rothmann apparently accepted "''re''baptism" that day, and well over 1000 adults were soon baptised. Vigorous preparations were made, not only to hold what had been gained, but to spread their beliefs to other areas. The many Lutherans who left were outnumbered by the arriving Anabaptists, there was an orgy of [[iconoclasm]] in cathedrals and monasteries, and rebaptism became compulsory. The property of the emigrants was shared out with the poor and soon a proclamation was issued that all property was to be held in common.{{sfn|Cohn|1970|pp=262-4}}

==Siege==
The city was then besieged by [[Franz von Waldeck]], its expelled [[bishop]]. In April 1534 on [[Easter Sunday]], Matthys, who had prophesied God's judgment to come on the wicked on that day, made a sally forth with only twelve followers, believing that he was a second [[Gideon]], and was cut off with his entire band. He was killed, his head severed and placed on a pole for all in the city to see, and his genitals nailed to the city gate.

The 25-year-old John of Leiden was subsequently recognized as Matthys' religious and political successor, justifying his authority and actions by the receipt of visions from heaven. His authority grew, eventually proclaiming himself to be the successor of [[David]] and adopting royal regalia, honors and absolute power in the new "[[Zion]]". There were at least three times as many women of marriageable age as men now in the town and he legalized [[polygamy]] and himself took sixteen wives. (John is said to have beheaded [[Elisabeth Wandscherer|one woman]] in the marketplace for refusing to marry him; this act might have been falsely attributed to him after his death.) Meanwhile, most of the residents of Münster were starving as a result of the year-long siege.

After lengthy resistance, the city was taken by the besiegers on June 24, 1535 and John of Leiden and several other prominent Anabaptist leaders were captured and imprisoned. In January 1536 John of Leiden, Bernhard Knipperdolling and one more prominent follower, [[Bernhard Krechting]], were tortured and executed in the marketplace of Münster. Their bodies were exhibited in cages, which hung from the steeple of [[St Lambert's Church, Münster|St. Lambert's Church]]. The bones were removed later, but the cages hang there still.

==Aftermath==
The Münster Rebellion was a turning point for the Anabaptist movement. It never again had the opportunity of assuming [[politics|political]] importance, as both Catholic and Lutheran civil powers adopted stringent measures to counter this. It is difficult to trace the subsequent history of the group as a religious body, through changes in the names used and beliefs held.

The [[Batenburgers]] under Jan van Batenburg preserved the violent [[millennialism|millennialist]] stream of Anabaptism seen at Münster. They were polygamous and believed force was justified against anyone not in their sect. Their movement went underground after the suppression of the Münster Rebellion, with members posing as Catholics or Lutherans as necessary. Some [[Nonresistance|nonresistant]] Anabaptists found leaders in [[Menno Simons]] and the brothers [[Obbe Philips|Obbe]] and [[Dirk Philips]], Dutch Anabaptist leaders who repudiated the distinctive doctrines of the Münster Anabaptists. This group eventually became known as the [[Mennonites]] after Simons. They rejected any use of violence and preached a faith based on love of enemy and compassion.

In August 1536 the leaders of Anabaptist groups influenced by Melchior Hoffman met in [[Bocholt, Germany|Bocholt]] in an attempt to maintain unity. The meeting included followers of Batenburg, survivors of Münster, [[David Joris]] and his sympathisers, and the nonresistant Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;(Williams, p.&amp;nbsp;582)&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting the major areas of dispute between the sects were polygamous marriage and the use of force against non-believers. Joris proposed compromise by declaring the time had not yet come to fight against the authorities, and that it would be unwise to kill any non-Anabaptists. The gathered Anabaptists agreed to the compromise of no more force,&lt;ref&gt;(Williams, p.&amp;nbsp;583)&lt;/ref&gt; but the meeting did not prevent the fragmentation of Anabaptism.

'''Naikpikhel''' (also '''Nekbikhel''' {{lang-ps| نیکپی خیل'}}) is a sub clan of Yousafzai Pashtun in Swat residing in the surrounding area of Tehsil [[Kabal, Swat]] lying just opposite to [[Mingora]] (Mingawara) on the western bank of [[River Swat]], [[Swat District|Swat]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].

==Ethnicity==

''Naikpikhel'' belongs to '''Yousafzai''' branch of Pashtuns and further expanded to the family tree from ''Malak Yousaf (Yousafzai) ''  to ''Aku  (Aku Zai). From the first wife of ''Aku (Aku Zai) namely 'Gouhara', we have four sons which form the tree to four sub tribes as 1. ''Baizai'', 2. ''Khwaja Zai'', 3. ''Aba Zai'', 4. ''Khadak Zai''.

'''Khwaja Zai''' is expended to ''Mali Zai'', ''Sujni'', ''Shami Zai'', ''Naikpi Khel'', ''Shamo Zai'', ''Aden Zai''.

==Etymology==
The name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Nikpi'' (نیکپی), which is Pashto for "fortunate", and ''khel'' (خیل), which is Pashto for "tribe" or "clan".

==Naikpi Khel Sub Khel (Tribe/Clan)==

The Nikpikhel are divided into Four Sub clans, Aba Khel,  Aisha Khel, Sheikh Sena and Musa. The Aisha khel comprises villages named Kanju, Dherai, Damghar, Kuza Bandai, Momdherai, Sigram, Lalu Bandai, Kamar Bandai, Jut Kot, Maloka, [[Bara Bandai]], Ghorijo, Dhelay, Jalawan and Ningolai.

'''Aba Khel''' is divided into ''Bar'' ("upper") Aba Khel and ''Koz'' ("lower") Aba Khel. Koz Aba Khel includes Dedahara, Gadi, Dagay, Kotlai, Akhud Kilay, Kabal, Sirsinai, Hazara, Aligrama and Malooch. Bar Aba Khel includes Kalakalay, Totano Bandai, Manja, Golden, Devlai, Nasrat, Shahdeari, Samai, Maira, Tall, [Dardyal],kamkhwalai, chur, penawrhai and Kamyari.

Bar Aba Khel is divided into three clans or tribes: Mata Khel, Zaina Khel, and Sahib Khel.

''Mata Khel'' sub clan are [[Karam Ali Khel (Karmali Khel)]], [[Maryam Khel]], [[Saran Khel]], [[Jora Khel]], [[Khusal Khel]], [[Bemi Khel]], [[Ranjo Khel]] and some descendant from wasli [[Khattak]] reside in Shahderai, Totano Bandai (Totanobandai), Golden, Manja and Dardyal.

''Zaina Khel'' sub clan are Merwais Khel, Usman Khel; Merwais Khel is further expanded to Sheda Khel, Umer Khel, Painda Khel, Musa Khel. Usman Khel is further divided into Jogi Khel, Nemat Khel, Baba Khel and Hasan Ali Khel.

''Sahib Khel'' is further divided into sub khel's like Mamo Khel (Mamo Khel sub Khel are Bado Khel, Mansaf Khel, Wali Khel), Bostan Khel, Baro Khel (Baro Khel sub khel is Ayoub Khel) , Dolat Khan Khel and Shabor Khel which are based in Devlai, Golden, Nasrat, Shalhand, Tagma, Malakana and Sirsinai. The grave of Baro baba famous as (Zyara Baba) is situated in Sirsinai.

'''Musa''' has only two sub khel according to Shajara namely Sar Abdal and Bakhti.

'''Aisha Khel''' is divided in three sub clans Zubar Khel, Khudai Khel and Dado Khel. ''Zubar Khel'' has further family tree of Rama Khel, Nemat Khel, Khata Khel and Pai Khel. ''Khudai Khel'' to Babokar Khel, Umer Khan, Zaal Khel and Mian Khan Khel. ''Dado Khel'' to Ali Khan Khel, Aibo Khel, Manki Khel, Jogi Khel, Ghali khel and Nasar Khel. In the same manner Ali Khan Khel is further expended to Audal Khel, Bucha Khel, Bara Khan Khel, Saido Khel and Sultan Khel. While Nasar Khel has sub khel of Shado Khel, Ajo Khel, Tawas Khel and Mandar.

'''Sheikh Sena''' has no such further sub khel information.

The '''Nine Saints''' were a group of [[missionary|missionaries]] who were important in the initial growth of [[Christianity]] in what is now [[Ethiopia]] during the late 5th century. Their names were Abba Aftse, Abba Alef, [[Abuna Aregawi|Abba Aragawi]], [[Abba Garima]] (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Abba Guba, Abba Liqanos, [[Abba Pantelewon]], Abba Sehma, and [[Abba Yem’ata]]. Although frequently described as coming from [[Syria]], only two or three actually came from that province; according to Paul B. Henze, others have been traced to [[Constantinople]], [[Anatolia]], and even [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
The Ethiopian historian [[Tadesse Tamrat]] speculates that they may have been connected with the anti-[[Monophysite]] and anti-[[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] persecutions that followed the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which adopted [[Chalcedonian|Dyophysitism]]. Tradition states that upon arrival they were welcomed by the [[Axum]]ite king [[Ella Amida]]. Their activities spread Christianity beyond "a narrow corridor between [[Adulis]] and Aksum along the caravan routes."&lt;ref&gt;Taddesse Tamrat, ''Church and State in Ethiopia, 1270-1527'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972 {{ISBN|0-19-821671-8}}), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides converting the local inhabitants to Christianity, they also founded a number of [[monasticism|monastic]] houses that followed the rule of Saint [[Pachomius]]: Abba Aftse founded the monastery at [[Yeha]]; Abba Alef the northernmost establishment at [[Bi'isa]] on the south bank of the [[Mareb River]]; the foundation of the important monastery of [[Debre Damo]] is attributed to Abba Aragawi; Abbas Liqanos and Pantelewon are credited with establishing [[Pentalewon Monastery]] in [[Axum]]; Abba Garima founded [[Abba Garima Monastery]] north of [[Adwa]]; Abba Guba the one at Madara; Abba Sehma one at Sedenya; and Abba Yem’ata founded the southernmost one of the group in the [[Gar'alta]], noted for its [[Abuna Yemata Guh]] church named after him.&lt;ref&gt;This list is from [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''The Ethiopians, A history'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), p.37 n. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abba Garima and the Garima Gospels==
Recent radiocarbon dating supports the tradition of Saint Abba Garima's arrival at the Abba Garima Monastery in 494.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Discovery-of-earliest-illuminated-manuscript%20%20/20990|title=Discovery of earliest illuminated manuscript|author=Martin Bailey|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}} {{cite web|url=http://ethiopianheritagefund.org/artsNewspaper.html|title=?|author=|date=June 2010|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501030359/http://ethiopianheritagefund.org/artsNewspaper.html|archivedate=2012-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Garima Gospels]], which Garima is said to have written, is now regarded as "the world's earliest illustrated Christian manuscript" and the oldest surviving Ethiopian manuscript of any kind.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

== Nine Saints in Cyprus ==

A painting belonging to the Cyprus Presidential Palace with the same title (but quite unrelated to the above) was on exhibition in the Λεβέντειος Πινακοθήκη in Nicosia in 2014. Information about the painting is found in the August 25th issue of the Greek-Cypriot Sunday newspaper Καθημερινή, [http://www.kathimerini.com.cy/index.php?pageaction=kat&amp;modid=1&amp;artid=181626].&lt;br /&gt;
The nine saints are also found in the Sinaxaristis (Συναξαριστής in Greek), [http://www.saint.gr/2181/saint.aspx]

The '''Orang Laut''' are an [[ethnic group]] living around [[Singapore]], [[peninsular Malaysia]] and the [[Riau Islands]].  It also may refer to any Malay origin people living on coastal islands, including those of [[Andaman Sea]] islands of [[India]] and those in [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]], commonly known as [[Moken]].

==Etymology==
The [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''orang laut'' literally means "sea peoples". The Orang laut live and travel in their boats on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cross Currents of Culture in Indonesia|author=Adriaan J. Barnouw|journal=The Far Eastern Quarterly|volume=5|issue=2|pages=143&amp;ndash;151|date=February 1946|doi=10.2307/2049739|publisher=The Far Eastern Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 2|jstor=2049739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Malay term for them, ''Orang Selat'' (literally "[[Strait of Malacca|Straits]] people" ), was brought into European languages as ''Celates''.

==Distribution==
[[File:Sea Nomads distribution map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Regions inhabited by peoples usually known as "Sea Nomads".&lt;ref name="sopher"&gt;{{cite journal|author=David E. Sopher|year=1965|title=The Sea Nomads: A Study Based on the Literature of the Maritime Boat People of Southeast Asia|journal=Memoirs of the National Museum|volume=5|pages=389&amp;ndash;403|doi=10.2307/2051635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{Legend|#e8bb9c|Orang Laut}}{{Legend|#86adfd|[[Moken]]}}{{Legend|#88c885|[[Sama-Bajau]]}}&lt;/small&gt;]] 
Broadly speaking, the term  encompasses the numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the [[Riau-Lingga Archipelagos]], the [[Pulau Tujuh Islands]], the [[Batam]] Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern Sumatra, southern Malaysia Peninsula and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html "The Malay Peninsula and Archipelago 1511–1722" ''The Encyclopedia of World History'' 2001];&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Woonschuiten van de Orang-Laoets langs de kusten van Djambi en Riouw varende TMnr 10010489.jpg|thumb|House barges of the Orang Laut off the coast of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]], [[Dutch East Indies]], circa 1914-1921.]]
Historically, the ''orang laut'' played major roles in [[Srivijaya]], the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], and the [[Sultanate of Johor]]. They patrolled the adjacent sea areas, repelling real pirates, directing traders to their employers' ports and maintaining those ports' dominance in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Somers Heidhues. ''Southeast Asia: A Concise History''. London: Hudson and Thames, 2000. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest description of ''orang laut'' may have been by the 14th century Chinese traveller [[Wang Dayuan]] who described the inhabitants of [[temasek]] (present day Singapore) in his work ''[[Daoyi Zhilüe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Wheatley|authorlink=w:Paul Wheatley (geographer)|title=The Golden Khersonese: Studies in the Historical Geography of the Malay Peninsula before A.D. 1500|location=Kuala Lumpur|publisher=[[w:University of Malaya|University of Malaya Press]]|year=1961|oclc=504030596|pages= 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[Image:RIAU WEB.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Villages of Orang Laut in [[Riau Islands]].]]
In the story "''The Disturber of Traffic''" by [[Rudyard Kipling]], a character called Fenwick misrenders the Orang laut as "Orange-Lord" and the narrator character corrects him that they are the "Orang-Laut".

'''Ossetian''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ɒ|ˈ|s|ɛ|t|i|ə|n}}, {{IPAc-en|ɒ|ˈ|s|iː|ʃ|ə|n}}),{{sfn|OED:Ossetian||p=}} also known as '''Ossete''' and '''Ossetic'''{{sfn|Dalby|1998}} ({{Lang-os|ирон æвзаг|links=no|iron ævzag}}), is an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian language]] spoken in [[Ossetia]], a region on the northern slopes of the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. It is a relative and possibly a descendant of the extinct [[Scythian languages|Scythian]], [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]], and [[Alans|Alanic]] languages.&lt;ref name=bbuat&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubotsky |first=Alexander |title=Van Sanskriet tot Spijkerschrift Breinbrekers uit alle talen |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2010 |page=34 |isbn=9089641793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ossete area in [[Russia]] is known as [[North Ossetia-Alania]], while the area south of the border is referred to as [[South Ossetia]], recognised by Russia, [[Nicaragua]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Nauru]] as an independent state but by most of the rest of the international community as part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Ossetian speakers number about 577,450, with 451,000&amp;nbsp;speakers in the Russian Federation recorded in the 2010 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/oss |title= Ossetic |work=[[Ethnologue]] |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and classification==
Ossetian is the spoken and literary language of the [[Ossetes]], a people living in the central part of the Caucasus and constituting the basic population of the republic of North Ossetia–Alania, which belongs to the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], and of [[South Ossetia]], which is ''de facto'' independent (but is ''de jure'' part of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian Republic]] according to most other states). Ossetian belongs to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] group of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages (as hinted by its endonym, ирон). Within Iranian it is placed in an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern]] subgroup and further to a Northeastern sub-subgroup, but these are [[Sprachbund|areal]] rather than genetic groups. The other Eastern Iranian languages such as [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] show certain commonalities but also deep-reaching divergences from Ossetic.

From deep [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] (since the 7th–8th&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE), the languages of the Iranian group were distributed in a vast territory including present-day [[Iran]] ([[Persia]]), [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Ossetian is the sole survivor of the branch of Iranian languages known as [[Scythian languages|Scythian]]. The Scythian group included numerous tribes, known in ancient sources as the [[Scythians]], [[Massagetae]], [[Saka]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Alans]] and [[Roxolans]]. The more easterly [[Khwarezm|Khorezmians]] and the [[Sogdians]] were also closely affiliated, in linguistic terms.

Ossetian, together with [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Tati (Iran)|Tati]] and [[Talysh language|Talyshi]], is one of the main [[Iranian languages]] with a sizable community of speakers in the Caucasus. It is descended from [[Alanic language|Alanic]], the language of the [[Alans]], medieval tribes emerging from the earlier [[Sarmatians]]. It is believed to be the only surviving descendant of a [[Scythian languages|Sarmatian language]]. The closest genetically related language may be the [[Yaghnobi language]] of [[Tajikistan]], the only other living Northeastern Iranian language.&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"&gt;Abaev, V. I.

[http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/ossetian/ossetian.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Ossetian has a plural formed by the suffix -''ta'', a feature it shares with Yaghnobi, Sarmatian and the now-extinct Sogdian; this is taken as evidence of a formerly wide-ranging Iranian-language [[dialect continuum]] on the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppe]]. The names of ancient Iranian tribes (as transmitted through Ancient Greek) in fact reflect this pluralization, e.g. ''Saromatae'' (Σαρομάται) and ''Masagetae'' (Μασαγέται).&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald |title=On the Historical Phonology of Ossetic: The Origin of the Oblique Case Suffix |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |date=2003 |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=43–72 |doi=10.2307/3217844}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}

===Evidence for Medieval Ossetian===
The earliest known written sample of Ossetian is an [[inscription]] which dates from the 10th to 12th&amp;nbsp;centuries and was found near the River [[Bolshoi Zelenchuk]] at [[Arkhyz]]. The text is written in the [[Greek alphabet]], with special [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]].

|}

The only other extant record of Proto-Ossetic are the two lines of "Alanic" phrases appearing in the ''Theogony'' of [[John Tzetzes]], a 12th&amp;nbsp;century [[Byzantine]] [[poet]] and [[philologist|grammarian]]:
{{quote|{{lang|grc|Τοῖς ἀλανοῖς προσφθέγγομαι κατά τήν τούτων γλῶσσαν&lt;br /&gt;Καλή ημέρα σου αὐθεντα μου αρχόντισσα πόθεν εἶσαι&lt;br /&gt;''Ταπαγχὰς μέσφιλι χσινὰ κορθὶ κάντα'' καὶ τ’άλλα&lt;br /&gt;ἂν ὃ ἒχη ἀλάνισσα παπὰν φίλον ἀκούσαις ταῦτα&lt;br /&gt;οὐκ αἰσχύνεσσι αὐθέντρια μου νὰ μου γαμὴ τὸ μουνί σου παπᾶς&lt;br /&gt;''τὸ φάρνετζ κίντζι μέσφιλι καίτζ φουὰ σαοῦγγε''|italic=unset}}&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;{{rp|54}}{{sfn|Zgusta|1987}}}}
The italicized portions above are Ossetian. Going beyond a direct transliteration of the Greek text, scholars have attempted a [[phonology|phonological]] [[Internal reconstruction|reconstruction]] using the Greek as clues, thus, while τ ([[tau]]) would usually be given the value "t," it instead is "d", which is thought to be the way the early Ossetes would have pronounced it. The scholarly transliteration of the Alanic phrases is: "dæ ban xʷærz, mæ sfili, (æ)xsinjæ kurθi kændæ" and "du farnitz, kintzæ mæ sfili, kajci fæ wa sawgin?"; equivalents in modern Ossetian would be ''"Dæ bon xwarz, me’fšini ‘xšinæ, kurdigæj dæ?"'' and ''"(De’) f(s)arm neč(ij), kinźi æfšini xæcc(æ) (ku) fæwwa sawgin"''.&lt;ref name="Kambolov"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Tamerlan |last=Kambolov |title=Some New Observations on the Zelenchuk Inscription and Tzetzes’ Alanic Phrases |conference=Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans – Iranian-Speaking Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes |pages=21–22 |location=Barcelona |date=10 May 2007 |url=http://class.csueastbay.edu/anthropologymuseum/2006IA/DNA_PDFS/yDNA/Sarmatian%20Abstracts.pdf |access-date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage translates as:

{{quote|The Alans I greet in their language:&lt;br /&gt;"Good day to you my lord's lady, where are you from?"&lt;br /&gt;"Good day to you my lord's lady, where are you from?" and other things:&lt;br /&gt;When an Alan woman takes a priest as a lover, you might hear this:&lt;br /&gt;"Aren't you ashamed, my lordly lady, that your cunt is being fucked by a priest?"&lt;!-- please don't remove, this is the literal translation of the Greek text--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aren't you ashamed, my lady, to have a love affair with the priest?"{{sfn|Zgusta|1987}}&lt;ref name="Kambolov" /&gt;}}

[[Marginalia]] of Greek religious books, with some parts (such as headlines) of the book translated into Old Ossetic, have been recently found.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

It is theorized that during the Proto-Ossetic phase, Ossetian underwent a process of phonological change conditioned by a ''[[Rhythmusgesetz]]'' or "Rhythm-law" whereby nouns were divided into two classes, those heavily or lightly [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]]. "Heavy-stem" nouns possessed a "heavy" long [[vowel]] or [[diphthong]], and were stressed on the first-occurring syllable of this type; "light-stem" nouns were stressed on their final syllable. This is precisely the situation observed in the earliest (though admittedly scanty) records of Ossetian presented above.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;{{rp|47}} This situation also obtains in Modern Ossetian, although the emphasis in [[Digor dialect|Digor]] is also affected by the "openness" of the vowel.{{sfn|Zgusta|1987|p=51}} The trend is also found in a [[glossary]] of the [[Jassic dialect]] dating from 1422.{{sfn|Zgusta|1987|p=55}}

==Dialects==
There are two important dialects: [[Iron dialect|Iron]] and [[Digor dialect|Digor]],&lt;ref name=bbuat/&gt; spoken by five-sixths and one-sixth of the population, respectively. A third dialect of Ossetian, [[Jassic dialect|Jassic]], was formerly spoken in [[Hungary]].

The Iron dialect of Ossetic has 7 vowels:

Ossetian researcher [[Vasily Abayev|V. I. Abayev]] distinguishes 26 consonants, to which five labialized consonants and two semivowels may be added. Unusually for an Indo-European language, there is a series of [[Glottalization|glottalized]] ([[Ejective consonant|ejective]]) stops and affricates. This can be considered an [[areal feature]] of [[languages of the Caucasus]].

Voiceless consonants become voiced word-medially (this is reflected in the orthography as well). {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}, and {{IPA|/t͡ʃʼ/}} were originally [[allophones]] of {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and {{IPA|/kʼ/}} when followed by {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ̈/}}; this alternation is still retained to a large extent.

Stress normally falls on the first syllable, unless it has a "weak" vowel ({{IPA|/ɪ̈/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}), in which case it falls on the second syllable. In the Iron dialect, definiteness is expressed in post-initially stressed words by shifting the stress to the initial syllable. This reflects the fact that historically they received a [[syllable|syllabic]] [[definite article]] (as they still do in the Digor dialect), and the addition of the syllable caused the stress to shift.&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;

==Grammar==

According to [[Vasily Abaev|V.I. Abaev]],&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;
{{bq|In the course of centuries-long propinquity to and intercourse with Caucasian languages,  Ossetian became similar to them in some features, particularly in phonetics and lexicon. However, it retained its grammatical structure and basic lexical stock; its relationship with the Iranian family, despite considerable individual traits,  does not arouse any doubt.}}

===Nouns===

Ossetic has lost the grammatical category of [[grammatical gender|gender]] which many Indo-European languages have preserved until today.&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica 2006&lt;ref name="Britannica 2006"&gt;Ossetic language. (2006). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved August 26, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057571&lt;/ref&gt; Ossetian preserves many archaic features of Old Iranian, such as eight cases and verbal prefixes. It is debated how many of these cases are actually inherited from Indo-Iranian case morphemes and how many have re-developed, after the loss of the original case forms, through [[clitic]]ization of adverbs or re-interpretations of [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational suffixes]]: the number of "inherited" cases according to different scholars ranges from as few as three (nominative, genitive and inessive) to as many as six (nominative, dative, ablative, directive, inessive). Some (the comitative, equative, and adessive) are secondary beyond any doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Т.Т. Камболов. 2006 Очерк истории осетинского языка. p.330-339&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definiteness====
[[Definiteness]] is, according to Abaev, only expressed by shift of word accent from the second to the first syllable (which is not possible in all nouns):
* ''færǽt'' "an axe"
* ''fǽræt'' "the axe"

====Cases====
Nouns and adjectives share the same morphology and distinguish two numbers (singular and plural) and nine cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], directive, [[ablative]], [[inessive]], [[adessive]], [[Equative case|equative]], and [[comitative]]. The nominal morphology is [[agglutinative]]: the case suffixes and the number suffix are separate, the case suffixes are the same for both numbers and the number suffix is the same for all cases:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
! Comitative
| align=center |сӕримӕ ''særimæ''
| align=center |сӕр'''т'''имӕ ''sær'''t'''imæ''
|}

Since inessive and genitive show the same forms in both numbers, it is sometimes debated whether Ossetian might possess eight case forms for each number instead of nine.

===Verbs===
Verbs distinguish six persons (1st, 2nd and 3d, singular and plural), three tenses (present, past and future, all expressed [[synthetic language|synthetically]]), and three moods ([[indicative]], [[subjunctive]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]]). The person, tense and mood morphemes are mostly fused. [[Passive voice]] is expressed [[periphrastic]]ally with the past passive participle and an [[auxiliary verb]] meaning "to go"; causative and reflexive meaning are also expressed by periphrastic constructions. Verbs may belong to one of two [[lexical aspect]]s ([[perfective]] vs [[imperfective]]); these are expressed by prefixes, which often have prepositional origin. There is an [[infinitive]] (morphologically coinciding with the 1st person singular, but syntactically forming a [[nominal phrase]]), four participles (present and past active, past passive, and future), and a [[gerund]]. Vowel and consonant alternations occur between the present and past stems of the verb and between intransitive and transitive forms. Intransitive and transitive verbs also differ in the endings they take in the past tense (in intransitive verbs, the construction is, in origin, a periphrastic combination of the past passive participle and the verb "to be").&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt; There are also special verb forms, such as immediate future tense that is transmitted by adding -inag to the verb and the auxiliary verb meaning "to be". Future Imperative is another special form that is transmitted through usage of independent particle iu. Yet another special verbal form that is used to reflect either an interrupted process or a process that has nearly been completed. This form is made up through the use of a particle sæi that is stuck between the prefix, usually fæ- and the verb.

Ossetic uses mostly [[postposition]]s (derived from nouns), although two prepositions exist in the language. [[modifier (grammar)|Noun modifier]]s precede nouns. The [[word order]] is not rigid, but tends towards [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]. The [[morphosyntactic alignment]] is [[nominative–accusative]], although there is no [[accusative case]]: rather, the direct object is in the nominative (typically if [[animacy|inanimate]] or [[definiteness|indefinite]]) or in the genitive (typically if animate or definite).&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;

For numerals above 20, two systems are in use&amp;nbsp;– a [[decimal]] one used officially, and a [[vigesimal]] one used colloquially.&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;

==Writing system==
[[File:Oseta kartvela skribo.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Ossetic text written with Georgian script, from a book on Ossetian folklore published in 1940 in South Ossetia]]
Written Ossetian may be immediately recognized by its use of the [[Ae (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter Ae]] (Ӕ&amp;nbsp;ӕ), a letter to be found in no other language using [[Cyrillic script]]. The father of the modern Ossetian literary language is the national poet [[Kosta Khetagurov]] (1859–1906).&lt;ref name="AbaevEnglish"/&gt;

An Iron literary language was established in the 18th century, written using the Cyrillic script in Russia and the Georgian script in Georgia. The first Ossetian book was published in Cyrillic in 1798, and in 1844 the alphabet was revised by a Russian scientist of Finnish-Swedish origin, [[Anders Johan Sjögren|Andreas Sjögren]]. A new alphabet based on the [[Latin script]] was made official in the 1920s, but in 1937 a revised Cyrillic alphabet was introduced, with digraphs replacing most [[diacritic]]s of the 1844 alphabet.

In 1820, I. Yalguzidze published a Georgian-script alphabetic primer, adding three letters to the Georgian alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ironau.ru/kaos.html Correspondence table between the Georgian based and the modern script with examples of use] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian orthography receded in the 19th century, but was made official with Georgian autonomy in 1937. The "one nation – two alphabets" issue caused discontent in South Ossetia in the year 1951 demanding reunification of the script, and in 1954 Georgian was replaced with the 1937 Cyrillic alphabet.

A Digor literary language was established in the late 19th century, using the Arabic script. It was abolished in 1939, five years before the Digor were deported to Siberia. Iron in Cyrillic is now the literary language for both dialects.

The table below shows the modern Cyrillic alphabet, used since 1937, with phonetic values for the Iron dialect in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]. Di- and tri-graphs in parentheses are not officially letters of the alphabet, but are listed here to represent phonemically distinctive sounds:

==Language usage==
[[File:1agRastdzinad.jpg|thumb|225px|The first page of the first issue of the Ossetian newspaper ''[[Ræstdzinad]]''. Sjögren's Cyrillic alphabet. 1923]]
The first printed book in Ossetian appeared in 1798. The first newspaper, ''[[Iron Gazet]]'', appeared on July 23, 1906 in [[Vladikavkaz]].

While Ossetian is the official language in both South and North Ossetia (along with Russian), its official use is limited to publishing new laws in Ossetian newspapers. There are two daily newspapers in Ossetian: ''[[Ræstdzinad]]'' (Рæстдзинад / Рӕстꚉінад, "Truth") in the North and ''[[Xurzærin]]'' (Хурзæрин, "The Sun") in the South. Some smaller newspapers, such as district newspapers, use Ossetian for some articles. There is a monthly magazine ''[[Max dug]]'' (Мах дуг, "Our era"), mostly devoted to contemporary Ossetian fiction and poetry.

Ossetian is taught in secondary schools for all pupils.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Native Ossetian speakers also take courses in [[Ossetian literature]].

The first Ossetian language Bible was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/oss|title=Ossetic|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the only full version of the Bible in the Ossetian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/russia/censorship-russian-bibles-literature/#?insight%5Bsearch_id%5D=8a185b64-5401-456c-a423-e5f8ddaa7936&amp;insight%5Bsearch_result_index%5D=0|title=Russian Censorship: Ossetian &amp; Russian Bibles, Bible Literature|newspaper=JW.ORG|access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penang Hokkien''' ({{zh|t=檳城福建話|s=槟城福建话|first=t}}; [[Tai-lo|Tâi-lô]]: ''Pin-siânn Hok-kiàn-uā''; {{zh|poj=Pin-siâⁿ Hok-kiàn-ōa}}) is a local variant of [[Hokkien]] spoken in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. It is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the majority [[Penangite Chinese|Chinese]] population in [[Penang]], as well as the neighbouring states of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]] and northern part of [[Perak]]. This [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialect]] is spoken as a mother tongue by up to 63.9% of [[Penangite Chinese|Penang's Chinese]] community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penangmonthly.com/article.aspx?pageid=7447&amp;name=dialects_and_languages_in_numbers|title=Dialects and Languages in Numbers|website=Dialects and Languages in Numbers,|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also spoken by some members of [[Malaysians of Indian descent in Penang|Penang's Indian]] and [[Kedahan Malay people|Malay]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaymailonline.com/features/article/saving-the-penang-hokkien-language-one-word-at-a-time&lt;/ref&gt;

Penang Hokkien is a subdialect of [[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou]] (漳州; Hokkien: ''Chiang-chiu'') Chinese, together with widespread use of [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]] loan words. It is said that it most closely resembles that spoken in the district of [[Haicang District|Haicang]] (海滄) in [[Longhai City|Longhai]] (龍海; Hokkien: ''Liông-hái'') [[county]] and in the districts of [[Jiaomei]] (角美) and [[Xinglin]] (杏林) in neighbouring Xiamen prefecture. In [[Southeast Asia]], similar dialects are spoken in the states bordering [[Penang]] ([[Kedah]], [[Perlis]] and northern [[Perak]]), as well as in [[Medan]] and [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It is markedly distinct from [[Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].

==Orthography==
Penang Hokkien is largely a spoken language: it is rarely written in [[Chinese characters]], and there is no official standard [[romanisation]]. In recent years, there has been a growing body of romanised Penang Hokkien material, however topics are mostly limited to the language itself such as dictionaries and learning materials. This is linked to efforts to preserve, revitalise and promote the language as part of Penang's cultural heritage, due to increasing awareness of the loss of Penang Hokkien usage among younger generations in favour of [[Malaysian Mandarin|Mandarin]] and English. The standard romanisation systems commonly used in these materials are based on [[Tâi-lô]] and [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] (POJ), with varying modifications to suit Penang Hokkien phonology.

The Hokkien Language Association of Penang (''Persatuan Bahasa Hokkien Pulau Pinang''; 庇能福建話協會) is one such organisation which promotes the language's usage and revitalisation. Through their [[Speak Hokkien Campaign]] they promote a Tâi-lô based system modified to suit the phonology of Penang Hokkien and its loanwords. This system is used throughout this article and its features are detailed below. 

The Speak Hokkien Campaign also promotes the use of [[traditional Chinese characters]] derived from recommended character lists for [[written Hokkien]] published by [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Taiwan's Ministry of Education]].

Most native-speakers are not aware of these standardised systems and resort to ad hoc methods of romanisation based on English, Malay and [[Pinyin]] spelling rules. These methods are in common use for many proper names and food items, e.g. ''[[Char Kway Teow]]'' (炒粿條 ''Tshá-kúe-tiâu''). These spellings are often inconsistent and highly variable with several alternate spellings being well established. These methods, which are more intuitive to the average native-speaker, are the basis of non-standard romanisation systems used in some written material.

* In the Tâi-lô system for Penang Hokkien, vowels are [[nasal vowels|nasalised]] using final {{angle bracket|-nn}}, while POJ uses superscript {{angle bracket|◌ⁿ}}. Vowel nasalisation also occurs in words that have nasal initials ({{angle bracket|m-}}, {{angle bracket|n-}}, {{angle bracket|ng-}}), however, this is not indicated, e.g. 卵 ''nūi'' ([nuĩ]).&lt;br&gt;For most speakers who are not aware of the standard romanisation, nasalisation is commonly indicated by putting an {{angle bracket|n}} after the initial consonant of a word. This is commonly seen for the popular Penang delicacy ''Tau Sar Pneah'' (豆沙餅 ''Tāu-sá-piánn'').&lt;br/&gt;In other instances, nasalisation may not be indicated at all, such as in the common last name ''Ooi'' (黃 ''Uînn'').
* The nasalised vowel {{angle bracket|unn}} is only found as part of {{angle bracket|iaunn}}, it does not exist in Hokkien as a final or in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;The rime {{angle bracket|iaunn}} is a variant pronunciation of {{angle bracket|ionn}}. The two may be used interchangeably in Penang Hokkien, e.g. 張 ''tiaunn/tionn'', 羊 ''iâunn/iônn''.
* When {{angle bracket|ia}} is followed by final {{angle bracket|-n}} or {{angle bracket|-t}}, it is pronounced [iɛ], with {{angle bracket|ian}} and {{angle bracket|iat}} being pronounced as [iɛn] and [iɛt̚] respectively.&lt;br/&gt;In speech, these sounds are often reduced to [ɛn] and [ɛt̚], e.g. 免 ''mián/mén''.
* When {{angle bracket|i}} is followed by final {{angle bracket|-k}} or {{angle bracket|-ng}}, it is pronounced as [ek̚] and [eŋ] respectively rather than other dialects which will pronounced as [iɪk̚] and [iɪŋ] respectively. e.g. 色 ''sik'' /ɕek̚/.
* {{angle bracket|ioo}} is a variant of {{angle bracket|io}} which is only found with the initial {{angle bracket|n-}}, e.g. 娘 ''niôo''.

===Tones===

In Penang Hokkien, the two ''Departing'' tones (3rd &amp; 7th) are virtually identical, and may not be distinguished except in their [[sandhi]] forms. Most native speakers of Penang Hokkien are therefore only aware of four tones in unchecked syllables (high, low, rising, high falling), and two ''[[Entering tone|Entering]]'' tones (high and low) in checked syllables. In most systems of romanisation, this is accounted as seven tones altogether. The tones are:

The names of the tones no longer bear any relation to the tone contours. The (upper) ''Rising'' (2nd) tone has two variants in Penang Hokkien, a high falling tone [˥˧] (53) and a high rising tone [˦˦˥] (445). The high falling tone [˥˧] (53) is more common among the older generations while in the younger generations there has been a shift towards the use of the high rising tone [˦˦˥] (445). When the 3rd tone is sandhied to the 2nd tone, the high falling variant [˥˧] (53) is used, however some speakers may sandhi the 3rd tone to the 1st tone [˦˦] (44).&lt;ref name=Chuang2013 /&gt; As in Amoy and Zhangzhou, there is no lower ''Rising'' (6th) tone.

===Tone sandhi===

Like in other Minnan dialects, the tone of a syllable in Penang Hokkien depends on where in a phrase or sentence the relevant syllable is placed. For example, the word 牛 ''gû'' in isolation is pronounced with an ascending tone, [˨˧] (23), but when it combines with a following syllable, as in 牛肉 ''gû-bah'', it is pronounced with a low tone, [˨˩] (21).

{| cellpadding="10" align="right" class="toccolours"
| '''1st''' ||  → || '''7th''' || ← || '''5th'''
|-
| ↑  ||    || ↓  
|-
| '''2nd''' ||  ← || '''3rd''' ||    
|-
| ↑ (if -h) ||    || ↑ (if -h) 
|-
| '''4th''' || ↔ (if -p,-t,-k) || '''8th'''
|}

The rules which apply when a syllable is placed in front of a connected syllable in standard Minnan, simply put, are as follows:

* 1st becomes 7th
* 7th becomes 3rd
* 3rd becomes 2nd (often sounds like 1st in Penang Hokkien)
* 2nd becomes 1st
* 5th becomes 7th
Checked syllables (-h):
* 4th becomes 2nd (often sounds like 1st in Penang Hokkien)
* 8th becomes 3rd
Checked syllables (-p,-t,-k):
* 4th becomes 8th
* 8th becomes 4th

Although the two departing tones (3rd &amp; 7th) are virtually identical in Penang Hokkien, in their sandhi forms they become [˥˧] (53) and [˨˩] (21) and are thus easily distinguishable.

The "tone wheel" concept does not work perfectly for all speakers of Penang Hokkien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banlam.tawa.asia/2012/10/beima-shengdiao-tones-penang-hokkien.html "Penang Hokkien Tones"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnan and Mandarin tones===

There is a reasonably reliable correspondence between Hokkien and Mandarin tones:

* Upper ''Level'': Hokkien 1st tone = Mandarin 1st tone, e.g. 雞 ''ke''/''jī''.
* Lower ''Level'': Hokkien 5th tone = Mandarin 2nd tone, e.g. 龍 ''lêng''/''lóng''.
* ''Rising'': Hokkien 2nd tone = Mandarin 3rd tone, e.g. 馬 ''bée''/''mǎ''.
* ''Departing'': Hokkien 3rd/7th tones = Mandarin 4th tone, e.g. 兔 ''thòo''/''tù'', 象 ''tshiōnn''/''xiàng''.

Words with ''Entering'' tones all end with {{angle bracket|-p}}, {{angle bracket|-t}}, {{angle bracket|-k}} or {{angle bracket|-h}} ([[glottal stop]]). As Mandarin no longer has any ''Entering'' tones, there is no simple corresponding relationship for the Hokkien 4th and 8th tones, e.g. 國 ''kok''/''guó'', but 發 ''huat''/''fā''. The tone in Mandarin often depends on what the initial consonant of the syllable is (see the article on [[Entering tone]]s for details).

==Literary and colloquial pronunciations==

Hokkien has not been taught in schools in Penang since the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911, when Mandarin was made the Chinese national language. As such, few if any people have received any formal instruction in Hokkien, and it is not used for literary purposes. However, as in other variants of Min Nan, most words have both [[literary and colloquial reading|literary and colloquial pronunciations]], and the literary pronunciations still appear in limited circumstances, e.g.:

* in given names (but generally not surnames), e.g. 安 ''an'' rather than ''uann'', 玉 ''gio̍k'' rather than ''ge̍k'';
* in a few surnames, e.g. 葉 ''ia̍p'' rather than ''hio̍h''
* in other proper names, e.g. 龍山堂 ''Liông-san-tông'' rather than ''Lêng-suann-tn̂g''
* in certain set phrases, e.g. 差不多 ''tsha-put-to'' rather than ''tshee-m̄-to'', 見笑 ''kiàn-siàu'' rather than ''kìnn-tshiò''

Unlike in Taiwan and mainland China, the literary pronunciations of numbers higher than two are not used when giving telephone numbers, etc.; e.g. 二五四 ''jī-gōo-sì'' instead of ''jī-ngóo-sù''. Literary variants are generally eschewed in favour of colloquial pronunciations, e.g. 大學 ''tuā-o̍h'' instead of ''tāi-ha̍k''.

==Differences from other Minnan dialects==

Although Penang Hokkien is based on the Zhangzhou dialect, which in many cases result from the influence of other Minnan dialects.

* The use of Zhangzhou pronunciations such as 糜 ''muâi'' (Amoy: ''bê''), 先生 ''sin-senn'' (Amoy: ''sian-sinn''), etc.;
* The use of Zhangzhou expressions such as 調羹 ''thâu-kiong'' (Amoy: 湯匙 ''thng-sî'')
* The adoption of pronunciations from [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]: e.g. 我 ''wá'' (Zhangzhou: ''guá''), 我儂 ''wang'', 汝儂 ''luang'', 伊儂 ''iang'' (Zhangzhou and Amoy: 阮 ''gún''/''guán'', 恁 ''lín'', 𪜶 (亻因) ''īn'');
* The adoption of Amoy and Quanzhou pronunciations like 歹勢 ''pháinn-sè'' (Zhangzhou: ''bái''/''pháinn-sì''), 百 ''pah'' (Zhangzhou: ''peeh''), etc.

General pronunciation differences can be shown as below:

==Loanwords==
Due to Penang's rich linguistic and ethnic diversity, Penang Hokkien is in close contact with many other languages and dialects which are drawn on heavily for loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= de Gijzel |first= Luc |year= 2009 |title=English-Penang Hokkien Pocket Dictionary |location= George Town, Penang |publisher= Areca Books |isbn= 978-983-44646-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and English.
===Malay===

Like other dialects in Malaysia and [[Singapore]], [[Penang]] Hokkien borrows heavily from Malay, but sometimes to a greater extent than other Hokkien dialects, e.g.:

*''almari'': wardrobe (probably originally from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])
*''anting'': earring
*''balai'': police station
*''balu (baru)'': new(ly), just now
*''bangku'': stool (probably originally from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])
*''batu'': stone
*''berlian'': diamond
*''binatang'': animal
*''bunting'': pregnant
*''cilaka (celaka)'': damn it
*''campur '': to mix (usable in conjunction with bei as in bei campur)
*''jamban'': toilet
*''gatai (gatal)'': itchy
*''geli'': creepy; hair-raising

*''lampin'': nappy/diaper
*''loti (roti)'': bread (via Malay from [[Sanskrit]])
*''macam-macam'': what a fuss
*''mana'': as if?, since when? (also to be found in Teochew with the same meaning)
*''manik'': bead
*''mata'': police (from Malay ''mata-mata''; also present in Teochew)
*''pasar'': market, originally from the word Bazaar
*''pinggang'': waist
*''puluk'': bolster
*''pun'': also
*''rasa'': to feel
*''sabun'': soap (via Malay from  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]; also present in Taiwanese)
*''sampah'': garbage
*''sayang'': to love; what a pity/waste
*''sombong'': snobbish
*''suka'': to like (via Malay from Sanskrit)
*''tapi'': but
*''tolong'': help
*''tongkat'': walking stick
*''tuala'': towel (via Malay from Portuguese)

There are also many Hokkien words which have been borrowed into Malay, sometimes with slightly different meanings, e.g.:

* ''beca'' (trishaw; originally 馬車 ''bée-tshia'', "horse-cart")
* ''bihun'' (米粉 ''bí-hún'', "rice vermicelli")
* ''Jepun'' (日本 ''Ji̍t-pún'', "Japan")
* ''loteng'' (attic; originally 樓頂 ''lâu-téng'', "upstairs")
* ''kicap'' (sauce; originally 鮭汁 ''kê-tsiap'', "fish sauce")
* ''kongsi'' (to share; originally 公司 ''kong-si'', "company/firm/clan association")
* ''kuaci'' (瓜子 ''kua-tsí'', "edible watermelon seeds")
* ''kuetiau'' (粿條 ''kué-tiâu'', "flat rice noodle")
* ''kuih'' (粿 ''kué'', "rice-flour cake")
* ''mi'' (麵 ''mī'', noodles)
* ''sinseh'' (先生 ''sin-senn'', literally translates to "mister", commonly refers to a traditional Chinese doctor)
* ''tauhu'' (豆腐 ''taū-hū'', "tofu")
* ''tauke'' (頭家 ''thâu-kee'', "boss")
* ''teh'' (茶 ''têe'', "tea")
* ''teko'' (茶鈷 ''têe-kóo'', "teapot")
* ''Tionghua'' (中華 ''Tiong-huâ'', "China/Chinese")
* ''tukang'' (廚工 ''tû-kang'', "craftsman")

===English===

Penang Hokkien has also borrowed some words from English, some of which may have been borrowed via Malay, but these tend to be more technical and less well embedded than the Malay words, e.g. brake, park, pipe, pump, etc.

== Entertainment ==
In recent years, a number of movies that incorporate the use of Penang Hokkien have been filmed, as part of wider efforts to preserve the dialect's relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/12/29/shooting-to-begin-for-first-penang-hokkien-film/|title=Shooting to begin for first Penang Hokkien film - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|last=Loh|first=Arnold|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more recent movies are [[The Journey (2014 Malaysian film)|''The Journey'']], which became the highest-grossing Malaysian film in 2014, and [[You Mean the World to Me (film)|''You Mean the World to Me'']], the first movie to be filmed entirely in Penang Hokkien.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3236">There are a number of '''Khuzestani Persian''' [[dialect]]s and [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s unique to the province of [[Khuzestan]] in southwestern [[Iran]].

There are two main regional classifications, in addition to less common varieties:

==Northern region==
* [[Dezfuli dialect|Shushtar]]i (dialect)
* [[Dezfuli dialect|Dezfuli]] (dialect)
* [[Bakhtiari dialect|Bakhtiary]] (dialect)
* [[Luri language|Luri]] (dialect)
* [[Laki dialect|Laki]] (dialect)
* [[Gotvand]]i (dialect)

These are generally unintelligible to speakers of Modern Standard [[Persian language|Persian]] and are related to and are rooted in [[old Persian]] and [[Elamite language]]s.

==Southern region==
* [[Behbahan]]i (dialect)
* [[Ramhormoz]]i (dialect) 
* [[Hendijan]]i (dialect)
* [[Abadani Persian|Abadani]] (accent)
* [[Ahvazi Persian|Ahvazi]] (accent) [note orphaned article at [[Ajami dialect]] may be this]
* [[Mahshahr]]i (dialect)
* [[Abadani Persian|Khorramshahri]] (accent)
* Qanavati (dialect)
* Larki (dialect)
* Bahmeei (dialect)

Those regional variety of Kouzestani accents are much closer to Standard Persian than Khouzestani dialects and are easily understood by the average Persian-speaker elsewhere in Iran.

==Phonology==
Persian dialects of Khuzestan are halfway between north Iranian dialects and [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari dialects]], or midway between Modern and Classical Persian dialects.
# Word-final [æ] in Classical Persian is allophonized to [e], except [næ] ('no').
# The long vowels of Classical Persian [{{IPA|eː}}] and [{{IPA|iː}}] merged into Modern Persian [{{IPA|iː}}], and [{{IPA|oː}}] and [{{IPA|uː}}] merged into [{{IPA|uː}}].
# Arabic letter و is realized as a [[voiced labiodental fricative]] [v].
# The convergence of the Arabic pronunciations of ق ([[voiced uvular stop]] {{IPA|[ɢ]}}) and غ ([[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}}) in [[Tehrani accent|Tehrani Persian]] and other north Iranian dialects (probably influenced by [[Turkic languages]] like [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]),&lt;ref&gt;A. Pisowicz, ''Origins of the New and Middle Persian phonological systems'' (Cracow 1985), p. 112-114, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; is still kept separate in Khuzestani dialects, as is in classic Persian and as all southern Iranian dialects are, most partly because of the [[Iranian Arabs|Arab Iranian]] population of Khuzestan.
#Like Tehrani accent and also most of the accents in Central and Southern Iran, the sequence /{{IPA|ɒ}}n/ in the colloquial dialect is nearly always pronounced [un]. The only common exceptions are high prestige words, such as [ɢo{{IPA|ɾʔɒ}}n] ('[[Qur'an]]'), and [{{IPA|ʔ}}iˈ{{IPA|ɾɒ}}n] ('Iran'), and foreign nouns (both common and proper), like the Spanish surname ''Beltran'' [belˈt{{IPA|ɾɒ}}n], which are pronounced as written. A few words written as /{{IPA|ɒ}}m/ are pronounced [um]. /{{IPA|ɒ}}m/ and /{{IPA|ɒ}}n/ are pronounced as they are in formal dialect.

Note that native Khuzestani Persian speakers can interchange colloquial and formal dialects in conversational speech.

Visible minorities have become highly concentrated in Vancouver and its suburbs.&lt;ref name="neighbourhoodchange"&gt;Ghettos in Canada's cities? Racial Segregation, [[ethnic enclave]]s and poverty concentration in Canadian urban areas [http://neighbourhoodchange.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Walks-Bourne-2006-Ghettos-in-Canadas-Cities.pdf] P278&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of visible minorities in Vancouver increased from 14 percent to 37 percent of the population between 1981 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada. 2003 Canada's Ethnocultural Portrait: The Changing Mosaic (Ottawa: Statistics Canada Census Analysis Series) Cat. 96F0030XIE2001008&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver has less residential segregation of its ethnic minorities compared to older [[List of cities in Canada|Canadian cities]] such as [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto_a"&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf Residential Segregation of visible minorities in Canada's Gateway cities] P207&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city does exhibit some [[residential segregation]], as demographic data shows visible minority concentrations vary by neighbourhood in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf] P218&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[East Vancouver]] has higher visible minority concentrations than Vancouver westside.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto"&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf Residential Segregation of visible minorities in Canada's Gateway cities] P218&lt;/ref&gt; Higher visible minority concentrations are also found in nearby suburbs such as [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Burnaby]] and [[New Westminster]].&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto" /&gt; Most recent immigrants choose to locate in peripheral neighborhoods in [[Greater Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, D. 1999. "Immigration and the changing social geography of greater Vancouver" BC Studies 121, 35-82&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada's multiculturalism policies]] may have prevented greater segregation from the dominant groups, both in terms of residential location and in the labour market.&lt;ref name="proquest215637701"&gt;Residential Segregation and Socio-economic Integration of Asians in Canadian cities http://search.proquest.com/docview/215637701&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Segregation may have both voluntary and involuntary causes,&lt;ref name="proquest215637701" /&gt; so residential segregation is not necessarily due to racism. Since a large number of visible minorities in Vancouver are recent immigrants and from non-Western countries, sense of ethnic identity, languages and custom make immigrants to voluntarily choose to live in racially segregated neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="proquest215637701" /&gt; Immigrant settlement patterns in Canada are closely related to circumstances in the housing market,&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto_a" /&gt; but immigrants vary significantly in terms of their socioeconomic status and housing conditions.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto_a" /&gt; Housing affordability segregates people in different socioeconomic class,.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto_b"&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf Residential Segregation of visible minorities in Canada's Gateway cities] P208&lt;/ref&gt; Housing affordability segregates different racial groups as well since visible minorities, both Canadian-born and foreign-born, have lower earnings than the white population.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto_b" /&gt; Hence, less visible minorities concentration in affluent Vancouver neighborhoods such as Point Grey, Kitsilano or even affluent suburbs such as West Vancouver,&lt;ref&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf Residential Segregation of visible minorities in Canada's Gateway cities]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas higher visible minority concentrations found in East Vancouver and nearby suburbs such as Richmond, Surrey, Burnaby and New Westminster, where housing price is lower compaing to Vancouver Westside.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto" /&gt; Immigrants are more likely to commute on public transit than the Canadian born, and that they commute from a more geographically dispersed area, so more visible minority immigrant groups live in North, East and Central Vancouver, Surrey and New Westminster, concentrated near routes serviced by the Sky Train and Sea Bus system.&lt;ref&gt;Public Transit Use Among Immigrants [http://publications.gc.ca/Collection/Statcan/11F0019MIE/11F0019MIE2004224.pdf] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese-Canadians==
Chinese immigrants first immigrated to Vancouver during the 1850s owing to railway labour opportunities, coal mining and a gold rush.&lt;ref name="collectionscanada"&gt;A History of Ethnic Enclaves in Canada. [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/008004/f2/E-31_en.pdf] P8&lt;/ref&gt; These early Chinese immigrants formed their own [[Enclave and exclave#Subnational enclaves and exclaves|enclaves]] and Chinatowns in Vancouver and New Westminster because of the [[Sinophobia]] of the host society and their lack of knowledge of the English language.&lt;ref name="collectionscanada" /&gt; In the early years, Chinatown represented ''otherness'', and was associated with crime, unleashed sexuality, opium dens, gambling, filth, run-down housing and mysterious back-alleys.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Ethnic Enclaves in Canada. [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/008004/f2/E-31_en.pdf] P9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver Chinatown]] is undergoing a period of adjustment due to a rapid rise in property assessments and taxes, and its boundaries are becoming increasingly indistinct.&lt;ref name="Evenden"&gt;Evenden, L.J. Urban Studies(Routledge); Mar95, Vol.32 Issue 2, p427, 2p. Book Review: Vancouver's Chinatown: Racial Discourse in Canada, 1875-1980&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown's function is changing from a residential segregated racial enclave to a tourism destination and historical site.&lt;ref name="Evenden" /&gt; Unlike the early Chinese immigrants, recent Chinese immigrants belong to wealthier socio-economic classes and have better educational qualifications and occupational skills, so they have more options in choosing neighborhoods in which to settle and some of them immediately settle in wealthier areas of the city.&lt;ref name="proquest215637701" /&gt; Although Chinese immigrants concentrate more in east Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby, some live in affluent non-racial enclaves such as [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]].&lt;ref name="proquest215637701" /&gt;

==South Asians==
Research found South Asian groups are the second most segregated racial groups in Canada.&lt;ref name="neighbourhoodchange" /&gt; Many South Asians cluster in the outer suburb of Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf] P217&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to recent Chinese immigrants, recent immigrants from South Asia belong to higher socio-economic classes than earlier immigrants and may have more options in choosing neighborhoods in which to settle.&lt;ref name="proquest215637701" /&gt; In the case of South Asians, while residential segregation has not changed much in the recent decade, occupational segregation has decreased substantially, so more South Asians are able to choose to live in non-racial enclaves due to place of work and housing affordability.&lt;ref&gt;Residential Segregation and Socio-economic Integration of Asians in Canadian cities http://search.proquest.com/docview/215637701&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal people==
The Aboriginal population was less urbanised and relatively few lived in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;Residential Segregation of Visible Minorities in Canada's gateway cities [http://individual.utoronto.ca/helderman/Bauder_Sharpe_Residential_Segregation_Visible_Minorities.pdf Residential Segregation of visible minorities in Canada's Gateway cities] P209&lt;/ref&gt; There are 11 indigenous nations located within Metro Vancouver and most of these First Nation people live in First Nation Reserves.&lt;ref name="metrovancouver"&gt;A Profile of First Nations, Tribal Councils, Treaty Groups and Associations with Interests within Metro Vancouver and Member Municipalities {{cite web |url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/aboriginal/Aboriginal%20Affairs%20documents/aboriginal-profile.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042632/http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/aboriginal/Aboriginal%20Affairs%20documents/aboriginal-profile.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous nations located within Metro Vancouver are: Hwlitsum First Nation, Katzie First Nation, Kwantlen First Nation, Kwikwetlem First Nation, Matsqui First Nation, Musqueam First Nation, Qayqayt First Nation, Semiahmoo First Nation, Squamish Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation and Tsleil-Waututh Nation.&lt;ref name="metrovancouver" /&gt;

'''Resource depletion''' is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished. [[Natural resource]]s are commonly divided between [[renewable resource]]s and [[non-renewable resource]]s (see also [[mineral resource classification]]). Use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=M.|last2=Bardi|first2=U.|last3=Feng|first3=L.|last4=Pang.|first4=X.|title=Development of oil formation theories and their importance for peak oil|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=2010|volume=27|issue=9|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Resource depletion is most commonly used in reference to [[farm]]ing, [[fishing]], [[mining]], [[water]] usage, and consumption of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/103/Depletion-Conservation-Natural-Resources.html Depletion and Conservation of Natural Resources: The Economic Value of the World's Ecosystems — How Much is Nature Worth? The Role of Forests and Habitat]&lt;/ref&gt; Depletion of wildlife populations is called ''[[defaunation]]''.&lt;ref name="def ant"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Dirzo|first= Rodolfo|author2= Hillary S.

== Minerals depletion ==
{{Main article|Peak minerals}}

Minerals are needed to provide food, clothing, and housing. A [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel, non-food sector of the economy; an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone, sand, and gravel used in construction.&lt;ref&gt;''Materials Flow and Sustainability'', US Geological Survey.Fact Sheet FS-068-98, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the [[Industrial Revolution]] around 1760 in [[England]] and has grown rapidly ever since. Technological improvements have allowed humans to dig deeper and access lower grades and different types of ore over that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=J|title=Decreasing metal ore grades: are they really being driven by the depletion of high-grade deposits?|journal=J Ind Ecol|date=2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=165–168|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00334.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drielsma|first1=Johannes A|last2=Russell-Vaccari|first2=Andrea J|last3=Drnek|first3=Thomas|last4=Brady|first4=Tom|last5=Weihed|first5=Pär|last6=Mistry|first6=Mark|last7=Perez Simbor|first7=Laia|title=Mineral resources in life cycle impact assessment—defining the path forward|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess|date=2016|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–105|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Robinson|first2=Gilpin R Jr|last3=Nassar|first3=Nedal T|date=2016|title=Mineral Resources: Reserves, Peak Production and the Future|journal=resources|volume=5|issue=14|doi=10.3390/resources5010014|last1=Meinert|first1=Lawrence D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all basic industrial metals (copper, iron, bauxite, etc.), as well as [[rare earth mineral]]s, face production output limitations from time to time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Oil ==
{{Main article|Oil depletion|Peak oil}}

[[Peak oil]] is the period when the maximum rate of global [[petroleum]] [[extraction of petroleum|extraction]] is reached, after which, according to peak oil theory, the rate of production will undergo a long-term decline.  The 2005 [[Hirsch report]] concluded that the decreased supply combined with increasing demand will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products, and that most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.

The Hirsch report, funded by  [[United States Department of Energy]], concluded that “The peaking of world oil production presents the U. S. and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem. As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the economic, social, and political costs will be unprecedented. Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf DOE Hirsch Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deforestation ==
{{Main article|Deforestation}}

[[Deforestation]] is the clearing of [[forest]]s by [[cutting]] or burning of trees and plants in a forested area. As a result of deforestation, presently about one half of the forests that once covered Earth have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Deforestation". Global Change Curriculum. University of Michigan Global Change Program. January 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs for many different reasons, and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest.

=== Causes ===
One of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for [[agricultural]] reasons. As the population of developing areas, especially near [[rainforest]]s, increases, the need for land for farming becomes more and more important.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Rhett A. "Impact of Population and Poverty on Rainforests". Mongabay.com / A Place Out of Time: Tropical Rainforests and the Perils They Face. Retrieved May 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For most people, a forest has no value when its resources are not being used, so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests. For this reason, the economic value of the forests is very important for the [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = David W | year = 2001 | title = The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems | url = | journal = Ecosystem Health | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 284–296 | doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.2001.01037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
Because deforestation is so extensive, it has made several significant impacts on the environment, including [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, changing the [[water cycle]], an increase in [[soil erosion]], and a decrease in [[biodiversity]]. [[Deforestation and global warming|Deforestation is often cited as a cause of global warming]]. Because trees and plants remove carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere, the reduction of forests contribute to about 12% of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;G. R. van der Werf, D. C. Morton, R. S. DeFries, J. G. J. Olivier, P. S. Kasibhatla, R. B. Jackson, G. J. Collatz and J .T. Randerson, CO2 emissions from forest loss, ''Nature Geoscience'', Volume 2 (November 2009) pp. 737–738&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion. The removal of trees causes higher rates of erosion, increasing risks of [[landslide]]s, which is a direct threat to many people living close to deforested areas. As forests get destroyed, so does the [[habitat destruction|habitat]] for millions of animals. It is estimated that 80% of the world’s known biodiversity lives in the rainforests, and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating [[extinction]] at an alarming rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionbioscience.org/environment/nilsson.html Do We Have Enough Forests? By Sten Nilsson]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlling deforestation ===

{{Main article|Wetland}}

[[Wetland]]s are [[ecosystem]]s that are often saturated by enough [[surface water|surface]] or [[groundwater]] to sustain [[vegetation]] that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions, such as [[cattails]], [[bulrush]]es, [[red maple]]s, [[wild rice]], [[blackberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], and [[peat moss]]. Because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments they contain diverse species and provide a distinct basis for the [[food chain]].

Traditionally, wetlands were assumed to be useless so it was not a large concern when they were being dug up for settlements, agricultural use, etc. It is now believed that wetland habitats contribute to [[environmental health]] and biodiversity.

In the USA, less than half of the wetlands that still existed in the 1600s have vanished.&lt;ref name=ncsu&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NCSU|url=http://www.water.ncsu.edu/watershedss/info/wetlands/wetloss.html|title=Major Causes of Wetland Loss and Degradation|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetlands provide [[environmental services]] for:

# Food and habitat
# Improving [[water quality]]
# [[Commercial fishing]]
# [[Floodwater]] reduction
# [[Shoreline]] stabilization
# Recreation

Some loss of wetlands resulted from natural causes such as erosion, [[sedimentation]] (the buildup of soil by the settling of fine particles over a long period of time), [[subsidence]] (the sinking of land because of diminishing underground water supplies), and a rise in the sea level.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}

The '''Ruhr uprising''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Ruhraufstand}}) or '''March uprising''' (''Märzaufstand'') was a left-wing workers' revolt in the [[Ruhr]] region of [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] in March 1920. The uprising took place initially in support of the call for a [[general strike]] issued by the [[Social Democrat]] members of the [[Weimar Republic#Years of crisis .281919.E2.80.931923.29|German government]], the unions and other parties in response to the right-wing [[Kapp Putsch]] of 13 March 1920.

However, the communists and socialists in the Ruhr had previously laid plans for "winning political power by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]" in the event of a general strike. After the collapse of the Kapp Putsch, the German government sent in the [[Reichswehr]] (the German army) and rightwing [[Freikorps]], to crush the ongoing insurgency of the around 50,000 members of the "Red Ruhr Army". This was done with considerable brutality and involved numerous summary executions.

==Origins==
As the [[Treaty of Versailles]] came into force on 10 January 1920, the German government had to drastically reduce the headcount of its regular armed forces, and dissolve paramilitary units like the right-wing ''[[Freikorps]]''. Consequently, the German ''Reichswehrminister'' (defence minister) [[Gustav Noske]] ordered the dissolution of the Freikorps ''Marinebrigaden'' "[[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt|Ehrhardt]]" and "Loewenfeld".&lt;ref name="Noske"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/NoskeGustav/index.html|title=Biografie Gustav Noske (German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest ranking general of the Reichswehr, [[Walther von Lüttwitz]] refused to comply, which resulted in what became known as ''[[Kapp Putsch]]'' or ''Lüttwitz-Kapp-Putsch''.&lt;ref name="Noske"/&gt; On 13 March 1920, the right-wing ''Marinebrigade Ehrhardt'' led by von Lüttwitz marched into Berlin, occupied the government buildings and installed [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as new chancellor, calling for a return of the monarchy. To restore order, Noske then asked [[Hans von Seeckt]], who at the time was the head of the ''[[Truppenamt|Truppenamt im Reichswehrministerium]]'', to order the regular army, the "Transitional [[Reichswehr]]", to put down the putsch. Von Seeckt and the other senior commanders with the exception of General [[Walther Reinhardt]] refused and the government was forced to flee from Berlin. Since the ministerial bureaucracy did not cooperate with the Kapp government, however, it could not govern effectively. On the very day of the putsch, the Social Democratic members of the government and [[Otto Wels]], head of the SPD, signed a call for a [[general strike]] to topple the putschists. It was supported by the ''[[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]]'' (ADGB) led by [[Carl Legien]], the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Angestellte'' (ADA) and the ''Deutsche Beamtenbund''.&lt;ref name="Strike"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/innenpolitik/generalstreik/index.html|title=Der Generalstreik 1920 (German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, the KPD, USPD and the [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] also called for a strike. Although protests by conservative groups including the Reichswehr soon caused the ''Reichsregierung'' to distance itself from this call to strike, the general strike of around 12 million workers helped bring about the putsch's collapse on 17 March 1920.&lt;ref name="Putsch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/gewalt/kapp/index.html|title=Der Militärputsch 1920 (Lüttwitz-Kapp-Putsch)(German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike and uprising in the Ruhr region==
[[Image:Ruhraufstand 1920 002.jpg|thumb|300px|Map showing the path taken by the "Red Ruhr Army", 17–23 March 1920.]]
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2013}}
The first demonstrations against the putsch were in the Ruhr region on 13 March 1920. For example, in [[Bochum]], 20,000 people turned out. Whilst the [[Kapp Putsch]] was in progress in Berlin, on 14 March 1920, in [[Elberfeld]] a meeting of representatives of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD), the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was held. The left-wing workers' parties decided on a spontaneous alliance against the putschists. The SPD, USPD and KPD drafted a joint appeal to "winning political power by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]".

As a consequence of this appeal and in the context of the general strike, some workers' organisations attempted to seize state power on a regional scale. Across the Ruhr area, spontaneously formed local "Executive Councils" took over political power. These were mostly dominated by the USPD, with the KPD also participating. The anarcho-syndicalist [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]] (FAUD) was also represented. Worker-soldiers were deployed, who controlled the cities.

The [[Red Ruhr Army]], whose strength was estimated at approximately 50,000 members judging by the number of rifles that were later confiscated, managed to prevail over the government forces in the area in a very short time.

On 17 March 1920, units of the Red Ruhr Army near [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]] attacked an advance party of the ''[[Freikorps Lichtschlag]]'' under Hauptmann Hasenclever, who upon being asked had identified himself as a supporter of the new Kapp government. They took the enemy force's weapons, captured 600 Freikorps members and occupied [[Dortmund]].&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt; On 20 March 1920 in Essen, a Central Committee (''Zentralrat'') of the [[Workers' council]]s was formed, the latter being in the process of taking power in parts of the Ruhr.&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt; Another central organ was in Hagen. The uprising possessed no common leadership nor a common political program, although turning ownership of important industries over to the workers was an important issue.&lt;ref name="March"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/innenpolitik/maerzaufstand/index.html|title=Der Märzaufstand 1920(German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the defeat of the Kapp Putsch==

{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2013}}
The general strike was officially declared as having ended on 22 March by the unions, the USPD and the KDP after additional concessions by the government of chancellor [[Gustav Bauer]]. These included the dismissal of ''Reichswehrminister'' Noske as well as changes to social and economic policies. General Reinhardt also resigned. [[Otto Gessler]] succeeded Noske, von Seeckt became ''Chef der Heeresleitung''. The demands by the USPD that a socialist workers' government be installed to prevent a move of Germany to the right were rejected.&lt;ref name="Strike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt;

The legitimate government, newly returned to Berlin, issued an ultimatum on 24 March, demanding that the workers' councils put an end to the strike and the uprising by 30 March (later extended to 2 April); the councils did not comply with this. On 25 March, the government of Gustav Bauer resigned and on 26 March ''Reichspräsident'' [[Friedrich Ebert]] appointed [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] as the new chancellor.&lt;ref name="C1920"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/1920/index.html|title=Chronologie 1920(German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The attempt to settle the conflict at the negotiating table in the [[Bielefeld Agreement]] failed ultimately due to the unauthorized actions of the regional military commander, [[Oskar von Watter]].

The consequence was the renewed proclamation of a general strike. More than 300,000 miners (about 75% of the work force in mining) joined this. The communist uprising brought [[Düsseldorf]] and Elberfeld into the hands of the communists. Until the end of March the whole Ruhr area was taken.

Those involved in the uprising, who were often world war veterans, even received wages from the workers' councils. They often operated in small groups, transporting themselves by bicycle. The ''[[Wesel citadel|Zitadelle Wesel]]'' was attacked on 24 March, but here the Ruhr Army experienced its first defeat.

The structure of the Ruhr Army was, like the political demands and positions of the different workers' councils, very heterogeneous and subject to frequent changes. In general, one can make out a strong difference between East and West. The USPD-dominated eastern Ruhr area organised and armed itself earlier, but did not support a continuation of armed action against the newly restored federal government. On the other hand, the mobilization was slower in the trade union-dominated western Ruhr area, but later the continuation of the uprising found greater support here.

On 2 April 1920, Reichswehr units marched into the Ruhr area to suppress the uprising.&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt; This force also contained units that had supported the putsch only days previously, such as the ''Marinebrigade von Loewenfeld'' and even the ''Marinebrigade Ehrhardt''.&lt;ref name="Putsch"/&gt;

==Bloody suppression==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-029-31, Bürgerkrieg, Möllen.jpg|thumb|200px|Members of the Reichswehr and shot members of the Red Ruhr Army, 2 April 1920, [[Möllen (Voerde)|Möllen]] near Duisburg]]
With the support of the federal government, the uprising was suppressed by General Watter, approaching from the north. Based in [[Münster]], his staff led the civil war in the Ruhr area. Units of the Reichswehr and ''Freikorps'' successfully suppressed the Red Ruhr Army. The fighting was followed by death sentences and mass executions. Those who were found carrying weapons at the time of their arrest were shot—including the wounded. On 3 April 1920, Reichspräsident Ebert forbade these summary executions. On 12 April 1920, General von Watter forbade his soldiers from engaging in "unlawful behaviour". The actions of both sides in the fighting have been described as showing "a maximum of cruelty".&lt;ref name="March"/&gt;

On 5 April, a large part of the Ruhr Army fled before the Reichswehr to the region [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|occupied]] by the [[French Army]]. In response to the Reichswehr presence in the Ruhr, which contravened the Treaty of Versailles, the French occupied towns like [[Frankfurt]], [[Hanau]] and [[Darmstadt]] on 6 April.&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt;

The Reichswehr stopped itself only at the river Ruhr, as the British occupation forces were threatening to occupy the [[Bergisches Land]] due to the breach of the Versailles Treaty. By 8 April, the Reichswehr controlled all of the northern Ruhr area.&lt;ref name="C1920"/&gt;

By the end of the fighting, the participants in the uprising had lost in excess of 1,000 lives, the Reichswehr 208 dead and 123 missing,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, HA (2006) Germany: The Long Road West Vol 2 OUP, Oxford 371&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Freikorps'' about 273 lives.

[[File:Siddi_Girl.jpg|thumb|A Siddi girl from the town of [[Yellapur]] in [[Uttara Karnataka]] district, Karnataka, India.]]
There are conflicting hypotheses on the origin of the name ''Siddi''. One theory is that the word derives from ''sahibi,'' an Arabic term of respect in North Africa, similar to the word ''sahib'' in modern India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Albinia2012" /&gt; A second theory is that the term ''Siddi'' is derived from the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to India. These captains were known as ''Sayyid''.&lt;ref name="Prashad"&gt;{{Citation | title=Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting: Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity | author=Vijay Prashad | year=2002 | publisher=Beacon Press | isbn=0-8070-5011-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiO6zUS9gigC | quote=''...since the captains of the African and Arab vessels bore the title Sidi (from Sayyid, or the lineage of the prophet Muhammad), the African settlers on the Indian mainland came to be called Siddis...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, another term for Siddis, ''habshi'', is held to be derived from the common name for the captains of the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinian]] ships that also first delivered Siddi slaves to the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Prashad" /&gt; Siddis are also sometimes referred to as Afro-Indians.&lt;ref name="mazrui1986"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Africans: a reader | author=Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, Toby Kleban Levine | year=1986 | publisher=Praeger | isbn=0-03-006209-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpQEAQAAIAAJ | quote=''...continue to exist in three main communities.

The first Siddis are thought to have arrived in [[India]] in 628 AD at the [[Bharuch]] port.

Some Siddis escaped slavery to establish communities in forested areas, and some also established the small Siddi principalities of [[Janjira State]] on Janjira Island and [[Jafarabad State]] in [[Kathiawar]] as early as the twelfth century. A former alternative name of [[Janjira State|Janjira]] was Habshan (i.e., land of the Habshis). In the [[Delhi Sultanate]] period prior to the rise of the Mughals in India, [[Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut]] was a prominent Siddi slave-turned-nobleman who was a close confidant of [[Razia Sultana]] (1205–1240 CE).

Harris (1971) provides an historical survey of the eastward dispersal of slaves from Southeast Africa to places like India.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J. E. (1971). ''The African Presence in Asia: Consequences of the East African Slave Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton (1990) argues that Siddis in South India are a significant social group whose histories, experiences, cultures, and expressions are integral to the [[African Diaspora]] and thus, help better understand the dynamics of dispersed peoples. More recent focused scholarship argues that although Siddis are numerically a minority, their historic presence in India for over five hundred years, as well as their self-perception, and how the broader Indian society relates to them, make them a distinct Bantu/Indian.&lt;ref&gt;Obeng, P.

===Siddis of Hyderabad===
In the 18th century, a '''Siddi''' community was established in [[Hyderabad State]] by the [[Arabs|Arab]] Siddi diaspora, who have frequently served as [[cavalry]] guards to the Asif Jahi [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]'s army. The '''[[Nizam of Hyderabad|Asif Jahi rulers]]''' patronised them with rewards and the traditional [[marfa (music)|Marfa music]] gained popularity and would be performed during official celebrations and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="TheHindu1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/article2216021.ece# |title=‘Marfa' band of the Siddis 'losing' its beat |work=The Hindu |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2011 |location=Hyderabad, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="An_African_Indian_community_in_Hyderabad"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Yimene|first=Ababu Minda|title=An African Indian Community in Hyderabad: Siddi Identity, Its Maintenance and Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DigPvwHTqJ4C&amp;pg=PA210|year=2004|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3-86537-206-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The African dispersal in the Deccan"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ali|first=Shanti Sadiq|authorlink=Shanti Sadiq Ali|title=The African Dispersal in the Deccan: From Medieval to Modern Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3CPc22nMqIC|year=1996|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Siddis of Hyderabad have traditionally resided in the [[A.C. Guards]] (African Cavalry Guards) area near Masjid Rahmania, known locally as Siddi Risala in the city [[Hyderabad]].

On the way to Deva-dungar is the quaint village of Sirvan, inhabited entirely by Siddis. They were brought 300 years ago from Portuguese colonial territories for the Nawab of Junagadh. Today, they follow very few of their original customs, with a few exceptions like the traditional Dhamal dance.&lt;ref&gt;Shekhawat, Rahul Singh (n.d.), [https://www.academia.edu/4206146/BLACK_SUFI_PAPER "Black Sufis: Preserving the Siddi's and its age old culture in India"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Gujarati Siddis have adopted the language and many customs of their surrounding populations, some of their Bantu traditions have been preserved. These include the ''Goma'' music and dance form, which is sometimes called ''Dhamaal'' (Gujarati: ધમાલ, fun).&lt;ref name="jias1993w"&gt;{{Citation | title=Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society | year=1993 | publisher=Indian Anthropological Society | volume=28 | issue=3 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUGBAAAAMAAJ | quote=''The word goma is derived from the Swahili word for dance, ngoma, which in the East African ...

''Goma'' music comes from the [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] word "ngoma", which means a drum or drums. It also denotes any dancing occasion where traditional drums are principally used.

=== Siddis of Karnataka ===
{{main article|Siddis of Karnataka}}
The [[Siddis of Karnataka]] (also spelled ''Siddhis'') are an ethnic group of mainly Bantu descent that has made [[Karnataka]] their home for the last 400 years.&lt;ref name="Shah"/&gt; There is a 50,000-strong Siddhi population across India, of which more than a third live in [[Karnataka]]. In Karnataka, they are concentrated around [[Yellapur, Karnataka|Yellapur]], [[Haliyal]], [[Ankola]], [[Joida]], [[Mundgod]] and [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]] taluks of [[Uttara Kannada]] and in [[Khanapur]] of [[Belgaum]] and [[Kalaghatagi]] of [[Dharwad district]]. Many members of the Siddis community of Karnataka had migrated to [[Pakistan]] after independence and have settled in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]]. It has been reported that these Siddis believe that [[Barack Obama]] shares their genepool and that they wanted to gift a bottle of honey to him on his visit to India in 2010.&lt;ref name="http://www.openthemagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.openthemagazine.com/shorts/smallworld/2010-10-30#1 Anil Budur Lulla, ''A Bottle of Honey for Our Brother Prez''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031195611/http://www.openthemagazine.com/shorts/smallworld/2010-10-30 |date=31 October 2010 }}, Short Takes section, ''Open Magazine'', 30 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sindh]], the Sheedis have traditionally intermarried only with people such as the Mallahs (fisherpeople), Khaskheli (laborers), Khatri (dyeing community) and Kori (clothmakers).

Famous Sheedis include the historic Sindhi army leader [[Hoshu Sheedi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2007/03/21/local34.htm "‘Hoshu Sheedi Day’ on March 23"], ''Dawn'', 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Urdu poetry|Urdu poet]] [[Noon Meem Danish]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080105020227/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/071209/books6.htm "A poet in New York"], ''Dawn'', 9 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=45 Afro-Asia in Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113160800/http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=45 |date=13 January 2009 }} Hasan Mujtaba, Samar Magazine, Issue 13: Winter/Spring, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheedis are also well known for their excellence in sports, especially in [[Association football|football]] and [[boxing]].

[[File:Sawan Qambrani.jpg|thumb|Sawan Qambrani, resident of village [[Syed Matto Shah]], Tehsil Bulri Shah Karim, District Tando Muhammad Khan, Sindh]]
Sheedis are largely populated in different towns and villages in lower [[Sindh]]. They are very active in cultural activities and organise annual festivals, like, Habash Festival, with the support of several community organisations. In the local culture, when there is a dance it is not performed by some selected few and watched idly by others but it is participated by all the people present there, ending difference between the performers and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/77851|title=Sheedi basha hum basha: black people dance away sorrows|work=Dawn|date=24 October 2009|accessdate=16 October 2012|first=M.

==Genetics==
Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Siddi. [[Genetic genealogy]], although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Siddi.

===Y DNA===
A [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] study by Shah et al. (2011) tested Siddi individuals in India for paternal lineages. The authors observed the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E1b1a]] haplogroup (now called haplogroup E-V38), which is frequent among [[Bantu peoples]], in about 42% and 34% of Siddis from [[Karnataka]] and [[Gujarat]], respectively. Around 14% of Siddis from Karnataka and 35% of Siddis from Gujarat also belonged to the Sub-Saharan [[Haplogroup B-M60|B-M60]]. The remaining Siddis had Indian associated or Near Eastern-linked clades, including haplogroups [[Haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|P]], [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a-M17]], [[Haplogroup J2|J2]] and [[Haplogroup L-M20|L-M20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indian Siddis: African Descendants with Indian Admixture| pmc=3135801 | pmid=21741027 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.030| volume=89| year=2011| journal=Am.

===mtDNA===
According to an [[mtDNA]] study by Shah et al. (2011), the maternal ancestry of the Siddi consists of a mixture of Bantu-associated haplogroups and Indian-associated haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighbouring Indian populations. About 53% of the Siddis from Gujarat and 24% of the Siddis from Karnataka belonged to various Bantu-derived [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macro-haplogroup L]] subclades. The latter mainly consisted of [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]] and [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2a]] sublineages associated with Bantu women. The remainder possessed Indian-specific subclades of the Eurasian haplogroups [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]] and [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]], which points to recent admixture with autochthonous Indian groups.&lt;ref name="Shah"/&gt;

===Autosomal DNA===
Narang et al. (2011) examined the [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[DNA]] of Siddis in India. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis' ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples. The remainder is associated with local [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking North and Northwest Indian populations, due to recent admixture events.&lt;ref name="Narang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narang|first=Ankita|title=Recent Admixture in an Indian Population of African Ancestry|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=15 July 2011|volume=89|issue=1|pages=111–120|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.06.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929711002576|accessdate=18 December 2012|display-authors=etal|pmid=21737057|pmc=3135806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Shah et al. (2011) observed that Siddis in Gujarat derive 66.90%–70.50% of their ancestry from Bantu forebears, while the Siddis in Karnataka possess 64.80%–74.40% such Southeast African ancestry. The remaining autosomal DNA components in the studied Siddi were mainly associated with local South Asian populations. According to the authors, gene flow between the Siddis' Bantu ancestors and local Indian populations was also largely unidirectional. They estimate this admixture episode's time of occurrence at within the past 200 years or eight generations.&lt;ref name="Shah"/&gt;

However, Guha et al. (2012) observed few genetic differences between the Makrani of Pakistan and adjacent populations. According to the authors, the genome-wide ancestry of the Makrani was essentially the same as that of the neighboring Indo-European speaking [[Baloch people|Balochi]] and Dravidian-speaking [[Brahui people|Brahui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guha|first=Saurav|title=Implications for health and disease in the genetic signature of the Ashkenazi Jewish population|journal=Genome Biology|date=25 January 2012|volume=13|issue=R2|doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r2|url=http://genomebiology.com/content/13/1/R2|accessdate=5 January 2014|pmid=22277159|pmc=3334583|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[social science]]s, a '''social group''' can be defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity. Other theorists disagree however, and are wary of definitions which stress the importance of [[interdependence]] or objective similarity.&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | editor1-last = Tajfel | editor1-first = H. | year = 1982 | title = Towards a cognitive redefinition of the social group | journal = Social identity and intergroup relations | pages = 15–40 | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platow et al. (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platow | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Grace | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Smithson | first3 = M. J. | year = 2011 | title = Examining the Preconditions for Psychological Group Membership: Perceived Social Interdependence as the Outcome of Self-Categorization | journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science | volume = 3 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, researchers within the [[social identity approach|social identity tradition]] generally define it as "a group is defined in terms of those who identify themselves as members of the group".&lt;ref name="Reicher, S.D. (1982)"&gt;Reicher, S.D. (1982). The determination of collective behaviour (pp. 41-83). In H. Tajfel (ed.), Social identity and intergroup relations. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, social groups come in a myriad of sizes and varieties. For example, a [[society]] can be viewed as a large social group.

== Definition ==

=== Social cohesion approach ===
A social group exhibits some degree of [[social cohesion]] and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals, such as people waiting at a bus stop, or people waiting in a line. Characteristics shared by members of a group may include [[Interest (emotion)|interests]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[Social representation|representations]], ethnic or social background, and [[kinship]] ties. Kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry, marriage, or adoption.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt; In a similar vein, some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as [[social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, A. P. (1962). ''Handbook of small group research''. New York: [[Macmillan Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dunbar's number]], on [[average]], people cannot maintain stable social relationships with more than 150 individuals.{{sfn |Gladwell |2002 |pp=177−181}}

Social psychologist [[Muzafer Sherif]] proposed to define a [[social unit]] as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to:
# Common motives and goals
# An accepted [[Division of labour|division of labor]], i.e. roles
# Established status ([[social rank]], dominance) relationships
# Accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group
# Development of accepted [[wikt:sanction|sanctions]] (praise and punishment) if and when norms were respected or violated&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, Muzafer and Sherif, Carolyn W., ''An Outline of Social Psychology'' rev.ed. [[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]]: New York pp. 143–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition is long and complex, but it is also precise. It succeeds at providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions:

# "How is a group formed?"
# "How does a group function?"
# "How does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group?"

==== Significance of that definition ====
The attention of those who use, participate in, or study groups has focused on functioning groups, on larger organizations, or on the decisions made in these [[organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' 3rd ed. [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] 1976 p.123-153&lt;/ref&gt; Much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by Sherif.

Some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street [[gang]]s in the 1920s and 1930s, continuing through the 1950s, which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''op. cit.'' p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory, and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang. There remains in the popular media and urban law enforcement agencies an avid interest in gangs, reflected in daily headlines which emphasize the criminal aspects of gang behavior. However, these studies and the continued interest have not improved the capacity to influence gang behavior or to reduce gang related violence.

The relevant literature on [[Ethology|animal social behaviors]], such as work on territory and dominance, has been available since the 1950s. Also, they have been largely neglected by policy makers, sociologists and anthropologists. Indeed, vast literature on organization, property, law enforcement, ownership, religion, warfare, values, conflict resolution, authority, rights, and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals. This disconnect may be the result of the belief that social behavior in humankind is radically different from the social behavior in animals because of the human capacity for language use and rationality. Of course, while this is true, it is equally likely that the study of the social (group) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people.

Territorial and dominance behaviors in humans are so universal and commonplace that they are simply taken for granted (though sometimes admired, as in home ownership, or deplored, as in violence). But these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups: ''they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of [[social identity]], [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]], body concept, or [[Self-concept|self concept]]. An adequately functioning individual identity is necessary before an individual can function in a division of labor (role), and hence, within a cohesive group. Coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development, functioning, and productivity of groups.

=== Social identification approach ===
Explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the [[Social identity approach|social identity perspective]], which draws on insights made in [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33–47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; Here, rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals, the social identity model assumes that "psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis".&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt; It posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is "awareness of a common category membership" and that a social group can be "usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept".&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt; Stated otherwise, while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask "who am I attracted to?", the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask "who am I?"

Empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the [[minimal group paradigm]]. For example, it has been shown that the mere act of allocating individuals to explicitly random categories is sufficient to lead individuals to act in an [[ingroup]] [[Ingroup bias|favouring]] fashion (even where no individual self-interest is possible).&lt;ref&gt;Tajfel, H., Billig, M., Bundy, R. P. &amp; Flament, C. (1971). Social categorization and intergroup behaviour. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 2'', 149-178,&lt;/ref&gt; Also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members.&lt;ref name="Platow et al. (2011)"/&gt;

While the roots of this approach to social groups had its foundations in social identity theory, more concerted exploration of these ideas occurred later in the form of [[self-categorization theory]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 = K. H. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = R. | editor2-last = Gaertner | editor2-first = S. L. | year = 2001 | title = The Social Identity Perspective in Intergroup Relations: Theories, Themes, and Controversies | journal = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas social identity theory was directed initially at the explanation of intergroup conflict in the absence of any conflict of interests, self-categorization theory was developed to explain how individuals come to perceive themselves as members of a group in the first place, and how this self-grouping process underlies and determines all problems subsequent aspects of group behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J.C. (1987) Rediscovering the Social Group: A Self-Categorization Theory. Oxford: Blackwell. pp. 42-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining characteristics ===
In his text, ''Group Dynamics,'' Forsyth (2010) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1) Interaction ====
This group component varies greatly, including verbal or non-verbal communication, social loafing, networking, forming bonds, etc. Research by Bales (cite, 1950, 1999) determine that there are two main types of interactions; relationship interactions and task interactions.
# Relationship interactions: “actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group, including both positive actions (social support, consideration) and negative actions (criticism, conflict).”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Task interactions: “actions performed by group members that pertain to the group’s projects, tasks, and goals.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involve members organizing themselves and utilizing their skills and resources to achieve something.

==== 2) Goals ====
Most groups have a reason for their existence, be it increasing the education and knowledge, receiving emotional support, or experiencing spirituality or religion. Groups can facilitate the achievement of these goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[The Circumplex Model of Group Tasks|'''circumplex model of group tasks''']]''',''' by Joseph McGrath&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = McGrath
| first = Joseph, E.

| isbn = 
| location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ
| pages = 61–62
}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizes group related tasks and goals. Groups may focus on several of these goals, or one area at a time. The model divides group goals into four main types, which are further sub-categorized
# Generating: coming up with ideas and plans to reach goals 
#* Planning Tasks
#* Creativity Tasks
# Choosing: Selecting a solution.
#* Intellective Tasks
#* Decision-making Tasks
# Negotiating: Arranging a solution to a problem.
#* Cognitive Conflict Tasks
#* Mixed Motive Task
# Executing: Act of carrying out a task.
#* Contests/Battles/Competitive Tasks
#* Performance/Psychomotor Tasks

==== 3) Interdependence in relation ====
“The state of being dependent, to some degree, on other people, as when one’s outcomes, actions, thoughts, feelings, and experiences are determined in whole or part by others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some groups are more interdependent than others. For example, a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater. Also, interdependence may be mutual (flowing back and forth between members) or more linear/unilateral. For example, some group members may be more dependent on their boss than the boss is on each of the individuals.

==== 4) Structure ====
Group structure involves the emergence or regularities, norms, roles and relations that form within a group over time. Roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group. Norms are the ideas adopted by the group pertaining to acceptable and unacceptable conduct by members. Group structure is a very important part of a group. If people fail to meet their expectations within to groups, and fulfil their roles, they may not accept the group, or be accepted by other group members.

==== 5) Unity ====
When viewed holistically, a group is greater than the sum of its individual parts. When people speak of groups, they speak of the group as a whole, or an entity, rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals. For example, it would be said that “The ''band'' played beautifully.” Several factors play a part in this image of unity, including group cohesiveness, and entitativity (appearance of cohesion by outsiders).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
According to [[Charles Horton Cooley]] (1864–1929), a [[Primary and secondary groups|primary group]] is a small social group whose members share personal and lasting relationships. People joined in primary relationships spend a great deal of time together, engage in a wide range of activities, and feel that they know one another well. In short, they show real concern for one another. In every society, the family is the most important primary group. Groups based on lasting friendships are also primary groups.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Macionis, Gerber|author2=John, Linda|year=2010|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}

[[Primary and secondary groups|Secondary groups]], in contrast to primary groups, are large groups involving [[formality|formal]] and [[institution]]al relationships. Secondary relationships involve weak emotional ties and little personal knowledge of one another. Most secondary groups are short term, beginning and ending without particular significance.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|149}} They may last for years or may disband after a short time. The formation of primary groups happens within secondary groups.

Primary groups can be present in secondary settings. For example, attending a university exemplifies membership of a secondary group, while the friendships that are made there would be considered a primary group that you belong to. Likewise, some businesses care deeply about the well being of one another, while some immediate families have hostile relations within it.

Individuals almost universally have a bond toward what sociologists call [[reference group]]s. A reference group is a social group that serves as a point of reference in making evaluations and decisions.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|152}}

Some examples of types of groups include the following:

:; [[Couple (relationship)|Couple]], [[Dyad (sociology)|Dyad]], [[Triad (sociology)|Triad]]
:: Smallest group with defined number of people often associated with family building; social interaction in a dyad is typically more intense than in larger groups because neither member shares the other's attention with anyone else;&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|153}} a triad is more stable than a dyad because one member can act as a mediator should the relationship between the other two become strained&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|154}}
:; [[Family]], [[Household]]
:: Small group of people who live in the same [[home]]. Family may or may not form [[clan]], fellowship, bigger [[kinship]] groups, a basic unit of community. [[Anglophone]] (and other) culture may include various models of household, including the [[family]], [[blended families]], [[share housing]], and [[group home]]s.
:; [[Crew]] or Band
:: Small group of skilled people with common interest; a rowing crew; a [[music band]]; [[construction crew]]; subunit of a [[tribe]] as [[band society]]
:; [[Peer group]]
:: A peer group is a group with members of approximately the same age, social status, and interests. Generally, people are relatively equal in terms of power when they interact with peers.
:; [[Clique]]
:: A group of people that have many of the same interests &amp; commonly found in a High School/College setting; most of the time they have a name &amp; rules for themselves.
:; [[Club (organization)|Club]]

:; [[Gang]]
:: A gang is usually an urban group that gathers in a particular area. It is a group of people that often hang around each other. They can be like some clubs, but much less formal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Webster's Online Dictionary|title=Webster's Online Dictionary - with Multilingual Thesaurus Translation|accessdate=24 February 2012|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/|archivedate=23 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually known in many countries to cause [[social unrest]] and also have negative influence on the members and may be a target for the law enforcers in case of any social vices

:; [[Ingroups and outgroups|In-group]]
:: It is a social group toward which a member feels respect and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|153}}
:: It is a group that an [[individual]] identifies in positive direction.  If a person is part of the in-group then they are collectively part of an inner circle of friends.  An inner circle may contain sub-groups within the inner circle including the apex (best friends), core (very close friends), outer rim, etc.  This group provides a support structure and being exclusive offers protection from anyone in an Out-group (see below.)
:; [[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]]
:: It is a social group toward which a person feels a sense of competition or opposition.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010"/&gt;{{rp|153}}
:: It is a group that an [[individual]] identifies in negative direction.

Groups can also be categorized according to the number of people present within the group. This makes sense if the size of the group has consequences for the way group members relate with each other. In a small group, for example, "each member receives some impression ... of each other member distinct enough so that he or she ... can give some reaction to each of the others as an individual person."&lt;ref&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). Interaction Process Analysis: A Method for the Study of Small Groups. MA: Addison-Wesley. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This personal interaction is not possible in larger groups.

== Health ==
The social groups people are involved with in the workplace directly affect their health. No matter where you work or what the occupation is, feeling a sense of belonging in a peer group is a key to overall success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-health-social-relationships.html|title=Health determined by social relationships at work|website=phys.org|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104001528/http://phys.org/news/2016-10-health-social-relationships.html|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this is the responsibility of the leader (manager, supervisor, etc.). If the leader helps everyone feel a sense of belonging within the group, it can help boost morale and productivity. According to Dr. Niklas Steffens "Social identification contributes to both psychological and physiological health, but the health benefits are stronger for psychological health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace leaders improve employee wellbeing|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-12-workplace-leaders-employee-wellbeing.html|website=phys.org|publisher=University Of Queensland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104000716/http://phys.org/news/2014-12-workplace-leaders-employee-wellbeing.html|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social relationships people have can be linked to different health conditions. Lower quantity or quality social relationships have been connected to issues such as: development of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Myocardial infarction|recurrent myocardial infarction]], [[atherosclerosis]], autonomic dysregulation, [[high blood pressure]], [[cancer]] and delayed cancer recovery, and slower wound healing as well as inflammatory biomarkers and impaired immune function, factors associated with adverse health outcomes and mortality. The social relationship of marriage is the most studied of all, the marital history over the course of one's life can form differing health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, chronic conditions, mobility limitations, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness also plays a large part in overcoming mental afflictions such as drug, alcohol, or substance abuse. With these types of issues, a person's peer group play a big role in helping them stay sober. Conditions do not need to be life-threatening, one's social group can help deal with work anxiety as well. When people are more socially connected have access to more support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umberson|first1=Debra|last2=Karas Montez|first2=Jennifer|title=Social Relationships and Health: A Flashpoint for Health Policy|pmc=3150158|website=National Center for Biotechnology Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the health issues people have may also stem from their uncertainty about just where they stand among their colleagues. It has been shown that being well socially connected has a significant impact on a person as they age, according to a 10-year study by the MacArthur Foundation, which was published in the book 'Successful Aging'&lt;ref name="Doigeront"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/37.4.433 |title=Successful Aging |year=1997 |last1=Rowe |first1=J.

Older people who were more active in social circles tended to be better off health-wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staackmann|first1=Mary|title=Social Connections are a Key to Aging Well|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/community/chi-ugc-article-social-connections-are-a-key-to-aging-well-2016-11-08-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=The Evanston Review|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130111506/http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/community/chi-ugc-article-social-connections-are-a-key-to-aging-well-2016-11-08-story.html|archivedate=2016-11-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial stages of expansion, the groups usually do not accept every applicant. One of the ways to build a reasonably closed group is to accept new members after one or more existing members propose and recommend them. Such group expands along the lines of other existing social networks. Other approach is to use existing members to evaluate the applicant, like in [[Microsoft interview]]. Member evaluation can also be delegated to some team that is not part of the group itself (like in [[high IQ societies]]). Some groups may choose to easily accept a lot of people but only leave the most efficient new members after [[Academic probation|probation]] (discarding others).

== Development ==
If one brings a small collection of strangers together in a restricted space and environment, provides a common goal and maybe a few ground rules, then a highly probable course of events will follow. Interaction between individuals is the basic requirement. At first, individuals will differentially interact in sets of twos or threes while seeking to interact with those with whom they share something in common: i.e., interests, skills, and cultural background. Relationships will develop some stability in these small sets, in that individuals may temporarily change from one set to another, but will return to the same pairs or trios rather consistently and resist change. Particular twosomes and threesomes will stake out their special spots within the overall space.

Again depending on the common goal, eventually twosomes and threesomes will integrate into larger sets of six or eight, with corresponding revisions of territory, dominance-ranking, and further differentiation of roles. All of this seldom takes place without some conflict or disagreement: for example, fighting over the distribution of resources, the choices of means and different subgoals, the development of what are appropriate norms, rewards and punishments. Some of these conflicts will be territorial in nature: i.e., jealousy over roles, or locations, or favored relationships. But most will be involved with struggles for status, ranging from mild protests to serious verbal conflicts and even dangerous violence.

By analogy to animal behavior, sociologists may term these behaviors ''territorial behaviors'' and ''dominance behaviors''. Depending on the pressure of the common goal and on the various skills of individuals, differentiations of leadership, dominance, or authority will develop. Once these relationships solidify, with their defined roles, norms, and sanctions, a productive group will have been established.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''op. cit.'' pp. 181–279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, John Paul. ''Animal Behavior'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1959, 281pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halloway, Ralph L., ''Primate Aggression, Territoriality, and Xenophobia'', Academic Press: New York, and London 1974. 496 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aggression]] is the mark of unsettled dominance order. Productive group cooperation requires that both dominance order and territorial arrangements (identity, self-concept) be settled with respect to the common goal and within the particular group. Some individuals may withdraw from interaction or be excluded from the developing group. Depending on the number of individuals in the original collection of strangers, and the number of "hangers-on" that are tolerated, one or more competing groups of ten or less may form, and the competition for territory and dominance will then also be manifested in the inter group transactions.

== Dispersal and transformation ==
Two or more people in interacting situations will over time develop stable territorial relationships. As described above, these may or may not develop into groups. But stable groups can also break up in to several sets of territorial relationships. There are numerous reasons for stable groups to "malfunction" or to disperse, but essentially this is because of loss of compliance with one or more elements of the definition of group provided by Sherif&lt;!-- seems like lost reference --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The two most common causes of a malfunctioning group are the addition of too many individuals, and the failure of the leader to enforce a common purpose, though malfunctions may occur due to a failure of any of the other elements (i.e., confusions status or of norms).

In a society, there is a need for more people to participate in cooperative endeavors than can be accommodated by a few separate groups.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The military has been the best example as to how this is done in its hierarchical array of squads, platoons, companies, battalions, regiments, and divisions. Private companies, corporations, government agencies, clubs, and so on have all developed comparable (if less formal and standardized) systems when the number of members or employees exceeds the number that can be accommodated in an effective group. Not all larger [[social structure]]s require the cohesion that may be found in the small group. Consider the neighborhood, the [[country club]], or the [[megachurch]], which are basically territorial organizations who support large social purposes. Any such large organizations may need only islands of cohesive leadership.

For a functioning group to attempt to add new members in a casual way is a certain prescription for failure, loss of efficiency, or disorganization. The number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten, and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on. The key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct, functioning identity in the minds of each of the members. The cognitive limit to this [[short-term memory|span of attention]] in individuals is often set at seven. Rapid shifting of attention can push the limit to about ten. After ten, subgroups will inevitably start to form with the attendant loss of purpose, dominance-order, and individuality, with confusion of roles and rules. The standard classroom with twenty to forty pupils and one teacher offers a rueful example of one supposed [[leader]] juggling a number of subgroups.

Weakening of the common purpose once a group is well established can be attributed to: adding new members; unsettled conflicts of identities (i.e., territorial problems in individuals); weakening of a settled dominance-order; and weakening or failure of the leader to tend to the group. The actual loss of a leader is frequently fatal to a group, unless there was lengthy preparation for the transition. The loss of the leader tends to dissolve all dominance relationships, as well as weakening dedication to common purpose, differentiation of roles, and maintenance of norms. The most common symptoms of a troubled group are loss of efficiency, diminished participation, or weakening of purpose, as well as an increase in verbal aggression. Often, if a strong common purpose is still present, a simple reorganization with a new leader and a few new members will be sufficient to re-establish the group, which is somewhat easier than forming an entirely new group. This is the most common factor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">The '''Tiddim''', or '''Tedim''', are an ethnic group of [[Myanmar]].  They generally inhabited Northern Chin State and are one of the three major tribes of Chin State.  They speak the [[Tedim language|Tiddim Chin language]] (locally known as Zo pau) which had a total of about 345,000 speakers in 1990. Some 190,000 of these lived in Burma with about 155,000 of them residing in India.  The Tiddim are numbered at about 230,000 people.  About 70 percent of the Tiddim are Christians, with the remainder practicing indigenous religions.

The Bible was translated into Tiddim in 1983, although the New Testament had been translated into and published in Tiddim in 1932.

The Tiddim reside primarily in [[Chin State]] in Burma and in adjacent parts of India, such as [[Manipur]].
They have an organisation called Tedim Chin Union, headquarter in Churachandpur District of Manipur. They work for the unification of all the tribes in Manipur. &lt;ref&gt;http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=1..301015.oct15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitman-Walker Health''' ('''WWH'''), formerly '''Whitman-Walker Clinic''', is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] community health center in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan area&lt;ref name="Boorstein"&gt;Boorstein, "Maintaining Awareness, One Step at a Time," ''The Washington Post'', October 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with a special expertise in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] healthcare and [[LGBT]] healthcare. Founded as an affirming health center for the gay and lesbian community in 1978, Whitman-Walker was one of the first responders to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in D.C. and became a leader in HIV/AIDS education, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Whitman-Walker has expanded its services to include primary healthcare services, a stronger focus on queer women's care and youth services.

WWH is named for [[gay]] poet [[Walt Whitman]] (a former D.C. resident) and Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]], a noted [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era physician in the District and [[women's rights]] activist.&lt;ref name="Gregg"&gt;Gregg, "Clinic for Gays Provides Specialized Treatment," ''The Washington Post'', March 5, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rupert"&gt;Rupert, "D.C. Clinic Draws Praise for Its AIDS Work," ''The Washington Post'', November 20, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Through four sites in D.C., WWH provides a number of health care services to the [[Washington metropolitan area|D.C. metro area]]. They include primary medical and [[Dentistry|dental care]]; [[Mental health counseling|mental health]] and addictions counseling and treatment; HIV education, prevention and testing; legal services; medical adherence case management; a pharmacy open to all; and more.

Whitman-Walker's newest medical facility is at 1525 14th Street, NW. This 42,000 square foot building opened in May 2015. It houses 28 medical exam rooms, nine dental chairs, a street-facing pharmacy, behavioral health therapy rooms and more.

Administration continues to operate out of the [[Elizabeth Taylor#Other interests|Elizabeth Taylor]] Medical Center located at 1701 [[14th Street Northwest and Southwest (Washington, D.C.)|14th Street]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Gregg" /&gt; WWH also provides primary medical services, dental care and legal services out of its [[Max Robinson]] Center in the primarily [[African-American]] neighborhood of [[Anacostia]] in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast]] D.C.&lt;ref name="MoreChanges"&gt;Chibbaro, "More Changes Planned for Whitman-Walker," ''Washington Blade,'' January 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annually, WWH produces The Walk to End HIV, formerly [[AIDS Walk]] Washington, which is held in October, and is the largest community-based fundraising event for WWH's HIV services.

==History==

===1970s===
Whitman-Walker was founded in November 1973 as the Gay Men's VD Clinic, part of the Washington Free Clinic.&lt;ref name="Rupert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, "After 39 Years, End of a Health Institution," ''The Washington Post'', January 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The VD Clinic operated in the basement of the Georgetown Lutheran Church with an all-volunteer staff. In 1976, after receiving complaints from the church, the VD Clinic split off as an independent organization and hired its first full-time staff.

Whitman-Walker Health was chartered as "Whitman-Walker Clinic" by the government of the District of Columbia on January 13, 1978. The D.C. Department of Human Resources provided WWH $15,000, the first city funds to support the organization. In October, Whitman-Walker Clinic opened a new, rented facility at 1606 17th Street, NW.

===1980s===
[[File:2335-2339 18th Street NW.JPG|thumb|From 1980 to 1987, Whitman-Walker Clinic was located at 2335 18th Street, N.W., visible on the far right-hand side.]]
In 1980, a financial crisis threatened the Clinic. The administrator resigned, programs were eliminated and the Clinic moved into a more affordable space on 18th Street in [[Adams Morgan]].

In 1981, [[Jim Graham]] became the Clinic's president&lt;ref name="Gregg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vargas"&gt;Vargas, "D.C. Gay Group Battles 'AIDS Fatigue,'" ''The Washington Post'', August 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, "Honoring Those Who Help Ease the Pain," ''The Washington Post'', November 20, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and Larry Medley became the third WWC administrator. Whitman-Walker hired its first board-certified medical technologist for an in-house laboratory offering testing for various sexually transmitted diseases.

On June 5, 1981, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's]] weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report features an account of five young gay men in Los Angeles with cases of rare pneumonia. This was the first medical report on what would famously come to be known as HIV/AIDS.

In 1983, as AIDS began taking a larger toll, WWC assumed a leadership role in fighting the epidemic. The Clinic launched its AIDS Education Fund to provide up-to-date information, counseling and direct services to people with AIDS; the Buddy program to help people living with AIDS was started; an AIDS information hotline (which was the recipient of the first DC contract awarded for AIDS services) was created; and an HIV/AIDS prevention advertising campaign was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, "Private NW Clinic Has Support Plan For Victims of AIDS," ''The Washington Post'', September 22, 1983; "AIDS Phone Line," ''The Washington Post'', October 6, 1983; Lewis, "Apprehensive Callers Swamp AIDS Hot Line," ''The Washington Post'', November 9, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; To support these new programs, WWC benefited from D.C.'s first AIDS fundraiser which raised $4,400.

On April 4, 1983, WWC presented the first D.C. AIDS Forum at the [[Lisner Auditorium]] at [[George Washington University]]. The forum distributed AIDS prevention information and catered to the 1,200 men in attendance. A second AIDS forum for people of color was held on September 28.&lt;!-- missing citation --&gt;

In 1984, WWC opened its AIDS Evaluation Unit, the first gay, community-based medical unit in the U.S. devoted to the evaluation and diagnosis of AIDS symptoms.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt; Fifty-five patients were treated the first year and 50 percent had AIDS.

The first support group for people with AIDS (PWA) began. Sunnye Sherman, a WWC client, stepped forward as one of the first women openly living with AIDS in the nation. She acted as a strong support system for other people with AIDS and educated the community on her experience.&lt;ref name="Vargas" /&gt;

Whitman-Walker opened the Robert N. Schwartz, M.D., house, the city's first home for people with AIDS, in 1985. The second house opened in December.&lt;ref&gt;Specter, "'Secret' House Provides Financial Refuge for AIDS Victims," ''The Washington Post'', August 31, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, WWC began anonymous testing for what was then called HTLV-III, but is now called HIV. Whitman-Walker became the largest testing site in the region.

The AIDS treatment center rapidly expanded and became a full-time clinic in 1986.&lt;ref name="Rupert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel, "Full-Time Clinic To Treat AIDS Planned in D.C.," ''The Washington Post'', September 6, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1986, WWC continued to expand HIV/AIDS services. The housing program grew with the opening of four houses. Whitman-Walker also opened a [[food bank]] and hired its first full-time [[Attorney at law (United States)|lawyer]] to provide clients with legal services related to [[AIDS Discrimination#Stigma|AIDS discrimination]].&lt;ref name="Hull" /&gt; These services largely consisted of wills, powers of attorney and disability entitlements.

In 1987, WWC opened a [[Dentistry|dental clinic]] for patients with HIV/AIDS, one of only three in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, "District's Whitman-Walker Clinic Comes of Age," ''The Washington Post'', May 27, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman-Walker also opened the Scott Harper House for gay men and lesbians recovering from substance abuse, a facility still open to this day.

[[File:Whitman Walker Clinic, former location.jpg|thumb|The Whitman-Walker Clinic's former medical facility located at 1407 S Street, NW.]]Also in 1987, WWC moved to a larger building, located at 1407 S Street, NW (formerly the Evelyn Towers Apartments). This facility would operate as the organization's headquarters for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;Hull, "Whitman-Walker, A Longtime Front in AIDS War, Moves Out," ''Washington Post,'' December 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman-Walker was able to purchase the building in 1988. At this time, D.C. [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|Mayor]] [[Marion Barry]] and the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meyerfoundation.org Meyer Foundation Web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; were the Clinic's primary financial supporters. Simultaneously, individual contributions from the local LGBTQ community made up about half of the organization's income.&lt;ref name="Hull" /&gt;

Whitman-Walker brought the first AIDS Walk to D.C. in 1987.

Whitman-Walker encountered resistance when it began to offer services through the [[Northern Virginia]] AIDS Project in 1987. Although the Clinic had started its Northern Virginia AIDS Project in 1987, it was unable to find space for its operations for some time. In one case, the Clinic was denied housing by a landlord who allegedly did so out of fear and/or [[homophobia]].&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt; The landlord claimed the Clinic had not met certain leasing and payment requirements, and a judge agreed. Whitman-Walker eventually found other space and opened its Northern Virginia AIDS (NOVAA) Project office in Arlington, offering case management and education services.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, "D.C. AIDS Clinic Rebuffed in Quest for Va. Site," ''The Washington Post'', December 10, 1988; Baker, "Va. Judge Throws Out Suit by AIDS Clinic," ''The Washington Post'', December 29, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, WWC expanded its services throughout the D.C. metropolitan region, providing access to new HIV treatments an opening an on-site, at-cost pharmacy.

===1990s===
The Lesbian Services and Mental Health Services programs had full-time, paid staff.

In December 1990, WWC dedicated the Stewart B. McKinney House, its first house specifically for families with HIV.

Passage of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1991 led to the infusion of federal [[Grant (money)|grant]] funds, helping to reinforce the Clinic's finances.&lt;ref name="Hull" /&gt; Whitman-Walker expanded to include a transportation service, interpreting services, a Spanish-speaking physician and a full-time dentist.

In June 1991, WWC began construction of a new outpatient care center for people with AIDS. The center was dedicated as the Bill Austin Day Treatment and Care Center. Then-[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], [[Barbara Bush]], made a highly publicized visit to open the Austin Center.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe, "Mrs. Bush, Reaching Out," ''Washington Post,'' December 20, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center.JPG|thumb|left|The Whitman-Walker Clinic's Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center]]

In 1992, WWC opened its Max Robinson Center in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast D.C.]] (2301 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE) and Whitman-Walker Clinic of [[Southern Maryland]] (7676 New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring).&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine, "Clinic's Troubles Years in Making," ''The Washington Post'', June 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutner, "Whitman-Walker to Open AIDS Outreach Center in Southeast," ''The Washington Post'', November 26, 1992; Goldstein, "Clinic Widens Its Reach to AIDS in Md. Suburbs," ''The Washington Post'', January 7, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lesbian Health Clinic also opened and offered a wide range of gynecological and wellness services to lesbians and bisexual women in the region.

The Clinic's expansion efforts caused conflict with some other service groups. For example, in 1993 WWC applied for a million-dollar HIV/AIDS grant and competed for the grant against a coalition of primarily African-American service and outreach groups for it. The Clinic won the grant, angering some community leaders and activists who felt the city had discriminated against black organizations in favor of the white-led Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, "AIDS Groups Go Head-to-Head With Whitman-Walker," ''The Washington Post'', August 25, 1993; Goldstein, "City Giving AIDS Clinic $1.2 Million," ''The Washington Post'', June 16, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Local community leaders also opposed the Clinic's expanding housing program, fearing for the health and safety of their communities.

Whitman-Walker adopted [[HIV test|oral testing for HIV]] in 1993 before most major AIDS clinics in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, "Whitman-Walker Adopts Oral HIV Test Before Other Big AIDS Clinics," ''The Washington Post'', January 16, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, WWC built the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, named in honor of actress and AIDS activist Dame [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Hull" /&gt; Taylor attended the building's opening ceremony.

Further expansion came in 1994 as the Northern Virginia AIDS (NOVAA) Project of Whitman-Walker Clinic grew and was formally renamed Whitman-Walker Clinic of Northern Virginia. The HIV testing and counseling program expanded to Max Robinson Center.

In 1995, the Clinic established a program under which patients could sell their [[life insurance]] policies to the organization in exchange for an [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]]. Critics claimed that Whitman-Walker would benefit only if its patients died, making this a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, "D.C. AIDS Clinic Makes Deal With Insurance Buyer," ''The Washington Post'', September 11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1997 AIDS Walk Washington was the organization's most successful Walk ever. About 25,000 people helped raise $1.7 million.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, "Ailing Economy Afflicts Clinic," ''Washington Post,'' January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1998, Washington AIDS Partnership awarded WWC with a $42,000 grant to expand the Clinic's Needle Exchange Program. The program conducted one-to-one syringe exchanges. The program counseled drug users, administered HIV tests and significantly reduced the transmission of HIV. Unfortunately, later that year, Congress passed a District budget with restrictions on federal funding for organizations conducting needle exchange programs.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt; In response, an independent corporation was incorporated to fill the need: Prevention Works, Inc.

In early February 1998, WWC Legal Services and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court Case of ''[[Bragdon v. Abbott]]'', a case of discrimination by a dentist to his patient who was HIV-positive. On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-156.ZO.html decided in favor] of the patient. With the successful use of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA), this case made it harder for doctors to justify discrimination against HIV-positive patients.

Jim Graham, long-time executive director of WWC, resigned at the end of 1998 to serve on the D.C. City Council representing Ward One.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, "7 Members Sworn In, Altering D.C. Council," ''The Washington Post'', January 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham’s replacement was Elliott Johnson, who came to the Clinic from the Los Angeles County Health Department. Johnson briefly served as executive director.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, "Whitman-Walker Tries to Recover From Troubles," ''Washington Post'', December 19, 1999; Goldstein, "Whitman-Walker Announces Replacement for Ousted Director," ''The Washington Post'', December 17, 1999; Goldstein, "Whitman-Walker Chief Forced to Leave," ''The Washington Post'', December 10, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the counseling and testing program went mobile with a van that provided testing at health fairs, festivals and bars. Whitman-Walker more than tripled its testing rates through this outreach. This program is still in effect today and supports the 10,000 free HIV tests that WWH administers annually.

===2000s===

Cornelius Baker, an HIV-positive civil rights and HIV activist, was selected as executive director in January 2000.&lt;ref name="Crea"&gt;Crea, "Baker to Leave Whitman-Walker," ''Washington Blade'', December 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2000, WWC renovated Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center to place nearly all client services under one roof.

That same year, the Rev. Jesse Jackson received an HIV test at Max Robinson Center as part of a campaign to encourage African-Americans to get tested.

Whitman-Walker played a fundamental role in organizing the National Coalition for LGBT Health along with 50 other local, state and national organizations. Cornelius Baker was named one of the first co-chairs of the Coalition.

As the HIV/AIDS epidemic entered the 21st Century, WWC was faced with a changing epidemic and difficult decisions. With improved medical treatment, HIV/AIDS patients began to live longer and required more services for longer periods of time. This change put an additional financial strain on the Clinic as it continued providing services to a growing patient base.

Simultaneously, funding problems began to beset the Clinic. Funding for the federal Ryan White CARE Act was frozen at its 2001 level for several years. Major fundraising events, such as the AIDS Ride (which went bankrupt) and the AIDS Walk (which saw reduced attendance in 2000 and 2001), were not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Only 7,000 people attended the AIDS Walk that year, raising a mere $100,000.  See: Morello and Smith, "Charities To Drop AIDS Ride Promoter," ''The Washington Post'', May 31, 2002; Morello, "Charities Peddle Their Own Bike Ride," ''The Washington Post'', September 22, 2002; Morello, "Expenses Eat Profits Of District AIDS Ride," ''The Washington Post'', August 27, 2002; Argetsinger, ''2 D.C. Charities Had Cut Ties to Firm,'' ''The Washington Post'', August 26, 2002; Morello, "Revenue Drop Causes Clinic To Reevaluate AIDS Walk," ''The Washington Post'', October 24, 2002; Wilson, "Ailing Economy Afflicts Clinic," ''Washington Post,'' January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Clinic began offering OraQuick's rapid oral HIV test, which gave results in 20 minutes. Whitman-Walker also instituted a sliding fee scale so that those who could afford to contribute to their care could do so.

2004 brought both good and bad news for WWC. The CDC and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield helped the Clinic observe World AIDS Day, December 1, by providing funds for two new mobile HIV testing units. However, financial problems lead to the Schwartz Housing Program's closing and the transition of all housing clients to other providers.

Cornelius Baker resigned as executive director of WWC in December 2004, telling the ''[[Washington Blade]]''  the Clinic's financial difficulties had negatively impacted his health and citing other personal reasons for leaving.&lt;ref name="Crea" /&gt;

In 2005, WWC opened medical and support services for the transgender community. Services include gynecological exams; STD screenings; chest and breast exams and self-exam instruction; hormone therapy; and mental health services.

In May 2005, WWC faced its biggest financial problem when it was unable to make payroll for the first time in its history. This cash crunch was brought on by the ongoing freeze in Ryan White CARE Act funding levels, reduced donations through special events and late payments from the D.C. government for services rendered.

At the same time, the Clinic discovered it had mistakenly overcharged funders for laboratory expenses. After an internal investigation confirmed the error, WWC immediately stopped billing for these services and notified all pertinent funders. This change further impacted revenue.

In early June, the Clinic announced that financial difficulties would force it to close several programs, including the Food Bank and the Clinic’s sites in Virginia and Maryland. Almost immediately, small donors, local governments and corporate partners offered financial support. The District of Columbia provided a one-time grant of $3.2 million. Government entities in Virginia pledged $800,000 to keep Whitman-Walker of Northern Virginia open through December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro, "Whitman-Walker Plans Layoffs, Program Cuts," ''Washington Blade'', May 20, 2005; "Minority AIDS Groups Question Clinic Bailout," ''Washington Blade'', August 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

These funds enabled the Clinic to keep open the Food Bank and its residential addictions programs. However, Whitman-Walker Clinic of Suburban Maryland closed on September 30, 2005.

In late 2005, the Clinic’s Board of Directors adopted a raft of changes to ensure the future viability of WWC. Those changes included:
* Making Whitman-Walker a community health center that would provide health care to the entire community, regardless of HIV status, sexual orientation or gender identity. [43]
* Adopting a new business model to reduce dependence on government funding and private donations that expanded primary medical care services and brought in more clients with private insurance, Medicaid or Medicare. The new model also streamlined the access process for new clients and provided services at more convenient times for clients.
* Reducing the size of the Board by half and requiring that a majority of Board members be patients of the Clinic.

The expansion of services began in early 2006 &lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro, "Whitman-Walker Unveils Strategy for Turnaround," ''Washington Blade'', January 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and included a greater push for the Clinic to accept more private and public insurance plans. The Clinic also created a public benefits unit to screen new and existing patients for insurance and to enroll them in public assistance programs for which they qualified, such as Medicare, Medicaid and DC Healthcare Alliance.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Don Blanchon Whitman-Walker's Executive Director.jpg|thumb|Whitman-Walker Executive Director Don Blanchon]] --&gt;On March 13, 2006, the WWC Board of Directors announced it was hiring Donald Blanchon to take over as executive director on May 1. Blanchon was formerly chief executive officer of Maryland Physicians Care (a managed care health plan in [[Maryland]]) and vice president for Medicaid and Medicare programs at Schaller Anderson (a medical management firm).&lt;ref&gt;Weill-Greenberg, "Whitman-Walker Clinic Names New Leader," ''Washington Blade'', March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchon quickly announced his support for the Board's turnaround plan.

A week later, WWC announced it would sell its two properties on 14th Street and the Max Robinson Center in Anacostia in seeking to build new, larger medical treatment facilities in the two respective areas by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Lynsen, "Whitman-Walker to Sell 3 City Properties," ''Washington Blade'', March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these plans were ultimately shelved due to the downturn in the real estate market in the area.

In 2007, the Washington Free Clinic closed its doors due to financial problems. Whitman-Walker hired the staff of the Washington Free Clinic was hired by Whitman-Walker, allowing WWC to further expand the medical services it offered.

Over the next three years, WWC continued expanding its services to the community, through adding gynecological services, Hepatitis A and B specialty care, medical adherence services, and the hiring of additional providers.

In March 2007, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, part of the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), gave WWC a “Federally Qualified Health Center Look-Alike” designation. The designation is only awarded to clinics that provide care to medically underserved communities and meet other stringent requirements. The benefits of this status include a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate.

Finally in 2007, WWC purchased and installed a state-of-the-art, computerized patient record-keeping system.

On January 11, 2008, Blanchon said the Clinic had almost completed its transformation into a primary care medical organization. Whitman-Walker hired Dr. Raymond Martins, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]], as its new chief medical officer, purchased and [[outsourcing|outsourced]] its financial management department. Although WWC laid off an unspecified number of employees due to the outsourcing, Blanchon said the Clinic was still the area's largest provider of HIV/AIDS education, prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name="MoreChanges"/&gt;

Whitman-Walker also began considering plans to improve and upgrade the Clinic’s facilities.&lt;ref name="MoreChanges" /&gt;

In June 2008, the Clinic sold its long-time headquarters at 1407 S Street, NW, to [[The JBG Companies]] for $8 million and moved its administrative staff into Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center at 14th Street, NW.&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;O'Connell, "Whitman-Walker Clinic Sells D.C. Office to JBG," ''Washington Business Journal,'' June 17, 2008; Schwartzman, "Whitman-Walker Clinic to Sell Administrative Offices," ''Washington Post,'' July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SellsHQ"&gt;Chibbaro, "Whitman-Walker Sells HQ Building for $8 Million," ''Washington Blade,'' June 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman-Walker used the proceeds to pay off $5 million in debts stemming from mortgages on its existing buildings.&lt;ref name="Sale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Closure"&gt;"HIV Clinic to Cut Workers, Staff," ''Associated Press,'' December 17, 2008; Plumb, "Whitman-Walker Lays Off 25%," ''Washington Business Journal,'' December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 AIDS Walk was the Clinic's most successful in several years, raising $700,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffin, "AIDS 5K Walk Raises Over $700,000," ''Washington Informer,'' October 9–15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By year's end, the Clinic had served about 10,000 patients, of whom 3,400 were HIV-positive.&lt;ref name="Hull" /&gt;

Nonetheless, WWC continued to face financial challenges. The global economic downturn in the fall of 2008 had a tremendous impact on revenue: Government reimbursements for medical care had not kept pace with inflation, promised funding from some sources were not delivered, donations had dropped by 29 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Private donations made up 30 percent of the WWC budget at the time. See: Plumb, "Whitman-Walker Lays Off 25%," ''Washington Business Journal,'' December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  sales of medical services had decreased, and the number of patients without insurance had risen.&lt;ref name="Closure" /&gt;  The Clinic was forced to close Whitman-Walker Clinic of Northern Virginia and its BridgeBack residential addiction treatment center, and laid off 45 employees.&lt;ref name="Closure" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavanuagh, "Whitman-Walker Clinic Announces Layoffs, Cuts," ''Washington Blade,'' December 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitman-Walker also outsourced its pharmacy operations to Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (a privately held, for-profit pharmacy management company based in Amarillo, Texas).&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Closure" /&gt; The Clinic was also forced to close its mental health telephone hotline when city funding for the program was eliminated.&lt;ref name="NewHearing"&gt;Lynsen, "New Hearing Set for Whitman-Walker Review," ''Washington Blade,'' April 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decade of financial struggle, WWC began seeing a turnaround in the second half of 2009. By the year's end, the Clinic’s $4 million loss in both 2007 and 2008 had been reduced more than 80 percent to a $650,000 loss.

The turnaround was attributed to several factors:
* A nearly tripling of revenue from third party funding such as private and public insurance.
* Increased revenue from WWC’s on-site pharmacy, which approached $500,000 a month by the year’s end.
* An increase in patients coming to WWC for care who had insurance or were eligible to receive public benefits.
* The 2009 AIDS Walk raised $100,000 more than expected.
* The difficult decisions to cut financially unsustainable programming.

The creation of stable sources of revenue allowed WWC to decrease its dependency on government funding and private contributions, making it less vulnerable to economic downturns.

At the same time, WWC services continued to expand. Between 2006 and 2010, the Clinic more than doubled the number of health care providers on staff, including specialists in gynecology, Hepatitis and psychiatry.

===2010s===
In early 2011, WWC announced that it had finished 2010 in the black, something it had not done in a decade. The two percent operating gain represented the third year in a row of financial progress and reflected a tremendous amount of hard work and sacrifice for WWC staff.&lt;ref&gt;Capehart, "Whitman-Walker rebound," ''Washington Post,'' February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broverman "D.C. Success Story," ''The Advocate,'' February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro "Restructuring credited with Whitman-Walker revenue gains," ''Washington Blade,'' February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitman-Walker also saw a 30 percent increase in patients between 2009 and 2010.

In April, Whitman-Walker announced that it was changing its name to “Whitman-Walker Health” and unveiled a new logo and website.&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan "Name Changer," ''Metro Weekly,'' April 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro "Whitman-Walker drops ‘Clinic’ from name," ''Washington Blade,'' April 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broverman "D.C. Gay Health Center Embraces Change," ''The Advocate,'' April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, WWH completed extensive renovations of patient service areas in Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, improving patient flow, expanding the size of the pharmacy, and bringing a new look to the lobby.

The year 2011 also brought some distinctions of merit to WWH, including the “Clinic of the Year” award from the Capital City Area Health Education Center &lt;ref&gt;Najafi "Clinic Kudos," ''Metro Weekly,'' April 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Medical Society of the District of Columbia’s John Benjamin Nichols Award for Outstanding Contributions to Community Health. Whitman-Walker was also named one of 27 “Leaders in LGBT Healthcare Equality” in the nation by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Najafi "Out Patient Care," ''Metro Weekly,'' July 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, WWH announced that 2011 had been a highly successful year:&lt;ref&gt;Riley "Whitman-Walker Touts Growth, Fiscal Health," ''Metro Weekly,'' March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer "Whitman-Walker continues strong streak," ''Washington Business Journal,'' March 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capehart "Whitman-Walker’s stunning turnaround," ''washingtonpost.com,'' March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro "Whitman-Walker posts $2.6 million surplus," ''Washington Blade,'' March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A $2.6 million operating gain, the second year in a row with a gain, marking a nearly $7 million turnaround since 2007's $4+ million loss.
* Whitman-Walker cared for 15,515 individuals, a nearly 20 percent increase over 2010.  The patient base had nearly doubled since WWH began its process to become a community health center in 2006.
* One in seven patients in 2011 lived in Wards Seven and Eight—a 68 percent increase over 2010.
* The number of LGB patients had increased by 77 percent since 2006.
* The number of transgender patients had increased by 185 percent since 2006.
* Whitman-Walker administered more than 10,600 HIV tests in 2011, nine percent of all HIV tests administered in the District of Columbia, with 174 new HIV diagnoses.

Whitman-Walker marked the International AIDS Conference in July 2012 with "Return to Lisner," a community forum on HIV/AIDS held at the site of DC's first AIDS forum on April 4, 1983, also organized by Whitman-Walker. The July 24th forum drew hundreds to the Lisner Auditorium to hear speakers including Jeanne White-Ginder, the mother of Ryan White.&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro "AIDS experts express hope at ‘Return to Lisner,’" ''Washington Blade,'' July 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As 2013 began, Whitman-Walker announced the construction of a new medical home set to open in 2015. The new facility would be at 1525 14th Street, NW, about two blocks south of Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center. It would be leased to WWH.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer "Whitman-Walker Health signs lease, will expand" ''Washington Business Journal,'' January 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, WWH announced that it had ended 2012 with an unaudited $2.4 million surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Lavers "Whitman-Walker reports surplus" ''Washington Blade,'' March 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the third consecutive year it had finished a year in the black. Whitman-Walker also ended 2012 with high patient satisfaction rates and high quality of care indicators.

Mautner Project, the National Lesbian Health Organization, a DC-based nonprofit focused on the health care needs of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, joined WWH in a collaboration in June 2013. All of Mautner Project's programs and employees became a part of WWH, allowing Mautner's existing clients greater access to more health care services.&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro "Mautner Project to become part of Whitman-Walker" ''Washington Blade,'' June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, WWH announced the name change of its annual AIDS Walk to The Walk to End HIV. The name change “reflects a cataclysmic shift to what HIV is today – a chronic, manageable disease,” said Don Blanchon at the time of the announcement. AIDS Walk Washington was the first AIDS Walk in the country to change its name and remove AIDS from the title.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, Peter. "'AIDS Walk' is now 'Walk to End HIV.'" ''Washington Blade''. July 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

2015 marked a new collaboration between the youth-serving organization Metro TeenAIDS (MTA) and WWH. [https://www.whitman-walker.org/our-mission-values/wwh-newsroom/press-releases/metro-teenaids-joins-whitman-walker-health/ Metro TeenAIDS became a part of WWH] in February, maintaining all of MTA’s youth services and extending WWH’s service reach to young people.

In May 2015, WWH opened its state-of-the-art medical home at 1525 14th Street, NW.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, John. "Whitman-Walker Health to debut new building on 14th Street." ''Metro Weekly''. May 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, the 42,000 square foot building doubled exam room space to 28, tripled dental chairs to nine and allowed for a street-facing pharmacy open to the whole community. With services spread over seven floors, the building (dubbed “1525”) houses primary medical care, dental care, behavioral health, legal services, wellness programs, and HIV counseling and testing. Administration staff continues to work out of Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, and some programs continue to be housed there.

In June, WWH announced that after the completion of a two-year planning and assessment process, its Board of Directors had decided to redevelop the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center site with Streetscape via a joint venture partnership model.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Tina. "Exclusive: Whitman-Walker reveals long-awaited plan for Elizabeth Taylor site on 14th Street." ''Washington Business Journal''. June 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman-Walker will be the majority owner of the joint venture and will retain major decision-making rights over key issues such as future programming/uses of the site.
