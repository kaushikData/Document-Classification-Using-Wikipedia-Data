'''Ammons Creek Falls''' is a [[waterfall]] located in the [[Tallulah Ranger District]] of the [[Chattahoochee National Forest]] in [[Rabun County, Georgia]] that cascades for over 100 feet.  There is 1.75 mile loop [[hiking trail]] that provides access to both nearby [[Holcomb Creek Falls]] and Ammons Creek Falls.  There is a wooden observation deck for viewing the falls.

The falls can be accessed from [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]] by taking Warwoman Road east for 10 miles. Turn left onto Hale Ridge Road (Forest Service Road 7) for 7 miles until it intersects Overflow Road (Forest Service Road 86).

'''Aspledon Undae''' is one of the named northern circumpolar [[dune field]]s in the vicinity of [[Planum Boreum]], the [[Mars|Martian]] North pole. It is named after one of the [[classical albedo features on Mars]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspledon Undae|url=https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/14279?__fsk=-155652745|website=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature|publisher=[[USGS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was officially approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) on 20 March 2007. Its name is [[Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; and derives from the name of a town in [[Boeotia]], [[Ancient Greece]], which, in turn, took its name from Aspledon ({{lang-grc|Ασπληδών}}),&lt;ref name="Greek Myth Index"&gt;{{cite web|title=ΑΣΠΛΗΔΩΝ|url=http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Aspledon.html|publisher=Greek Myth Index|access-date=3 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702071957/http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Aspledon.html|archive-date=2 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Poseidon]], the ancient Greek god of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fasti Hellenici: The civil and literary chronology of Greece, from the earliest accounts to the death of Augustus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IanLqygofgAC&amp;pg=PA48|year=1834|publisher=at the University Press|page=48|quote=Ασπληδών.

Aspledon Undae is the southernmost of the albedo-named dune fields of Planum Boreum,  and lies to the south of [[Hyperboreae Undae]] and southeast of [[Siton Undae]]. It is theorised that the formation of Aspledon Undae may have occurred during early erosion incidents of the Planum Boreum cavi unit, and that [[Rupes Tenuis]] may have also been a sand source, although it is now depleted.

According to Tanaka et al., [[Planum Boreum]] lies on two major basal units: The Rupes Tenuis unit and the Planum Boreum Cavi unit. The age of the Rupes Tenuis unit is early [[Amazonian (Mars)|Amazonian]], while the Planum Boreum Cavi unit overlays the Rupes Tenuis unit, and its age is Middle to Late Amazonian. The Olympia Undae unit may have formed during early denudation incidents of the Planum Boreum Cavi unit in its immediate neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt; More distant dune fields from the Planum Boreum Cavi unit, such as Siton, Aspledon, and a large portion of [[Olympia Undae]] may have formed during earlier erosional events of the Planum Boreum Cavi unit.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt; Other sources to these dune fields may include [[Rupes Tenuis]], although this source is now considered to be exhausted.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt;

'''Bajrak of Oštrozub''' was a [[bajrak]] which included about 43 villages in southern and central [[Lapušnica]] and southern [[Drenica]], today's [[Kosovo]]. ''Bajrak''s were military units and later administrative land divisions created in some provinces of historical [[Albania]] which also included what is today Kosovo during the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It was a patriarchal organization, similar to a commune or small district today.

The Bajrak of Oštrozub was one of the largest of Kosovo and Albania. It is believed that it formed as an administrative unit in the mountainous area of Lapušnica which was not controlled directly by the Ottoman government due to its location so it was given autonomy. The Bajrak of Oštrozub is believed to have been formed sometime in the mid-17th century based on Oštrozub which today is a village in the municipality of [[Mališevo]].

The Bajrak of Oštrozub also was popularly known as Bajrak Kapakli in reference to the warfare conducted by fighters in the region against the Ottoman Empire during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish war]].

It included about 43 villages:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20793">'''Bluetooth beacons''' are hardware transmitters - a class of [[Bluetooth low energy]] (LE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby [[Mobile computing|portable electronic]] devices. The technology enables [[smartphone]]s, [[computer tablet|tablet]]s and other devices to perform actions when in close proximity to a beacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bfonics Inc.|url=http://bfonics.com/what_is_beacon.php|publisher=Bfonics.com|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108070354/http://bfonics.com/what_is_beacon.php|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=18 January 2015 | title=Beacons: Everything you need to know.|url=http://www.pointrlabs.com/blog/beacons-everything-you-need-to-know/|publisher=Pointrlabs.com | accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluetooth beacons use [[Bluetooth low energy#Proximity sensing|Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing]] to transmit a [[universally unique identifier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daveaddey.com/?p=1252 |title=iBeacons |publisher=Dave Addey |date=2013-09-22 |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014352/http://daveaddey.com/?p=1252 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; picked up by a compatible app or operating system.  The identifier and several bytes sent with it can be used to determine the device's physical location,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/BLE-Beacons-URIBeacon-AltBeacons-iBeacon/|title=Understanding the different types of BLE Beacons|website=developer.mbed.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; track customers, or trigger a [[Location-based service|location-based]] action on the device such as a [[Check-in#Social network|check-in on social media]] or a [[Mobile marketing|push notification]].

One application is distributing messages at a specific [[Point of Interest]], for example a store, a bus stop, a room or a more specific location like a piece of furniture or a vending machine. This is similar to previously used geopush technology based on [[GPS]], but with a much reduced impact on battery life and much extended precision.

Another application is an [[indoor positioning system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meetingofideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ibeacons-bible-1-0.pdf |title=iBeacon Bible |publisher=Andy Cavallini |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/apple/apple-ibeacons-explained-smart-home-occupancy-sensing-solved.html |title=Apple iBeacons Explained – Smart Home Occupancy Sensing Solved? |publisher=Automated Home |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iBeacon- The game changer in InStore Navigation|url=http://technoparkliving.com/2013/12/ibeacon-the-game-changer-in-instore-navigation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps smartphones determine their approximate location or context.  With the help of a Bluetooth beacon, a smartphone's software can approximately find its relative location to a Bluetooth beacon in a store. [[Brick and mortar]] retail stores use the beacons for [[mobile commerce]], offering customers special deals through [[mobile marketing]],&lt;ref name="mcforbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2014/12/18/mcdonalds-ibeacon/|title=Apple iBeacons Find Their Way Into McDonald's|work=Forbes|date=18 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can enable [[mobile payment]]s through [[point of sale]] systems.

Bluetooth beacons differs from some other location-based technologies as the broadcasting device (beacon) is only a 1-way transmitter to the receiving smartphone or receiving device, and necessitates a specific app installed on the device to interact with the beacons. This ensures that only the installed app (not the Bluetooth beacon transmitter) can track users, potentially against their will, as they passively walk around the transmitters.

Bluetooth beacon transmitters come in a variety of form factors, including small coin cell devices, USB sticks, and generic Bluetooth 4.0 capable USB [[dongles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learn.adafruit.com/pibeacon-ibeacon-with-a-raspberry-pi/overview |title=Overview  piBeacon  DIY iBeacon with a Raspberry Pi  Adafruit Learning System  |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
The development of the "short-link" radio technology, later named Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989 by Dr. Nils Rydbeck CTO at Ericsson Mobile in [[Lund]] and Dr. [[Johan Ullman]]. The purpose was to develop wireless headsets, according to two inventions by [[Johan Ullman]], SE 8902098-6, issued 1989-06-12 and SE 9202239, issued 1992-07-24. Since its creation the Bluetooth standard has gone through many generations each adding different features. Bluetooth 1.2 allowed for faster speed up to ~700 kbit/s. Bluetooth 2.0 improved on this for speeds up to 3 Mbit/s. Bluetooth 2.1 improved device pairing speed and security. Bluetooth 3.0 again improved transfer speed up to 24 Mbit/s. In 2010 Bluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy) was released with its main focus being reduced power consumption. Before Bluetooth 4.0 the majority of connections using Bluetooth were two way, both devices listen and talk to each other. Although this two way communication is still possible with Bluetooth 4.0, one way communication is also possible. This one way communication allows a bluetooth device to transmit information but not listen for it. These one way "beacons" do not require a paired connection like previous Bluetooth devices so they have new useful applications.

Bluetooth beacons operate using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy standard so battery powered devices are possible. Battery life of devices varies depending on manufacturer. The Bluetooth LE protocol is significantly more power efficient than Bluetooth Classic. Several chipsets makers, including [[Texas Instruments]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/article/tis-support-of-apples-ibeacon-adds-enterprise-iot-heft/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nordic Semiconductor]] now supply chipsets optimized for iBeacon use. Power consumption depends on iBeacon configuration parameters of advertising interval and transmit power.  Battery life can range between 1–48 months. Apple's recommended setting of 100 ms advertising interval with a coin cell battery provides for 1–3 months of life, which increases to 2–3 years as advertising interval is increased to 900 ms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/03/best-ibeacon-hardware-stress-test-battery-life/ |title=Best iBeacon hardware crowned following extensive stress tests |publisher= 9to5 mac|date=2014-11-03|accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery consumption of the phones is a factor that must be taken into account when deploying beacon enabled apps. A recent report has shown that
older phones tend to draw more battery power in the vicinity of iBeacons, while the newer phones can be more efficient in the same environment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/07/09/retailers-are-excited-about-beacons-but-how-fast-will-they-drain-your-smartphone-battery/ |title=Retailers are excited about beacons, but how fast will they drain your smartphone battery? |publisher= GIGAOM|date=2014-07-09|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the time spent by the phone scanning, number of scans and number of beacons in the vicinity are also significant factors for battery drain, as pointed out by the Aislelabs report.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-phones/ |title=iBeacon and Battery Drain on Phones: A Technical Report |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-07-09|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a follow up report, [[Aislelabs]] found a drastic improvement in battery consumption for iPhone5S, iPhone 5C versus the older model iPhone 4S.
At 10 surrounding iBeacons, iPhone 4S can consume up to 11% of battery per hour whereas iPhone5S consumes a little less than 5% battery per hour.
&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/ |title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report - Aislelabs |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An energy efficient iBeacon application needs to consider these aspects in order to strike a good balance between app responsiveness and battery consumption.

===USB powered===
Bluetooth beacons can also come in the form of USB dongles. These small USB beacons can be powered by a standard USB port which makes them ideal for long term permanent installations.

==Uses==

===Advertising===
Bluetooth beacons can be used to send a packet of information that contains a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This UUID is used to trigger events specific to that beacon. In the case of Apple's iBeacon the UUID will be recognized by an app on the user device that will trigger an event. This event is fully customizable by the app developer but in the case of advertising the event might be a push notification with an ad. However, with a UID based system the users device must connect to an online server which is capable of understanding the beacons UUID. Once the UUID is sent to the server the appropriate message action is sent to a users device.

Other methods of advertising are also possible with beacons, URIBeacon and Google's Eddystone  allow for a URI transmission mode that unlike iBeacons UID doesn't require an outside server for recognition. The URI beacons transmit a URI which could be a link to a webpage and the user will see that URI directly on their phone.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Indoor navigation===
Indoor positioning with beacons falls into three categories. Implementations with many beacons per room, implementations with one beacon per room, and implementations with a few beacons per building. Indoor navigation with Bluetooth is still in its infancy but attempts have been made to find a working solution.

===Notification and interaction===
Beacons can be associated with the artpieces in a museum to encourage further interaction. For example, a notification can be sent to user's mobile device when user is in the proximity to a particular artpiece. By sending user the notification, user is alerted with the artpiece in his proximity, and if user indicates their further interest, a specific app can be installed to interact with the encountered artpiece &lt;ref&gt;P. C. Ng, J. She and S. Park, "Notify-and-interact: A beacon-smartphone interaction for user engagement in galleries," 2017 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), Hong Kong, 2017, pp. 1069-1074.
doi: 10.1109/ICME.2017.8019467
[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019467/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In general, a native app is needed for a mobile device to interact with the beacon if the beacon uses iBeacon protocol; whereas if Eddystone is employed, user can interact with the artpiece through a physical web URL broadcast by the Eddystone.

==== Many beacons per room ====
With multiple beacons per room [[trilateration]] can be used to estimate a users' position to within about 2 meters.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazan|first=Filip|date=2015|title=A Study of Devising Neural Network Based Indoor Localization Using Beacons: First Results|url=|journal=Computing &amp; Information Systems |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=15|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluetooth beacons are capable of transmitting their Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in addition to other data. This RSSI value is calibrated by the manufacturer of the beacon to be the signal strength of the beacon at a known distance, typically one meter. Using the known output signal strength of the beacon and the signal strength observed by the receiving device an approximation can be made about the distance between the beacon and the device. However this approximation is not very reliable, so for more accurate position tracking other methods are preferred. Since its release in 2010 many studies have been connected using Bluetooth beacons for tracking.  A few methods have been tested to find the best way of combining the RSSI values for tracking.  Neural networks have been proposed as a good way of reducing the error in estimation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A [[Stigmergic]] approach has also been tested, this method uses an intensity map to estimate a users location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo Filippo|first=Barsocchi Paolo|date=2015

====One beacon per room==== 
With only one beacon per room, a user can use their known room position in conjunction with a virtual map of all the rooms in a building to navigate a building. A building with many separate rooms may need a different beacon configuration for navigation. With one beacon in each room a user can use an app to know the room they are in, and a simple shortest path algorithm can be used to give them the best route to the room they are looking for. This configuration requires a digital map of the building but attempts have been made to make this map creation easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobek|first=Szymon|date=2015|title=Indoor Microlocation with BLE Beacons and Incremental Rule Learning|url=|journal=IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Few beacons per building====

Beacons can be used in conjunction with [[pedestrian dead reckoning]] techniques to add checkpoints to a large open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LI|first=XI|date=2015|title=A Bluetooth/PDR Integration Algorithm for an Indoor Positioning System|url=|journal=Sensors |volume=15 |issue=10|doi=10.3390/s151024862|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDR uses a known last location in conjunction with direction and speed information provided by the user to estimate a person's location. This technique can be used to estimate a person's location as they walk through a building. Using Bluetooth beacons as checkpoints the user's location can be recalculated to reduce error. In this way a few Bluetooth beacons can be used to cover a large area like a mall.

===Healthcare===
Using the device tracking capabilities of Bluetooth beacons, in-home patient monitoring is possible. Using bluetooth beacons a person's movements and activities can be tracked in their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De|first=Debraj|date=September 2015|title=Multimodal Wearable Sensing For Fine-Grained Activity Recognition In Healthcare|url=|journal=IEEE Internet Computing |volume=19 |issue=5|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluetooth beacons are a good alternative to in house cameras due to their increased level of privacy. Additionally bluetooth beacons can be used in hospitals or other workplaces to ensure workers meet certain standards. For example, a beacon may be placed at a hand sanitizer dispenser in a hospital, the beacons can help ensure employees are using the station regularly.

==Beacon protocols==

===iBeacon=== 
In mid-2013, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced [[iBeacon]]s and experts wrote about how it is designed to help the retail industry by simplifying payments and enabling on-site offers. On December 6, 2013, Apple activated iBeacons across its 254 US retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/apple-launches-ibeacon-in-254-stores-to-streamline-shopping-experience-7000024026/ |title=Apple launches iBeacon in 254 stores to streamline shopping experience |publisher=ZDNet |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's has used the devices to give special offers to consumers in its fast-food stores.&lt;ref name="mcforbes" /&gt; As of May 2014, different hardware iBeacons can be purchased for as little as $5 per device to more than $30 per device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vincenth.net/blog/archive/2014/04/24/building-cross-platform-ibeacon-apps-for-ios-android-and-windows-with-c-and-xamarin.aspx |title=Building Cross-Platform iBeacon Apps for iOS, Android and Windows with C# and Xamarin |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these different iBeacons have varying default settings for their default transmit power and iBeacon advertisement frequency. Some hardware iBeacons advertise at as low as 1&amp;nbsp;Hz while others can be as fast as 10&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://itechcraft.com/comparison-of-ble-hardware/|title=A Short Comparison of BLE Hardware for Commercial Use - IT Craft|date=2016-07-11|work=IT Craft|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  iBeacon technology is still in its infancy.  One well reported software quirk exists on 4.2 and 4.3 Android systems whereby the system's bluetooth stack crashes when presented with many iBeacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/2014/04/02/a-solution-for-android-bluetooth-crashes.html |title=A Solution for Android Bluetooth Crashes |publisher=Developer.radiusnetworks.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reportedly fixed in Android 4.4.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67272 |title=Android Issue Tracker|publisher=code.google.com|accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AltBeacon===
AltBeacon is an open source alternative to iBeacon created by Radius Networks&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/BLE-Beacons-URIBeacon-AltBeacons-iBeacon/|title=Understanding the different types of BLE Beacons|website=developer.mbed.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===URIBeacon===
URIBeacons are different from iBeacons and AltBeacons because rather than broadcasting an identifier, they send a URL which can be understood immediately.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Eddystone===
[[Eddystone_(Google)|Eddystone]] is Google's standard for Bluetooth beacons. It supports three types of packets, Eddystone-UID, Eddystone-URL, and Eddystone-TLM.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://developer.estimote.com/eddystone/|title=What is Eddystone™? - Estimote Developer|website=developer.estimote.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddystone-UID functions in a very similar way to Apple's iBeacon, however, it supports additional telemetry data with Eddystone-TLM. The telemetry information is sent along with the UID data. The beacon information available includes battery voltage, beacon temperature, number of packets sent since last startup, and beacon uptime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Comparable technologies==
Although the [[Near field communication]] (NFC) environment is very different and has many non-overlapping applications, it is still compared with iBeacons.
* NFC range is up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (7.87 inches) but the optimal range is &lt; 4&amp;nbsp;cm (1.57 inches). iBeacons have a significantly larger range.
* NFC can be either passive or active. When using passive mode, the power is sent from the reader device. Although Passif (bought by [[Apple Inc.]]) has worked on reducing the energy consumption, a battery pack is still needed inside iBeacon tags at this time.
* Most Android smart devices ship with both [[Bluetooth]] 4.0 LE and NFC support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.pushmote.com/10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-ibeacons.html |title=10 most frequently asked questions about iBeacons |work=Pushmote Blog |accessdate=10 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071207/https://blog.pushmote.com/10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-ibeacons.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2014 also Apple released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus, supporting the NFC standard, but only limited to payments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/|title=Apple - iPhone - Compare Models|work=Apple|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital is [[Sucre]] while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands) a mostly flat region in the east of Bolivia.

The [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]] and the 27th largest in the world.

The country's population, estimated at 11&amp;nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. The [[Racial segregation|racial]] and [[social segregation]] that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].

Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunción]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].
After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Simón Bolívar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964–82)#The Banzer regime|coup d'état]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan José Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.

Modern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

== Etymology ==
Bolivia is named after Simón Bolívar, a leader in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salempress.com/store/samples/great_lives_from_history_19th/great_lives_from_history_19th_bolivar.htm |title=Simón Bolívar |publisher=Salem Press |accessdate=28 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825121538/https://salempress.com/store/samples/great_lives_from_history_19th/great_lives_from_history_19th_bolivar.htm |archivedate=25 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of [[Venezuela]], [[Antonio José de Sucre]], had been given the option by Bolívar to either unite [[Sucre|Charcas]] (present-day Bolivia) with the newly formed [[Republic of Peru]], to unite with the [[United Provinces of Rio de la Plata]], or to formally declare its independence from Spain as a wholly independent state. Sucre opted to create a brand new state and on 6 August 1825, with local support, named it in honor of Simón Bolívar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historia-bolivia.com/6-de-Agosto-Independencia-de-Bolivia/6 |title=6 de Agosto: Independencia de Bolivia |publisher=Historia-bolivia.com |accessdate=14 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820091233/http://historia-bolivia.com/6-de-Agosto-Independencia-de-Bolivia/6 |archivedate=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name was Republic of Bolívar. Some days later, congressman Manuel Martín Cruz proposed: "If from [[Romulus]] comes Rome, then from [[Bolívar]] comes Bolivia" ({{lang-es|Si de Rómulo Roma, de Bolívar Bolivia|links=no}}). The name was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825.&lt;ref name="Blogs.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/01/11/what-countries-are-named-after-individuals-or-families/ |title=What countries are named after individuals or families? |publisher=Blogs.law.harvard.edu |date=11 January 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] changed the country's official name to "Plurinational State of Bolivia" in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia's indigenous peoples under the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Blogs.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

=== Pre-colonial ===
[[File:Puerta_del_Sol_Símbolo_de_Tiwanaku_-_Bolivia.jpg|thumb|[[Gate of the Sun|Puerta del Sol]], Archaeological Zone of [[Tiwanaku]], Bolivia]]
[[File:Map_of_Wari_and_Tiawaku.svg|thumb|Tiwanaku at its largest territorial extent, AD 950]]
The region now known as Bolivia had been occupied for over 2,500 years when the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] arrived. However, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the [[Tiwanaku culture]] which had its capital at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small, agriculturally based village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fagan|2001|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. According to early estimates,{{When|date=February 2014}} the city covered approximately {{convert|6.5|sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}} at its maximum extent and had between 15,000 and 30,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolata|1993|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 [[satellite imaging]] was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.&lt;ref name="Valley of the Spirits"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolata|1996|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.&lt;ref name="McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.2307/530562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states "Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Isbell|first=William H.|title=Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon|journal=The Handbook of South American Archaeology|year=2008|pages=731–751|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_37|isbn=978-0-387-74906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.&lt;ref name="McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997"/&gt;

Tiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred,&lt;ref name="Kolata, Alan L. 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolata|first=Alan L. |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization|date=8 December 1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-55786-183-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}} causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.

As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities farther away from Lake Titicaca began to tender fewer foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kolata, Alan L. 1993"/&gt;

[[File:Inca_Expansion.svg|thumb|Inca Expansion (1438–1533)]]

Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its expansion from its capital at [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]]. It gained control over much of what is now Andean Bolivia and extended its control into the fringes of the Amazon basin.

=== Colonial period ===
The Spanish conquest of the [[Inca empire]] began in 1524, and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was known as Charcas, and was under the authority of the Viceroy of [[Lima]]. Local government came from the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]] located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern [[Sucre]]). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, [[Potosí]] soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the [[New World]] with a population exceeding 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ |title=The High Place: Potosi |author=Demos, John |publisher=Common-place.org |accessdate=14 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DCjAsiyH?url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ |archivedate=26 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 16th century, Bolivian [[silver]] was an important source of revenue for the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |title=Conquest in the Americas |publisher=MSN Encarta |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028035130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A steady stream of natives served as labor force under the brutal, slave conditions of the Spanish version of the pre-Columbian draft system called the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm |title=Bolivia – Ethnic Groups |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charcas was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 and the people from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty, coined the term "[[Upper Peru]]" ({{Lang-es|Alto Perú}}) as a popular reference to the Royal Audiencia of Charcas.

=== Independence and subsequent wars ===

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1809–1920)}}

The [[Bolivian War of Independence|struggle for independence]] started in the city of [[Sucre]] on 25 May 1809 and the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city) is known as the first cry of Freedom in Latin America. That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.

Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]]. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Simón Bolívar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.

[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bolívar in honor of [[Simón Bolívar]]]]

In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis José de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]].

At the outset of the war, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, the government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.

Following the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agustín Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Ingavi]] on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General [[José Ballivián]] then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]]. Later, both sides signed a [[peace treaty]] in 1842, putting a final end to the war.

A period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. In addition, during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83), [[Chile]]  occupied vast territories rich in [[natural resources]] south west of Bolivia, including the Bolivian [[coast]]. Chile took control of today's [[Chuquicamata]] area, the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, and the port of [[Antofagasta]] among other Bolivian territories.

Thus, since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGurn Centellas |first=Katherine |date=June 2008 |title=For Love of Land and Laboratory: Nation-building and Bioscience in Bolivia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXD4SlJQYDgC&amp;pg=PA97|location=Chicago  |isbn=9780549565697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the Acre War, important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864–71) traded the land for what he called "a magnificent white horse" and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians, which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability.

During the early 20th century, [[tin]] replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth.

Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]].

Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced [[universal suffrage]] into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

=== Late 20th century ===

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1964–82)}}

Twelve years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President [[René Barrientos Ortuño]], a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President Juan José Torres, the military, the MNR, and others installed Colonel (later General) [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]] as president in 1971. He returned to the presidency in 1997 through 2001.

The United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had been active in providing finances and training to the Bolivian military dictatorship in the 1960s. The revolutionary leader [[Che Guevara]] was killed by a team of CIA officers and members of the Bolivian Army on 9 October 1967, in Bolivia. [[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Félix Rodríguez]] was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara.&lt;ref name="BBC-2007-10-8"&gt;{{Cite journal| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7027619.stm| title= CIA man recounts Che Guevara's death| last= Grant |first=Will| date= 8 October 2007| journal= BBC News| accessdate = 2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez said that after he received a Bolivian presidential execution order, he told "the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully, to remain consistent with the Bolivian government's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army." Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in Panama, and "I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops, and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted", but that he had chosen to "let history run its course" as desired by Bolivia.&lt;ref name="XXXI-172"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Statements by Ernesto "Che" Guevara Prior to His Execution in Bolivia |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xxxi/36271.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206144244/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xxxi/36271.htm |archivedate=6 February 2009 |journal=Foreign Relations of the United States, Volume XXXI, South and Central America; Mexico |id=XXXI: 172 |date=13 October 1967 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups d'état, counter-coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, General [[Luis García Meza Tejada]] carried out a ruthless and violent [[coup d'état]] that did not have popular support. He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year. At the end of the year, he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced, "''Bueno, me quedo''", or, "All right; I'll stay [in office]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0120/1137626790492.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126130236/http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0120/1137626790492.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 January 2013 |title=Astroturfing all the way to No 1 |author=Boyd, Brian |date=20 January 2006 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=7 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981, three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], elected in 1980, and allow it to choose a new chief executive. In October 1982, [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] again became president, 22 years after the end of his first term of office (1956–60).

=== Democratic transition ===
{{main|History of Bolivia (1982–present)}}

[[File:Gonzálo Sánchez de Lozada-Agencia BrasilAntonio Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Former President, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]]

[[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was the "capitalization" program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises in return for agreed upon capital investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/01/business/international-business-bolivia-sells-utility-to-us-companies.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Bolivia Sells Utility to U.S. Companies|last=Sims|first=Calvin|date=1995-07-01|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Andrew|last2=Goldmark|first2=Susan|year=1994|title=Privatization by Capitalization : The Case of Bolivia – A Popular Participation Recipe for Cash-Starved SOEs|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/11679|journal=Viewpoint|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] ran for [[President of Bolivia|president]] in alliance with the [[Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari|Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement]], which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact94/wf950032.txt|title=1994 CIA World FactBook|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Sanchez de Lozada introduced the ''Plan de Todos'', which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of [[intercultural bilingual education]], implementation of [[Agriculture|agrarian]] [[legislation]], and [[privatization]] of state owned businesses. The plan explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the plan, most [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs), though not mines, were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia de la República de Bolivia|url=http://www.mirabolivia.com/edu/historia.htm|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This privatization of SOEs led to a [[neoliberal]] structuring.&lt;!--that acknowledged a diverse population within Bolivia. – Acknowledged how so?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.temple.edu/gus/kohl/documents/kohlplancitizenshipIJURR603.pdf |doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00451 |title=Restructuring Citizenship in Bolivia: El Plan de Todos |last=Kohl |first=Benjamin |year=2003 |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |volume=27 |issue=2 |page=337 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208112503/https://www.temple.edu/gus/kohl/documents/kohlplancitizenshipIJURR603.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law of Popular Participation gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures (and offering services): health, education, systems of irrigation, which stripped the responsibility away from the state.{{when|date=October 2014}}{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare [[coca]]-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of Bolivia, the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers.

In the 1997 elections, General [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–78), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to eradicate physically the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chakana.nl/files/pub/AssiesSalman_2005_Ethnicity-and-Politics-in-Bolivia.pdf |title=Ethnicity and Politics in Bolivia |publisher=Ethnopolitics 4(3):269–297 |format=PDF |date=September 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.

Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez]] completed the final year of his term.

[[File:Evo Morales in Ecuador (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Current President, [[Evo Morales]]]]
In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.

In 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.
[[File:Evomorales 20050122 posesion01.jpg|thumb|Evo Morales' inauguration as President]]
The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodríguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

The indigenous population of the [[Andes|Andean]] region was not able to benefit from government reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucero|first=José Antonio|editor=John Burdick |editor2=Philip Oxhorn |editor3=Kenneth M. Roberts|title=Beyond neoliberalism in Latin America?|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-61179-5|chapter=Decades Lost and Won: The Articulations of Indigenous Movements and Multicultural Neoliberalism in the Andes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evo Morales]] won the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 53.7% of the votes, an [[absolute majority]], unusual in Bolivian elections. On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to [[Bolivian gas conflict|re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets]]. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |title=Push for new Bolivia constitution |publisher=BBC News |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, more conflicts arose in Sucre, as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city, but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Congress of Bolivia|National Congress]].

Bolivia is located in the central zone of [[South America]], between 57°26'–69°38'W and 9°38'–22°53'S. With an area of {{convert|1098581|km2|sqmi}}, Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country, and the fifth largest country in South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html | title=Country Comparison :: Area | work=[[The World Factbook]] | publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending from the [[Andes|Central Andes]] through part of the ''[[Gran Chaco]]'', [[Pantanal]] and as far as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. The geographic center of the country is the so-called ''Puerto Estrella'' ("Star Port") on the [[Río Grande (Bolivia)|Río Grande]], in [[Ñuflo de Chávez Province]], [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]].

The geography of the country exhibits a great variety of terrain and climates. Bolivia has a high level of [[biodiversity]], considered one of the greatest in the world, as well as several [[ecoregion]]s with ecological sub-units such as the ''[[Altiplano]]'', [[tropical rainforest]]s (including [[Amazon rainforest]]), dry [[valley]]s, and the ''[[Chiquitania]]'', which is a [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]]. These areas feature enormous variations in altitude, from an elevation of {{convert|6542|m|ft}} above sea level in [[Nevado Sajama]] to nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} along the [[Paraguay River]]. Although a country of great geographic diversity, Bolivia has remained a [[landlocked country]] since the [[War of the Pacific]]. [[Puerto Suárez]], [[San Matías, Santa Cruz|San Matías]] and [[Puerto Quijarro]] are located in the [[Pantanal|Bolivian Pantanal]].

Bolivia can be divided into three [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions:

*'''The Andean region''' in the southwest spans 28% of the national territory, extending over {{convert|307603|km²|sqmi}}. This area is located above {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and is located between two big Andean chains, the ''[[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]]'' ("Western Range") and the ''[[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Range"), with some of the highest spots in the [[Americas]] such as the [[Nevado Sajama]], with an altitude of {{convert|6542|m|ft}}, and the [[Illimani]], at {{convert|6462|m|ft}}. Also located in the Cordillera Central is [[Lake Titicaca]], the highest commercially navigable lake in the world and the largest lake in South America;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5080/ | title=Lake Titicaca | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | date=17 June 2005 | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lake is shared with [[Peru]]. Also in this region are the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'', which is the largest [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] in the world and an important source of [[lithium]].
*The '''Sub-Andean region''' in the center and south of the country is an intermediate region between the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' (plain); this region comprises 13% of the territory of Bolivia, extending over {{convert|142815|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and encompassing the Bolivian valleys and the Yungas region. It is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate.
*The '''Llanos region''' in the northeast comprises 59% of the territory, with {{convert|648163|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is located to the north of the [[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]] and extends from the Andean foothills to the [[Paraguay River]]. It is a region of flat land and small plateaus, all covered by extensive rain forests containing enormous biodiversity. The region is below {{convert|400|m|ft}} above sea level.

Bolivia has three [[drainage basin]]s:

*The first is the [[Amazon River|Amazon Basin]], also called the North Basin ({{convert|724000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big [[meander]]s which form lakes such as [[Murillo Lake]] in [[Pando Department]]. The main Bolivian [[tributary]] to the Amazon basin is the [[Mamoré River]], with a length of {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} running north to the confluence with the [[Beni River]], {{convert|1113|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length and the second most important river of the country. The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guaporé River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].
*The second is the [[Río de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandioré Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.
*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km²|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains. The most important river is the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]], with a length of {{convert|436|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the longest river of the ''Altiplano''; it begins in [[Lake Titicaca]] and then runs in a southeast direction to [[Poopó Lake]]. The basin is then formed by Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó, the Desaguadero River, and great salt flats, including the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'' and [[Coipasa Lake]].

[[File:Bolivia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Bolivia map of Köppen climate classification]]
The [[geology of Bolivia]] comprises a variety of different [[lithology|lithologies]] as well as [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. Most elementally, the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the [[subduction]] processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable [[platform (geology)|platforms]] and [[shield (geology)|shields]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Pista de esquí de Chacaltaya Bolivia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chacaltaya]] Ski Resort, [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz Department]]]]
The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one eco-region to the other, from the tropics in the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' to a [[polar climate]] in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, [[atmospheric pressure]] and evaporation, yielding very different climates in different areas. When the climatological phenomenon known as ''[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308110026/http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2005 |title=Fortalecimiento de las Capacidades locales para enfrentar El Fenómeno del Niño en Perú y Bolivia |publisher=itdg.org.pe |format=PDF |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001813/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Deja 56 muertos "El Niño" en Bolivia |publisher=elfinanciero.com.mx |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place, it causes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows in the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more common. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.
*''Llanos''. A [[Humidity|humid]] [[tropical climate]] with an average temperature of {{convert|25|°C|F}}. The wind coming from the [[Amazon rainforest]] causes significant rainfall. In May, there is low precipitation because of dry winds, and most days have clear skies. Even so, winds from the south, called ''surazos'', can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days.
*''[[Altiplano]]''. [[Desert climate|Desert]]-[[Polar climate|Polar]] climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C. At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above 0&amp;nbsp;°C, while during the day, the weather is dry and [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] is high. [[Ground frost]]s occur every month, and snow is frequent.
*Valleys and ''Yungas''. [[Temperateness|Temperate]] climate. The humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains, making this region very humid and rainy. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Snow occurs at altitudes of {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.
*''[[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]''. [[Subtropics|Subtropical]] [[semi-arid climate]]. Rainy and humid in January and the rest of the year, with warm days and cool nights.

=== Biodiversity ===
Bolivia, with an enormous variety of [[organism]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, is part of the "[[Megadiverse countries#Cancún initiative and declaration of like-minded megadiverse countries|Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.biosafetyclearinghouse.net/actividades/2009/grouplmmc.pdf|title=LIKE MINDED MEGADIVERSE COUNTRIES|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivia's variable altitudes, ranging from {{convert|90|-|6542|m|ft}} above sea level, allow for a vast biologic diversity. The territory of Bolivia comprises four types of [[biome]]s, 32 ecological regions, and 199 ecosystems. Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves such as the [[Noel Kempff Mercado National Park]], the [[Madidi National Park]], the [[Tunari National Park]], the [[Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve]], and the [[Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area]], among others.

Bolivia boasts over 17,000 species of seed plants, including over 1,200 species of [[fern]], 1,500 species of ''[[marchantiophyta]]'' and [[moss]], and at least 800 species of [[fungus]]. In addition, there are more than 3,000 species of [[medicinal plant]]s. Bolivia is considered the place of origin for such species as [[Capsicum pubescens|peppers]] and [[Capsicum|chili peppers]], [[peanut]]s, the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common bean]]s, [[Cassava|yucca]], and several species of palm. Bolivia also naturally produces over 4,000 kinds of [[potato]]es.

Bolivia has more than 2,900 animal species, including 398 mammals, over 1,400 birds (about 14% of birds known in the world, being the sixth most diverse country in terms of bird species)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bolivia.com/noticias/Autonoticias/DetalleNoticia40938.asp | title=Bolivia es el Sexto País con la Mayor Cantidad de Especies de Aves en el Mundo |trans-title=Bolivia is the Sixth Country with the Highest Number of Bird Species in the World | language=Spanish | publisher=Bolivia.com | date=10 June 2009 | accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}, 204 [[amphibian]]s, 277 [[reptile]]s, and 635 fish, all [[fresh water]] fish as Bolivia is a [[landlocked country]].

== Politics and government ==
{{Main|Politics of Bolivia|Foreign relations of Bolivia}}

[[File:LaPaz Plaza Pedro Di Murillo 10.2004.jpg|thumb|The government building of the [[National Congress of Bolivia]] at the Plaza Murillo in central [[La Paz]]]]

Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982; prior to that, it was governed by various dictatorships. Presidents [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] (1982–85) and [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.

Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is [[Evo Morales]], the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' [[Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples]] party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]], drafted in 2006–07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.

The executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.&lt;ref name="presidencia.gob.bo"/&gt;

The ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The ''Cámara de Diputados'' (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts (''circunscripciones''), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments.&lt;!-- 70 + 60 + 7 = 137. Can someone clarify how National Congress has 130 members while, appearently, 137 is elected --&gt; The ''Cámara de Senadores'' (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department). Members of the Assembly are elected to five-year terms. The body has its headquarters on the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, but also holds honorary sessions elsewhere in Bolivia. The Vice President serves as titular head of the combined Assembly.

[[File:Supremecourtbolivia.jpg|thumb|The Supreme Court Building in the capital of Bolivia, [[Sucre]]]]

The judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]], the Constitutional Tribunal, the Judiciary Council, Agrarian and Environmental Tribunal, and District (departmental) and lower courts. In October 2011, Bolivia held its first judicial elections to choose members of the national courts by popular vote, a reform brought about by Evo Morales.

The [[Plurinational Electoral Organ]] is an independent branch of government which replaced the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral | work = La Jornada | accessdate = 28 April 2011 | date = 16 August 2010 | url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121138/http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1# | archive-date = 13 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections were the country's first [[Bolivian judicial election, 2011|judicial election]] in October 2011, and five municipal special elections held in 2011.

=== Capital ===
Bolivia has its constitutionally recognized capital in Sucre, while La Paz is the seat of government. La Plata (now Sucre) was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Alto Perú (later, Bolivia) on 1 July 1826.&lt;ref name=DicGeo&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Impr. "Bolívar" de M. Pizarro | last="Sucre." | first = Sociedad Geográfica | title = Diccionario geográfico del Departamento de Chuquisaca: contiene datos geográficos, históricos y estadisticos | year = 1903 | pages = 296–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1839, President [[José Miguel de Velasco]] proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader [[Antonio José de Sucre]].&lt;ref name=DicGeo /&gt; The Bolivian seat of government moved to [[La Paz]] at the start of the twentieth century, as a consequence of Sucre's relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of [[Potosí]] and its silver industry and of the Liberal Party in the War of 1899.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|2009 Constitution]] assigns the role of national capital to Sucre, not referring to La Paz in the text.&lt;ref name="presidencia.gob.bo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619201729/http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2009 |work=Nueva Constitución Política del Estado |page=4 |quote=I. Sucre is the Capital of Bolivia." |title=Political Constitution of the State, First Part, Title I, Chapter One: Model of State |format=PDF |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the constitutional capital, the Supreme Court of Bolivia is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. Nonetheless, the [[Palacio Quemado]] (the Presidential Palace and seat of Bolivian [[Executive (government)|executive power]]) is located in La Paz, as are the National Congress and Plurinational Electoral Organ. La Paz thus continues to be the seat of government.

=== Law and crime ===
{{Main|Crime in Bolivia}}
There are 53 [[prisons in Bolivia]], which incarcerate around 8,700 people {{As of|2010|lc=y}}. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate ({{lang-es|Dirección de Régimen Penintenciario|links=no}}). There are 17 prisons in [[Departments of Bolivia|departmental]] capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/advocacy/prisons/americas2.htm|title=Human Rights Watch - Prison Conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign relations ===
Despite losing its maritime coast, the so-called [[Litoral Department]], after the [[War of the Pacific]], Bolivia has historically maintained, as a state policy, a maritime claim to that part of [[Chile]]; the claim asks for sovereign access to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and its maritime space. The issue has also been presented before the [[Organization of American States]]; in 1979, the OAS passed the ''426 Resolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oas.org/columbus/Bolivia.asp |title=Bolivia |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605114445/http://www.oas.org/columbus/Bolivia.asp |archive-date=5 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through [[Antofagasta]], and freed the payment of export rights in the port of [[Arica]]. In October 1904, the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] was signed, and Chile agreed to build a [[Arica–La Paz railway|railway between Arica and La Paz]], to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports.

The ''Special Economical Zone for Bolivia in Ilo'' (ZEEBI) is a special economic area of {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} of maritime coast, and a total extension of {{convert|358|ha|lk=in|abbr=out}}, called Mar Bolivia ("Sea Bolivia"), where Bolivia may maintain a free port near [[Ilo, Peru|Ilo]], [[Peru]] under its administration and operation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=-17.739531&amp;lon=-71.258011&amp;z=14&amp;l=3&amp;m=a&amp;v=2|title=Satellite view in Wikimapia of ''Bolivia Mar'', near the Peruvian town of Ilo|publisher=Wikimapia|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}} for a period of 99 years starting in 1992; once that time has passed, all the construction and territory revert to the Peruvian government. Since 1964, Bolivia has had its own port facilities in the ''Bolivian Free Port'' in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario, Argentina]]. This port is located on the [[Paraná River]], which is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

The dispute with Chile was taken to the [[International Court of Justice]]. The court ruled in support of the Chilean position, and declared that although Chile may have held talks about a Bolivian corridor to the sea, the country was not required to actually negotiate one or to surrender its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-chile-worldcourt/world-court-chile-not-forced-to-negotiate-over-bolivia-sea-access-idUSKCN1MB2YR|title= World Court: Chile not forced to negotiate over Bolivia sea access|author= Stephanie van den Berg, Aislinn Laing|date= October 1, 2018|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===

The [[Military of Bolivia|Bolivian military]] comprises three branches: [[Bolivian Army|Ejército (Army)]], [[Bolivian Naval Force|Naval (Navy)]] and [[Bolivian Air Force|Fuerza Aérea (Air Force)]]. The legal age for voluntary admissions is 18; however, when the numbers are small the government recruits anyone as young as 14.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; The [[tour of duty]] is generally 12 months. The Bolivian government annually spends $130&amp;nbsp;million on defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolivia Military Profile 2006|year=2006 |publisher=Index Mundi |url=http://indexmundi.com/bolivia/military_profile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolivian army has around 31,500 men. There are six military regions (''regiones militares''—RMs) in the army. The army is organized into ten divisions.

Although it is landlocked Bolivia keeps a navy. The [[Bolivian Naval Force]] (''Fuerza Naval Boliviana'' in Spanish) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bolivia's landlocked sailors pine for the high seas | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bolivian Air Force]] ('Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' or 'FAB') has nine air bases, located at La Paz, Cochabamba, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], [[Puerto Suárez]], [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]], [[Villamontes]], [[Cobija]], [[Riberalta]], and [[Roboré]].

== Administrative divisions ==

{{Main|Departments of Bolivia|Provinces of Bolivia|Municipalities of Bolivia|Cantons of Bolivia|Native Community Lands}}

Bolivia has nine departments—[[Pando Department|Pando]], [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]].

According to what is established by the Bolivian Political Constitution, the Law of Autonomies and Decentralization regulates de procedure for the elaboration of Statutes of Autonomy, the transfer and distribution of direct competences between the central government and the autonomous entities.&lt;ref&gt;Political Constitution of Bolivia, Article 271&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four levels of decentralization: Departmental government, constituted by the ''Departmental Assembly'', with rights over the legislation of the department. The [[governor]] is chosen by [[universal suffrage]]. Municipal government, constituted by a ''Municipal Council'', with rights over the legislation of the municipality. The [[mayor]] is chosen by universal suffrage. Regional government, formed by several provinces or municipalities of geographical continuity within a department. It is constituted by a ''Regional Assembly''. Original indigenous government, [[self-governance]] of original indigenous people on the ancient territories where they live.

[[File:Edificios_de_la_paz_en_Cotahuma.png|thumb|right|La Paz, Bolivia]]
Bolivia's estimated 2012 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $27.43 billion at official exchange rate and $56.14 billion at purchasing power parity. Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/bolivian-economy-during-morales-administration/|title=Bolivia: The Economy During the Morales Administration|date=December 2009|author1=Weisbrot, Mark |author2=Ray, Rebecca |author3=Johnston, Jake  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=CEPR – Center for Economic and Policy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; A surplus budget of 1.7% (GDP) was obtained by 2012, the government runs surpluses since Morales administration reflecting a prudent economic management.

A major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crabtree | first=J. |author2=Buffy, G. |author3=Pearce, J. | title=The Great Tin Crash: Bolivia and the World Tin Market | journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=174–175 |year=1988 | doi=10.2307/3338459 | publisher=Bulletin of Latin American Research, Vol. 7, No. 1 | jstor=3338459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm#econ |title=Economy of Bolivia |publisher=US State Government |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miners at Work Potosi (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Young miners at work in [[Potosí]]]]

In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former president of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, [[Cochabamba]]. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests and rioting]] among those who could no longer afford clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hattam|first=Jennifer|title=Who Owns Water?|journal=Sierra|date=September 2001|volume=86|issue=5|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200109/lol1.asp|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/ |title=Leasing the Rain |publisher=PBS Frontline/World |date=June 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Bolivia has the second largest [[natural gas]] reserves in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7607158.stm |title=Anti-Morales protests hit Bolivia |publisher=BBC News |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has a long-term sales agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.

The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5.4 million [[cubic ton]]nes of [[lithium]], which represent 50%–70% of world reserves. However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called [[Salar de Uyuni]]), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7607624.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Bolivia's lithium mining dilemma | date=10 September 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sustainable extraction of lithium is attempted by the government. This project is carried out by the public company "Recursos Evaporíticos" subsidiary of COMIBOL.

Once Bolivia's government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance development projects and to pay the public staff. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign [[creditor]]s, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the [[Paris Club]] mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally good record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.

The income from tourism has become increasingly important. [[Tourism in Bolivia|Bolivia's tourist industry]] has grown gradually since about 1990.

=== Foreign-exchange reserves ===
The amount in reserve currencies and [[gold]] held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under [[Hugo Banzer Suarez]]'s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under [[Evo Morales]]' government.

{{See also|List of airlines of Bolivia|List of airports in Bolivia}}
[[File:Aviones de BoA en Cochabamba.jpg|thumb|[[Boliviana de Aviación]] (BoA) is a state-owned company and the country's largest airline. Two BoA Boeing 737-300s parked at [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]].]]
The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil—DGAC) formerly part of the FAB, administers a civil aeronautics school called the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (Instituto Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil—INAC), and two commercial air transport services TAM and TAB.

[[TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar]] (the Bolivian Military Airline) is an airline based in La Paz, Bolivia. It is the civilian wing of the 'Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' (the Bolivian Air Force), operating passenger services to remote towns and communities in the North and Northeast of Bolivia. TAM (a.k.a. TAM Group 71) has been a part of the FAB since 1945.

A similar airline serving the [[Beni Department]] with small planes is [[Línea Aérea Amaszonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amaszonas.com |title=Amaszonas |publisher=Amaszonas |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; using smaller planes than TAM.

Although a civil transport airline, [[TAB – Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos]], was created as a subsidiary company of the FAB in 1977. It is subordinate to the Air Transport Management (Gerencia de Transportes Aéreos) and is headed by an FAB general. TAB, a charter heavy cargo airline, links Bolivia with most countries of the [[Western Hemisphere]]; its inventory includes a fleet of Hercules C130 aircraft. TAB is headquartered adjacent to [[El Alto International Airport]]. TAB flies to Miami and [[Houston]], with a stop in [[Panama]].

The three largest, and main international airports in Bolivia are [[El Alto International Airport]] in La Paz, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] in Santa Cruz, and [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]] in Cochabamba.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia}}
Bolivias's drinking water and [[sanitation]] coverage has greatly improved since 1990 due to a considerable increase in sectoral investment. However, the country has the continent's lowest coverage levels and services are of low quality. Political and institutional instability have contributed to the weakening of the sector's institutions at the national and local levels.

Two concessions to foreign private companies in two of the three largest cities – [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] – were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to  strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.

According to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to  water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; "technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is "not consistent with the political change in the country"; "ambiguities in the social participation schemes"; a reduction in the quantity and 
quality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.&lt;ref name="PNSB"&gt;Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008–2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s. Coverage in urban areas is bigger than in rural ones.&lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ JMP 2010 Estimates for Bolivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110110338/http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ |date=10 November 2010 }}. The estimates are based on the Household Survey (2005), the Bolivia Democratic and Health Survey (2008) and other surveys.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the last two censuses carried out by the Bolivian National Statistics Institute ''(Instituto Nacional de Estadística'', INE), the population increased from 8,274,325 (from which 4,123,850 were men and 4,150,475 were women) in 2001 to 10,027,254 in 2012.&lt;ref name=Cen2012&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ine.gob.bo:8081/censo2012/PDF/resultadosCPV2012.pdf | title=Principales resultados del censo nacional de población y vivienda 2012 (CNPV 2012) – Estado plurinacional de Bolivia | publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) | date=July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209134921/http://www.ine.gob.bo:8081/censo2012/PDF/resultadosCPV2012.pdf | archivedate=9 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last fifty years the Bolivian population has tripled, reaching a population growth rate of 2.25%. The growth of the population in the inter-census periods (1950–1976 and 1976–1992) was approximately 2.05%, while between the last period, 1992–2001, it reached 2.74% annually.

Some 62.43% of Bolivians live in urban areas, while the remaining 37.57% in rural areas. The most part of the population (70%) is concentrated in the departments of [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]]. In the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] region the departments of La Paz and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] hold the largest percentage of population, in the valley region the largest percentage is held by the departments of Cochabamba and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], while in the Llanos region by Santa Cruz and [[Beni Department|Beni]]. At national level, the population density is 8.49, with variations marked between 0.8 ([[Pando Department]]) and 26.2 (Cochabamba Department).

The largest population center is located in the so-called "central axis" and in the Llanos region. Bolivia has a young population. According to the 2011 census, 59% of the population is between 15 and 59 years old, 39% is less than 15 years old. Almost 60% of the population is younger than 25 years of age.

=== Genetics ===
According to a genetic study done on Bolivians, average values of Native American, European and African ancestry are 86%, 12.5%, and 1.5%, in individuals from La Paz and 76.8%, 21.4%, and 1.8% in individuals from Chuquisaca; respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255957174_Ancestry_analysis_reveals_a_predominant_Native_American_component_with_moderate_European_admixture_in_Bolivians#pf3|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.05.012|title=Ancestry analysis reveals a predominant Native American component with moderate European admixture in Bolivians|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=7|issue=5|pages=537|year=2013|last1=Heinz|first1=Tanja|last2=Álvarez-Iglesias|first2=Vanesa|last3=Pardo-Seco|first3=Jacobo|last4=Taboada-Echalar|first4=Patricia|last5=Gómez-Carballa|first5=Alberto|last6=Torres-Balanza|first6=Antonio|last7=Rocabado|first7=Omar|last8=Carracedo|first8=Ángel|last9=Vullo|first9=Carlos|last10=Salas|first10=Antonio}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic and racial classifications ===
[[File:Macheteros.JPG|thumb|Bolivian Macheteros]]

The vast majority of Bolivians are  mestizo (with the indigenous component higher than the European one), although the government has not included culltural self-identification   "mestizo" in the  November 2012 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are approximately three dozen native groups totaling approximately half of the Bolivian population – the largest proportion of indigenous people in Latin America. Exact numbers vary based on the wording of the ethnicity question and the available response choices. For example, the 2001 census did not provide the racial category "mestizo" as a response choice, resulting in a much higher proportion of respondents identifying themselves as belonging to one of the available indigenous ethnicity choices. [[Mestizo]]s are distributed throughout the entire country and make up 26% of the Bolivian population. Most people assume their ''mestizo'' identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more indigenous cultures.  A 2018 estimate of racial classification put mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian) at 68%, indigenous at 20%, white at 5%, [[cholo]] at 2%, black at 1%, other at 4%, while 2% were unspecified; 44% attributed themselves to some indigenous group, predominantly the linguistic categories of [[Quechuas]] or [[Aymara people|Aymaras]].&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;  [[White people|Whites]] comprised about 14% of the population in 2006, and are usually concentrated in the largest cities: [[La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and [[Cochabamba]], but as well in some minor cities like [[Tarija]] and [[Sucre]]. The ancestry of Whites and the White ancestry of Mestizos lies within the continents of [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], most notably [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Croatia]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Bolivia|title=Immigration to Bolivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]], there are several dozen colonies of German-speaking [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites from Russia]] totaling around 40,000 inhabitants ({{As of|2012|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier |publisher=New York Times |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afro-Bolivian]]s, descendants of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] who arrived in the time of the [[Spanish Empire]], inhabit the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|department of La Paz]], and are located mainly in the provinces of [[Nor Yungas Province|Nor Yungas]] and [[Sud Yungas Province|Sud Yungas]]. Slavery was abolished in Bolivia in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Robert William |last2=Engerman|first2=Stanley L. |title=Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|year=1995|publisher=W W Norton &amp; Company Incorporated|isbn=978-0-393-31218-8|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also important communities of [[Japanese Bolivians|Japanese]] (14.000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/bolivia/data.html|title=ボリビア多民族国（The Plurinational State of Bolivia）|website=外務省}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] (12.900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution/ |title=Geographical Distribution of the Lebanese Diaspora |work=The Identity Chef}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], also called ''"originarios"'' ("native" or "original") and less frequently, ''Amerindians'', could be categorized by geographic area, such as [[Andes|Andean]], like the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] (who formed the ancient [[Inca Empire]]), who are concentrated in the western departments of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. There also are ethnic populations in the east, composed of the [[Chiquitano]], [[Chané]], [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and [[Moxo]]s, among others, who inhabit the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] and [[Pando Department|Pando]].

There are small numbers of European citizens from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], as well as from other American countries, as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], the [[United States]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]], among others. There are important [[Peru]]vian colonies in [[La Paz]], [[El Alto]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].

==== Indigenous peoples ====
The [[Indigenous peoples of Bolivia]] can be divided into two categories of ethnic groups: the Andeans, who are located in the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] and the valley region; and the lowland groups, who inhabit the warm regions of central and eastern Bolivia, including the valleys of Cochabamba Department, the Amazon Basin areas of northern La Paz Department, and the lowland departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (including the [[Gran Chaco]] region in the southeast of the country). Large numbers of Andean peoples have also migrated to form Quechua, Aymara, and intercultural communities in the lowlands.

*'''Andean ethnicities'''
** [[Aymara people]]. They live on the high plateau of the departments of La Paz, Oruro and Potosí, as well as some small regions near the tropical flatlands.
** [[Quechua people]]. They mostly inhabit the valleys in [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. They also inhabit some mountain regions in [[Potosí Department|Potosí]] and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]]. They divide themselves into different Quechua nations, as the Tarabucos, Ucumaris, Chalchas, Chaquies, Yralipes, Tirinas, among others.
** [[Uru people]]
*'''Ethnicities of the Eastern Lowlands'''
** [[Guaraní people|Guaraníes]]: made up of Guarayos, Pausernas, [[Sirionó]]s, Chiriguanos, [[Wichí]], Chulipis, Taipetes, [[Toba people|Tobas]], and Yuquis.
**'''Tacanas''': made up of Lecos, Chimanes, Araonas, and Maropas.
**'''Panos''': made up of Chacobos, Caripunas, Sinabos, Capuibos, and Guacanaguas.
**'''Aruacos''': made up of Apolistas, Baures, [[Moxo people|Moxos]], [[Chané people|Chané]], Movimas, Cayabayas, Carabecas, and Paiconecas (Paucanacas).
**'''Chapacuras''': made up of Itenez (More), Chapacuras, Sansinonianos, Canichanas, Itonamas, Yuracares, Guatoses, and [[Chiquitano]]s.
**'''Botocudos''': made up of Bororos and Otuquis.
**'''Zamucos''': made up of [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreos]].

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of Bolivia}}

[[File:Pueblos originarios de Bolivia.png|thumb|left|Geographic distribution of the indigenous languages of Bolivia]]
Bolivia has great linguistic diversity as a result of its [[multiculturalism]]. The [[Constitution of Bolivia]] recognizes 36 official languages besides [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Araona language|Araona]], [[Baure language|Baure]], [[Bésiro language|Bésiro]], [[Canichana language|Canichana]], [[Cavineño language|Cavineño]], [[Cayubaba language|Cayubaba]], [[Chácobo language|Chácobo]], [[Chimán language|Chimán]], [[Ese Ejja language|Ese Ejja]], [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], [[Guarasuawe language|Guarasu'we]], [[Guarayu language|Guarayu]], [[Itonama language|Itonama]], [[Leco language|Leco]], [[Machajuyai-Kallawaya]], [[Machineri language|Machineri]], [[Maropa language|Maropa]], [[Mojeño-Ignaciano]], [[Mojeño-Trinitario]], [[Moré language (Bolivia)|Moré]], [[Mosetén language|Mosetén]], [[Movima language|Movima]], [[Pacawara language|Pacawara]], [[Puquina language|Puquina]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Sirionó language|Sirionó]], [[Tacana language|Tacana]], [[Tapieté language|Tapieté]], [[Toromona language|Toromona]], [[Uru-Chipaya]], [[Weenhayek language|Weenhayek]], [[Yaminawa language|Yaminawa]], [[Yuki language (Bolivia)|Yuki]], [[Yuracaré language|Yuracaré]], and [[Zamuco language|Zamuco]].&lt;ref name="languages"/&gt;

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most spoken official language in the country, according to the 2001 census; as it is spoken by two-thirds of the population. All legal and official documents issued by the State, including the Constitution, the main private and public institutions, the media, and commercial activities, are in Spanish.

The main indigenous languages are: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] (21.2% of the population in the 2001 census), [[Aymara language|Aymara]] (14.6%), [[Guarani language|Guarani]] (0.6%) and others (0.4%) including the [[Moxos language|Moxos]] in the department of Beni.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

[[Plautdietsch]], a [[German dialects|German dialect]], is spoken by about 70,000 [[Mennonites in Bolivia|Mennonite]]s in [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]]. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken mainly in the areas close to [[Brazil]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Bolivia}}

Bolivia is a constitutionally [[secular state]] that guarantees the [[freedom of religion]] and the independence of government from religion.&lt;ref name="Constitute Assembly of Bolivia 2007 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Constitute Assembly of Bolivia|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2001 [[census]] conducted by the [[National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia]], 78% of the population is [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], followed by 19% [[Protestant]], and small number of Bolivians that are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and 3% non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90243.htm |title=Bolivia religion | publisher= Department of State | location = USA | date= 14 September 2007 | accessdate =30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://institutointerglobal.org/ateismo/1545-ateos-en-numeros|title=Ateos en números|publisher=InterGlobal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205041006/http://institutointerglobal.org/ateismo/1545-ateos-en-numeros|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on the World Christian Database) records that in 2010, 92.5% of Bolivians identified as [[Christianity|Christian]] (of any denomination), 3.1% identified with indigenous religion, 2.2% identified as [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], 1.9% identified as [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and all other groups constituted 0.1% or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia: Adherents|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_27_2.asp|website=The Association of Religious Data Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the indigenous population adheres to different traditional beliefs marked by [[inculturation]] or [[Syncretic|syncretisim]] with Christianity. The cult of [[Pachamama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catamarcaguia.com.ar/Cultura/Pachamama.php |title=Pachamama y los Dioses Incaicos |publisher=Catamarcaguia.com.ar |accessdate=14 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013359/http://www.catamarcaguia.com.ar/Cultura/Pachamama.php |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Mother Earth", is notable. The veneration of the [[Virgen de Copacabana|Virgin of Copacabana]], Virgin of Urkupiña and Virgin of Socavón, is also an important feature. There also are important [[Aymara people|Aymaran communities]] near [[Lake Titicaca]] that have a strong devotion to [[James, son of Zebedee|James the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolivia.com/Noticias/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia32134.asp|publisher=Bolivia.com|title=El Tata Santiago, un santo en Guaqui con vena de general}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deities worshiped in Bolivia include [[Ekeko]], the Aymaran god of abundance and prosperity, whose day is celebrated every 24 January, and [[Guarani mythology|Tupá]], a god of the [[Guaraní people]].

=== Largest cities and towns ===
Approximately 67% of Bolivians live in urban areas,&lt;ref name="factbook" /&gt; among the lowest proportion in South America. Nevertheless, the rate of urbanization is growing steadily, at around 2.5% annually. According to the 2012 census, there are total of 3,158,691 households in Bolivia – an increase of 887,960 from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia|2012|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 75.4% of homes were classified as a house, hut, or Pahuichi; 3.3% were apartments; 21.1% were rental residences; and 0.1% were [[mobile home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ine.gob.bo/indicadoresddhh/vivi4.asp | title=Bolivia: Hogares por Tipo y Tenencia de la Vivienda, Según Área Geográfica, 2000 – 2009 |trans-title=Bolivia: Households by Type and Tenure, According to Geographic Area, 2000 – 2009 | publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia]] | accessdate=28 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183010/http://www.ine.gob.bo/indicadoresddhh/vivi4.asp | archivedate=13 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the country's largest cities are located in the highlands of the west and central regions.

Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Quechua, the Aymara, as well as the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.

The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important [[archaeology|archaeological]] ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[ceramic]]s, and [[weaving]]s remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]], [[Inkallaqta]] and [[Iskanawaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.&lt;ref name="BackgroundNote"&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Note: Bolivia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm |accessdate=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and [[artisan]]s, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque". The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Pérez de Holguín, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.&lt;ref name="BackgroundNote"/&gt;

Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Roberto Mamani Mamani]], [[Alejandro Mario Yllanes]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]].

Bolivia has a rich [[folklore]]. Its regional [[folk music]] is distinctive and varied. The "devil dances" at the annual carnival of Oruro are one of the great folkloric events of South America, as is the lesser known carnival at [[Tarabuco]].&lt;ref name="BackgroundNote"/&gt;
The best known of the various festivals found in the country is the "[[Carnaval de Oruro]]", which was among the first 19 "Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity", as proclaimed by UNESCO in May 2001.

Entertainment includes [[association football|football]].{{citation needed|reason=the statement provides no useful information without specific information about the sport's popularity|date=December 2016}}

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Bolivia}}

In 2008, following [[UNESCO]] standards, Bolivia was declared free of illiteracy, making it the fourth country in South America to attain this status.&lt;ref name="literacyBBC"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7794293.stm | title=Bolivia Declares Literacy Success | newspaper=[[BBC News]] | date=21 December 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivia has public and private universities. Among them: Universidad Mayor, Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca USFX – Sucre, founded in 1624; [[Universidad Mayor de San Andrés]] UMSA – La Paz, founded in 1830; [[Universidad Mayor de San Simon]] UMSS – Cochabamba, founded in 1832; [[Universidad Autónoma Gabriel René Moreno]] UAGRM – Santa Cruz de la Sierra, founded in 1880; [[Universidad Técnica de Oruro]] UTO – Oruro, founded in 1892; and [[Universidad Autónoma Tomás Frías]] UATF – Potosi, founded in 1892.

In 2017, Bolivia is the first country in South America in terms of funds dedicated to public education and is the second in Latin America, after Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Bolivia-1st-in-Education-Investment-in-South-America-Report-20171024-0018.html|title=Bolivia 1st in Education Investment in South America: Report|first=teleSUR /|last=cg-RSF-rg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camp Goodwin''', and '''Fort Goodwin''', a historical [[locale (geographic)|locale]], at an elevation of 2648 feet, located in [[Graham County, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

==History==

Camp Goodwin, then Fort Goodwin, was constructed in June 1864 by the [[California Volunteers]], of the [[Union Army]] in [[Arizona Territory]] for a base for prosecuting the [[Apache Wars|1861-1872 Apache War]] and protecting settlers in the Upper [[Gila River]] region.  It was named for [[Arizona]]'s first territorial governor, [[John N. Goodwin]].  The adobe buildings it was constructed with began to crumble in a few years due to poor construction.  Additionally the camp was plagued by [[malaria]] from [[mosquitoes]] in the cienega fed by the nearby spring from which the fort obtained its water.  Called Camp Goodwin again from 1866, the camp was abandoned by the Army in March, 1871 due to the illness caused by malaria.

The camp was subsequently used as a subagency of the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] until about 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Granger, Byrd H. '''Arizona Place Names'''. Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 1982, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the site is located on farmland not far from the ghost town of [[Geronimo, Arizona|Geronimo]].  Nothing remains of the post, the only physical marker is a [[Bureau of Land Management]] survey marker which indicates the original site of its flagpole.

[[File:Goodhope2.jpg|thumb|300px|Cape Point in the left foreground, with the [[Cape of Good Hope]] almost right behind and some 2.3 km away]]
[[File:Cape Point, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-23, DD 109-111 PAN.jpg|thumb|300px|Looking from behind the old lighthouse (at top left) to the new lighthouse (a sunlit speck of white very near the point). The lighthouses are 700 metres apart, and the new lighthouse 162 metres lower in altitude so as to remain visible during low cloud.]]
'''Cape Point''' is a [[promontory]] at the southeast corner of the [[Cape Peninsula]], which is a mountainous and scenic landform that runs north-south for about thirty kilometres at the extreme southwestern tip of the [[Africa]]n continent in the Republic of [[South Africa]]. [[Table Mountain]] and the city of [[Cape Town]] are close to the northern extremity of the same peninsula. The cape is located at {{coord|34|21|26|S|18|29|51|E|display=inline,title|region:ZA_type:landmark}}, about 2.3&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1.4&amp;nbsp;mi) east and a little north of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on the southwest corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sagns.dac.gov.za/intranet/ApplicationMap.asp?MapState=-34357222|18497500|40000&amp;buttonCommand=ZoomIn&amp;mapFromApp= Topo map of Cape Point]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, from the South African Geographical Names System&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these two rocky capes are very well known, neither cape is actually the southernmost point of the mainland of Africa; that is [[Cape Agulhas]], approximately {{convert|150|km}} to the [[east-southeast]]. Cape point is closed on [[Christmas]], the [[Day of Goodwill]] and [[New Year’s Day]]. Opening times are from 6:00-18:00.

==Peaks==
The peak above Cape Point is higher than that above the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The rugged sandstone ([[Cape Peninsula#Geology|Table Mountain sandstone]]) ridge that rises from Cape Point at sea level develops into two peaks. There is a major peak that dominates the skyline locally but there is also a smaller peak about 100 m (328 ft) further south. The higher peak has the old [[lighthouse]] on the top. The [[Flying Dutchman Funicular]] runs from a car park to the north up to slightly below the level of the old lighthouse and a short flight of steps leads to a viewing platform around the base of the lighthouse. From the end of the railway a second path leads to the lower peak.

==Lighthouse==
[[File:Cape Peninsula.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of the Cape Peninsula showing its major features. Cape Point is the small cape jutting out towards the east from [[The Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern end of the Peninsula. The lighthouse is on Cape Point, rather than on the Cape of Good Hope to the west.]]
The new lighthouse is at a lower elevation (87 meters; 285.5 feet above [[sea level]]), for two reasons: the old lighthouse, located at {{coord|34|21|12|S|18|29|25.2|E|type:isle_region:ZA}} (262 meters; 859.6 feet above sea level), could be seen 'too early' by ships rounding the point towards the east, causing them to approach too closely. Secondly, foggy conditions often prevail at the higher levels, making the older lighthouse invisible to shipping. On 18 April 1911, the Portuguese liner ''[[SS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' was wrecked just south of Cape Point at {{coord|34|23|22|S|18|29|23|E|type:isle_region:ZA}} on Bellows Rock for precisely this reason, prompting the relocation of the lighthouse.  

The new lighthouse, located at {{coord|34|21|26|S|18|29|49|E|type:isle_region:ZA}}, cannot be seen from the West until ships are at a safe distance to the South. The light of the new Cape Point lighthouse is the most powerful on the South African coast, with a range of {{convert|63|mi|km nmi}} and an intensity of 10 [[megacandela]]s in each flash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/cape-point.htm ''Cape Point Attractions: Cape Point, Cape Town, South Africa''], from South Africa Explored&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facts==
[[File:Benguela and Agulhas Currents 2.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|The courses of the  warm [[Agulhas current]] (red) along the east coast of South Africa, and the cold [[Benguela current]] (blue) along the west coast. Note that the Benguela current does not originate from Antarctic waters in the South Atlantic Ocean, but from [[upwelling]] of water from the cold depths of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] against the west coast of the continent. The two currents do not "meet" anywhere along the south coast of Africa, except as random eddies from the two currents, that arise and intermingle west of [[Cape Agulhas]].]]
Cape Point is situated within the [[Table Mountain National Park]], within a section of the park referred to as Cape of Good Hope. This section covers the whole of the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula and which takes in perhaps 20% of its total area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/tourism/map.php Map of the park, showing the Cape Point section.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape of Good Hope section of the park is generally wild, unspoiled and undeveloped and is an important haven for seabirds. The vegetation at Cape Point consists primarily of [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]].

Cape Point is often mistakenly claimed to be the place where the cold [[Benguela Current]] of the Atlantic Ocean and the warm [[Agulhas Current]] of the Indian Ocean collide. In fact, the meeting point fluctuates along the southern and southwestern Cape coast, usually occurring between [[Cape Agulhas]] and Cape Point. The two intermingling currents help to create the [[micro-climate]] of [[Cape Town]] and its environs. Contrary to popular mythology, the meeting point of the currents produces no obvious visual effect; there is no "line in the ocean" where the sea changes colour or looks different in some way. There are, however, strong and dangerous swells, tides and localized currents around the point and in adjacent waters. These troubled seas have witnessed countless maritime disasters in the centuries since ships first sailed here. 

Fishing is good along the coast but the unpredictable swells make angling from the rocks very dangerous. Over the years scores of fishermen have been swept to their deaths from the rocky platforms by freak waves. [[False Bay]], which opens to the east and north of Cape Point, is the location of the well-known naval port of [[Simon's Town]]. The bay is also famous – or infamous – for its great white sharks, which hunt the [[Cape fur seal]]s that live in the area.

==Climate research==
Cape Point is the site of one of the [[Global Atmosphere Watch]]'s atmospheric research stations. In the early years of the 20th century icebergs from [[Antarctica]] were occasionally sighted from Cape Point. There have been no authentic recent sightings of ice, which some climatologists and experts have attributed to [[global warming]].

[[Image:Chwe Chenedl Geltaidd.png|thumb|280px|&lt;center&gt;The six ''Celtic nations'' within their modern borders are shown in yellow&lt;/center&gt;]]

The modern '''Celts''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɛ|l|t|s|}}, see [[Names of the Celts#Pronunciation|pronunciation of ''Celt'']]) are a related group of [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] who share similar [[Celtic languages]], cultures and artistic histories, and who live in or descend from one of the [[Celtic nations|regions]] on the western extremities of [[Europe]] populated by the [[Celts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/44666-history-of-the-celts.html|title=History of the Celts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/celtic|title=Celtic Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern Celtic identity emerged in [[Western Europe]] following the identification of the native peoples of the Atlantic fringe as Celts by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in the 18th century. Lhuyd and others equated the Celts described by [[Greco-Roman]] writers with the pre-Roman peoples of [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. They categorised the ancient Irish and British languages as [[Celtic languages]]. The descendants of these ancient languages are the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] ([[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] variants) and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] variants) languages, and the people who speak them are considered modern Celts. 

The concept of modern Celtic identity evolved during the course of the 19th century into the [[Celtic Revival]]. By the late 19th century, it often took the form of [[ethnic nationalism]], particularly within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], where the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]] resulted in the secession of the [[Irish Free State]], in 1922. There were also significant [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh]], [[Scottish nationalism|Scottish]] and [[Breton nationalist]] movements, giving rise to the concept of [[Celtic nations]]. After [[World War II]], the focus of the Celtic movement shifted to [[linguistic revival]] and [[linguistic protectionism|protectionism]], e.g. with the foundation of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] in 1961, dedicated to preserving the surviving [[Celtic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celtic League&amp;nbsp;– About us|url=http://www.celticleague.net/about-us/|website=Celticleague.net|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtic revival also led to the emergence of [[Celtic music|musical]] and [[Celtic art#Celtic revival|artistic styles]] identified as Celtic. Music typically drew on folk traditions within the Celtic nations. Art drew on decorative styles associated with the ancient Celts and with early medieval [[Celtic Christianity]], along with folk-styles. Cultural events to promote "inter-Celtic" cultural exchange also emerged.

In the late 20th century some authors criticised the idea of modern Celtic identity, usually by downplaying the value of the linguistic component in defining culture and cultural connection, sometimes also arguing that there never was a common Celtic culture, even in ancient times. These authors usually opposed language preservation efforts. Malcolm Chapman's 1992 book ''The Celts: The Construction of a Myth'' led to what the archaeologist, [[Barry Cunliffe]] has called a "politically correct disdain for the use of 'Celt'"&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Traditionally, the essential defining criterion of Celticity is seen as ''peoples and countries that do, or once did, use Celtic languages'' and it is asserted that an index of connectedness to the [[Celtic languages]] has to be borne in mind before branching out into other cultural domains.&lt;ref name=KochDef&gt;{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John T.

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the term ''Celtic'' has been applied to a wide variety of peoples and cultural traits present and past. Today, ''Celtic'' is often used to describe people of the [[Celtic nations]] (the [[Bretons]], the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], the [[Irish people|Irish]], the [[Manx people|Manx]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]]) and their respective cultures and languages.&lt;ref name="Amgueddfa 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts? ...

By the same token, the Bretons have been subject to strong [[Frenchification]] since the [[Early Modern period]], and can similarly be described as participating in a Franco-Celtic macro-culture.

Less common is the assumption of ''Celticity'' for European cultures deriving from [[Continental Celtic]] roots ([[Gauls]] or [[Celtiberians]]). These were either Romanised or Germanised much earlier, before the Early Middle Ages. Nevertheless, ''Celtic'' origins are many times implied for continental groups such as the [[Asturian people|Asturians]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], Northern [[Italians]], [[Belgians]]&lt;ref name=thecelts&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Nora|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Austrians]].

'Celt' has been adopted as a label of self-identification by a variety of peoples at different times. 'Celticity' can refer to the inferred links between them.

During the 19th century, French nationalists gave a privileged significance to their descent from the [[Gauls]]. The struggles of [[Vercingetorix]] were portrayed as a forerunner of the 19th-century struggles in defence of French nationalism, including the wars of both Napoleons ([[Napoleon I of France]] and [[Napoleon III of France]]). Basic French history textbooks emphasised the ways in which Gauls (''"Nos ancêtres les Gaulois..."'', 'our ancestors the Gauls') could be seen as an example of cultural assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Eugen (1991) "Gauls versus Franks: conflict and nationalism", in ''Nationhood and Nationalism in France'', edited by Robert Tombs. London: HarperCollins Academic; Dietler, Michael (1994) "'Our ancestors the Gauls': archaeology, ethnic nationalism, and the manipulation of Celtic identity in modern Europe", ''American Anthropologist'' 96:584–605.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Middle Ages, some French writers believed (incorrectly) that their language was primarily Celtic, rather than Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Rebecca.''Romance Languages''. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar use of ''Celticity'' for 19th-century nationalism was made in [[Switzerland]], when the Swiss were seen to originate in the Celtic tribe of the [[Helvetii]], a link still found in the official Latin name of Switzerland, ''Confœderatio Helvetica'', the source of the nation code CH and the name used on postage stamps (Helvetia).

Before the advance of [[Indo-European studies]], [[philology|philologists]] established that there was a relationship between the [[Goidelic]] and [[Brythonic languages]], as well as a relationship between these languages and the extinct Celtic languages such as [[Gaulish]], spoken in classical times. The terms Goidelic and Brythonic were first used to describe the two [[Celtic languages|Celtic language families]] by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in his 1707 study and, according to the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum Wales]], during that century "people who spoke Celtic languages were seen as Celts."&lt;ref name="Amgueddfa 1"/&gt;

At the same time, there was also a tendency to play up alternative heritages in the [[British Isles]] at certain times. For example, in the Isle of Man, in the [[Victorian era]], the ''[[Viking]]'' heritage was emphasised, and in Scotland, both Norse and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heritage was emphasised.

A [[Romanticism|romantic]] image of the Celt as [[noble savage]] was cultivated by the early [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]], [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], [[Lady Llanover]], [[James Macpherson]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Théodore Hersart de la Villemarqué]] and the many others influenced by them. This image coloured not only the English perception of their neighbours on the so-called "[[Celt belt|Celtic fringe]]" (compare the [[stage Irish]]man), but also [[Irish nationalism]] and its analogues in the other Celtic-speaking countries. Among the enduring products of this resurgence of interest in a romantic, pre-industrial, brooding, mystical Celticity are [[Gorsedd]]au, the revival of the [[Cornish language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of the Cornish language|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|publisher=Maga Kernow|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225172227/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|archivedate=25 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ellis|first=Peter Berresford|authorlink=Peter Berresford Ellis|title=The Story of the Cornish Language|year=2005|publisher=Tor Mark Press|isbn=0-85025-371-3|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the revival of the [[Gaelic games]].

==Contemporary Celtic identity==

The ''modern Celtic'' groups' distinctiveness as ''national'', as opposed to regional, minorities has been periodically recognised by major British newspapers. For example, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and said that they should be constitutionally recognised:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are ''distinctly national'' in ways which ''proud people from [[Yorkshire]]'', much less proud people from [[Berkshire]] will never know. Any new constitutional settlement ''which ignores these factors'' will be built on uneven ground.''&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', editorial, 8 May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Republic of Ireland, on surpassing [[UK|Britain]]'s GDP per capita in the 1990s for the first time, was given the moniker "[[Celtic tiger]]". Thanks in part to campaigning on the part of Cornish regionalists, [[Cornwall]] was able to obtain [[Objective One]] funding from the [[European Union]]. Scotland and Wales obtained agencies like the [[Welsh Development Agency]], and Scottish and Welsh Nationalists have recently supported the institution of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]]. More broadly, distinct identities in opposition to that of the metropolitan capitals have been forged and taken strong root.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}

These latter evolutions have proceeded hand in hand with the growth of a [[pan-Celticism|pan-Celtic]] or inter-Celtic dimension, seen in many organisations and festivals operating across various Celtic countries. Celtic studies departments at many universities in Europe and beyond, have studied the various ancient and modern Celtic languages and associated history and folklore under one roof.

Some of the most vibrant aspects of modern Celtic culture are music, song and festivals. Under the ''Music'', ''Festivals'' and ''Dance'' sections below, the richness of these aspects that have captured the world's attention are outlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticmp3s.com/things_celtic_music/Festivals_and_Pubs/|title=Things Celtic Music Directory : Festivals and Pubs|accessdate=9 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225184959/http://www.celticmp3s.com/things_celtic_music/Festivals_and_Pubs/|archivedate=25 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports such as [[Hurling]], [[Gaelic Football]] and [[Shinty]] are seen as being ''Celtic''.

The USA has also taken part in discussions of modern Celticity. For example, [[Virginia]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James H. Webb]], in his 2004 book ''[[Born Fighting|Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America]]'', controversially asserts that the early "pioneering" immigrants to North America were of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] origins. He goes on to argue that their distinct ''Celtic traits'' (loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and military readiness), in contrast to the ''[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]'' settlers, helped construct the modern ''American identity''. Irish Americans also played an important role in the shaping of 19th-century [[Irish republicanism]] through the [[Fenian]] movement and the development of view that the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Hunger]] was a British atrocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metress|first=Seamus|authorlink=Seamus Metress|title=The Great Starvation and British Imperialism in Ireland (University of Toledo)|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thorns/resources/Translations/iphunger.pdf|publisher=The Irish People|accessdate=12 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718083224/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thorns/resources/Translations/iphunger.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

V. S &amp; M. R.|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Dr [[Simon James (archaeologist)|Simon James]] of the University of Leicester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/james|title=Professor Simon James — University of Leicester|first=|last=tk74|website=2.le.ac.uk|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Antiquity'' article  "Celts, politics and motivation in archaeology" replied to Ruth and Vincent Megaw's article questioning the suitability of the term ''Celtic'' in the historic sense.&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Celts,+politics+and+motivation+in+archaeology.-a020632334|title=Celts, politics and motivation in archaeology.|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of his argument was that the Iron Age peoples of Britain should be considered not as generic Celts, but as a mosaic of different societies, each with their own traditions and histories.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;
Later in 1998, this line of reasoning came under criticism, being labelled an intellectual extension of modern British cultural colonialism, as well as for simplifying the anthropological correlation between material culture and ethnicity. Ruth and Vincent Megaw in the Antiquity article "The Mechanism of (Celtic) Dreams?': A Partial Response to Our Critics." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/'The+mechanism+of+(Celtic)+dreams?':+a+partial+response+to+our...-a020912892|title='The mechanism of (Celtic) dreams?': a partial response to our critics. - Free Online Library|website=Thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked 'Celt-sceptics' for being motivated by English nationalism or anxieties about the decline of British imperial power.

Simon James, in 1998, wrote a response arguing that the rejection of a Celtic past was not 'nationalist' but partly due to archaeological evidence, and usually by a post-colonial and multi-cultural agenda with recognition that Britain has always been home to multiple identities.&lt;ref name=jameswebpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/stj/furthread.htm|title=Simon James's Ancient Celts Page&amp;nbsp;– Further info|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Insular Celts have increasingly been seen as part of an Atlantic trading-networked culture speaking Celtic languages of the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] and probably earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf|title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix|website=Wales.ac.uk|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic nations==

{{Main|Celtic nations}}
Six nations tend to be most associated with a modern Celtic identity, and are considered 'the Celtic nations'.

:* [[Brittany]]
:* [[Ireland]]
:* [[Scotland]]
:* [[Wales]]
:* [[Isle of Man]]
:* [[Cornwall]]

It is these six nations that (alone) are considered Celtic by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] and the [[Celtic Congress]] amongst others.&lt;ref name="Celtic League 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticleague.net/

In the aforementioned six regions, Celtic languages have survived and continue to be used to varying degrees in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man, Cornwall and Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/Celtic_Languages.pdf |title=Visio-Map of Europe Celtic Europe.vsd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |format=PDF |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Celtic nomads: [[Irish Travellers]] called "Pavee" that speak a language called [[Shelta]] that is a creole of Irish Gaelic and other languages and [[Scottish Travellers#Indigenous Highland Travellers|Indigenous Highland Scottish Travellers]] called "Tinkers" who speak a language called [[Beurla Reagaird]] that is an [[acrolect]] of Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The last of the Tinsmiths: The Life of Willy MacPhee, by Shelia Douglas 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Queen's"&gt;Kirk, J. &amp; Ó Baoill, D. ''Travellers and their Language'' (2002)[[Queen's University Belfast]] {{ISBN|0-85389-832-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of activists on behalf of other regions/nations have also sought recognition as modern Celts, reflecting the wide diffusion of ancient Celts across Europe. Of these, the  most prominent are [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia / N. Portugal]], [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]].

A Celtic language did not survive in Galicia / Northern Portugal (together Gallaecia), Asturias nor Cantabria, and as such they fall outside of the [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] used by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], and the [[Celtic Congress]]. Nevertheless, many organisations organised around Celticity consider that [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] / Northern Portugal ([[Douro]], [[Minho Province|Minho]] and [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Tras-os-Montes]]) and [[Asturias]]  "can claim a Celtic cultural or historic heritage". These claims to Celticity are rooted in the long&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_11/gamito_6_11.pdf |title=The Celts in Portugal |format=PDF|website=4.uwm.edu |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; historical existence of Celts in these regions and ethnic connections to other Atlantic Celtic peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_5/alvarez_sanchis_6_5.pdf |title=Oppida and Celtic society in western Spain |format=PDF|website=4.uwm.edu |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.pdf |title=Briga Toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula |format=PDF|website=4.uwm.edu |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Celtiberians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Castro culture]]).

Elements of Celtic music, dance, and folklore can be found within England (e.g. [[Yan Tan Tethera]], [[Well dressing]], [[Halloween]]), and the [[Cumbric language]] survived until the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] in about 1018.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, S. R. (2004) ''History of Language''. Reaktion Books, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; England as a whole comprises many distinct regions, and some of these regions, such as [[Cumbria]], [[Lancashire]], and Western [[Yorkshire]] can claim more Celtic heritage than others.&lt;ref name=moffat1&gt;{{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Sea Kingdoms|year=2001|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-653243-8|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was claimed that revival of the [[Cumbric language]] was being attempted in the [[Cumberland]] area of England,&lt;ref name=lewiscarn&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lewis|first1= Colin|last2= |first2= |year= 2009|title= Cumbrian Welsh – an update|journal=[[Carn]]|volume= 144 |page= 10|url=http://www.celticleague.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/CARN-144-October-2009.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the idea that "Cumbric" was separate from Old [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has been criticised as stemming from the difficulty that many English historians have with accepting Old Welsh as the language once spoken all over England.&lt;ref name=moffat2&gt;{{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Sea Kingdoms|year=2001|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-653243-8|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested by Colin Lewis in [[Carn]] magazine that revivalists in the [[north of England]] use [[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]] to enable use of Welsh's existing rich cultural basis rather than having to "reinvent the wheel"&lt;ref name=lewiscarn/&gt; in much the same way as has been done successfully in [[Derbyshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Derby Welsh Learners Circle|url=http://derbywelshlearnerscircle.blogspot.com.au/|website=Derbywelshlearnerscircle.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; another area where elements of Celtic culture survive.&lt;ref name=moffat1/&gt;

Although they are not usually considered a Celtic nation, the [[Faroe Islands]] has a population with a large Celtic heritage in genetic terms.  Recent DNA analyses have revealed that Y chromosomes, tracing male descent, are 87% [[Scandinavia]]n.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The origin of the isolated population of the Faroe Islands investigated using Y chromosomal markers |first=Tove H. |last=Jorgensen |first2=Henriette N. |last2=Buttenschön |first3=August G. |last3=Wang |first4=Thomas D. |last4=Als |first5=Anders D. |last5=Børglum |first6=Henrik |last6=Ewald |year=2004 |journal=Human Genetics |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1117-7 |pmid=15083358}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[mitochondrial DNA]], tracing female descent, is 84% Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C.

The founder population of [[Iceland]] came from Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia: studies of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomes indicate that 62% of Icelanders' matrilineal ancestry derives from Scotland and Ireland (with most of the rest being from Scandinavia), while 75% of their patrilineal ancestry derives from Scandinavia (with most of the rest being from the Irish and British Isles). In addition, there are some areas of the accepted Celtic countries whose population are mostly not of Celtic heritage: for example, the [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]] and [[Shetland Islands]] in Scotland have a population of mostly Nordic descent.&lt;ref name="Goodacre"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodacre|first=S|author2=Helgason, A |author3=Nicholson, J |author4=Southam, L |author5=Ferguson, L |author6=Hickey, E |author7=Vega, E |author8=Stefánsson, K |author9=Ward, R |author10= Sykes, B |date=2005|title=Genetic evidence for a family-based Scandinavian settlement of Shetland and Orkney during the Viking periods|journal=Heredity|pmid=15815712|volume=95|issue=2|pages=129–135|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration from Celtic countries==
{{Main|Celtic diaspora (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Banniel Keltia.svg|thumb|right|The Pan-Celtic flag]]
A significant  portion of the populations of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is composed of people whose ancestors were from one of the "Celtic nations". This concerns the [[Irish diaspora]] most significantly (see also [[Irish American]]), but to a lesser extent also the [[Welsh diaspora]] and the [[Cornish diaspora]].

There are three areas outside Europe with communities of Celtic language speakers:
*the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] in [[Patagonia]] with Welsh-speaking [[Welsh Argentine]]s (known as ''[[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Y Wladfa]]'')
* [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia with [[Canadian Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Canadians]]
*southeast [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] with Irish-speaking [[Irish Canadians]].

The most common mother-tongue amongst the [[Fathers of Confederation]] which saw the formation of Canada was [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/flag-drapeau/defi-challenge/reponses-answers_e.cfm Ministry of Canadian Heritage]. Gaelic most common mother-tongue among Fathers of Confederation. URL accessed 26/04/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a movement in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] for a separate province in Canada, as espoused by the [[Cape Breton Labour Party]] and others.

In some former British colonies, or particular regions within them, the term [[Anglo-Celtic]] has emerged as a descriptor of an ethnic grouping. In particular, [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]] is a term comprising about 80% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003, "Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population"] (from ''Australian Social Trends, 2003'').

==Music==

[[Image:Gaiteiros em romaria galega.jpg|270px|Traditional Galician ''gaiteiros''|thumb]]
The claim that distinctly Celtic styles of music exist was made during the nineteenth century, and was associated with the revival of folk traditions and pan-Celtic ideology. The Welsh anthem "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]" was adopted as a pan-Celtic anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Loffler, Marion ''A Book of Mad Celts: John Wickens and the Celtic Congress of Caernarfon 1904'', Llandysul: Gomer Press, 2000, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are links between Scots Gaelic and Irish Gaelic folk musics, very different musical traditions existed in Wales and Brittany. Nevertheless, Gaelic styles were adopted as typically Celtic even by Breton revivalists such as [[Paul Ladmirault]].&lt;ref&gt;Bempéchat, Paul-André, ''Allons enfants de quelle patrie? Breton nationalism and the Impressionist aesthetic'', (Center for European Studies working papers).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Stivell 072707 Nuremberg 02.JPG|left|thumb|Breton harpist and Celtic music exponent [[Alan Stivell]] at Nuremberg, Germany, 2007]] 
Celticism came to be associated with the [[bagpipe]] and the [[harp]]. The harp is considered to be the national instrument of Wales and is used to accompany '''penillion''' singing (or '''[[cerdd dant]]''') where the harpist plays a melody and the singer sings in counterpoint to it.&lt;ref&gt;Brake, Julie &amp; Jones, Christine (2000) ''Welsh: a complete course in understanding speaking and writing''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[roots revival]], applied to [[Celtic music]], has brought much inter-Celtic cross-fertilisation, as, for instance, the revival by Welsh musicians of the use of the mediaeval Welsh [[bagpipe]] under the influence of the Breton ''binioù'', Irish ''uillean'' pipes and famous Scottish pipes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/#pipes|title=Celtic Music Instruments|publisher=Ceolas.org |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Scots have revived the ''bodhran'' from Irish influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/instruments/#bodhran |title=Celtic Music Instruments |publisher=Ceolas.org |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles le Goffic]] introduced the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|Scottish Highland pipes]] to Brittany.

Other traditional unaccompanied styles sung currently are [[Waulking song]] and Psalm singing or [[Lining out]] both from Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Boyd &amp; Taylor, Iain (1993) ''Gaelic: a complete course for beginners''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[folk-rock]] led to the creation of a popular music genre labelled [[Celtic music]] which "frequently involves the blending of traditional and modern forms, e.g. the Celtic-punk of [[The Pogues]], the ambient music of [[Enya]] ... the Celtic-rock of [[Runrig]], [[Rawlins Cross]] and [[Horslips]]."&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, Roy (2005) ''Popular Music: the key concepts'', Routledge; p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-Celtic music festivals were established, notably the [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] founded in 1971, which has occurred annually since.

Attitudes and customs associated with the routine of the year's work, religious beliefs and practices survived the coming of Christianity in the conservative rural areas of much of the Celtic countries.&lt;ref name=kruta2&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruta|first=Venceslas|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; All over these lands there were sacred places which had earned their status in pre-Christian times and which had only been gingerly adopted by the Christian church and given a garnish of Christian names or dedications, hills, stones, and especially wells which can still be seen festooned with rags in observance of an old ritual.&lt;ref name=kruta2/&gt;

'''Donji grad''' ({{IPA-sh|dôɲi grâd|pron}}, "Lower Town") is one of the 17 city districts of [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]]. It is located in the central part of the city and has 37,024 inhabitants (as of 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Croatian Census 2011|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/e01_01_01_cet/E01_01_01_zup21_cet.html|title=Population by Age and Sex, by Districts of City of Zagreb, 2011 Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the district is rarely used, for it is dubbed ''centar'' (center) by most Zagreb residents even though "centar" encompasses some southern parts of district [[Gornji Grad-Medveščak]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10308">A '''dot distribution map''', or '''dot density map''', is a [[map]] type that uses a [[wikt:dot|dot]] symbol to show the presence of a feature or a phenomenon. Dot maps rely on a visual [[Scatter plot|scatter]] to show spatial pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Education, Inc. "Key Terms." Making Maps With GIS. Pearson Education, Inc. 8 December 2009. http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_clarke_gsgis_4/7/1848/473320.cw/index.html. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of dot maps==

===One-to-one===
In a one-to-one dot map, each dot represents one single recording of a phenomenon. Because the location of the dot corresponds to only one piece of [[data]], care must be taken to ensure that the dot is represented in its correct spatial location. Inaccuracies in the location of the dot can misrepresent the data being mapped. Various methods exist for determining the exact spatial location of a single point, including [[geocoding]].{{citation needed|date = March 2013}}

===One-to-many===

[[File:Acres of Harvested Wheat in Illinois in 2012.pdf|thumb|Acres of Harvested Wheat in Illinois in 2012]]

In a one-to-many, or dot-density map, each dot on the map represents more than one of the phenomena being mapped. The number of data represented by each dot is determined by the map author and may be the product of data availability. Some data, such as the addresses of [[cancer]] patients, may not be available for mapping due to restrictions on access to individuals' [[medical record]]s.{{fact|date = March 2013}}

In one-to-many dot distribution maps, the reader must be careful not to interpret the dots as actual locations, as the dots represent [[aggregate data]] and are often arbitrarily placed on a map. Methods of dot placement include by areal unit centroid, [[Random distribution|random dispersement]], and uniform (evenly spaced) placement, among others.{{fact|date = March 2013}}

==Historical examples of dot distribution maps==

===''Carte philosophique figurant la population de la France''===
[[File:Carte Philosophique figurant la Population de la France.jpg|thumb|''Carte Philosophique figurant la Population de la France'']]
The first dot distribution map was created by a [[Franciscan]] [[monk]], Armand Joseph Frère de Montizon (1788 - ????).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Carte philosophique figurant la population de la France. | last1= Frère de Montizon | first1 = Armand Joseph | year = 1830}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively simple map of population by [[département]] (administrative district) in [[France]] and is one of the first known examples of a [[demographic map]] for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = La naissance de la démocartographie. Analyse historique et sémiologique | author = Gilles Palsky | author-link=Gilles Palsky | journal = Espace, populations, sociétés | volume = 2 | pages = 25–34 | year = 1984 | issn = 0755-7809 | url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/espos_0755-7809_1984_num_2_2_956 | doi=10.3406/espos.1984.956 | publisher = Université des Sciences et Technologies de Lille | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each dot represents 10,000 individuals. The dots are spaced in even rows, the distance between which determined by the population of the department. A table in the map lists the departments by name, population, and [[prefectural city]]. The departments were numbered on the map to correspond to the table. The regular spacing of the dots in the map produces a visual display of [[population density]], as higher population levels within an administrative border exhibit a closer, denser pattern of dots. Since the dots are evenly spaced, it is evident that they do not represent the actual locations of where people live within a department. This is an example of an [[ecological fallacy]], where a value for an area generalizes all within that area to exhibit that value.&lt;ref name="KonvitzJosef"&gt;Konvitz, Josef W. Cartography in France, 1660-1848: Science, Engineering, and Statecraft. University of Chicago Press, 1987. p.&amp;nbsp;147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Montizon's map was the first thematic dot map published, it did not garner the author fame. Instead, his innovation had no effect on practice for nearly 30 years until the dot distribution map was "reinvented" for map by a [[Swedish Army]] officer, published in 1859.&lt;ref name="KonvitzJosef" /&gt; This map was authored by Thure Alexander von Mentzer and shows the [[population distribution]] for the [[Scandinavia]]n region. No known reproductions of this map exist.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Zachary Forest. "Dot Density." The First Thematic Maps. N.p., 3 November 2009. http://indiemaps.com/blog/. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Snow's cholera map===
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|350px|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854. The pump is located at the intersection of Broad Street and Little Windmill Street.]]
Display of discrete data in the form of points in a map can provide convincing evidence related to [[medical geography]]. During the mid-1850s, [[cholera]] was a major concern. When a large outbreak occurred in [[London]] in 1854, Dr. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] created a dot distribution map that settled a debate between two schools of thought: that cholera is transmitted not through the inhalation of infected air, but through the ingestion of contaminated water or food.&lt;ref name="geography.about"&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. "Map Stops Cholera: John Snow's Map of London." About.com:Geography. N.p., 1 May 2010. http://geography.about.com/cs/medicalgeography/a/cholera.htm. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in London was simple and effective in its design. The base map is a simple road network, with few buildings named or depicted. Study area is outlined along the relevant road centerlines. [[Water pump]]s around the neighborhood are symbolized with points and bold, [[uppercase]] labels. Cholera deaths are depicted along the road network in their correct locations by address, with quantities measured by parallel tick marks stacked next to the road.&lt;ref&gt;Andreit. "Ghost Map (1854 Cholera Outbreak)." Umapper. 13 October 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.umapper.com/maps/view/id/43438/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022114348/http://www.umapper.com/maps/view/id/43438 |archivedate=2009-10-22 |df= }}. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbology, while simple, is effective for a study of fatal disease. The symbology of the cholera deaths is reminiscent of large [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] events, where bodies are stacked next to the roadway for disposal. However, Snow's work is derivative of [[Thomas Shapter]]'s work in [[Exeter]], Devon.

The map showed that a high number of deaths were occurring near a water pump on [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]] at Cambridge Street. Snow petitioned the local authorities to remove the pump's handle, which caused dramatic decreases in cholera cases for the immediate area.&lt;ref name="geography.about" /&gt; The map helped the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] of [[disease transmission]] supplant [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]] as the widely accepted view.

==Advantages and disadvantages of dot distribution maps==
Dot maps are advantageous when mapping phenomena that change smoothly over a space, as the dot maps will visually match the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Jeremy M. "Dot and Dasymetric Map Types." 31 March 2008. http://monarch.gsu.edu/jcrampton/courses/geog4518/notes/week_11bdot_dasy.html. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dot distribution maps also have disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that the actual dot placement may be random. That is, there may be no actual phenomenon where the dots are located. Second, the subjective nature of the dot size and spacing could give the map a [[bias]]ed view. Inappropriately sized or spaced dots can skew or distort the message a map attempts to communicate. If the dots are too numerous, it may be difficult for the reader to count the dots. This can cause the map to be ineffective in communicating its message.{{citation needed|date = March 2013}}

Solutions to problems in dot maps can be found through the combination of remotely sensed data. [[Satellite imagery]] showing lights at night can give good indication of population density. With such information, clustering of dots to relevant areas could possibly be applied to analyses. Data from the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s Landscan project is commonly used in this emerging technique.{{citation needed|date = March 2013}}

==Dot maps today==
A large portion of the new maps appearing today are generated not through [[Government agency|government agencies]] or geographical societies and associations, but by common individuals from all walks of life. Users of such [[virtual globe]] services as [[Google Earth]] constantly create new [[thematic map]]s quickly and easily. Such services offer a base platform upon which users can display layers as they choose, or even add their own data to the display.

One example was created on April 21, 2009 by [[Pittsburgh]] [[biochemist]] Harry Niman.&lt;ref&gt;http://flutracker.rhizalabs.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306081700/http://flutracker.rhizalabs.com/ |date=2012-03-06 }} 17 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The map shows where the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 H1N1 swine flu virus]] was spreading at the time. Despite the fact that the data shown was not backed by any official agency, the author's creation had "gone viral", surpassing 290,000 web views and 3,000 comments within nine days of its being published online.&lt;ref&gt;"Online Swine Flu Map Goes Viral." CNN.com/technology. CNN, 30 April 2009. http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/30/online.flumaps/index.html. 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging [[technology]] is increasingly making [[map]]ping more mobile. Dot distribution maps, through their simple and effective displays, are becoming the standard for such on-the-fly mapping services.{{citation needed|date = March 2013}}

Starting in March 2004, Seth Anthony created a project, called the Dot Project, to create red dot maps for Rambot-created Wikipedia articles.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7387">The '''geology of [[Zambia]]''' formed beginning in the [[Proterozoic]] eon of the [[Precambrian]]. The igneous and metamorphic basement rocks tend to be highly-metamorphosed and may have formed earlier in the [[Archean]], but heat and pressure has destroyed evidence of earlier conditions. Major sedimentary and metamorphic groups formed in the mid-Proterozoic, followed by a series of glaciations in the [[Neoproterozoic]] and much of the [[Paleozoic]] which deposited glacial [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] as well as other sediments to form the [[Katanga Supergroup]] and rift-related [[Karoo Supergroup]]. Basalt eruptions blanketed the Karoo Supergroup in the [[Mesozoic]] and Zambia shifted to coal and sandstone formation. Geologically recent windblown sands from the [[Kalahari Desert]] and alluvial deposits near rivers play an important role in the modern surficial geology of Zambia. The country has extensive natural resources, particularly copper, but also cobalt, emeralds, other gemstones, uranium and coal.

==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest rocks in Zambia are part of the crystalline [[Precambrian]] basement complex, outcropping in the east and as the structurally complex [[Lufubu System]] in the [[Copperbelt]]. The [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[migmatite]], [[schist]], [[amphibolite]], [[charnockite]], [[granulite]], [[khondalite]], [[phyllite]], [[limestone]] and metaquartzite basement rocks date to the [[Paleoproterozoic]]. Due to extensive metamorphism and deformation, they were altered from older rocks, obscuring the geologic history of the region. Additionally, the basement rocks are intruded by other granites, [[syenite]], [[dolerite]], [[gabbro]], [[rhyolite]], [[andesite]], metavolcanic and ultrabasic rocks. Although primarily exposed in the north and east, dome outcrops of basement rock exist at other locations in the country. 

A one billion year [[Proterozoic]] [[unconformity]] separates the basement rock from the [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], schists, iron-rich sandstones and mudstones of the [[Muva Supergroup]].The supergroup is intruded by [[carbonatite]], dolerite, granite, granite [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], [[lamprophyre]], [[norite]], [[pegmatite]] and other igneous rock types. A rhyolite porphyritic belt, formed at the same time as the Muva Supergroup extends along the eastern bank of the [[Luapula River]], between [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Mweru]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Neoproterozoic]], the [[Katanga Supergroup]] deposited conglomerate, shale, [[argillite]], quartzite, [[arkose]], [[greywacke]], [[dolomite]] and aeolian sandstones unconformably atop both the Muva Supergroup and Precambrian basement rocks. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=271}}

===Paleozoic===
The deposition of the Katanga Supergroup continued into the [[Cambrian]], in parallel with the rapid expansion of multi-cellular life. Geologists divide the supergroup into the [[Roan Group]], [[Mwasha Group]] and [[Kundelungu Group]] in the Copperbelt, and simply into upper and lower units elsewhere. The Roan Group hosts much of the copper in the Copperbelt as [[chalcopyrite]], [[chalcocite]], [[bornite]], [[malachite]] and [[azurite]], in [[shale]], sandstone, dolomite and quartzite associated with the margins of the Kafue [[syncline]]. 

The Kundelungu Group dolomites, limestones and carbonaceous shales unconformably overly the Mwasha Group [[shale]], argillite and interbedded quartzites. The lower unit of the Kundelungu Group is a conglomerate formed from glacial sediments, potentially related to the [[Hirnantian]] glaciation in the [[Ordovician]], as Zambia, within the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]] drifted close to the South Pole. 

In the mid-Paleozoic, a large rift valley formed across southern Gondwana, spanning much of what is now southern Africa and southern South America. The [[Karoo Supergroup]], the most widespread stratigraphic unit in southern Africa deposited in the rift. In Zambia, the Karoo Supergroup is represented by outcrops in major rift block valleys, in the east and south, such as the Luangwa, Lukusashi, Lunsemfwa, Rufunsa and mid-Zambezi rivers. Because glaciations continued throughout much of the Paleozoic, into the [[Permian]], in Gondwana, the bottom sequence of Karoo Supergroup rocks is a [[tillite]] that appears to be glacially produced. Ascending units includes sandstones and the Gwembe Coal Formation, mudstones and additional sandstones. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=271}}

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present)===
Deposition of the Karoo Supergroup continued into the [[Mesozoic]], with the sequence capped by basalt lava flows from the [[Jurassic]]. Today, the basalt is exposed on the walls of Batoka Gorge, below [[Victoria Falls]]. 

The Karoo Supergroup is overlain by [[Late Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] sandstones and mudstone, and intruded by [[carbonatite]] and [[kimberlite]].

During the past 66 million years of the [[Cenozoic]], the [[Kalahari Desert]] underwent a major expansion during a long lasting dry period. In the [[Neogene]] through the [[Pleistocene]], this climate change deposited moderately consolidated sandstones and windblown sands as the [[Kalahari Group]] in the Western Province and other parts of northwest, south and central Zambia. Pleistocene and [[Holocene]] alluvial deposits line the major rivers, as well as the Bangweulu Swamps and Kafue Flats. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=271}}

==Hydrogeology==
[[Quaternary]] alluvial aquifers and the 20 to 40 meter unconsolidated sands of the Kalahari Group, in western and northeastern Zambia are recharged by rainwater, although the Kalahari Group has some issues with brackish water. 

Several units of the [[Katanga Supergroup]] form consolidated, fracture flow aquifers in the Roan dolomite, Kundelungu limestone, Roan quartzites and Muva Supergroup. Brackish water is held in the unconfined, high porosity Karoo Group sandstones. By contrast, Karoo basalts, interbedded with sandstones and recharged through fractures tend to yield high quality water. 

Large parts of the country are underlain by granite and gabbro crystalline basement rock. These rocks are generally impermeable, but store water in 10 to 15 meter thick weathered [[regolith]] and fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Zambia|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Zambia#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Zambia has extensive natural resources, most famously the copper ore of the [[Roan Group]], which gave rise to the [[Copperbelt]] region. Until the rapid decline in copper prices in the mid-1970s, copper mining formed the backbone of the [[economy of Zambia]]. Demand has picked up for copper, along with secondary production of cobalt. The country has deposits of iron, zinc, lead and tin, as well as small scale gemstone mining from basement rock. The Ndola area has emerald, aquamarine, garnet and talc.

Lower Karoo rocks host coal, while Upper Karoo rocks contain uranium. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=272}}

The '''Gulf of Chiriquí National Marine Park''' is located in the [[Gulf of Chiriquí]], on the Pacific coast of [[Panama]]. It was established in 1994 to protect {{convert|150|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2}} of [[marine ecosystem]]s, including [[coral reef]], [[mangrove swamp]] and [[Seagrass|marine meadow]], and around two dozen islands of the [[archipelago]] of [[Isla Parida]]. In total, the park has 25 islands and 19 coral reefs.

The park is known for its wildlife including: [[green iguana]]s, [[humpback whale]]s (from August to October), [[hammerhead shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s, [[manta ray]]s, [[dolphin]]s and multiple species of [[sea turtle]] that nest on the beaches of the islands.

Islands protected within the park include Santa Catalina, Pulgoso, Gámez, Tintorera, Obispo, Obispone, Los Pargos, Ahogado, Icacos, Corral de Piedra, Bolaños, Bolañitos and Berraco. These islands are covered by tropical forests including [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[oak]] which can provide timber; threats to the area include [[logging]].

The '''head of the valley''' or, less commonly, the '''valley head''', refers to the uppermost part of a [[valley]].&lt;ref name=Leser&gt;Leser (2005), p. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
The head of a valley may take widely differing forms;&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt; for example, in [[highland]] regions the valley often ends in a broad, evenly sloping hollow. The higher the head of the valley, the more likely it is to resemble the geomorphological shape of a [[cirque]]. In [[glacial valley]]s or [[trough valley]]s, it may be referred to as the [[trough head]] or [[trough end]].&lt;ref&gt;Leser (2005), p. 978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mountains with predominantly [[crystalline rock]] the heads of the valleys are generally very wet, sometimes [[bog]]gy and often support lush [[alpine meadow]]s, whilst those made of [[limestone]] are usually dry and covered in [[Scree|talus]] or [[gravel]]. Where there has been [[ice age]] glaciation, the valley bottoms are modified by [[moraine]]s and mountain lakes are common.

[[File:Follower of Jheronimus Bosch Christ in Limbo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Christ in Limbo'' ({{circa}} 1575) by an anonymous follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/christ-limbo-bosch-hieronymus |title=Christ in Limbo |publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Catholic theology]], '''Limbo''' (Latin ''[[wikt:limbus|limbus]]'', edge or boundary, referring to the "edge" of [[Christian views on hell|Hell]]) is a doctrine concerning the [[afterlife]] condition of those who die in [[original sin]] without being assigned to the [[Hell|Hell of the Damned]]. Medieval theologians of western Europe described the [[underworld]] ("hell", "[[Christian views on Hades|hades]]", "infernum") as divided into four distinct parts: [[Christian views on hell#Hell in the New Testament|Hell of the Damned]],&lt;ref name="Gehenna"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Hell]: "However, in the New Testament the term [[Gehenna]] is used more frequently in preference to hades, as a name for the place of punishment of the damned. ... held in abomination by the Jews, who, accordingly, used the name of this valley to designate the abode of the damned (Targ. Jon., Gen., iii, 24; Henoch, c. xxvi). And Christ adopted this usage of the term." [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&amp;letter=G#345 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': Gehenna: Sin and Merit]: "It is frequently said that certain sins will lead man into Gehenna. The name "Gehenna" itself is explained to mean that unchastity will lead to Gehenna (; 'Er. 19a); so also will adultery, idolatry, pride, mockery, hypocrisy, anger, etc. (Soṭah 4b, 41b; Ta'an. 5a; B. B. 10b, 78b; 'Ab. Zarah 18b; Ned. 22a)."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purgatory]], [[#Limbo of the Patriarchs|Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs]], and [[#Limbo of Infants|Limbo of the Infants]]. However, Limbo of the Infants is not an official doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]].

==Limbo of the Patriarchs==
{{see also|Sheol}}
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 018.jpg|left|thumb|237px|''Jesus in Limbo'' by [[Domenico Beccafumi]]]]

The "Limbo of the Patriarchs" or "Limbo of the Fathers" (Latin ''limbus patrum'') is seen as the temporary state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] until redemption by [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ]] made it possible. The term "Limbo of the Fathers" was a medieval name for the part of the underworld ([[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ's soul descended into it by his death&lt;ref&gt;"Christ's soul descended only into that part of Hell wherein the just were detained." [[Thomas Aquinas]], http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4052.htm#2&lt;/ref&gt; through crucifixion and freed them (see [[Harrowing of Hell]]). The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] describes Christ's descent into Hell as meaning primarily that "the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into Hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead." It adds: "But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there." It does not use the word "Limbo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1R.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 633]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of Limbo affirms that admittance to Heaven is possible only through the intervention of Jesus Christ, but does not portray [[Moses]], etc. as being punished eternally in Hell. The concept of Limbo of the Patriarchs is not spelled out in Scripture, but is seen by some as implicit in various references.

{{bibleverse||Luke|16:22}} speaks of the "[[bosom of Abraham]]", which both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, following early Christian writers, understand as a temporary state of souls awaiting entrance into Heaven. The end of that state is set either at the [[Resurrection of the Dead]], the most common interpretation in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], or at the Harrowing of Hell, the most common interpretation in the [[Western Christianity|West]], but adopted also by some in the East.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/11/1/5.aspx Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev: ''Christ the Conqueror of Hell'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus told the [[Saint Dismas|Good Thief]] that the two of them would be together "this day" in "[[Paradise]]" ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:43}}; see also {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:38}}); but on the Sunday of his [[resurrection]] he said that he had "not yet [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to the Father]]" ({{bibleverse||John|20:17}}). Some say that the descent of Jesus to the abode of the dead, his presence among them, turned it into a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PkLrlvWctoC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=|author=François Xavier Schouppe |title=Abridged course of religious instruction, apologetic, dogmatic, and moral: for the use of Catholic colleges and schools |page=248 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3auKFLqCKxEC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22with+me+in+paradise%22+limbo+today#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Anne Clark Bartlett, Thomas Howard Bestul |title=Cultures of Piety: Medieval English Devotional Literature in Translation |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1999 |ISBN= 0-8014-8455-3 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others understand the text to mean not "I say to you, This day you will be with me in paradise", but "I say to you this day, You will be with me in paradise". [[Timothy Radcliffe]] explained the "today" as a reference to the "Today of eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkLUB6c4h1UC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Radcliffe+%22with+me+in+paradise%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Timothy Radcliffe |title=Seven Last Words |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |year=2004 |ISBN= 0-86012-397-9 |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is also described as preaching to "the spirits in prison" (1 Pet 3:19). [[Medieval drama]] sometimes portrayed Christ leading a dramatic assault—The Harrowing of Hell—during the three days between the [[Crucifixion]] and the resurrection. In this assault, Jesus freed the souls of the just and escorted them triumphantly into heaven. This imagery is still used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s [[Holy Saturday]] [[liturgy]] (between [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter|Pascha]]) and in Eastern Orthodox [[icons]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].

The doctrine expressed by the term "Limbo of the Fathers" was taught, for instance, by [[Clement of Alexandria]], who maintained: "It is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the coming (of Christ) should have the advantage of the divine righteousness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book6.html Stromata, book VI, chapter VI]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chora Anastasis1.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Eastern depiction of Christ in his resurrection raising also [[Adam and Eve]]]]

==Limbo of Infants==
The Limbo of Infants (Latin ''limbus infantium'' or ''limbus puerorum'') is the hypothetical permanent status of the [[baptism|unbaptized]] who die in [[infancy]], too young to have committed actual sins, but not having been freed from [[original sin]]. Recent Catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope, although not the certainty, that these infants may attain heaven instead of the state of Limbo.&lt;ref name=ITC/&gt;

While the [[Catholic Church]] has a [[dogmatic definition|defined]] doctrine on original sin, it has none on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, leaving theologians free to propose different theories, which [[magisterium]] is free to accept or reject. Limbo is one such theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html Study by International Theological Commission], 22 April 2007, 32–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1261 ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1261]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin Fathers===
In countering [[Pelagius]], who denied original sin, Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] was led to state that because of original sin, "such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: 'Judgment from one offence to condemnation' ({{bibleverse||Romans|5:16}}), and again a little after: 'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation' ({{bibleverse||Romans|5:18}})."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15011.htm On Merit and the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants], ; cf. [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html#_ftn41 Study by the International Theological Commission], 22 April 2007], 15–18]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of North African bishops, which included Augustine of Hippo, held at Carthage in 418 did not explicitly endorse all aspects of Augustine's stern view about the destiny of infants who die without baptism, but said in a section of one canon (not found in all manuscripts)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html#_ftn41 Study by the International Theological Commission], 22 April 2007, footnote 41]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCAC/&gt; that there is no "intermediate or other happy dwelling place for children who have left this life without Baptism, without which they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, that is, eternal life".&lt;ref name=CCAC&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm Canon 110 of the Code of Canons of the African Church]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html#_ftn41 Study by the International Theological Commission], 22 April 2007, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; So great was Augustine's influence in the West, however, that the Latin Fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries (e.g., [[Jerome]], [[Avitus of Vienne]], and [[Gregory the Great]]) did adopt his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html#_ftn41 Study by the International Theological Commission, 22 April 2007], 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval theologians===
In the later medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine's view. In the 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142) said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment, just the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision. Others held that unbaptized infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the [[beatific vision]], they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. This theory was associated with but independent of the term "Limbo of Infants", which was forged about the year 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html#_ftn41 Study by the International Theological Commission], 22 April 2007, 21–25]&lt;/ref&gt;

If Heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with [[God]], and Hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then, in this view, the Limbo of Infants, although technically part of hell (the outermost part, "limbo" meaning "outer edge" or "hem") is seen as a sort of intermediate state.

The question of Limbo is not treated in the parts of the [[Summa Theologica]] written by Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] himself, but is dealt with in an appendix to the Supplement added after his death by Fra Rainaldo da Piperino.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Summa Theologiae/Supplement to the Third Part/EDITOR'S NOTE|Summa Theologiae, Supplement to the Third Part, EDITOR'S NOTE]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Limbo of Infants is there described as an eternal state of natural joy, untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptized: "Every man who has the use of free-will is adapted to obtain eternal life, because he can prepare himself for grace whereby to merit eternal life; so that if he fail in this, his grief will be very great, since he has lost what he was able to possess. But children were never adapted to possess eternal life, since neither was this due to them by virtue of their natural principles, for it surpasses the entire faculty of nature, nor could they perform acts of their own whereby to obtain so great a good. Hence they will nowise grieve for being deprived of the divine vision; nay, rather will they rejoice for that they will have a large share of God's goodness and their own natural perfections. Nor can it be said that they were adapted to obtain eternal life, not indeed by their own action, but by the actions of others around them, since they could be baptized by others, like other children of the same condition who have been baptized and obtained eternal life: for this is of superabundant grace that one should be rewarded without any act of one's own. Wherefore the lack of such a grace will not cause sorrow in children who die without Baptism, any more than the lack of many graces accorded to others of the same condition makes a wise man to grieve."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Summa Theologiae/Appendix/Question 1|Summa Theologica, Supplement 1 to the Third Part, article 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of God mediated through creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, Lawrence. ''The Natural Desire to See God According to St. Thomas and His Interpreters.'' 2nd edition. Ave Maria: Sapientia Press of Ave Maria University. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the International Theological Commission's document on the question:

{{bq|text=Because children below the age of reason did not commit actual sin, theologians came to the common view that these unbaptized children feel no pain at all or even that they enjoy a full, though only natural, happiness through their mediated union with God in all natural goods (Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7529&amp;CFID=79131013&amp;CFTOKEN=19869646 The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptized], 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern era===
The [[Ecumenical Council|Ecumenical]] [[Council of Florence]] (1442) spoke of baptism as necessary even for children and required that they be baptised soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM#5 Council of Florence Session 11 (Bull ''Cantate Domino''):] "With regard to children, since the danger of death is often present and the only remedy available to them is the sacrament of baptism by which they are snatched away from the dominion of the devil and adopted as children of God, it admonishes that sacred baptism is not to be deferred for forty or eighty days or any other period of time..."&lt;/ref&gt; This had earlier been affirmed at the local [[Council of Carthage (417)]]. The Council of Florence also stated that those who die in original sin alone go to hell, but with unequal pains as those in actual mortal sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM#3 Council of Florence Session 6] "..the souls of those who depart this life in actual mortal sin, or in original sin alone, go down straightaway to hell to be punished, but with unequal pains."&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wycliffe]]'s attack on the necessity of infant baptism was condemned by another general council, the [[Council of Constance]].&lt;ref&gt;Session 15, 6 July 1415&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] in 1547 explicitly stated that baptism (or [[baptism of desire|desire for baptism]]) was the means by which one is transferred "from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html |title=The Council of Trent – The Sixth Session |others=Trans. J. Waterworth |location=London |publisher=Dolman (retrieved from Hanover College) |edition=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 18th and 19th centuries, individual theologians (Bianchi in 1768, H. Klee in 1835, Caron in 1855, H. Schell in 1893) continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved. By 1952 a theologian such as [[Ludwig Ott]] could, in a widely used and well-regarded manual, openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for heaven.&lt;ref&gt;"Other emergency means of baptism for children dying without sacramental baptism, such as prayer and the desire of the parents or the Church (vicarious baptism of desire—Cajetan), or the attainment of the use of reason in the moment of death, so that the dying child can decide for or against God (baptism of desire—H. Klee), or suffering and death of the child as quasi-Sacrament (baptism of suffering—H. Schell), are indeed possible, but their actuality cannot be proved from Revelation. Cf. [[Denzinger]] 712." Ludwig Ott, ''Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma'', Book 2, Section 2, § 25 (p. 114 of the 1963 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; He also told about [[Thomas Cajetan]], a major 16th-century theologian, that suggested infants dying in the womb before birth, and so before ordinary sacramental baptism could be administered, might be saved through their mother's wish for their baptism. In its 1980 instruction on children's baptism the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] stated that "with regard to children who die without having received baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7521#1c |title=Pastoralis Actio |chapter=The Church's Mission |author=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=CatholicCulture.org |date=20 October 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} leaving all theories as to their fate, including Limbo, as viable possibilities. And in 1984, when [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], then Cardinal Prefect of that Congregation, stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised cannot attain salvation, he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background.

The Church's teaching expressed in the 1992 [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] is that "Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament." It adds that "God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments". It recalls that, apart from the sacrament, "baptism of blood" (as in the case of the martyrs) and in the case of catechumens who die before receiving the sacrament, explicit desire for baptism, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, ensures salvation. It states that, since Christ died for all and all are called to the same divine destiny, "every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved", seeing that, if they had known of the necessity of baptism, they would have desired it explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1257-1260]&lt;/ref&gt;

It then states: "As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|10:14}}; cf. {{bibleverse|1|Tim|2:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#VI ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1261] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930092218/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#VI |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely stating that one can "hope" in a way of salvation other than baptism, the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants, the only certain means to "not prevent" their "coming to Christ" for salvation.

On 20 April 2007,&lt;ref name="CNSapril07"/&gt; the advisory body known as the [[International Theological Commission]] released a document, originally commissioned by [[Pope John Paul II]], entitled "The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized."&lt;ref name=ITC&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptised, ITC], 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:

{{bq|text=Our conclusion is that the many factors that we have considered above give serious theological and liturgical grounds for hope that unbaptized infants who die will be saved and enjoy the beatific vision. We emphasize that these are reasons for prayerful hope, rather than grounds for sure knowledge. There is much that simply has not been revealed to us.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{bibleverse||John|16:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; We live by faith and hope in the God of mercy and love who has been revealed to us in Christ, and the Spirit moves us to pray in constant thankfulness and joy.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{bibleverse|1|Thes|5:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{bq|text=What has been revealed to us is that the ordinary way of salvation is by the sacrament of baptism. None of the above considerations should be taken as qualifying the necessity of baptism or justifying delay in administering the sacrament. Rather, as we want to reaffirm in conclusion, they provide strong grounds for hope that God will save infants when we have not been able to do for them what we would have wished to do, namely, to baptize them into the faith and life of the Church.}}

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized publication of this document, indicating that he considers it consistent with the Church's teaching, though it is not an official expression of that teaching.&lt;ref name="CNSapril07"&gt;[[Catholic News Service]] (20 April 2007). [http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm "Vatican commission: Limbo reflects 'restrictive view of salvation'"]. Retrieved 20 April 2007. {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070508193238/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm |date=8 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports that by the document "the Pope closed Limbo"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 April 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/world/europe/21briefs-limbo.html |title=Vatican City: Pope Closes Limbo}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thus without foundation. In fact, the document explicitly states that "the theory of ''limbo'', understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin. This theory, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium. Still, that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis" (second preliminary paragraph); and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of Limbo "remains a possible theological opinion". The document thus allows the hypothesis of a limbo of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised, a question on which there is "no explicit answer" from Scripture or tradition.&lt;ref name="CNSapril07"/&gt; The traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not Heaven, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church, but are only opinions that the Church does not condemn, permitting them to be held by its members, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.

==In other denominations and religions==
[[File:5part-icon-Hell.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Old Testament]] righteous follow Christ from [[Hades in Christianity|Hades]] to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] (Russian icon)]]

Neither the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] nor [[Protestantism]] accepts the concept of a limbo of infants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/limbo3.htm |title=Limbo: Recent statements by the Catholic church, and Protestant views |website=Religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, while not using the expression "Limbo of the Patriarchs", the Eastern Orthodox Church lays much stress on the resurrected Christ's action of liberating [[Adam and Eve]] and other righteous figures of the [[Old Testament]], such as [[Abraham]] and [[David]], from Hades (see [[Harrowing of Hell]]).

Some Protestants have a similar understanding of those who died as believers prior to the crucifixion of Jesus residing in a place that is not Heaven, but not Hell. The doctrine holds that Hades has two "compartments", one an unnamed place of torment, the other named Abraham's Bosom. {{Bibleverse|Luke|16:19–16:26|KJV}} speaks of a chasm fixed between the two which cannot be crossed. Those in the unnamed "compartment" have no hope, and will ultimately be consigned to hell. Those in Abraham's bosom are those of whom it is written of Jesus, "When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives..." (Eph. 4:8, quoting Psa. 68:18). These individuals, the captives, now reside with God in Heaven. Both "Compartments" still exist, but Abraham's Bosom is now empty, while the other chamber is not, according to this doctrine.

[[Mormons]] teach that "all who have died without a knowledge of [the] gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/137/7 D&amp;C 137:7] See [[Baptism for the Dead]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and others have taught that the [[soul sleep|dead are unconscious]] (or even nonexistent), awaiting their destiny on [[Judgment Day]].

The [[Zoroastrian]] concept of ''[[hamistagan]]'' is similar to limbo. Hamistagan is a neutral state in which a soul that was neither good nor evil awaits [[Judgment Day]].

In [[Islam]], which denies the existence of original sin in totality, the concept of Limbo exists as ''[[Barzakh]]'', the state that exists after death, prior to the day of resurrection. During this period sinners are punished and the adequately purified rest in comfort. Children however are exempt from this stage, as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims (despite religious upbringing). After death they go directly to Heaven, where they are cared for by Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_9_88.php Al-Bukhary, Volume 9, Book 88, Number 171]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Classical [[Greek Mythology]], the section of [[Hades]] known as the [[Fields of Asphodel]] were a realm much resembling Limbo, to which the vast majority of people who were held to have deserved neither the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] (Heaven) nor [[Tartarus]] (Hell) were consigned for eternity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14856">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Macau'''. There are8 2 mammal species in [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

The '''M181''' is a [[motorway]] that links the town of [[Scunthorpe]], England, to the [[M180 motorway]]. A spur of the M180, the road is virtually straight through its entire {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} length. It was opened in December 1978, at the same time as the section of M180 from junction 3 ([[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]]) to the east side of the [[River Trent]] (the bridge was not opened until late 1979).

==Route==
It begins just outside Scunthorpe, at the junction of the [[A1077 road|A1077]] and [[A18 road (England)|A18]]. There is an out-of-town retail park, known locally as Gallagher Retail Park, which offers a variety of food and retail outlets, and Glanford Park, the home of [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United Football Club]] at this junction. At the other end, the road has a junction for the M180 east, while the main carriageway merges with the M180 west. It has no intermediate junctions. It is built to typical British motorway standards, being two lanes in each direction, plus a [[hard shoulder]] for its entire length.

As part of the Lincolnshire Lakes development, it is proposed to construct a new roundabout junction halfway along the M181 which would form the terminus of the motorway.&lt;ref&gt;Scunthorpe Telegraph, {{cite web |url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/Green-light-Lincolnshire-Lakes-plan-3-000-new/story-23347982-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041222/http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/Green-light-Lincolnshire-Lakes-plan-3-000-new/story-23347982-detail/story.html |archivedate=26 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Island Volcanic Plateau''' (often called the '''Central Plateau''' and occasionally the '''Waimarino Plateau''') is a [[volcanic plateau]] covering much of central [[North Island]] of New Zealand with volcanoes, lava plateaus, and crater lakes.

==Location and description==
The plateau is approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km east–west and the north–south distance is about 130&amp;nbsp;km.

Extensive [[ignimbrite]] sheets spread east and west of the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]] centred on the huge dormant [[supervolcano|supervolcanic]] [[caldera]] [[Lake Taupo]], the largest lake in New Zealand, which last erupted 2000 years ago. The volcanic area includes the three active peaks of [[Mount Tongariro]], [[Mount Ngauruhoe]], and [[Mount Ruapehu]] in the south, and extends beyond [[Rotorua]] in the north reaching almost to the [[Bay of Plenty]] coast. North of Tongariro is the volcanic [[Pihanga|Mount Pihanga]]. The western boundary of the plateau forms an escarpment beside the [[Mamaku Ranges|Mamaku]] and [[Kaimai Range]]s, but further south is less distinct. In the east, the plateau runs up to the foot of the [[Ahimanawa Range|Ahimanawa]], [[Kaweka Range|Kaweka]] and the fertile [[Kaimanawa Range|Kaimanawa]] mountain ranges. Finally, west of the plateau stands the volcano [[Mount Taranaki/Egmont|Mount Taranaki]] (in [[Egmont National Park]]).

Two of the country's longest rivers, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Waikato River|Waikato]] have their headwaters on the plateau.

===Geology===
The tallest mountain, Ruapehu, is an [[Andesite]] cone that was once twice as high but has been eroded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} All of the cones are composite [[stratovolcano]]es made up of layers of lava and [[tephra]]. They are in the intermediate category, meaning that they have a moderate amount of [[silica]] in the [[magma]]. The percentage of silica is the deciding factor in the thickness or [[viscosity]] of the lava. This contrasts with [[ignimbrite]] which is a [[gas]]-rich material ejected from the ground at high speed forming a giant white hot fountain 55 kilometres high. When the ignimbrite falls it flows outwards at high speed (600–900&amp;nbsp;km/h) and can travel many kilometres, even going up and over hills and mountains before it cools, trapping air inside. Especially around [[Lake Taupo]] the eroded ignimbrite includes pieces of [[pumice]], a lightweight rock that floats on water. The top, unwelded layer of the ignimbrite sheet is relatively soft and easily eroded by streams and rivers, which transport the pumice to the lake. The lower, welded layers of the ignimbrite sheets are more dense, though still porous. These lower compressed layers often show the glint of heated [[silicon]] specks{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. This stone, called [[Hinuera]] stone (after the quarry of origin), is used for  building cladding. 

The ring plain around the central volcanoes is formed from numerous [[lahar]]s or mudflows that occur when either the [[crater lake]] water is ejected from Ruapehu or snow is melted, during an eruption. The water runs down the mountain, picking up [[volcanic ash|ash]], [[lapilli]], blocks and [[volcanic bomb|bombs]] as well as previously eroded rock, forming a thick, dense mud that is capable of picking up car-sized rocks. An old lahar flow is visible from the approach road to [[Whakapapa]] ski field. In December 1953 a sudden lahar at night on Mt Ruapehu knocked out the rail bridge at [[Tangiwai disaster|Tangiwai]], causing six carriages of the [[Wellington]]-[[Auckland]] express to plunge into the [[Whangaehu River]], killing 151 people.

The last major eruption in the area was the [[Hatepe eruption]] from the Lake Taupo volcanic complex 1800 years ago, which ejected lava and especially wind-blown tephra over a wide area to the north and northeast of the North Island. About {{convert|30|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of material was ejected in the space of a few minutes, in the biggest volcanic event in the world in the last 5,000 years.

The entire area is above 300 metres, with a considerable proportion of it more than 800 metres above sea level. The plateau has a mild climate although the temperature regularly falls below freezing in winter and snow can fall between March and October. Of all North Island regions, the Volcanic Plateau is closest to having a [[continental climate]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm McKinnon {{cite web
|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/volcanic-plateau-region/2.
|title=Geology and climate - Volcanic Plateau region
|date=November 30, 1999
|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]
|accessdate=30 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of maximum snow is July to September. Sudden blizzard conditions can be experienced on the volcanoes in winter. These blizzards have killed  climbers as recently as the 1980s.The Desert Road on State Highway 1 is often closed by snow in winter for brief periods.

==Flora==
The natural vegetation of the area includes the [[podocarp]] conifers including rimu ''([[Dacrydium cupressinum]])'', miro ''([[Prumnopitys ferruginea]])'', matai ''([[Prumnopitys taxifolia]])'', totara ''([[Podocarpus totara]])'' and kahikatea ''([[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]])'' and hardwoods that once covered this whole area before the eruption of Taupo and other volcanoes. To the west of the three large volcanoes, the land is rough forested hill country, while the north close to Lake Taupo is more fertile and undulating and much has been cleared for farming. The forest used to extend to the west coast and there are still patches of natural vegetation in wetlands including the [[Horowhenua]] floodplains.

However to the east of Taupo the barren, ash-laden soils and harsh alpine climate leave the high land largely bare and unprofitable, capable of growing only scrubby plants. This area is known as the [[Rangipo Desert]]  although it is not a true desert as the annual rainfall is over 1,000mm PA and the real reason for the low and sparse vegegation was the mass sterilization of seeds caused by the 20,000-year-old Taupo eruption, which swept white-hot ignimbrite through this valley. Prior to this cataclysmic event this area was forested and stumps of charcoalized trees can be seen where soil has eroded.
Around Taupo itself there are [[geothermal]] areas with specialised plant life such as the prostrate kanuka ''(a subspecies of [[kunzea ericoides]])''.

Further to the east of the plateau lies more rough hill country in the Kaimanawa Ranges, a popular hunting area for wild red and sika deer. The tops of the mountains are open and tussock covered .Helicopters and light aircraft can land on a rough air strip. Hunting range in the bush is often 50 m or less but in the open tops the range can be much further. The area to the south, around [[Lake Moawhango]] is richer in plant life. Finally there are areas of [[beech]] forest and [[alpine vegetation]] at higher elevations throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0405|name=North Island temperate forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The northern side of the plateau especially is home to wildlife including birds such as the [[North Island kōkako]] wattlebird ''(Callaeas wilsoni)'', [[New Zealand kaka]], and large populations of [[brown kiwi]] ''(Apteryx australis)'' and [[blue duck]] ''(Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos)''. The area to the south of the plateau and down to [[Wellington]] is home to a variety of lizards including [[Whitaker's skink]] ''(Cyclodina whitakeri)'', [[forest gecko]] ''(Hoplodactylus granulatus)'' and [[Wellington green gecko]] ''(Naultinus elegens punctatus)''. Wetlands throughout the region support waterbirds and fish including the endemic [[Neochanna apoda|brown mudfish]].

==Threats and preservation==
The lowland areas are quite highly populated and therefore urban development, agriculture and forestry are a major threat to natural habitats there. One block of lowland forest remains in and around [[Whanganui National Park]] and large areas of the uplands are protected either by Maori tradition or in national parks of which [[Te Urewera National Park|Te Urewera]] is the largest. The four North Island national parks, which surround the plateau, are Te Urewera, Whanganui, Egmont and New Zealand's first national park, the World Heritage listed [[Tongariro National Park]]. Introduced species and livestock grazing are now major threats to some endemic species. Rats, cats and stoats prey on native reptiles and birds (including the kokako, blue duck and brown kiwi), while imported plants such as [[Clematis vitalba|old man’s beard]], [[banana passionfruit]] and [[gorse]] can take over from indigenous species. Finally grazing by goats and possums can eradicate others such as [[Weinmannia racemosa|kamahi]], [[Libocedrus bidwillii|kaikawaka]] (''Libocedrus bidwillii'') and [[Podocarpus cunninghamii|mountain tōtara]]. Therefore, smaller islands off the coast of Wellington have been used as a refuge for North Island birds and reptiles whose habitats may be threatened now or in the future.

Also the Volcanic Plateau region has the largest area of man made forest in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all the trees are ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' which were bought in for trials at Rotorua in 1899 from [[Kew Gardens]], London. The tree, a native of [[Monterey, California]], grew very fast in the poor soils. Mass planting was initially carried out by prisoners in the 1920s and then by the unemployed on a large scale during the [[Great Depression]]. After World War II scientists from [[Norway]] settled in the region and helped develop ways of treating the soft pine to prevent [[Decomposition|rotting]] using pressure treatment with chemicals. They also introduced [[selective breeding]] methods which was the standard way of improving the trees until [[tissue culture]] was introduced in the 1990s. Trees take 25–30 years to reach full height. Most plantations use [[growth factor]] (GF) trees to guarantee very high quality (straight and knot-free) timber, however treatment by chemical salts is still required to stop rotting. This is done by either dipping or more usually, pressure treatment. New Zealand has pioneered the use of Radiata timber and plywood in small craft boatbuilding. Untreated clear timber or plywood is used that is then encapsulated in epoxy resin after construction. The key reason is the low cost of the wood rather than any inherent properties of the wood which is of moderate weight but fractures easily when bent, when dried to 12% moisture. One of the largest ply factories in New Zealand is located on the Volcanic Plateau at Tokoroa. Although planting by hand is still done on steeper land, most seedlings are now planted with the help of machines.

Urban areas in the region include the towns of [[Taihape]] in the south, [[Ohakune]] the carrot-growing capital of NZ in the west, and [[Taupo]] in the north, with [[Turangi]] a major trout fishing base at the south of Lake Taupo and by the [[Kaweka Ranges]] in the east, The majority of the population of the area lives close to the shores of [[Lake Taupo]], with some smaller settlements to the east of the volcanoes. These make their living largely through [[tourism]], including [[skiing]] in the winter season, trout fishing, especially on the Tongariro river or by forestry in the plateau's northeast, which includes the [[Kaingaroa Forest]] or by working on the extensive Hydro Electric power system.

==History==
The [[Māori people|Māori]] population during the Archaic period was sparse. Only two [[moa]] hunter period sites have been discovered to date. The best known is the Whakamoenga cave near Taupo. The cave was in use about 600 years ago and three moa bones, obsidian flakes, hollow pumice stone ash holders, pumice floats, a fishing net, bird spears, pieces of hue (gourd) and bracken remains have been found. The other moa hunter site is at Tokoroa.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Leahy Study, University of Auckland, 1962/63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tangata whenua]] are the [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa]]. Their paramount chief is [[Tumu te Heuheu|Sir Tumu te Heuheu]]. They moved into this area after splitting away from the Arawa tribe on the east coast. The boundary between Arawa and Tuwharetoa is a small island 400 metres north of [[Huka Falls]] on the [[Waikato River]]. Their main marae is on the southern shores of Lake Taupo at Waihi near the Tokaanu geothermal area. They still retain ownership of the peaks of the mountains which are considered sacred, as well as the Ketetahi hot springs on the north slope of Mt Tongariro. The Māori people considered the volcanoes sacred and in traditional times wore woven flax eye shields to avoid looking at the peaks.

The Rangipo region is largely uninhabited. It is used by the [[New Zealand Army]], based at [[Waiouru]] in the south, and by the [[Rangipo prison farm]] in the north and Rangipo underground HEP station to the east. During the 1960s The [[Tongariro power scheme]] redirected the flow of water from many of the streams and rivers that drain the central peaks. The water was channelled into canals, tunnels and storage lakes to provide water for 2 HEP stations at Rangipo and Tokaanu. The water then flowed into Lake Taupo increasing its input by 20%. Most of the Tongariro river flow is not included in the power scheme due to its importance as a breeding area for brown and rainbow trout. The extra water boosted the amount of water available to the 10 other HEP stations on the [[Waikato River]] which flows from the north end of the lake and is its only exit.

The productivity of pasture on the plateau was greatly improved in the 1950s once it was realised that the "[[bush sickness]]" suffered by local livestock was due to cobalt deficient volcanic soils. The cure for this was discovered by an [[Australia]]n scientist in 1936 but the application of [[cobalt]] at the rate of 30cc per Ha was only possible after [[World War II]] making use of war surplus planes and ex WW2 pilots for [[aerial topdressing]]. The cobalt was mixed with crushed [[phosphate rock]] which was obtained cheaply from [[Nauru]] Island in the West Pacific. The resulting mix was called Super Phosphate.

The site is close to [[Tangiwai]], the scene of New Zealand's worst railway disaster on Christmas Eve, 1953, when 151 were killed when the rail bridge was destroyed by a lahar flow from [[Mt Ruapehu]].
The largest farm in the North Island was established off the Taupo-Napier road and is called Lochinver Station. The station was largely developed by construction millionaire Bill Stephenson and his family using heavy earthmoving equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. The high country sheep and cattle station has several airstrips, 21 houses and 200&amp;nbsp;km of roading. It normally carries 100,000 breeding ewes and about 8,000 cattle. It has extensive shelter belts of contorta pine, improved rye-grass pasture and grows crops of swedes and barley. The farm is open to tourist and school group bus tours.

==Popular culture==
Tourism is an economic mainstay of the region with a wide range of largely outdoor attractions from [[trout fishing]], [[flyfishing]] on [[Tongariro River]] or harling on Lake Taupo, [[tramping]], [[Mountain biking]] centred on National Park, deer or pig hunting, [[horse riding]] to snowskiing/boarding on Mt Ruapehu.

The [[Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre of New Zealand]] is located on the site of an old Italian tunneling construction camp. Started by mountaineer [[Graeme Dingle]] in the 1970s, this centre offers valuable outdoor training experience and skills to secondary school groups and others.

Train and engineering enthusiasts will enjoy the [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The main trunk rail line spirals upwards 132m via a tunnel and 180 degree hairpin bends so the passengers near the head of the train can see the rear carriages heading in the opposite direction. At the time of construction it was considered a masterpiece of engineering. This was the last stage to be built in the main trunk railway line completed in 1900.

===Cold Kiwi Motorcycle Rally===
The Cold Kiwi Motorcycle Rally, advertised as NZ's longest running [[motorcycle rally]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldkiwi.co.nz/], www.coldkiwi.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt; has been held on the Plateau since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/wiki/Cold_Kiwi Cold Kiwi], www.kiwibiker.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt; 
The event is run by The Ruapehu Motorcycle Club in early Sept each year. Bikers sleep in their own tents despite the average temperature being -8C at night, but the club provides hot food and drinks, a bonfire, as well as  competitions, souvenirs, live bands and toilet facilities.

The  2016 event will be held from Friday 2 September to Sunday 4 September on a new site at [[Horopito, New Zealand|Horopito]] on the western side of Mt Ruapehu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldkiwi.co.nz/], www.coldkiwi.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongariro Alpine Crossing===
{{main article|Tongariro Alpine Crossing}}
The one-day [[Tongariro Alpine Crossing]] from the Mangatepopo Valley across Mt Ngauruhoe and Mt Tongariro is named one of the greatest one-day walks in the world by the Department of Conservation. The 19.2&amp;nbsp;km track is well marked in summer and popular but trampers should be quite fit and well equipped as the route is exposed, especially during the winter months (April to September) when the route poles are sometimes hidden by snow or blown away. There are two well equipped huts near the ends of route. Detailed guidance is available from the Mt Ruapehu Department of Conservation Visitors Centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4180">The '''origin of the name "Kven"''' is unclear. The name appears for the first time in a 9th-century [[Old English language|Old English]] version, written by [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred of Wessex]], of a work by the Roman author [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], in the plural form "Cwenas". 

Today, however, the name [[Kven people|Kven]] refers to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] speaking people who have migrated to northern [[Norway]] in relatively recent times, with no connection to the ''Cwenas/Kænir'' mentioned in the sagas.

==Norwegian background==

{{main|Kvens of the past}}

All ancient references to Kvenland and Kvens seem to be from Old English and Icelandic sources (9th to 13th centuries). Furthermore, most of them seem to have been connected to a certain geographical area in [[Norway]] in one way or another:

* [[Ohthere from Hålogaland|Ottar]], the source used by King Alfred of Wessex, was from Hålogaland
* Orkneyinga saga described how Nór travelled from Kvenland to Trondheim
* Egil's saga described how Thorolf travelled from Namdalen (north of Trondheim) to Kvenland
* Writer of the publication mentioning Terra Feminarum was especially familiar with Trondheim and also mentioned Hålogaland
* Kvens were mentioned 1271 to have pillaged Hålogaland

This might indicate that the term "Kven" was originally used in Norwegian dialects around a rather compact area ranging from [[Trondheim]] to [[Hålogaland]].

==Theory one: "Swampy land"==

Widely accepted is the view first presented by Jouko Vahtola&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, J. (1994), Kvenerne – vem var de ursprungligen? In: Torekoven Strøm (eed.), Report from the seminar ”Kvenene – en glemt minoritet?” 14.11.94 at the University of Tromsø/Tromsø Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, J. (2001), Folk och folkgrupper inom det nordliga rummet över tid. In: Tedebrand, L.-G. &amp; Edlund, L.-E. (ed.), Tre kulturer i möte. Kulturens frontlinjer. Papers from the research program Kulturgräns norr, 27. Published by Johan Nordlander-sällskapet, 23. Umeå.&lt;/ref&gt; that "kven" etymologically originates from [[Old Norse]] "hvein," meaning "swampy land".&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=\data\ie\germet&amp;text_recno=409&amp;root=config Etymology of hvein.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory two: "Woman"==

Whatever the origin of the name "kven" is, it effortlessly translates to "woman" in Old Norse. Proto-Germanic "*kwinōn, *kunōn; *kwēni-z, *kwēnō" for "woman" had developed into "kona; kvǟn, kvān, kvɔ̄n; kvendi; kvenna, kvinna" in Old Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=\data\ie\germet&amp;text_recno=257&amp;root=config Etymology of kwen.]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is that Kvenland was most likely translated to ''[[Terra Feminarum]]'' ("Woman Land") in a Latin text from 1075 CE. Another reference to a north-bound land of women is from an Icelandic manuscript from the 14th century that describes a ''kuenna land'' ("Woman Land") north of [[India]] that would only have women with both reproduction organs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/am764.html Manuscript "AM 764 4to"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928080738/http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/am764.html |date=2006-09-28 }}. See also [http://sagnanet.is/saganet/?MIval=/SinglePage&amp;Manuscript=100203&amp;Page=4723&amp;language=english entire text in Icelandic]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory three: Sami background ==

Similar sounding words to "kainuu" also exist in the [[Sami languages]]. In [[North Samic]], ''Gáidnu'' is a rope made of roots for boats or fishing nets. ''Gáidnulaŝ'' refers to a clumsy person and ''Geaidnu'' stands for a road or a way.&lt;ref&gt;Álgu-database&lt;/ref&gt; In the early saami dictionaries ''Kainolats/Kainahaljo'' had the meaning Norwegian or Swedish man while ''Kainahalja'' had the meaning Norwegian or Swedish women, it could also have the meaning peasant. Helsing-byn close Torneå was referred to as ''Cainho''.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon lapponicum, Erik Lindahl, Johann Öhrling, Typis Joh. Georg. Lange, 1780"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The General Survey of Madrid between 1749 and 1774 was one of the most important cadastral surveys of the Old Spanish regime.  The Planimetría General de Madrid resulted in the production 557 plans of blocks throughout Madrid.&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

In the cadastre documentary data were collected on the ownership of Madrid properties and other features such as previous owners, map showing the plots into which each [[City block|manzana]] or block was divided, description of the configuration and structure of each building, size and quality of the building, indication of the name and number of tenants housed per room, the tax status according to the [[regalía de aposento|aposento]] charged, among other indicators. Each block was then numbered and identified with the objective of levying taxes. This identification done by the general visit resulted in a white tile being laid on every house with writing in blue letters indicating the number assigned: "Visita G. Casa nº123" (General Visit House # 123).&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

The initial intentions of the [[Zenón de Somodevilla, 1st Marqués de la Ensenada|Marqués de la Ensenada]] was to renew the tax system in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Among the constraints imposed on the inhabitants of Madrid was the [[regalía de aposento]]. The method by which taxes were imposed was based on the "Visita General" which identified the nature of property ownership and assessed the taxes on inhabitants accordingly.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

The imprecision of the method resulted in it being eventually abandoned. It was repealed by [[Joaquín Vizcaíno|Marqués Viudo de Pontejos]] who replaced it with a more logical which consisted of identifying streets with names of famous persons and historical events. The white numbered tiles that were laid by officials during the survey are still evidenced on the façade of Madridean houses especially in the historic center of Madrid.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

[[File:Starr 070906-8906 Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum.jpg|thumb|Plugs of yellow [[pear tomato]]es]]

'''Plugs''' in [[horticulture]] are small-sized [[seedlings]] grown in trays from expanded polystyrene or polythene filled usually with a [[peat]] or [[compost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqMt8k3qaWIC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=plug+plants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC52T_efNuariALu6KioDg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=plug%20plants&amp;f=false | title=''Small Green Roofs: Low-Tech Options for Greener Living'' | publisher=Timber Press | year=2011 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | author=Dunnett, Nigel| pages=67–68|display-authors=etal}} {{ISBN|9781604690590}}&lt;/ref&gt; substrate. This type of plug is used for commercially raising vegetables and bedding plants. Similarly plugs may also refer to small sections of [[lawn]] grass [[sod]]. After being planted, lawn grass may somewhat spread over an adjacent area.

Plug plants are young plants raised in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a garden.&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/diseases-of-fruits-and-vegetables-diagnosis-and-management-volume-2/oclc/56884192&amp;referer=brief_results | title=''Diseases of fruits and vegetables: diagnosis and management, Volume 2'' | publisher=New York; Dordrecht ; London: Kluwer Academic | year=2004 | page=466 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | author=Naqvi, SAMH}} {{ISBN|1402026072}}{{spaced ndash}} "An alternative to field-grown transplants is the use of container-grown, or plug plants.

==Overview==
[[File:New Place Nursery - geograph.org.uk - 297230.jpg|thumb|left|Plugs growing in a [[greenhouse]] at New Place Nurseries in Pulborough, West Sussex, England]]
Planting from plugs reduces the time a [[crop]] resides in the ground, and is functional for those with limited space. Plugs can improve yields: a healthy, stocky plant will grow rapidly and symmetrically when planted out, with a potentially greater capacity to withstand pests, disease and drought. Raising some types of seedlings successfully can be difficult, so plug plants can be beneficial for less experienced gardeners. Plug plants are beneficial for gardeners who want to try a new variety or a range of varieties without purchasing numerous packets of seeds and starting the plants from seed. Plug plants are very useful if the sowing window is missed, and plugs can be purchased quickly to replace a crop which has failed.

As a garden develops, interplanting ([[intercropping]]) existing crops with plugs plants, ideally companion plants, can improve the productivity of the space and so maximise harvests{{spaced ndash}}a sown crop may not be able to compete with established plants. Plug plants are much easier to weed than sown seedlings, and [[Weed control|weeding]] will need to be done less frequently.

Having semi-grown plants simplifies designing a vegetable plot or container. As plants that have already started growth, the time to attain plant growth is lessened.&lt;ref name="SmallFruits"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNXFdqwkCx8C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=plug+plants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC52T_efNuariALu6KioDg&amp;ved=0CHEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=plug%20plants&amp;f=false | title=''Small Fruits in the Home Garden'' | publisher=Food Products Press | year=1996 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 |author1=Gough, Robert Edward |author2=Poling, E. Barclay | pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of planting signs of growth are typically visible: leaves will perk up and roots anchor into the soil. Air pruned plugs are grown in a manner to promote very rapid growth almost immediately after being transplanted to new soil.

Plugs are sometimes used in hillside [[plasticulture]] applications, due to the ease in which they are transplanted.&lt;ref name="SmallFruits"/&gt;

==Plant cultivation and growth==
[[File:StAugPlug.jpg|thumb|right|A plug of [[St. Augustine grass]] ready for [[sprigging]] ]]
Plug plants grow more consistently, as has been noted by the commercial scale vegetable growing industry, and more rapidly; large-scale brassica field crops are planted almost exclusively from soil block plugs in some parts of Europe, a trend which is growing in the UK. This success at the commercial scale is testament to the success of plugs in the ground.

It is of note that many varieties actively benefit from being transplanted as severing the [[taproot]] encourages bushier root growth. Traditionally nearly all heading brassica are sown in a separate seed bed, thinned, and the best ones planted in a prepared bed after about 6–8 weeks. Many pests want to eat baby [[brassica]]; this in combination with its long growing season makes planting brassica from plugs a much easier option.

==Root vegetables==
[[List of root vegetables|Root vegetable]]s are typically, but not always, sown from seed, rather than transplanted from plugs, where they are to mature and then be thinned. The thinning action is highly beneficial in itself as it provides soil aeration at depth without disturbing adjacent roots systems. The initial concentration of seedlings also dilutes damage from pests and provided some food for the gardener or the compost in the form of thinnings. Beetroot, carrots and the root brassica family- swede, turnip- will simply not reach their full potential with any check to early root growth. In addition, these seeds are typically inexpensive, and the seedlings are delicate; hence there is little value to the gardener in buying or growing them as plugs.

'''Podlužje''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Подлужје}}) is a small geographical region in [[Serbia]]. It is located in south-eastern [[Syrmia]]. The western part of Podlužje belong to the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]], and the eastern part belongs to the city of [[Belgrade]]. The Serbian Orthodox [[Fenek monastery]] and natural reserve [[Obedska Pond]] are situated in this region, as well as the medieval town of [[Kupinovo|Kupinik]] (today a village named Kupinovo), the former seat of the Serbian despots in Syrmia.

Slieve Gullion is a steep-sided mountain with a flat top and a height of {{convert|573|m|ft}}. It is the eroded remains of a [[Paleocene]] volcanic complex. It is surrounded by a [[ring dike]] known as the [[Ring of Gullion]], a designated [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB). Slieve Gullion has been shaped by glaciation and exhibits a classic 'crag and tail' glacial feature. The 'tail', made up of glacial deposits, points south, ending at Drumintee. The geological formation was the first ring dike to be mapped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/escr/summary.asp?Item=1118 |title=Slieve Gullion Ring - Overview |publisher=Habitas.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its significance was not understood until similar structures had been described from Scotland. The rocks of the area are complex and have featured in international geological debate since the 1950s. The site has attracted geologists from all over the world and featured in a number of theories that have been put forward to explain the unusual rock relationships. Some of these theories have now become an accepted part of geological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/protected_areas_home/aonb/aonb_gullion/aonb_gullion_geology.htm |title=Geology within Ring of Gullion AONB |publisher=Doeni.gov.uk |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112094550/http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/protected_areas_home/aonb/aonb_gullion/aonb_gullion_geology.htm |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Please do not go into too much detail about the Ring of Gullion, as this article is about the mountain--&gt;

Much of Slieve Gullion is covered with forest, heather, or raw stone, while 612&amp;nbsp;hectares of dry [[heath (habitat)|heath]] on the mountain has been designated a [[Special Area of Conservation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/protectedsites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0030277 |title=Slieve Gullion Special Area of Conservation |publisher=Jncc.gov.uk |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Environmentally Sensitive Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/sr/sr1997/Nisr_19970298_en_1.htm |title=Environmentally Sensitive Areas (Slieve Gullion) Designation (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 1997 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2013-06-17 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In July 2006, some areas of [[gorse]] were destroyed by a [[wildfire]] which may have been [[arson|started deliberately]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FireFightingNews.com |url=http://www.firefightingnews.com/article-UK.cfm?articleID=13942 |title=Arsonists Strike 2,500 Times In Ulster In Last Three Years |publisher=Firefightingnews.com |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of fields on the mountain's poor soil from farming in earlier times can still be seen. There is also evidence of past quarrying.

===Burial cairns===
[[File:Chambered Grave on Slieve Gullion - geograph.org.uk - 563997.jpg|thumb|250px|The entrance to the passage tomb]]
There are two burial [[cairn]]s on top of the mountain, on either side of a small lake. The southern one is a large [[passage tomb]], the highest surviving passage tomb in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythicalireland.com/other/slievegullion.php |title=Slieve Gullion, County Armagh |publisher=Mythicalireland.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, a team of archaeologists explored the site and set up a 30-person camp near the summit.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.E.P., and B.C.S. Wilson. "The Slieve Gullion Cairns" in the ''Ulster Journal of Archaeology'' (1963). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb's cairn is 30&amp;nbsp;m (97&amp;nbsp;ft) wide and 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) high. The chamber inside is 3.6&amp;nbsp;m (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, with a corbelled roof up to 4.3&amp;nbsp;m (14&amp;nbsp;ft) high. It contained three large blocks of stone seemingly used as basins, and fragments of human bone. Some bits of worked flint and a barbed-end arrowhead were also found, "the meager remnants that survived the centuries of tomb raiding".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.E.P. "The Slieve Gullion Passage-Grave Cairn". ''Journal of the Armagh Diocesan Historical Society 5.1'' (1969). pp.180-182&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance is aligned with the setting sun on the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2011/1203/1224308504006.html 'Mystery and magic in megalithic Ireland' ''Irish Times'', December 3rd, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating suggests it was built c.3500–2900 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, John. ''The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland''. Wordwell, 2005. p.77&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller cairn to the north of the lake was built later, perhaps during the [[Bronze Age]]. It contains two [[cist]] burials, with one containing bits of burnt bone; likely the remains of a single adult.&lt;ref&gt;Collins &amp; Wilson, pp.31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The two cairns were disturbed by American soldiers training there during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Collins &amp; Wilson, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Irish folklore holds that it is bad luck to damage or disrespect such tombs and that doing so could bring a [[curse]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Champion &amp; Gabriel Cooney. "Chapter 13: Naming the Places, Naming the Stones". ''Archaeology and Folklore''. Routledge, 2005. p.193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Gillian. ''The Irish Ordnance Survey: History, Culture and Memory''. Four Courts Press, 2004. p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are historic monuments protected by law. In recent years, volunteers have helped to repair the burial cairns under the supervision of an archaeologist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32778672 "Slieve Gullion: Volunteers help repair ancient cairn"].

==Hillwalking==
Slieve Gullion is popular with hillwalkers, with about 20,000 people climbing the mountain every year. A road leads to a small carpark about halfway up the western side of the mountain. From there is a trail leading to the summit. There is also a waymarked trail from the northern side of the mountain. As there is no security on the mountainside, cars parked there are often broken into by thieves, and police have asked visitors not to leave valuables in cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newrytimes.com/2017/08/22/vigilance-urged-after-slieve-gullion-forest-park-robberies/ "Vigilance urged after Slieve Gullion Forest Park robberies"]. Newry Times. 22 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newrytimes.com/2013/11/08/slieve-gullion-park-theft-prompts-police-investigation/ "Slieve Gullion Park theft prompts police investigation"]. Newry Times. 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eastern side of the mountain is Slieve Gullion Forest Park, which includes a visitors' centre, café, playground, and the Giant's Lair Story Trail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ringofgullion.org/things-to-do/slieve-gullion-adventure-playpark/ Slieve Gullion Forest Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Slieve Gullion appears in [[Irish mythology]].

===Fionn and the Cailleach===
In the tale known as ''The Hunt of Slieve Gullion'', [[Áine]] and her sister Milucra both seek after the legendary hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (Finn McCool). Knowing that Áine vowed never to marry a man with grey hair, Milucra secretly puts a spell on the lake atop Slieve Gullion, so that anyone who swam in it would become elderly. She tricks Fionn by asking him to fetch her golden ring from the lake, and he emerges as an old man with grey-white hair. His men, the [[Fianna]], force her to give him a restorative potion from her [[cornucopia]]. Fionn's youth returns, but his hair does not return to its true colour.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.109&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to be the origin of his name, Fionn, meaning 'white'. In some versions of the tale, Milucra is revealed to be the [[Cailleach|Cailleach Bhéara]] (Calliagh Birra), an ancient goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Isabell Augusta (Persse). ''Gods and Fighting Men''. J. Murray, 1904. pp.306-09&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of several features on the mountain refer to the Cailleach Bhéara. The passage grave is known as Calliagh Birra's House and the small lake is called Calliagh Birra's Lough. Lower down, on a hillock called Spellick, is a rock feature called the Calliagh Birra's Chair. Locals would visit it at [[Lughnasadh]] and take turns sitting on the chair.&lt;ref name=tempan&gt;Tempan, Paul. [http://mountainviews.ie/features/names/List2010/MVHillList09.pdf Irish Hill and Mountain Names]. MountainViews.ie.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cú Chulainn===
Slieve Gullion is said to be where the legendary hero [[Cú Chulainn]] (Cuhullin) received his name and where he spent his childhood as Sétanta.

According to myth, the mountain is named after [[Culann]] the [[metalsmith]]. Culann invites [[Conchobar mac Nessa|Conchobhar mac Neasa]], king of Ulster, to a feast at his house on the slopes of Slieve Gullion. On his way, Conchobhar stops at the playing field to watch the boys play [[hurling]]. He is so impressed by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta promises to join him after he finishes his game. Conchobhar goes ahead, but he forgets about Sétanta, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to guard his house. When Sétanta arrives, the hound attacks him, but he kills it; in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, in another by driving a [[sliotar]] (hurling ball) down its throat with his [[Hurley (stick)|hurley]]. Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so Sétanta promises to rear him a replacement, and until it was old enough to do the job, he himself would guard Culann's house. The druid [[Cathbad|Cathbhadh]] announces that his name henceforth would be Cú Chulainn, "Culann's Hound".

In the ''[[Táin Bó Cuailnge]]'', the nearby [[Gap of the North]] is where Cú Chulainn single-handedly fends-off the army of queen [[Medb|Méabh]].&lt;ref&gt;Gribben, Arthur. "Táin Bó Cuailnge: A Place on the Map, A Place in the Mind". ''Western Folklore'' (1990). p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strollology''' or '''Promenadology ''' is the ''[[-logy|science]] of [[strolling]]'' ({{lang-de|'''Spaziergangswissenschaft'''}}) as a method in the field of aesthetics and cultural studies with the aim of becoming aware of the conditions of perception of the environment and enhancement of environmental perception itself.

Based on traditional methods in cultural studies as well as experimental practices like taking reflective walks and aesthetically interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaziergangswissenschaft. In: ders. Warum ist Landschaft schön?|last=Burckhardt|first=Lucius|publisher=Martin Schmitz Verlag|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=257–300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and [[faculty (division)|special field of studies]] was created in the 1980s by the [[Swiss]] [[sociologist]] [[Lucius Burckhardt]], who, at that time, was a professor at the [[University of Kassel]], as an alternative to the [[technocratic]] [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]].

'''Thamel''' ({{lang-ne|ठमेल}}) is a commercial neighbourhood located in [[Kathmandu]], the capital of [[Nepal]]. Thamel has been the centre of the [[tourism|tourist industry]] in Kathmandu for over four decades, starting from the [[hippie]] days when many artists came to Nepal and spent weeks in Thamel. It is the hottest-spot for tourism inside the Kathmandu valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/exploring-kathmandus-dark-star/ |publisher=''[[The Diplomat]]'' |title=Exploring Kathmandu’s ‘Dark Star’ |first=Vishal |last=Arora |date=April 24, 2017 |quote=It’s one of the favorite neighborhoods of foreign backpackers in Nepal, who check in to budget hotels here before leaving for trekking tours or Mount Everest base camps. At first sight, Thamel might look like a tourist hotspot or a red light district, as it boasts numerous hotels, bars, cafés, bookshops, and temples as well as massage parlors and dance bars. |access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thamel is known by its narrow alleys crowded with various shops and vendors. Commonly sold goods include food, fresh vegetables/fruits, pastries, trekking gear, walking gear, music, DVDs, handicrafts, souvenirs, woolen items and clothes. Travel agencies, small grocery stores, budget hotels, restaurants, pubs and clubs also line the streets. Cars, cycle rickshaws, two-wheelers and taxis ply these narrow streets alongside hundreds of pedestrians. Recently many roads in Thamel have been declared vehicle free zones to avoid crowd and traffic havoc.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There are many restaurants in Thamel that serve traditional and continental cuisine, although prices are significantly higher than in non-tourist areas. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers. It boasts a wide range of mountaineering gear shops, foreign money exchange booths, mobile phone shops, along with the numerous travel agents and guest houses. Thamel probably is the best place to enjoy night-life when you are in Kathmandu. Thamel is home to a wide range of the Nepalese population, and serves both entertainment and employment purposes for the locals around the area.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On Wednesday, 28 September 2011, Thamel was declared a full Wi-Fi zone. It is the first Wi-Fi zone of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com/home/index.php/-video-archive-gg/13544-thamel-declared-wifi-zone.html Thamel declared WiFi Zone] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905110329/http://www.nepalnews.com/home/index.php/-video-archive-gg/13544-thamel-declared-wifi-zone.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Signal From Tölva''''' is an [[open world]] [[first-person shooter]] game developed and published by [[Big Robot]]. It was released on April 10, 2017 for Windows, MacOS and Linux.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-signal-from-tolva|title=The Signal From Tolva|website=Metacritic|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking place in the far future, the player character is a hacker-for-hire who hijacks a surveyor robot to investigate the barren world of Tölva in search of a strange signal. The game contains [[walking simulator]] elements, with tactical engagements being broken up by large segments of slow-paced exploration.

The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its setting and [[concept art]]-inspired aesthetic, but criticized its slow walking speed and the simplicity of its gameplay.

== Plot ==
The player character is a mysterious hacker who was contacted by The Broker, who hired them to infiltrate The Surveyors, a faction of robots who are probing the planet Tölva.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/the-signal-from-tolva-review|title=The Signal From Tölva Review|last=Wigmore|first=Glenn|date=2017-04-10|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can remotely commandeer drones located on the planet's surface, but is opposed by two other robotic factions, the Zealots and Bandits, who will attack on sight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game alternates between combat in a first-person shooter style and exploration while traversing the planet's surface in a robot chassis. Robots have access to laser-based weaponry in the form of assault rifles and beam rifles. They also have a defensive shield system, and an area-of-effect attack that can disrupt enemies or heal allies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The player gains the ability to reprogram other robots to assist them in battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

During exploration segments, the player can use a scanner to search for hidden messages and upgrades. The game contains a day/night cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Development ==
The game's visual aesthetic was inspired by the concept art of Ian McQue, who also designed the robots featured in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/quick-look-landscape-art-signal-tolva/|title=A quick look at the landscape art of The Signal From Tölva - Kill Screen|date=2016-12-01|work=Kill Screen|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Signal From Tölva'' received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 69/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chris Schilling of [[PC Gamer]] rated the game 80/100, calling it a "lean, intelligent sci-fi shooter" with a "fascinating setting" and a "watchmaker's eye for detail". He criticized the fact that the game can be "unfair" due to the existence of friendly fire against allies and no way to defend and fortify bases from other factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-signal-from-tlva-review/|title=The Signal From Tölva review|work=pcgamer|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of [[Eurogamer]] called the game a "dark, frustrating work", praising the game's artistic style, story and sound, but criticized the "strong  element of grinding", saying the game later becomes "tedious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-09-the-signal-from-tolva|title=The Signal from Tölva review|last=Evans-Thirlwell|first=Edwin|date=2017-04-10|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Wigmore of IGN rated the game 6.5/10, calling its concept "promising" and its visuals and audio "awe-inspiring", but calling its movement speed "plodding" and the plot only "partially" compelling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Travellers Club''' is a private [[gentlemen's club]] situated at 106 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is the oldest of the surviving [[List of gentlemen's clubs in London|Pall Mall clubs]] and one of the most exclusive, having been established in 1819. It was described as "the [[quintessential English]] gentleman's club" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/07/travel/tr-spano7 Touring the manly realm of London's Travellers Club] Los Angeles Times, November 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The original concept of the club, by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] and others, dates from the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They envisaged a club where gentlemen who travelled abroad might meet and offer hospitality to distinguished foreign visitors. The original rules of 1819 excluded from membership anyone ''“who has not travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least five hundred miles from London in a direct line”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/travellersclub.htm|title=Victorian London - Entertainment and Recreation - Clubs - Travellers Club; (Peter Cunningham, Hand-Book of London, 1850)|website=www.victorianlondon.org|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The members of the club's first Committee included the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] (later Prime Minister), [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] (after whom [[Auckland]], New Zealand is named), the [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] (who had already served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later refused office as Prime Minister) and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (later Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister).

Subsequent members included statesmen and travellers such as Prime Minister [[George Canning]],&lt;ref name=TCH&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Club History and Building| work =| publisher =The Travellers Club| date =| url =http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| doi =| accessdate =2008-09-23| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080726164615/http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| archivedate =2008-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], Prime Minister [[Arthur Balfour]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Francis Beaufort]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (creator of the [[Beaufort scale]]), [[Robert FitzRoy]] of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Sir [[William Edward Parry]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (explorer of the [[Northwest Passage]]), Sir [[Roderick Murchison]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} (after whom the [[Murchison crater]] on the [[Moon]] is named) and Sir [[Wilfred Thesiger]].&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Novelist [[Anthony Powell]] was a member, and the club is featured in various guises in the work of [[Graham Greene]], [[Jules Verne]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and John le Carré.

The club's members include members of the British and foreign royal families, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] whilst in office, and various ambassadors to London; a tradition still continued today and there is also a special category of membership for particularly distinguished travellers, explorers and travel writers. Such well-known current members include Field Marshal [[Edwin Bramall|Lord Bramall]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and [[Terry Waite]].&lt;ref name=TGP&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4718049/So-what-should-an-English-gentleman-do.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=So what should an English gentleman do? | date=1999-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its membership remains exclusive, although there are a number of connections with other clubs throughout the world whose members may use its premises from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Club Guide Accessed May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Welby]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, announced in 2014 that he would resign from the club, owing to its refusal to admit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10972976/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-will-quit-gentlemens-club-that-voted-against-female-members.html|title=Archbishop of Canterbury will quit gentlemen's club that voted against female members|first=Raziye|last=Akkoc|date=17 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premises==
The club's original premises were at 12 Waterloo Place. It moved to 49 Pall Mall in 1821 (a building which had once been occupied by [[Brooks's]]). However, it quickly outgrew this building and in 1826 the members decided to spend £25,000 on the construction of a purpose built club house on the present site at 106 Pall Mall, backing onto Carlton gardens.

The architect was Sir [[Charles Barry]] who was later to be the architect for the [[Houses of Parliament]], and the Travellers Club building proved to be one of his masterpieces. It takes the form of a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] palace which is said to have been inspired by [[Raphael]]'s Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence. It was completed in 1832, with the tower (which had been in Barry's original design) added in 1842.

The club building includes a smoking room (a large common room which looks over Carlton Gardens), the cocktail bar and adjacent Bramall room (which gives access to [[Carlton House Terrace#Carlton Gardens|Carlton Gardens]]), the Outer Morning Room (a large drawing room overlooking Pall Mall, and connecting to an Inner Morning Room), and the dining room (known as the Coffee Room). ''[[The Times]]'' on 10 January 2004 noted ''"the wonderful dining, heavy on fish and game (partridges to [[potted shrimps]]) with echoes of public school food (bread pudding) and a superb wine cellar"''.

The magnificent library is decorated with a cast of the [[Bassae Frieze]] from the 5th century BCE [[Greek temple]] of Apollo Epicurius at [[Bassae]]. The originals of this frieze were discovered by the architect [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], who was on the first Committee of the Club in 1819, and they are now in the [[British Museum]]. The library has a large and important collection of books, from the antiquarian to the modern, mainly on travel.

There are a number of bedrooms at the club for out-of-town members. The dress code is formal at all times.

[[Image:Treasurehouse.jpg|thumb|The Treasure House]]
The '''Treasure House''' is a historic building located in [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], US. Samuel Grasset, a [[tanning (leather)|tanner]] and leather worker, built the original construction in approximately 1700. Additions were made in 1740, 1790 and 1860. Subsequent owners of the house in subsequent centuries include a cord wainer (shoemaker), innkeeper, stonemason, and coach trimmer. A number of local businesses have also occupied the structure. The house was named after a legend that a cache of [[American Revolutionary War]] era gold coins was discovered during renovation in about 1860.
