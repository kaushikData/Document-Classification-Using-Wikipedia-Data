{{Spartan Constitution}}
The '''Apella''' ({{lang-el|Ἀπέλλα}}) was the popular [[deliberative assembly]] in the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]], corresponding to the ''[[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' in most other Greek states. Every Spartan male full citizen who had completed his thirtieth year was entitled to attend the meetings, which, according to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]{{'}} ordinance, must be held at the time of each full moon within the boundaries of Sparta.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apella|volume=2|page=160|first=Marcus Niebuhr|last=Tod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word is derived from the [[Dorians|Doric]] word ''apella'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}}), which originally meant wall, enclosure of stones,  and later assembly  of people  within the limits of the square.&lt;ref&gt;Spartan verb: {{lang|grc|ἀπελλάζειν}}, and the festival {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}, which surely belonged to Apollo: Nilsson, Vol I p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from  the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word ''pélla'' ({{lang|grc|πέλλα}}), "stone", which appears in some toponyms in Greece like [[Pella]] ({{lang|grc|Πέλλα }}) and Pallini ({{lang|grc|Παλλήνη}}). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2380486 Πέλλα / Pella], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt;The explanation is given by  [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]: ''apellai'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}), ''sekoi'' ({{lang|grc|σηκοί}} "folds"), ''ecclesiai'' ({{lang|grc|ἐκκλησίαι}}: popular assemblies).&lt;ref&gt;Ηeschych. {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι, σηκοί, ἐκκλησίαι, ἀρχαιρεσίαι}}: Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apelazw&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)pella/zw&amp;highlight=a%29pe%2Fllai {{lang|el|απελλάζω}} in Liddell and Scott's lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival ''[[apellai]]'' was surely dedicated to the god  [[Apollo]]  ([[Dorians|Doric]] form: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}) and it was  spread by the [[Dorians]] in central-Greece, as it is proved by the use of the month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλαιος}}). &lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2311830 Ἀπελλαῖος]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The meetings had in all probability taken place originally in the Agora, but were later transferred to the neighbouring building known as the Skias.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Paus]]. iii. 12. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; According to [[Plutarch]], a  [[Great Rhetra]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Ogden, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/632735 Crooked speech]: the genesis of the Spartan rhetra, ''[[Journal of Hellenic Studies|JHS]]'' 114 (1994) 85-102.&lt;/ref&gt;  was given by [[Pythia]] to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The old aristocratic council,  was  substituted by the [[gerousia]]  (thirty elders  including  the two kings). The meetings  of the   "apella" should take place from time to time, and the citizens should  have the power to debate and take the decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch|Plut]]. ''[[:s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Lycurgus|Lycurg]]. VI, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mosse168&gt;C. Mosse, p.  168-171&lt;/ref&gt;  This  right  of the citizens  was very soon  limited.  The kings Theopompus and Polydorus, probably during the 7th century BC, added to the "rhetra" that  the kings and the elders ([[gerousia]])  could set aside any "crooked" decision of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch|Plut]]. ''[[:s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Lycurgus|Lycurg]].'' VI,4,5  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.%20Lyc.%206&amp;lang=original]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mosse168/&gt;

The presiding officers were at first the kings, but in historical times the [[ephor]]s, and the voting was conducted by assessing the loudness of shouting in the crowd; if the president was doubtful as to the majority of voices, a division was taken and the votes were counted.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Vote by shouting could be seen as the first type of [[range voting]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangevoting.org/SpartaBury.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The apella  simply accepted  or rejected  the proposals submitted to it.  In later times, too, the actual debate was almost, if not wholly, confined to the kings, elders, [[ephor]]s and perhaps the other magistrates. The apella voted on peace and war, treaties and foreign policy in general: it decided which of the kings should conduct a campaign and settled questions of disputed succession to the throne: it elected elders, ephors and other magistrates, emancipated [[helot]]s and perhaps voted on legal proposals.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

There is a single reference&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon|Xen]]. ''[[:s:Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hell]].'' iii. 3. 8&lt;/ref&gt; to a "small assembly" ({{lang|el|ἡ μικρὰ καλουμένη ἐκκλησία}}) at Sparta, but nothing is known as to its nature or competence. The term ''apella'' does not occur in extant Spartan inscriptions, though two decrees of [[Gythium]] belonging to the Roman period refer to the μεγάλαι ἀπέλλαι.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apelazw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Bas-Foucart, ''Voyage archéologique'', ii., Nos. 242a, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

The apella was responsible for electing men to the [[gerousia]] for life. Candidates were selected from the aristocrats and presented before the apella. The candidate who received the loudest applause became a member of the gerousia.

The apella also elected the five [[ephor]]s annually. Ephors presided over meetings of the gerousia and the apella. They could not run for re-election.

The gerousia presented motions before the apella. The apella then voted on the motions. However, unlike the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]] in [[Athens]], the apella did not debate; it merely approved or disapproved of measures. Moreover, the gerousia always had the power to veto the decision of the apella.

==Air Fleet==

Many fixed-wing aircraft of the PGR were obtained after having been confiscated, so their air fleet consists of various types, of which very few are appropriate to the tasks of combatting drug trafficking. Its current fleet consists of Commander Gulfstream jets 840, 900, 980 to 1000, [[Learjet]], Citation I and II, and Grumman. They also operate several types of Cessna and [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft King Air]] aircraft.

During the administration of President Fox, most of the PGR's air fleet - just over 100 units - was abandoned because required maintenance had not been performed. In November 2007, during the administration of President Felipe Calderon, the PGR transferred 58 helicopters to the Ministry of National Defense (SEDENA) to be fixed and readied to work in the eradication of illegal drug crops.&lt;ref&gt;[PGR gave http://www.el-universal.com.mx/nacion/156121.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sedena inoperable aircraft to destroy crops]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the PGR submitted an official request to the Ministry of Finance to purchase 30 new [[Eurocopter]] helicopters for surveillance and interception.

===Inventory===
* 26 [[Bell UH-1H]]
* 7 [[Bell 212]]
* 1 [[Bell 407]]
* 2 [[Bell LR 206]]
* 11 [[Schweizer 333]]

:''For the Israeli political party, see [[Labor Party (Israel)]].''
'''Avoda''', or '''Avodah''' ({{Lang-he-n|עֲבוֹדָה}}), is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word, literally meaning "work, worship, and service".

In a modern context, usually referring to business-type activities, it can also mean [[agricultural]] work and, more traditionally, serving God.

In its original, traditional sense, "avodah" was applied to sacrifices offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The word was also used to describe the epitome of sacrificial rite, the complex and fraught main service of [[Kohen Gadol|The High Priest]] on [[Yom Kippur]] (The Day of Atonement). Today it refers to a liturgical reenactment of the aforementioned ceremony which is recited during the [[Musaf]] [[Amidah]] of Yom Kippur.

==Avodah in Chassidism==

In [[chassidism]]: Avodah generally refers to Divine service (or worship). For example, it's part of the Divine service to serve God with joy.

"eizohi ''Avodah'' shebelev? zu Teffilah."&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli, Ta'anit 2a&lt;/ref&gt; -translated as "What is the service of the heart? That is teffilah, prayer." That is why in chassidism there is a great emphasis on prayer.

==Avodah and Bnei Akiva==

Avodah is one of the two words that underlie the [[ideology]] of the [[Bnei Akiva]] movement. (The other is [[Torah]]).

In this ideological framework, the word was originally utilised in a strictly agricultural context. "Avodah" meant working on a kibbutz.

In more recent years, Bnei Akiva has had to redefine the terminology. Tens of thousands of its members currently live, or plan to live in an urban setting in Israel. Furthermore, it is generally perceived that the "needs" of Israel have developed somewhat since Bnei Akiva was founded. Draining malarial swamps and "turning the desert green" have assumed somewhat lower priorities than in earlier years. To give an example from [[exporting]], Israel is now known for its [[high tech]] industries as much as for its [[Jaffa orange]]s.

The movement has therefore subtly redefined Avodah, to mean work that contributes towards the building up of the land of Israel.

The '''Act Constituting the Government of Democratic Transition and National Unity''' ({{lang-es|Acta de Constitución del Gobierno de Transición Democrática y Unidad Nacional}}) — known colloquially as the "'''Carmona Decree'''" or ''el carmonazo''&lt;ref&gt;
From the surname of [[Pedro Carmona]] and the suffix ''-azo,'' which implies a blow and/or magnitude: see [[Spanish nouns#Other suffixes|Spanish nouns: Other suffixes]]. See also: [http://www.scielo.org.ve/scielo.php?script=sci_isoref&amp;pid=S0459-12832006000100008&amp;lng=pt Los procesos de legitimación y deslegitimación discursivas en la prensa escrita venezolana]. Pérez de Pérez, Anneris. ''Letras''. 2006, vol.48, no.72, accessed 29 May 2007, p.349-363.&lt;/ref&gt;
— was a document drawn up on 12 April 2002 the day following the [[Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002]], which attempted to oust [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]].

This Act established a transitional government, dissolving the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] and the [[Supreme Court (Venezuela)|Supreme Court]] and also suspending the Attorney General, Comptroller General, [[List of Governors of States of Venezuela|governors]] and mayors elected during Chávez's administration.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''BBC news''. (''BBC'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_3718000/3718810.stm Venezuela investiga el "Carmonazo"]. Retrieved 13 June 2006. {{es_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''BBC news''. (''BBC'' 13 April 2002) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1927322.stm Interim Venezuelan president sworn in] Retrieved 31 Aug 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clauses==
Within the Act, the basis for the formation of a transitional government is delineated, citing the [[Constitution of Venezuela]]. The Act principally cites Article 350 of the Constitution, which says the People of Venezuela shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights.&lt;ref name=Decreto&gt;''Venezuela Analitica'' (''Analitica'' 2002). [http://www.analitica.com/Bitblio/carmona_estanga/decreto1.asp Acta de constitución del Gobierno de Transición Democrática y Unidad Nacional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102054750/http://www.analitica.com/bitblio/carmona_estanga/decreto1.asp |date=2 January 2010 }} Retrieved 24 Jul 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also alleges violations by the Chávez administration of Articles 43, 57, 58, 68, 136, 141, 145, 204, 211, 254, 270, 273, 279, 294, 295 and 328 of the Constitution, and it references the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter|Democratic Charter]]  of the [[Organization of American States]] and [[2002_Venezuelan_coup_d'état_attempt#Ch.C3.A1vez.27s_detention|Chávez's supposed resignation the day before]].

Remembering the date of 11 April 2002 "with profound indignation and national mourning," it accuses the government of Chávez of:&lt;ref name=Decreto/&gt;

*Attacking, repressing, and assassinating innocent peaceful demonstrators.
*Compromising democratic principles, particularly representative democracy.
*Human and property rights violations.
*Flagrant violation of separation and independence of powers.
*Corruption.
*Misuse of the armed forces.
*Promoting a climate of social violence.
*Unacceptable isolationist foreign policy, aiding Colombian guerrillas.
*Eliminating autonomy of the electoral process.
*Enacting an [[enabling act]] without consulting the electorate.
*Promoting violence via its [[Bolivarian Circles]].
*Disrespecting institutions necessary for peaceful democratic coexistence.

==Articles==
''The Act'' declares the formation of a democratic and national unity transition government, according to the following articles:&lt;ref name=Decreto/&gt;

'''Article I'''
Designated [[Pedro Carmona Estanga]] President of Venezuela in charge of the Executive Branch.

'''Article II'''
Re-established the country's name as ''República de Venezuela''.

'''Article III'''
Suspended the National Assembly, with new elections to be held no later than December 2002.

'''Article IV'''

'''Article V'''
Named the President of Venezuela to coordinate the interim period.

'''Article VI'''
Established that Presidential elections would occur in no later than 365 days, and the interim President may not be a candidate.

'''Article VII'''

'''Article VIII'''
Reorganized public offices to recuperate autonomy and independence, removing officials illegitimately named to their posts as members of the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Court]], Attorney General, Comptroller General, and members of the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]].  These positions would be filled as soon as possible with consultation of the Ministers and Advisory Council.

'''Article IX'''

'''Article X'''
Upheld all other laws both internal and international, as long as they do not disagree with the present Act.

'''Article XI'''
All members of the transitional government will abandon their posts once their newly elected counterparts take charge.

==Aftermath==
The Act was the catalyst that allowed the Armed Forces to justify abandoning the newly formed government,&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; returning Chávez to power on 13 April. After Chávez was re-instated as president, controversy regarding those that signed ''The Act'' remained.&lt;ref&gt;''Venezuela Analitica'' (''Analitica'' 2002).

'''Compulsory purchase''' is the power to acquire rights over an estate in [[English land law]], or to buy that estate outright, without the current owner's consent in return for compensation. In England and Wales, Parliament has granted several different kinds of compulsory purchase power, which are exercisable by various bodies in various situations.  Such powers are "for the public benefit", but this expression is interpreted very broadly.

==History==
[[File:Surrey Iron Railway watercolour.jpg|thumb|right|After the [[enclosure]] movement, the [[Surrey Railways Act 1801]]&lt;ref&gt;This is a [[Local Act of Parliament]], found under the reference of Acts in 1801 (41 Geo. 3) c. xxxiii, Surrey Railways. Listed at [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/chron-tables/local/2 legislation.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; used compulsory purchase to build the [[Surrey Iron Railway]]. Courts since have fought over the extent to which [[eminent domain]] is used for the public good.]]
Although land may be acquired by consent, and conduct which raises another party's reasonable expectations, these private methods of acquiring land are often insufficient for adequate public regulation.&lt;ref&gt;See K Gray and SF Gray, ''Land Law'' (7th edn 2011) Ch 11, 563–569&lt;/ref&gt; Building national infrastructure, such as railways, housing, and sewerage, as well as democratically determined planning rules, either by national or local government, typically requires [[compulsory purchase]], because private owners might not give up land required for public works except at an extortionate price. Historically, compulsory purchases were carried out under the [[Inclosure Acts]] and their predecessors, where [[enclosure]] was frequently a method of expropriating people from [[common land]] for the benefit of barons and landlords. In the [[industrial revolution]], most railways were built by private companies procuring compulsory purchase rights from private Acts of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;Procedures were consolidated by the [[Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]] and the [[Inclosure Act 1845]].&lt;/ref&gt; though by the late 19th century, powers of compulsory purchase slowly became more transparent and used for general social welfare, as with the [[Public Health Act 1875]], or the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Public Health Act 1875]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/38-39/55/part/V/crossheading/purchase-of-lands/enacted ss 175–178] and [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/48-49/72/crossheading/labouring-glasses-lodging-houses/enacted s 2(2)] for compulsory purchase provisions.&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory purchase legislation was significantly extended during [[World War One]] for military use,&lt;ref&gt;[[Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916]]&lt;/ref&gt; and after the war for housing, as certain principles became standardised.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local authority purchase==
Today, the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]] section 5 generally requires that the owner of an interest in land (e.g. a freehold, leasehold or easement as in ''[[Re Ellenborough Park]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1955] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1955/4.html EWCA Civ 4], [1956] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;) receives payment for the "value of the land... if sold on an open market by a willing seller".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung Ironworks Ltd]]'' [1995] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/1995_7.html UKPC 7], on the assessments for compensation.&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation is often also available for losses to a home, or if one's business has to move.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]]'' [1976] 1 WLR 852&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]] set conditions for a purchase to be made, and the [[Acquisition of Land Act 1981]] regulates the conditions for granting a "[[Compulsory Purchase Order]]". Typically, either central government represented by a Secretary of State, or a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]] will be interested in making a compulsory purchase. The authority of local councils for make purchases for specific reasons can be set out in specific legislation, such as the [[Highways Act 1980]] to build roads when strictly necessary. However the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] section 226,&lt;ref&gt;Inserted by the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]] s 99&lt;/ref&gt; which allows compulsory purchase to "facilitate the carrying out of development, re-development or improvement" for the area's economic, social, or environmental well being, must be confirmed by the Secretary of State, and similarly the [[Local Government Act 1972]] section 121 requires the council seek approval from the government Minister,&lt;ref&gt;[[Local Government Act 1972]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/part/VII/crossheading/land-transactions-principal-councils s 121]&lt;/ref&gt; a time-consuming process which prevents compulsory purchase being carried out without co-ordination in central government.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Leasehold purchase==
[[File:Upper Brook Street - geograph.org.uk - 1422552.jpg|Left|thumb|The [[Grosvenor family]], which arrived with [[William the Conqueror]], own most of [[Mayfair]] and [[Belgravia]] in [[central London]] since [[Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet|Sir Thomas]] married into inheritance of the land in 1677. The [[Grosvenor estate]] lost human rights challenges to the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[James v United Kingdom]]'' [1986] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html ECHR 2]&lt;/ref&gt; giving tenants a "[[right to buy]]", but the legislation was restricted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most general power originally appeared in the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]]. Under that Act, the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1987]], and the [[Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1992]], private individuals who are leaseholders have the power in certain circumstances to compel their landlord to extend a lease or to sell the freehold at a valuation.

Recompense, under compulsory purchase, is not necessarily a monetary payment of open market value (see ''[[James v United Kingdom]]'' [1986]), but in most cases a sum equivalent to a valuation made as if between a willing seller and a willing purchaser will fall due to the previous owner.

==Utility companies==
Utility companies have statutory powers to, for example, erect electrical substations or lay sewers or water pipes on or through someone else's land.  These powers are counterbalanced by corresponding rights for landowners to compel utility companies to remove cables, pipes or sewers in other circumstances (see for example section 185 of the [[Water Industry Act 1991]]).

Compulsory purchase only applies to the extent that it is necessary for the purchaser's purposes.  Thus, for example, a water authority does not need to buy the freehold in land in order to run a sewer through it.  An [[easement]] will normally suffice, so in such cases the water authority may only acquire an easement through the use of compulsory purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Although this principle protects the land above the pipe, in practice, water pipes and their associated manholes and inspection chambers are owned by the water authority in fee simple, until the pipe reaches the boundary of the property it serves, irrespective of who owns the land above.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
In most cases a [[Compulsory Purchase Order]] (CPO) is made by the purchasing authority or the Secretary of State.  The CPO must unambiguously identify the land affected and set out the owners, where these are known.  The order is then served on all owners and tenants with a tenancy with more than a month to run, or affixed to the land if some owners or tenants cannot be traced.  A period of at least 21 days is allowed for objections. If there is a valid objection that is not withdrawn, an inquiry chaired by an inspector will take place.  The inspector reports to the Secretary of State.  If the Secretary of State confirms the CPO, then it becomes very difficult to challenge.

Once the CPO is confirmed, the purchasing authority must serve a Notice to Treat within three years, and a Notice of Entry within a further three years.  It may take possession of the land not less than 14 days after serving the Notice of Entry. The Notice to Treat requires the land's owner to respond, and is usually the trigger for the land's owner to submit a claim for its value. If no claim is submitted within 21 days of the Notice to Treat, the acquirer can refer the matter to the Lands Tribunal. If the land's owner cannot be traced and does not respond to a Notice to Treat affixed to the land, then the purchasing authority must pay the compensation figure to the Court.

==Crichel Down rules==
{{see also|Crichel Down affair}}
The [[Crichel Down affair|Crichel Down]] principles oblige central and local government, when, having acquired an estate compulsorily, they find they no longer need it, to offer it in the first instance to the person from whom they acquired it at its market value. However, this only applies where the land has not materially changed in character, and does not withstand the principle that councils may not dispose of land "for a consideration less than the best that can be obtained" under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], section 123. This means that where it is difficult to value land for some reason, the land may need to be sold by tender or auction.

==Human rights==
Because of property's social importance, either for personal consumption and use or for mass production,&lt;ref&gt;[[AA Berle]], 'Property, Production and Revolution' (1965) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1120512 65 Columbia Law Review 1], distinguishes personal and productive property, and posits that the justifications for regulation of productive property, particularly that held collectively by a corporation, become stronger.&lt;/ref&gt; compulsory purchase laws have met with human rights challenges. One concern is that since the 1980s privatisations, many compulsory purchase powers can be used for the benefit of private corporations whose incentives may diverge from the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;K Gray and S Gray, 'Private Property and Public Propriety', in J McLean (ed), ''Property and the Constitution'' (Hart 1999) 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Water Resources Act 1991]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/57/part/VII/chapter/I s 154]&lt;/ref&gt; continues to allow government bodies to order compulsory purchases of people's property,&lt;ref&gt;Currently the [[Environment Agency]] under the [[Environment Act 1995]] s 2(1)(a)(iv)&lt;/ref&gt; although profits go to the private shareholders of [[UK water companies]]. In ''[[R (Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd) v Wolverhampton CC]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2010] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/20.html UKSC 20]&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that [[Wolverhampton City Council]] acted for an improper purpose when it took into account a promise by [[Tesco]] to redevelop another site, in determining whether to make a compulsory purchase order over a site possessed by [[Sainsbury's]]. [[Lord Walker]] stressed that "powers of compulsory acquisition, especially in a "private to private" acquisition, amounts to a serious invasion of the current owner's proprietary rights."&lt;ref&gt;[2010] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/20.html UKSC 20], [84]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless compulsory purchase orders have frequently been used to acquire land that is passed back to a private owner, including in ''[[Alliance Spring Ltd v First Secretary]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2005] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/18.html EWHC 18 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt; where homes in [[Islington]] were purchased to build the [[Emirates stadium]] for [[Arsenal Football Club]]. By contrast, in ''[[James v United Kingdom]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1986] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html ECHR 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]], the inherited owner of most of [[Mayfair]] and [[Belgravia]], contended that leaseholders' right to buy had violated their [[right to property]] in [[ECHR Protocol 1, article 1]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]], which allowed tenants to purchase properties from their private landlords, was within a member state's margin of appreciation. It was competent for a member state to regulate property rights in the public interest.

Another issue of whether regulatory or planning decisions in general might breach property rights has not been important for the United Kingdom. In a divided case by the [[US Supreme Court]] called ''[[Lucas v South Carolina Coastal Council]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|505|1003|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; a majority held that if a regulation prevented a property owner developing land (in this case to preserve coastline beaches) compensation would have to be paid. This has not been followed in most of the rest of the Commonwealth,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Canada, ''[[Mariner Real Estate Ltd v Nova Scotia]]'' (1999) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/1999/1999canlii7241/1999canlii7241.html 177 DLR (4th) 696]&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Grape Bay Ltd v Attorney General of Bermuda]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1999/43.html UKPC 43]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Privy Council]] advised that a decision by a democratic legislature is better than a court to determine issues of social and economic policy in relation to property. Here, [[McDonald's]] attempted to sue [[Bermuda]] for passing legislation to prevent it opening a restaurant as a breach of "property rights" under the Bermudan constitution, which it said consisted in the expectation of being able to run a business and various contractual arrangements to that end. [[Lord Hoffmann]] held that there was no such violation of property, noting that the "give and take of civil society frequently requires that the exercise of private rights should be restricted in the general public interest." The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, though not fully clear, indicates a similar approach.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Matos e Silva, LDA v Portugal]]'' [1996] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/37.html ECHR 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8891">{{Politics of Lithuania}}
The '''Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania''' (in {{lang-lt|Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas}}) is a special court established by the [[Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania]] of 1992; it began the activities after the adoption of the Law on Constitutional Court of the [[Republic of Lithuania]] on February 3, 1993. Since its inception, the Court has been located in the city of [[Vilnius]], [[Gediminas Avenue]].

The main task of the court is [[judicial review]]. It may therefore declare the acts of the [[Seimas]] [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] and thus render them ineffective. As such, it is somewhat similar to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. However, it differs from it and other [[supreme court]]s in that it is not part of the regular judicial system, but more a unique judicial branch. Most importantly, it does not serve as a regular [[court of appeals]] from lower courts or as a sort of “superappellate court” on any violation of national laws. 
{{stack|[[File:Lithuanian Constitutional Court.jpg|thumb|The Court's palace on [[Gediminas Avenue]]]]}}
Its jurisdiction is focused on constitutional issues, the integrity of the Constitution. Moreover, it adjudicates on the conformance of the acts of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania to the laws, compliance with the Constitution of international agreements, as well as their ratification, and takes a final decision on voting infringements.

==Activities==
The Court has played a substantial role in the development of the [[Law of Lithuania|Lithuanian legal system]], declaring a number of national laws unconstitutional. 
On March 31, 2004, it issued a ruling acknowledging the breach of the [[oath of office]] by the President [[Rolandas Paksas]]. He was removed from office by Seimas following the [[impeachment]] on April 6, 2004; this has been the first successful case of impeachment of the head of state in the history of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/04/dea1b82e-15e4-4651-a95e-b4e294eff047.html Lithuania: Paksas Becomes First European President To Be Removed From Office] Accessed January 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling interpreted the Constitution as precluding a person, who was pleaded guilty for the breach of oath, from assuming any future position in public service, which requires taking an oath.

==Composition==
The Court comprises nine justices, elected by the Seimas, for a nine-year non-renewable term of office. Only Lithuanian citizens of an impeccable reputation, who are trained in law, and who have served for at least 10 years in the legal profession, or in an area of legal education are eligible for appointment. Usually, notable legal scholars and highly experienced judges qualify for the position. The candidates are nominated by the Chairman of the Seimas, the [[President of Lithuania]] and the President of the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Lithuania]], 3 persons each. The Seimas appoints the President of the Court from among the justices upon the nomination by the President of the state.

The '''Consumer Credit Act 1974''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/contents c 39]) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that significantly reformed the law relating to [[consumer credit]] within the [[United Kingdom]].

Prior to the Consumer Credit Act, legislation covering consumer credit was slapdash and focused on particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and [[hire-purchase]] agreements. Following the report of the Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|a general election]], the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974.

The Act introduces new protection for consumers and new regulation for bodies trading in consumer credit and related industries. Such traders must have full licenses from the [[Office of Fair Trading]], which may be suspended or revoked in the event of irregularities. The Act also regulates what may be taken as [[Security (finance)|security]], limits the ways in which credit organisations can advertise and gives the [[county court]] the ability to intercede in the case of unfair or unjust credit agreements. It also gives additional rights to the debtor, including certain limited rights to cancel concluded agreements. The Act was amended by the [[Consumer Credit Act 2006]].

==Background==

===Early evolution of consumer protection===
[[Credit (finance)#Consumer credit|Consumer credit]] regulation was almost entirely ignored by both Parliament and the courts for over 800 years, with the judges and [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]] taking the attitude that there was no reason to interfere with fairly concluded [[English contract law|contracts]]. The first piece of legislation to deal with consumer credit was the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]], which required [[bill of sale|bills of sale]] to be registered. This allowed the courts to intervene for the first time, since an unregistered bill of sale was void and could not be claimed by creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This act was followed by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] and the [[Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882]], which provided limited protection for debtors. Outside of these acts, however, little was done between 1854 and 1900, and moneylenders used this to their advantage, sometimes abusively; the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Money-Lending in 1898 included testimony from one moneylender who admitted he charged 3,000% interest, while another had worked under 34 different aliases to avoid having notoriety associated with his name.&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Goode (1979) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this report the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] was passed, which required registration for moneylenders and allowed the courts to dissolve "unfair" moneylending agreements. This act had two main weaknesses, however; firstly, many of the debtors who would like to sue their moneylender to have the agreement cancelled were by definition poor, and could not afford legal representation. Secondly, the Act only focused on specific types of lenders; lending by a single moneylender was covered, lending by a bank was not. In 1927 a [[Moneylenders Act 1927|second Moneylenders Act]] was passed, which required licensing as well as registration and forbade moneylenders from employing agents, canvasses or sending out unsolicited advertisements.&lt;ref name=g3/&gt; Unfortunately the 1900 and 1927 Acts also covered commercial transactions, and since people lending money in a commercial area were not excluded as banks were, a slight infraction could make a loan completely irrecoverable. This was partially solved with the passing of the [[Companies Act 1967]], which allowed the [[Board of Trade]] to give individual moneylenders licenses saying that they were acting as banks, not moneylenders.&lt;ref name=g4&gt;Goode (1979) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the restrictions on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of [[hire-purchase]] developed. These were first regulated by the [[Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932]], which only covered [[Scotland]]; England and Wales was first covered by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1938]], later amended by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1954]] and the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]]. The 1965 Act applied to all hire-purchase agreements worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowther Committee===
In 1965 the Crowther Committee was established to look at the state of consumer credit law in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan (2005) p.420&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Lord Crowther]], the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a Consumer Sale and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use.

The reaction to the report from consumer and business organisations was overwhelmingly positive, but the government initially did nothing, since the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] wanted time to work out the particular details of any Acts. Their hand was eventually forced by [[Norah Phillips, Baroness Phillips|Baroness Phillips]] a year later, who initiated a debate in the [[House of Lords]] on the matter. The government's official statement was that they were willing to accept almost all the recommendations made about consumer credit, they did not wish to legislate on lending and securities.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1973 they created a Voluntary Code which they expected those lending to observe. The Code set out guidelines for loaning money to individuals and disclosing the cost of the loan.

In September 1973 the government issued a [[white paper]] titled ''Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit'' in which they indicated they were planning to implement almost all of the Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from £2,000 to £5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Goode (1979) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the Act==
The Act was first introduced to Parliament as the Consumer Credit Bill at the beginning of November 1973, and initially ran to 96 pages. It was given its [[second reading]] on 14 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/nov/14/consumer-credit-bill|title=CONSUMER CREDIT BILL (Hansard, 14 November 1973)|date=14 November 1973|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was welcomed by both the government and opposition.By February 1974 it had passed through the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Committee stage|Committee Stage]], but its progress was cut short by a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the same month. Thanks to the support of the opposition to the original bill this did not make a significant impact, and the new administration immediately reintroduced the bill in the [[House of Lords]]. It was passed on 31 July 1974, and immediately received the [[Royal Assent]].&lt;ref name=g10&gt;Goode (1979) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the act contained 193 sections and 5 schedules, much larger than the original 96 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act is divided into 12 sections, and is "designed to provide a comprehensive code regulating the consumer credit and consumer hire fgb and almost every aspect of a credit granting operation".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Director General of Fair Trading===
The office of Director General of Fair Trading was created by the [[Fair Trading Act 1973]], with the Director appointed by the government for a five-year term. Consumer credit was not originally part of his duties (although the scope of his role did contain some elements of consumer credit) and the [[Crowther Committee]] had recommended the creation of a separate Consumer Credit Commissioner, something included in the original bill. When the bill was resurrected after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] general election, however, it was decided that the duties should instead be given to the Office of Fair Trading, and for this purpose a separate division (the Division of Consumer Credit) was set up within the OFT.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Act gives the Director General of Fair Trading the duties of administering the licensing system set up by the Act, supervising the working and enforcement of the Act and any regulations made by it and, if appropriate, enforce the Act and regulations himself. The DGFT is also tasked with advising the government about social and commercial developments within the United Kingdom, and any actions taken to enforce the Act and its orders and regulations. Section 4 of the act requires him to disseminate any appropriate information and advice about consumer credit to the people of the United Kingdom. This allows him to educate the public about consumer credit, and was intended to be conducted through organisations such as the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]. The Director's duties under this Act overlap slightly with those given by the Fair Trading Act, but are still an expansion over his original role.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.43&lt;/ref&gt; The Director General is tasked with issuing licenses, and under Section 35 of the Act, the Director is required to maintain a register containing all appropriate information related to licenses and applications for licenses. The register was created on 2 February 1976, and is kept at Chancery House in London.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] formally substituted the Office of Fair Trading for the Director General of Fair Trading for the purposes of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Act 2002 S.278-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Credit agreements, hire agreements and linked transactions===
Part II contains definitions for many types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit agreements, regulated consumer hire agreements and partially regulated agreements.

====Regulated agreements====
A regulated consumer credit agreement is defined as an agreement between two parties, one of whom (the debtor) is an individual, and the other of whom (the creditor) is "any other person", in which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not exceeding £5,000 (this figure was subsequently increased to £25,000 and under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 there is no upper limit). An exception to this definition is so-called "exempt agreements", which are agreements made where the creditor is a land improvement company, a charity, a [[friendly society]], a trade union, an insurance company or "a body corporate named or specifically referred to in any public general Act".&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Credit Act 1974 S.16(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "agreement" is given as any discussion which produces a legal relationship; a [[English contract law|contract]]. As such the decision of courts as to whether an agreement constituted an "agreement" under the Act rests with English contract law, and is not discussed within the Act. In many cases this is largely academic, however, since unless one party tries to contest the existence of a contract any agreement can proceed regardless of its validity under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

"Individual" is defined as including a partnership or other unincorporated body, but not corporations registered at [[Companies House]] or created by an [[Act of Parliament]] or [[Royal Charter]], such as the [[BBC]]. The definition also excludes "corporations sole", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the [[Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965]], [[industrial and provident society|industrial and provident societies]] are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of "person" includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulated consumer hire agreement is defined as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement must be "capable of subsisting" for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than £5,000 total and not be an "exempt agreement". "Goods" are defined as [[Personal property|chattels personal]], with "capable of subsisting" simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement does not have to exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partially regulated agreements====
Partially regulated agreements are those consumer hire or consumer credit agreements which are not an exempt agreement but are exempt from certain provisions of the Act. What these provisions are depends on the type of agreement; small agreements, non-commercial agreements and contracts with a foreign element.

Small agreements are defined in Section 17 of the act as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed £30 and regulated consumer hire agreements which do not require the hirer to pay more than £30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under £30 to avoid regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;  Small agreements are exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is primarily aimed at commercial and professional traders, and as a result excludes non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements are defined by the Act as agreements where neither the creditor nor debtor are providing the transaction for business purposes in any way. Non-commercial agreements are exempt from Part V of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts with a foreign element would not normally be mentioned in Acts of Parliament, which are deliberately constructed to avoid giving the law extraterritorial effect. In this case, however, the Act contains provisions for contracts with a foreign element, which due to the nature of commerce are common (a credit card issued in the United Kingdom, for example, which is used on holiday in France). As a result, Section 16(5) specifically excludes contracts "having a connection with a country outside the United Kingdom" from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Licensing of credit and hire businesses===
The previous Acts on commercial credit provided no mechanism to regulate and enforce the rules, and the Consumer Credit Act's licensing system was the first major regulatory process within British consumer credit law. Licenses are required to carry out a consumer credit or consumer hire business, with exceptions for local authorities and corporate bodies allowed by an Act of Parliament to carry out consumer credit business. All other bodies must apply to the Consumer Credit Licensing Branch of the [[Office of Fair Trading]] for a license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of license====
There are two types of license given - group licenses and standard licenses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Group licenses are issued by the Director General of Fair Trading to cover a group of people in those activities described in the license. Group licenses can be issued following an application, or simply voluntarily by the Director. Holders of a group license do not have to apply individually and are not vetted individually, and holding a group license does not prevent members from also applying for a standard license. The group licenses are intended for cases where individual screening is not in the public interest; for example, when bodies are so large and established that their reputation is without question and individual screening would take too much time. Bodies currently holding group licenses include the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[Law Society of Northern Ireland]], both professional associations of [[solicitors]]. The Director has the ability to exclude named individuals from group licenses to prevent obvious abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard licenses are licenses issued by the Director General to an individual. It can only be provided following an application, not at the Director General's discretion like a group license, and covers certain activities in a fixed period. Initially there was no obligation to issue licenses, but an amendment to the bill in Parliament means that the Director General is required to issue a license on the application of any person, providing that person is a fit person to engage in such activities and the name he applies to be licensed under is not misleading or undesirable. The license allows an individual or a partnership to trade under those names listed on the license, and is divided into seven categories:
*Category A: Consumer credit business
*Category B: Consumer hire business
*Category C: Credit brokerage
*Category D: Debt-adjusting and counselling
*Category E: Debt-collecting
*Category F: Credit reference agencies

Holders of a license are obliged to inform the Director General when there is a change made within the office of a corporate licensee, an unincorporated body or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the ''Consumer Credit Bulletin'', the weekly journal of the [[Office of Fair Trading]].  A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

A license can be terminated on the death of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the [[Mental Health Act 1959]], a bankruptcy deal under the [[Bankruptcy Act 1914]] in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the [[Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914]] in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.119&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IV: Seeking business===
The Act specifically controls the way in which traders and companies seek business. Prior to this individual aspects had been controlled — advertisement by moneylenders had been strictly regulated since the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]] — but no other aspects of consumer credit were regulated at all. While this was acceptable for large and respectable institutions, the evolution of less reputable trading organisations necessitated some kind of regulation, and the Consumer Credit Act was the first statute to provide such controls for consumer credit organisations. It covers three main areas: advertising, canvassing and quotations and the display of information. No regulations have yet been made on quotations or the display of information.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
The advertising provisions apply to any advertisement published for the business carried out by the advertiser which indicates he is willing to provide credit or provide goods to be hired. "advertisement" is taken to mean any form of advertisement, including a publication, television or radio broadcast, the display of signs, labels or goods, the distribution of samples, circulars, catalogues or price lists or the exhibition of picture, models or films, or in "any other way". Previous legislation such as the [[Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1967]] limited the definition of advertisement to visual advertisements and excluded oral communications and radio broadcasts, which are included by the Act. The test of whether an oral communication counts as an "advertisement" is whether or not the communication is made for drawing attention to the advertiser's business or for answering a specific enquiry without promoting the business. In ''[[R. v Delmayne]]'' [1970] 2 QB 170 the [[High Court of Justice]] decided that even replying to an enquiry can amount to an advertisement if framed in such a way that it is calculated to attract business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV only applies to "public" advertising published to promote a business — as such circulars given to employees advertising such terms would not be considered "advertisements". Advertisements are not regulated by the Act if the advertiser is not involved in a consumer credit business, consumer hire business or a business in which he provides credit to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Part IV, the Secretary of State can make regulations limiting the form and content of advertisements covered by the Act. The regulations can also specifically include certain terms or facts, and failing to follow them constitutes an offence. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that no advertisement contains misleading information, that advertisements provide the reader with a "reasonable picture" of the terms and conditions and that the reader is aware that the availability and terms of credit may be affected by factors such as the age and employment of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canvassing====
The Crowther Committee recommended that [[Peddler|doorstep canvassing]] for loans should be completely prohibited. The original provisions in the bill were indeed extremely stringent, and caused potential problems for other businesses, but were significantly amended and now only affect the canvassing they were intended to prevent. Canvassing is defined as a situation in which an individual (the canvasser) solicits the entry of another individual (the consumer) into an agreement based on his oral representations during a visit by the canvasser to "any place" for the purpose of making such representations. Exceptions to "any place" are places where business is carried out, either permanently or temporarily, by the creditor, owner, supplier, canvasser, employer of the canvasser or the consumer. There is no requirement that the oral solicitations take place in person - they can come over the telephone, or be trying to induce another individual to convince the consumer into entering an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part V: Entry into credit or hire agreements===
Part V of the Act deals with four elements of entering into a credit or hire agreement; pre-contract disclosure, the formalities of entry into a regulated agreement, cancellation of a regulated agreement and its consequences and withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement and its consequences. In some cases, specific information must be disclosed before a contract is made, with the standard provision that contracts where this is not followed are unenforceable without an order from the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formalities====
There are certain formalities for entry into a regulated agreement, mostly based on the documentation that must be provided. Under Section 60, the Secretary of State is required to make certain regulations covering the format that contracts must take. These regulations must ensure that the debtor is made aware of the rights and/or duties conferred on him by the agreement, the amount and rate of the total charge for credit, the protection and remedies available to him and "any other matters which, in the opinion of the secretary of state, it is desirable for him to know about in connection with the agreement". The Act allows the Director General of Fair Trading to waive certain requirements if it appears, on the application of a consumer credit business, that to enforce them would be impracticable.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 61 lays out the formalities required for a regulated agreement. The terms must be found in a signed and legible document, a copy of the unsigned agreement must be supplied to the debtor or hirer, a copy of the signed document must be supplied to the debtor or hirer and a notice advising the debtor or hirer of his rights of cancellation must be included with the signed and unsigned copies. The "signed and legible document" is described in Section 61 as a document which contains all the prescribed terms, other than implied terms, and is, when presented to the debtor or hirer for signature, in such a state that all its terms are legible. Such a document must be in the form "prescribed by regulations".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations in question are the 1983 Regulations (UK Parliament SIs 1980-1989/1983/1551-1600/Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 (SI 1983/1553) 1983 No 1553 "Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983"). These regulations laid down specific rules regarding certain "prescribed terms". For example, a regulated credit agreement had to contain prescribed information about the amount of credit, the length of any fixed term loan, the amount of monthly repayments and so on. If a lender failed to comply with the prescribed regulations then the agreement would not be "properly executed" under section 61 and could then be challenged as "irredeemably unenforceable" under section 127.

====Withdrawals====
Part V contains several provisions relating to the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These are similar to those found in the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at [[common law]]; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to cancel a confirmed agreement was introduced by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]], mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right of cancellation is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a notice of writing given to the creditor or an agent of the creditor within six days of the agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part VI: Matters arising during currency of credit or hire agreements===

===Part VII: Default and termination===

===Part VIII: Security===
The Act was the first attempt by the Government of the United Kingdom to provide coherent rules relating to the taking of [[Security (finance)|securities]] when dealing with consumer credit. Other than the Bills of Sale Acts there had been little law on securities before this, apart from a few provisions in the Hire-Purchase Acts. The Consumer Credit Act devoted an entire part of the Act to security, mostly between debtor and creditor, with third-party rights and regulations mostly governed by [[common law]]. The Act provides the form of securities, requires certain information and documents to be supplied, controls the enforcement of securities and provides certain circumstances in which securities can be considered void.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

"Security" is defined by the Act to mean any form of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], indemnity, guarantee or other right provided by the debtor as "security" to the consumer credit or hire-purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both "real" securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given at the request of the debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other formalities must be observed; under Section 105, a security is not considered properly executed unless a document is signed on or on behalf of the debtor. This document must conform to certain regulations; the terms must be legible when it is presented to be signed, it must give all the terms and conditions other than implied terms, a copy must also be presented and if the security is provided before the regulated agreement is made, a copy of the security agreement must be given to the debtor within seven days of the regulated agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.262&lt;/ref&gt; If the formalities are not complied with the security agreement becomes unenforceable without a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The Act does not provide for any civil or criminal sanctions for creditors who enforce the agreement without a court order, however, but it may lead to the revocation or suspension of the creditor's license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IX: Judicial control===
Part IX gives the courts wide powers to re-open credit deals deemed extortionate and gives them control over regulated agreements. Section 189 establishes that "courts" means the [[county court]]; all problems are to be brought to the county court, although certain situations relating to extortionate credit agreements can be sent to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orders====
[[File:Watford County Court.jpg|thumb|right|The County Court at Watford: the county court deals with the majority of judicial actions brought under the Act.]]
The courts are allowed to issue enforcement orders for cases where the contract has been infringed upon, except in situations where the contract has not been signed or the terms are not set out in the contract, in which case they are permanently unenforceable. The courts are also prohibited from making enforcement orders where the owner or creditor did not give a copy of the agreement to the debtor or hirer before the contract commenced. Other than this the court is obliged to issue such orders. There are also situations in which orders can be made even when there has been no infringement. These are when the debtor or hirer has died, to recover protected goods without the consent of a debtor and to enforce a land mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can also make "time orders" providing for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made at the discretion of the courts after an application for an enforcement order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.325&lt;/ref&gt; The time orders can also cover [[Bailment|statutory bailment]] in the case of hire-order or hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.326&lt;/ref&gt; If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.330&lt;/ref&gt;

Other orders are "special orders", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and transfer orders. Return orders are orders from the court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor if he does not return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment of the rest of the goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the returned goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

====Credit bargains====
The courts have long held [[Equity (law)|equitable]] jurisdiction to set aside "harsh and unconscionable bargains", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were "harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used in the field of consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.334&lt;/ref&gt;

The Consumer Credit Act provided guidelines for the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the courts jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter the terms of the agreement or order the return of any security.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.341&lt;/ref&gt; This only covers consumer credit agreements, not hire agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part X: Ancillary credit businesses===

====Definitions====
An ancillary credit business is defined in Section 145 of the Act as any business that works in [[credit broker]]age, debt adjusting, debt collecting, debt counselling or as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.346&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit brokers are people involved in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally in exchange for a commission. Under the Act, "credit broker" includes not only [[mortgage broker]]s and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for [[hire-purchase]] agreements and [[solicitor]]s who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt adjusting is when a company or individual negotiates with the creditor or owner in an agreement on behalf of the debtor to change the terms for the discharge of the debt, takes over the debt in exchange for payment by the debtor or engages in "any similar activity concerned with the liquidation of a debt".Pieheads  This is again a wide area; the base definition covers, for example, solicitors and accountants who act as negotiators for clients who owe money to a third party. There are certain exceptions; a solicitor negotiating for the settlement of his client's debts is not considered to be working as a debt adjuster thanks to Section 146 of the Act, which excludes "a solicitor engaging in contentious business" as defined in the [[Solicitors Act 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt counselling is the giving of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer hire agreements. This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of if it is free legal advice; as a result the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to "procure payment of debts due" under consumer credit agreements and consumer hire agreements. Those who "purchase" debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions for these definitions are provided under Section 146 if the credit broker, debt adjuster, debt counsellor or debt collector is the creditor or owner under the credit agreement, the supplier under the agreement, a credit broker who has acquired the business of the supplier or somebody expressly excluded from certain definitions, such as a [[solicitor]]. The provisions for suppliers only come into effect when the credit is a loan, so that the supplier and creditor are different people. The exceptions do not include people who "buy" the roles above by purchasing the debts, such as professional debt buyers or financial houses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit reference agencies are covered separately from other ancillary credit businesses, and are defined in Section 148 as individuals or companies which carry on a business "comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant to the financial standard of individuals, being information collected by the agency for that purpose". This definition was the subject of much academic debate, because the holding of the license for a credit reference agency involves a duty to supply information on credit status which the company might prefer to keep confidential. There are exceptions; the information must be collected for the purpose of giving it to others, so the fact that a bank, for example, has that information, does not mean they need to obtain a license as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.351&lt;/ref&gt;

====Licensing and other matters====
Part III of the Act applies directly to ancillary credit businesses, who must obtain a license. As with standard credit agreements, agreements made by an unlicensed ancillary trader are only enforceable against the other party if the Director General of Fair Trading issues an order which applies to the agreement. Under Section 149, creditors have an onus to make sure that the credit brokers they obtain business from are duly licensed. Again, if the broker is unlicensed, the agreement between the debtor and creditor is only enforceable when the Director General makes an order saying so. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.353&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV of the Act also applies to ancillary credit businesses in relation to advertising, canvassing and quotations, as well as ways in which business can be sought. The Act also limited the brokerage fees that credit brokers can charge. Under Section 155, if the brokerage work does not lead to the client entering into an agreement with a creditor within 6 months of the work, the entire fee (minus the sum of £1) is refundable to the client. The Director General at the time indicated that those businesses which flouted Section 155 would be refused a license. These provisions came into force on 1 April 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.354&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part XI: Enforcement of Act===

===Part XII: Supplement===

==Implementation of the Act==
Some elements of the Act came into force on 31 July 1974, the day it was passed, but many were left to be brought in later at the discretion of the government. This process was "painfully slow", with almost nothing apart from the licensing system being active in 1979.&lt;ref name=g10/&gt; Section 141, which requires enforcement actions of a regulated credit or linked transaction to be pursued in the [[county court]], came into force on 19 May 1985 through the [[Statutory instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] "Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Commencement No. 8) Order 1983".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=17 February 1988|title=LEGAL UPDATE - Consumer credit – Consumer Credit Act 1974 (practice note issued by the Queen's Bench Masters 21 January 1988)|journal=Law Society Gazette|volume=85|issue=38|issn=0262-1495|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T7549115139&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;sort=PUBLISHED-DATE,D,H,$PSEUDOLOSK,A,H&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T7549115144&amp;cisb=22_T7549115143&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=280335&amp;docNo=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act repealed the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Advertisements (Hire Purchase) Act 1967]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]], the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1872]] and the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1960]]. The Act was influential outside the United Kingdom, and was studied in both the [[United States]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It formed the basis of a 1979 Directive on Consumer Credit of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=g10/&gt;

The Act did not go to the full extent suggested by the Crowther Committee's report, with protection only being available for consumers, not for the credit industry.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.436&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act was widely supported by all sides of the political spectrum, and by academia. Arthur Rogerson compared it to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] in that, like the 1925 Act, it "represents fundamental rethinking of an area of great economic significance, which has resulted in the sweeping away of a chaos of obsolete rules, and the substitution for them of a simpler and better enforced body of law".&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">'''Countermeasure''' in [[public international law]] refers to [[reprisals]] not involving the use of force. In other words, it refers to non-violent acts which are illegal in themselves, but become legal when executed by one state in response to the commission of an earlier illegal act by another state towards the former.

==Definition==
The leading case on countermeasure is the [[International Court of Justice]] decision in [[Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros Dams]] case. The court remarked that, for a countermeasure to be justifiable, it must meet the conditions below:
# The act constituting countermeasure must be taken in response to a previous intentional wrongful act of another state and must be directed against that state.
# The injured state must have already called upon the state committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation, but the request was refused.
# The countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the rights in question.
# The purpose behind evoking the countermeasure is to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law. Therefore, the measure must be reversible.

==State responsibility==
Article 22 of the [[International Law Commission]] draft articles on state responsibility states that the wrongfulness of an act is precluded if the act constitutes a countermeasure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup06/basicmats2/DASR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a validly executed countermeasure is legal under international law.

{{Insolvency}}
'''Creditors' rights''' are the procedural provisions designed to protect the ability of [[creditors]]—persons who are owed money—to collect the money that they are owed. These provisions vary from one [[jurisdiction]] to another, and may include the ability of a creditor to put a [[lien]] on a debtor's property, to effect a seizure and [[forced sale]] of the debtor's property, to effect a [[garnishment]] of the debtor's wages, and to have certain purchases or gifts made by the debtor set aside as [[fraudulent conveyance]]s. The rights of a particular creditor usually depend in part on the reason for which the debt is owed, and the terms of any writing memorializing the debt.

==Priority of creditors==
Creditors' rights deal not only with the rights of creditors against the debtor, but also with the rights of creditors against one another. Where multiple creditors claim a right to levy against a particular piece of property, or against the debtor's accounts in general, the rules governing creditor's rights determine which creditor has the strongest right to any particular relief.

Generally, creditors can be divided between those who "[[Perfection (law)|perfected]]" their interest by establishing an appropriate [[public record]] of the debt and any property claimed as collateral for it, and those who have not. Creditors may also be classed according to whether they are "in possession" of the collateral, and by whether the debt was created as a [[purchase money security interest]]. A creditor may generally ask a court to set aside a [[fraudulent conveyance]] designed to move the debtor's property or funds out of their reach.

==Specialized legal practices==
Some [[lawyer]]s have a specialized practice area focused on the collection of such [[debts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.Asp?selected=398&amp;bold=||   Law dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such attorneys are frequently referred to as collection attorneys or collection lawyers.

[[Lawyer|Attorneys]] who practice in the area of "creditor's rights" perform one or all of the following:

*File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect [[consumer]] debts (i.e., debts owed by individuals)
*File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect commercial debts (i.e. debts owed by businesses)
*Represent creditor's interests in a [[bankruptcy]] proceeding
*[[Foreclose]] homes or commercial real estate if the purchaser defaults on payment
*Recover (or [[replevin]]) secured goods (e.g., automobiles) if the purchaser defaults on payment

'''Economic freedom''' or '''economic liberty''' is the ability of people of a society to take economic actions. This is a term used in economic and [[policy debate]]s as well as in the [[philosophy of economics]].&lt;ref name=Bronfenbrenner1955&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronfenbrenner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Bronfenbrenner|year=1955|journal=[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]|title=Two Concepts of Economic Freedom|volume=65|issue=3|jstor=2378928|pages=157–70 |doi=10.1086/290998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SenRationalityFreedom&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen|first=Amartya|authorlink=Amartya Sen|title=Rationality and Freedom|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach to economic freedom comes from [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] traditions emphasizing [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], and [[private property]] under free enterprise.

The [[free market]] viewpoint defines economic liberty as the freedom to produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired without the use of force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaPubChoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surjit S.

===Institutions of economic freedom===

====Private property rights====
{{Main|Right to property}}

[[File:Goldeagle.jpg|thumb|125px|left|In the 1960s, [[Alan Greenspan]] argued that economic freedom requires the [[gold standard]] for protection of savings from confiscation through inflation&lt;ref&gt;Addision Wiggin, William Bonner. ''Financial Reckoning Day: Surviving the Soft Depression of the 21st Century''. (2004). John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-48130-0}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to the free market view, a secure system of [[property rights (economics)|private property rights]] is an essential part of economic freedom.  Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Milton Friedman]] sees property rights as "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Rose D. Friedman, Milton Friedman. ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs''. (1998). University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-26414-9}} p. 605&lt;/ref&gt; With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they do it on a voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions most people can achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard H. Siegan. ''Property and Freedom: The Constitution, the Courts, and Land-Use Regulation''. Transaction Publishers. (1997). {{ISBN|1-56000-974-8}} pp. 9, 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical evidence]] suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Weimer. ''The political economy of property rights''. Published in ''The Political Economy of Property Rights''. Cambridge University Press. (1997). {{ISBN|0-521-58101-X}} pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]], much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). {{ISBN|0-465-01615-4}} pp. 210–11&lt;/ref&gt; One thinker to question private property was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a socialist and anarchist, who argued that property is both theft and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism''. Edited by Daniel Guerin, translated by Paul Sharkey. 2005. AK Press. {{ISBN|1-904859-25-9}} pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of contract====
[[Freedom of contract]] is the right to choose one's contracting parties and to trade with them on any terms and conditions one sees fit. Contracts permit individuals to create their own enforceable legal rules, adapted to their unique situations.&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth. ''Contract and the Common Law''. Published in '' The State and Freedom of Contract''. (1998). Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3370-8}} p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all contracts need to be enforced by the state. For example, in the United States there is a large number of third-party [[arbitration]] tribunals which resolve disputes under private commercial law.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} pp. 82–88&lt;/ref&gt; Negatively understood, freedom of contract is freedom from government interference and from imposed value judgments of fairness. The notion of "freedom of contract" was given one of its most famous legal expressions in 1875 by Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Ooseterhout, Jack J. Vromen, Pursey Heugensp. ''Social Institutions of Capitalism: Evolution and Design of Social Contracts''. (2003). Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84376-495-4}} p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[I]f there is one thing more than another public policy requires it is that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice. Therefore, you have this paramount public policy to consider – that you are not lightly to interfere with this freedom of contract.}}

The doctrine of freedom of contract received one of its strongest expressions in the [[US Supreme Court]] case of [[Lochner v New York]] which struck down legal restrictions on the working hours of bakers. [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html]

Critics of the classical view of freedom of contract argue that this freedom is illusory when the bargaining power of the parties is highly unequal, most notably in the case of contracts between employers and workers. As in the case of restrictions on working hours, workers as a group may benefit from legal protections that prevent individuals agreeing to contracts that require long working hours. In its [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]] decision in 1937, overturning Lochner, the Supreme Court cited an earlier decisions {{cquote|The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many States has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that [p. 394] their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases, self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0300_0379_ZO.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
From this point on, the Lochner view of freedom of contract has been rejected by US courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Supreme Court . Capitalism and Conflict . Landmark Cases . Lochner v. New York (1905) {{!}}PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and political freedom===
Some free market advocates argue that political and [[civil liberties]] have simultaneously expanded with market-based economies, and present empirical evidence to support the claim that economic and [[political freedom]]s are linked.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom in the World.'' (1999). Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7658-0675-4}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis F. Abbott. ''British Democracy: Its Restoration &amp; Extension'', ISR/Google Books, 2006, 2010.  Chapter Five: “The Legal Protection Of Democracy &amp; Freedom: The Case For A New Written Constitution &amp; Bill Of Rights”. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xwN-MIMtE6sC&amp;dq=ISBN090632131X]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman further developed Friedrich Hayek's argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that economic and political freedom were mutually dependent: "The idea that political freedom can be preserved in the absence of economic freedom, and vice versa, is an illusion. Political freedom is the corollary of economic freedom. It is no accident that the age of capitalism became also the age of government by the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Von Mises]]. Planning for Freedom. Libertarian Press. 1962. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek argued that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek criticized [[socialist]] policies as the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents |last=Hayek |first= Friedrich |year=2007 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-32055-7 |pages=53–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Tullock]] has argued that "the Hayek-Friedman argument" predicted totalitarian governments in much of Western Europe in the late 20th century – which did not occur. He uses the example of Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of [[GNP]], as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with ''The Road to Serfdom'' is "that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms." While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, "Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one set of arguments depend on the other."&lt;ref name=Tullock&gt;{{cite book |last = Tullock|first=Gordon|author-link = Gordon Tullock|editor-last=Walker|editor-first=Michael A.|title=Freedom, Democracy and Economic Welfare|pages=60–64|publisher=The Fraser Institute|place=Vancouver, B.C., Canada|year=1988|url=http://fraser.stg.devlin.ca/commerce.web/publication_details.aspx?pubID=2942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indices of economic freedom===
{{Main|Indices of economic freedom}}

The annual surveys ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'' (EFW) and ''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]'' (IEF) are two indices which attempt to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. The EFW index, originally developed by Gwartney, Lawson and Block at the [[Fraser Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;Gwartney, L., R. Lawson, and W. Block (1996). ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'', 1975–1995. Vancouver: Fraser Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely the most used in empirical studies as of 2000.&lt;ref name=Heckelman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heckelman | first1 = Jac C. | last2 = Stroup | first2 = Michael D. | year = 2000 | title = Which Economic Freedoms Contribute to Growth? | url = | journal = Kyklos | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 527–44 | doi = 10.1111/1467-6435.00132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major index, which was developed by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]] appears superior for data work, although as it only goes back to 1995, it is less useful for historical comparisons.&lt;ref name=Heckelman/&gt;

According to the creators of the indices, these rankings correlate strongly with higher average income per person, higher income of the poorest 10%, higher life expectancy, higher literacy, lower infant mortality, higher access to water sources and less corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf Economic Freedom of the World: 2004 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316215702/http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf |date=2016-03-16 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf Index of Economic Freedom – Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044144/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The people living in the top one-fifth of countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s. The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $728 in the lowest ranked countries compared with over $7,000 in the highest ranked countries. The life expectancy of people living in the highest ranked nations is 20 years longer than for people in the lowest ranked countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/318|title=Issues|author=|date=|website=The Buckeye Institute|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher economic freedom, as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices, correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?] The Cato institute. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Gartzke of the Fraser Institute estimates that countries with a high EFW are significantly less likely to be involved in wars, while his measure of [[democracy]] had little or no impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf Chapter2: Economic Freedom and Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}, Economic Freedom of the World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic Freedom of the World'' score for the entire world has grown considerably in recent decades. The average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4 in 2005. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetheworld.com/release_2005.html|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report|author=|date=|website=freetheworld.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom methodology world economic freedom has increased 2.6 points since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS49743+15-Jan-2008+PRN20080115|title=Economic Freedom Holding Steady |author=|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[World Bank Group]] also use ''Index of Economic Freedom'' as the indicator of investment climate, because it covers more aspects relevant to the private sector in wide number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/our_effectivene.html Improving Investment Climates]'', World Bank Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8213-6282-8}} pp. 221–24&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critiques====
The nature of economic freedom is often in dispute. [[Robert Lawson (economist)|Robert Lawson]], the co-author of ''EFW'', even acknowledges the potential shortcomings of freedom indices: "The purpose of the EFW index is to measure, no doubt imprecisely, the degree of economic freedom that exists."&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Robert A. 2006. "'On Testing the Connection between
Economic Freedom and Growth." ''Econ Journal Watch'' 3(3): 398–406. [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-3-number-1-september-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; He likens the recent attempts of economists to measure economic freedom to the initial attempts of economists to measure GDP: "They [macroeconomists] were
scientists who sat down to design, as best they could with the tools at hand, a measure of the current economic activity of the nation. Economic activity exists and their job was to measure it.  Likewise economic freedom exists. It is a thing. We can define and measure it."
Thus, it follows that some [[economists]], [[socialists]] and [[anarchists]] contend that the existing indicators of economic freedom are too narrowly defined and should take into account a broader conception of economic freedoms.

Critics of the indices (e.g. [[Thom Hartmann]]) also oppose the inclusion of business-related measures like corporate charters and [[intellectual property]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomhartmann.com/index.php option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=183&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller in [[Dollars &amp; Sense]] has stated that the indices are "a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity." He argues that the high correlation between living standards and economic freedom as measured by IEF is the result of choices made in the construction of the index that guarantee this result. For example, the treatment of a large informal sector (common in poor countries) as an indicator of restrictive government policy, and the use of the change in the ratio of government spending to national income, rather than the level of this ratio. Hartmann argues that these choices cause the [[social democratic]] European countries to rank higher than countries where the government share of the economy is small but growing.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2005/0305miller.html |title=Free, Free at Last &amp;#124; Dollars &amp; Sense |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Dani Rodrik]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have separately noted that there appears to be little correlation between measured economic freedom and economic growth when the least free countries are disregarded, as indicated by the strong growth of the Chinese economy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Sachs, ''The End of Poverty; How We Can Make It Happen In Our Lifetime'' (Penguin Books, 2005), pp. 320–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-there-a-grow.html |title=Dani Rodrik's weblog: Is there a growth payoff to economic freedom? |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Altman found that there is a relatively large correlation between economic freedom and both per capita income and per capita growth. He argues that this is especially true when it comes to sub-indices relating to property rights and sound money, while he calls into question the importance of sub-indices relating to labor regulation and government size once certain threshold values are passed.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Altman, "How Much Economic Freedom is Necessary for Economic Growth? Theory and Evidence," ''Economics Bulletin'', Vol. 15 (2008), no. 2, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller further observes that [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], both only "partially free" according to [[Freedom House]], are leading countries on both economic freedom indices and casts doubt on the claim that measured economic freedom is associated with political freedom.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, according to the Freedom House, "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Karatnycky. ''Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties''. Transaction Publishers. 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0101-2}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice sets and economic freedom==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}

[[Amartya Sen]] and other economists consider economic freedom to be measured in terms of the set of economic choices available to individuals. Economic freedom is greater when individuals have more economic choices available – when, in some technical sense, the [[choice set]] of individuals expands.

===Positive and negative freedom===
The differences between alternative views of economic freedom have been expressed in terms of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s distinction between [[positive freedom]] and [[negative freedom]]. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast [[Amartya Sen]] argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1993MAF&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sen|first=Amartya K.|authorlink=Amartya Sen|year=1993|journal=[[Oxford Economic Papers]]|title=Markets and Freedoms: Achievements and Limitations of the Market Mechanism in Promoting Individual Freedoms|volume=45|issue=4|pages=519–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life.&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goodin | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Rice | first2 = James Mahmud | last3 = Parpo | first3 = Antti | last4 = Eriksson | first4 = Lina | title = Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-70951-4 |pages=1–54 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521709514}} Chapter 1 and 2 discusses the context and validity of the new measure.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Capitalism and Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Milton|title=Capitalism and Freedom|date=1962|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.

==Freedom from want==
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] included [[freedom from want]] in his [[Four freedoms]] speech. Roosevelt stated that freedom from want "translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world".{{cn|date=February 2017}} In terms of US policy, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] included economic freedoms such as freedom of [[trade union]] organisation, as well as a wide range of policies of government intervention and redistributive taxation aimed at promoting freedom from want.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Internationally, Roosevelt favored the policies associated with the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] which fixed exchange rates and established international economic institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Herbert Hoover]] saw economic freedom as a fifth freedom, which secures survival of Roosevelt's Four freedoms. He described economic freedom as freedom "for men to choose their own calling, to accumulate property in protection of their children and old age, [and] freedom of enterprise that does not injure others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Herbert Hoover |last=Whisenhunt |first=Donald W. |year=2007 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=978-1-60021-476-9 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association and unions==
The Philadelphia Declaration (enshrined in the constitution of the [[International Labour Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm#annex |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222152631/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-22 |title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization |work= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that "all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity." The ILO further states that "The right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing is an integral part of a free and open society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |title=Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining – Themes |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204135134/http://www.ilo.org./global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialist views==
The [[socialist]] view of economic freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava. ''Political Theory: An Introduction''. Pearson Education India, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist]]s stress the importance of freeing the individual from what they view as coercive, [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]] social relationships of production they are compelled to partake in, as well as the importance of economic development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Goodwin. Using Political Ideas. West Sussex, England, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2007. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic impact of economic freedom==
One of the ways to measure economic competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world.  Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed even when we compare these indicators within territories of countries. 
Nevertheless, despite these benefits societies have to be aware that with increasing economic freedom they will have to face going through a phase of increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]], which basically is a result of decreased redistribution, as well as other negative effects from [[economic liberalization]], i.e., running of local enterprises out of business, takeover of competitive firms, enforcing of interests of foreign companies, dependence on foreign capital, deteriorating work rights, harmful manufacturing for the environment, introducing of commercial practices that are not favorable for consumers, as well as endangerment for survival of national cultures.
However, on the bright side, these negative effects from economic freedom tend to be felt in a shorter term, and if countries use the opportunities of economic freedom in our increasingly globalized economy in a right way, as research shows their socioeconomic conditions will be significantly better than in a case of less economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rožāns, Edgars, The Socioeconomic Impact of Economic Freedom. Humanities and Social Sciences, pp. 105–25, 2015. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2683493&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''further assurances''' clause is part of the standard '[[Standard form contract|boilerplate]]'&lt;ref&gt;See an [[Arnold &amp; Porter]] article, http://www.arnoldporter.net/publications_articles.cfm?practice_ID=0&amp;publication_id=1074&lt;/ref&gt; in most sophisticated [[Commercial law|commercial]] [[Contract|agreement]]s.  It provides that a party shall provide cooperation and assistance to the other party in executing duties under the contract.  For example, in an agreement for a [[home construction]] there might be a clause requiring the party purchasing the contractor's services to assist the contractor in securing variances, easements, or building permits required by law for a home construction.  Without a further assurances clause one party might try to escape the contract by withholding assistance to the other party where that assistance is either necessary or of great importance.  Accordingly, it is generally considered poor legal drafting to omit a further assurances provision where there is a possibility one's client may need the assistance of the other party to fulfill his responsibilities or obtain some intended benefit under the contract.

'''Ghana Open Data Initiative''' ('''GODI''') was started in January 2012 by the [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA) in partnership with the [[Web Foundation]] (WF), to make [[Ghana|Government of Ghana]] data available to the public for re-use. The establishment of GODI is meant to promote [[efficiency]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] in governance as well as to facilitate economic growth by means of the creation of Mobile and Web applications for the Ghanaian and world markets. The project was scheduled for completion in 2014 and aimed to create a sustainable Open Data ecosystem for Ghana. GODI was launched with a 100 data sets categorized as political, legal, organizational, technical, social or economic. The vision of GODI is to develop an open data community involving the Government of Ghana, civil society organizations, industry, developer communities, academia, media practitioners,  and the citizenry, to interact with one another with the aim of developing an open data portal to bring about transparency, accountability and efficiency in government.&lt;ref name="GODI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/general-news/17132-open-government-data-portal-ready-by-december-2013 |title=Open Government Data Portal Ready By December 2013 |author=GNA |date=October 24, 2012 |work= |publisher=ghana.gov.gh |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030605/http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/general-news/17132-open-government-data-portal-ready-by-december-2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BIZTECH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biztechafrica.com/article/godi-project-get-us-tech-support/4605/?country=ghana |title= GODI project to get US tech support |author= BiztechAfrica|date= November 3, 2012 |work= |publisher= biztechafrica.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GODIsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gov.gh/about-us |title=About GODI |author=GODI |date= |work= |publisher=data.gov.gh |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818061103/http://data.gov.gh/about-us |archivedate=August 18, 2013 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webfoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webfoundation.org/2012/02/ghana-godi-launch/|title= New Project: Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI)|author= José M.

== History ==
At the close of 2011, the president of the Republic of Ghana, [[John Atta Mills|His Excellency Prof. J.E. Mills]], signed the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP), a global initiative started by the [[United States government]].&lt;ref name="theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" BIZTECH " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" vibegh " /&gt;&lt;ref name="BIZGH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2012/11/22/ghanas-open-data-portal-goes-live/feed/|title= Ghana’s open data portal goes live|author= GNA|date= November 22, 2012 |work= |publisher= ghanabusinessnews.com |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] is a new multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. In the spirit of multistakeholder collaboration, the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] is overseen by a steering committee of governments, [[civil society]] organizations, [[academia]] and the [[Software developer|developer community]].&lt;ref name="theafricareport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-sets-up-open-data-platform.html |title= Ghana sets up Open Data platform |author=Lawrence Quartey |date= November 22, 2012 |work= |publisher= theafricareport.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name="vibegh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vibeghana.com/2012/11/01/us-data-team-visits-ghana/ |title= US Data team visits Ghana|author= GNA |date= November 1, 2012 |work= |publisher= vibeghana.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Ghana signing onto the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]], the [[Web Foundation|World Wide Web Foundation]] (WF) had conducted feasibility studies in Ghana and Chile as special case studies for developing countries and published the report in February 2011. On the basis of the feasibility report, the [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA), an agency of the Ministry of Communications, which was created by an Act of Parliament to oversee and implement government policy on [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT), began discussions with the WF in April 2011 on how to develop an open government portal in Ghana.&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" GODIsite " /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISTO"&gt;{{cite web

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] over the last three years has been deploying a massive government network dubbed the GovNET across the country and data centers which will be repositories of Government data. NITA has also been mandated to engage the citizenry with government by providing  [http://eservices.gov.gh/ e-Services] platforms to serve the citizenry with services like online passport application, business and birth and death registration which NITA is executing with 11 pilot e-service platforms.&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" ISTO " /&gt;

On the initial signing of the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] commitment by the embassy of Ghana in the US in September 2011, [[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] intensified its discussions with the WF on developing a national plan to create an open data portal where government could make its data available in a format that [[Civil society|civil society organizations]] (CSOs), the [[International development|developer community]], [[academia]], the [[Mass media|media]] and [[industry]] could re-use.&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt; These discussions culminated in a visit to Ghana by a team from the WF during which a strategic plan was developed at a formal stakeholders’ meeting which took place in Accra, where the initiative was duly launched. The visiting WF team and [[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] officials paid a courtesy call on the then Vice President [[John Mahama|His Excellency John Dramani Mahama]] to invite him to champion the Ghana Open Data Initiative.

== Relevance of open government data to Ghana ==
Open government data is particularly important to low and middle income countries like Ghana because:
* Transparency and accountability are critical dimensions for foreign aid and investments, which in turn is essential for social and economic development. The potential of ICT in developing countries to provide basic services in health, education, business and governance has been highlighted for more than a decade by the [[World Summit on Information Society|WSIS]].
* Easy access to government-held data reduces risks and transaction costs in the economic sector, thus reducing barriers to growth.
* Citizen inclusion and participation in government agenda have been historically low in developing countries, particularly due to lack of information and infrastructure. Increasing such citizen participation has proven to be essential for the establishment of stable democratic processes.
* Data on government services is capable of attracting groups and organizations to form communities whose activities can improved social capital and economic growth.

== Development of GODI ==

=== Executive level ===
The WF feasibility report indicated that the Government of Ghana has the political will to make information transparently available to its citizens.
In January 2012, then vice president of Ghana, [[John Mahama]], informed a delegation from the WF that he was committed to championing the GODI at the cabinet level.

=== Public administration level ===
The feasibility report of the WF indicated that government departments and agencies are in support of OGD initiatives.  Substantial information is already available in digital format; however end user access still remains on paper which imparts negatively on the access and reuse of information. Since January 2012 when the GODI started, several public administrators have indicated their willingness to provide data in the format required to contribute to the project.

=== Civil society level ===
The WF feasibility report indicated that there is already a movement towards reuse of information driven by organizations like the Population Council as well as universities that are advocating the access to raw data for their studies.

== Organogram ==
[[File:GODI Project Organogram.jpg]]

== Implementation ==
The [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA) is the implementing agency for the [http://www.data.gov.gh/ Ghana Open Data Initiative] (GODI).&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" GODIsite " /&gt; The GODI portal was developed on the fourth thematic area of the [[Open Government Partnership]].

The objectives of the GODI project are to:
* Provide a central platform for access to public government data.
* Bring about the development of the open data community.
* Promote participation between government, civil society organizations, academia, media practitioners, industry, developer community and the citizen.
* Serve as a concrete action plan of the fourth thematic area of the Open Government Partnership (technology and innovation) for the republic of Ghana.
* Promote transparency, accountability and efficiency in government through citizen feedback.

== Benefits ==
Ghana’s decision to create an open data portal was informed by the fact the [[Open Data|Open Government Data]] (OGD) programs around the world have demonstrated multiple benefits. GODI perceives that Ghana can gain all the benefit of open data which are grouped around three main themes:

=== Transparency and accountability ===
* Increased transparency of governments
* Greater accountability of officials by citizens being able to see and challenge individual spending and purchasing decisions
* Behaviour change due to the possibility of greater scrutiny
* Better understanding by civil society of the reasons for government decisions
* Better democracy and increased civic capital
* Better informed and balanced journalism; i.e. [[data journalism]]

{{Insolvency}}
The '''history of bankruptcy law''' begins with the first legal remedies available for recovery of debts. [[Bankruptcy]] is the legal status of a [[Legal personality|legal person]] unable to repay debts.

==Ancient world==
In [[Ancient Greece]], bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into "[[debt slavery]]", until the creditor recouped losses via their [[physical labour]]. Many city-states in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years and debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions.

In [[Judaism]] and the [[Torah]], or [[Old Testament]], every seventh year is decreed by [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]] as a Sabbatical year wherein the release of all debts that are owed by members of the [[Jewish]] community is [[Mandate (theology)|mandate]]d, but not of "[[gentiles]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0515.htm#1 Deuteronomy 15:1–3]&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh Sabbatical year, or forty-ninth year, is then followed by another Sabbatical year known as the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Year of Jubilee]] wherein the release of all debts is mandated, for fellow community members and foreigners alike, and the release of all debt-slaves is also mandated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm#8 Leviticus 25:8–54]&lt;/ref&gt; The Year of Jubilee is announced in advance on the [[Day of Atonement]], or the tenth day of the seventh [[Hebrew calendar|Biblical month]], in the forty-ninth year by the blowing of trumpets throughout the land of Israel.

In [[Islamic]] teaching, according to the [[Quran]], an insolvent person was deemed to be allowed time to be able to pay out his debt. This is recorded in the Quran's second chapter ([[Sura]] [[Al-Baqara]]), Verse 281, which notes: "And if someone is in hardship, then let there be postponement until a time of ease. But if you give from your right as charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew."

==Medieval period==
Medieval [[canon law]] discussed extensively provisions to mitigate the harshness of debtors' punishments. Most commentators allowed for a debtor to be discharged and make a fresh start, after ceding to his creditors all his goods (or possibly all his goods except some bare necessities).&lt;ref&gt;W. Pakter, The origins of bankruptcy in medieval canon and Roman law, in [http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/b/b071148.pdf ''Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Medieval Canon Law'']], 1984, ed. P. Linehan, Vatican City, 1988, 485-506.&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions later influenced English law.

Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times.

[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] had to declare four state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. Spain became the first [[sovereign nation]] in history to declare bankruptcy.

==Renaissance England==
Some form of law for bankrupts can be seen tracing back to Ancient Babylon. In England, the first recognised piece of legislation was the [[Statute of Bankrupts|Statute of Bankrupts 1542]].&lt;ref&gt;34 and 35, Henry VIII, c.4&lt;/ref&gt; Bankrupts were seen as crooks, and the Act stated its aim to prevent "crafty debtors" escaping the realm.&lt;ref&gt;I Treiman, 'Escaping the Creditor in the Middle Ages' (1927) 43 [[Law Quarterly Review]] 230, 233&lt;/ref&gt; A more humane approach was developed in the [[Bankrupts Act 1705]].&lt;ref&gt;3 Anne, c.17, passed in fact on 19 March 1706&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Chancellor]] was given power to discharge bankrupts, once disclosure of all assets and various procedures had been fulfilled. In ''[[Fowler v Padget]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1798) 101 ER 1103; 7 Term Rep 509&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Kenyon]] reasserted the old sentiment that "Bankruptcy is considered a crime and a bankrupt in the old laws is called an offender."

The bankrupt was seen as being bonded to his creditors. Under the [[Insolvent Debtors (England) Act 1813]], debtors could request release after 14 days in jail by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if any of their creditors objected, they had to stay inside. Attitudes were changing, however, and the [[Bankrupts (England) Act 1825]]&lt;ref&gt;6 Geo. IV, c. 16&lt;/ref&gt; allowed people to start proceedings for their own bankruptcy, in agreement with creditors. Previously only creditors could start the proceedings. Bankruptcy proceedings agreed between creditors and debtor also occurred when a trader filed a declaration of insolvency in the office of the Chancellor’s Secretary of Bankrupts, which was then advertised. The advertised declaration supported a commission in bankruptcy to be issued.  A law was thereafter enacted, which declared that no commission grounded on this act of bankruptcy was to be “deemed invalid by reason of such declaration having been concerted or agreed upon between the bankrupt and any creditor or other person.” ([[Bankrupts (England) Act 1825]], sections VI and VII). Voluntary bankruptcy was not authorized until 1849. ([[Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act 1849]], section 93 (1849)).

In the middle of the 19th century, attitudes towards corporations were also quickly changing. Since the [[South Sea Bubble]] disaster, companies were viewed as inefficient and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;See Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN20.html#V.1.107 Book V, Ch 1, para.107]&lt;/ref&gt; But with the [[industrial revolution]] in full swing that changed. The [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]]&lt;ref&gt;7 &amp; 8 Vict. c.110&lt;/ref&gt; allowed people to create companies without permission through a [[royal charter]]. Companies had "separate legal personality", the ability to sue and be sued, and served as an easy mechanism for raising capital through the purchase of shares (an equitable title) in the company's capital. The Act's corollary, to bring the existence of these "legal persons" to an end was the [[Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844]]. The [[Limited Liability Act 1855]] produced a further innovation. Before, if a corporation had gone broke, the people that lent it money (creditors) could sue all the shareholders to pay off the company's debts. But the 1855 Act said that shareholders' liability would be limited to the amount they had paid for their shares of stock. The [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]] consolidated the companies legislation in one, and the modern law of corporate insolvency was born. Finally, the [[Bankruptcy Act 1869]] was passed allowing all people, rather than just traders to file for bankruptcy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31391">The '''Homeless Bill of Rights''' (also '''Homeless Person's Bill of Rights''' and '''Acts of Living bill''') refers to legislation protecting the [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] of [[homeless people]]. These laws affirm that homeless people have equal [[right to health|rights to medical care]], free speech, free movement, voting, opportunities for employment, and privacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Rankin, Sara|date=2015|title=A Homeless Bill of Rights (Revolution)|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/shlr/vol45/iss2/1|journal=Seton Hall Law Review|language=en|volume=45|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation of this type is currently being debated at the state level in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over 120 organizations in five different states have shown public support for a Homeless Bill of Rights and are working towards its implementation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boden, Paul|first=Mossman, Terry|date=2015|title=The Right to Rest: Homeless Coalition Challenges Criminalization of Life on the Street|jstor=43875798|journal=Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment|volume=20|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Homeless Bill of Rights has become law in [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]] and [[Illinois]] and is under consideration by several other U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Delaware]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Oregon]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Street Sleeper 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Homeless Bill of Rights laws affirm that people living on the street have a [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] in their property.]]

While the wording and objectives of proposed bills vary from state to state, most proposed legislation seeks to protect these central rights for all unhoused individuals:

* The right to use public spaces without fear of discrimination of harassment by law enforcement
* The right to vote
* The right to non-obstructively seek shelter, social services, legal aid, and education
* The right to privacy of property in public spaces
* The right to feel safe

This type of legislation is groundbreaking because it asserts that having a permanent and valid address is not a requisite for retaining basic rights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toner|first=Mike|date=August 2015|title=Homelessness &amp; the Right to Rest Act|url=|journal=Journal of Property Management|volume=|pages=36–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities around the United States attempt to shift the problem of housing insecurity outside their jurisdiction by criminalizing homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell, Don|first=Heynen, Nik|date=16 May 2013|title=The Geography of Survival and the Right to the City: Speculations on Surveillance, Legal Innovation, and the Criminalization of Intervention|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2747/0272-3638.30.6.611|journal=Urban Geography|volume=30|pages=611–632|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminalization of homelessness creates a vicious cycle of citations, fines, imprisonment, and reduced employability that further increases the difficulty of securing stable housing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; States that implement a Homeless Bill of Rights protect individuals' rights to exist in public spaces, thus requiring that cities attempt to directly address the issue of [[Housing insecurity in the United States|housing insecurity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, while a Homeless Bill of Rights may not directly create signifiant change in the lives of unhoused individuals, it can facilitate a shift in the American perspective of homelessness and open up avenues for further discourse, programs, and legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criminalization of Homelessness ==
The criminalization of homelessness can be defined as the passage of laws or ordinances that prohibit sitting, sleeping, panhandling, sharing food, or religious practice in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over 610,000 people are homeless on any given night in the United States, and a third of them are unsheltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhlmann|first=Ellyn|date=2014|title=A HOME to the HOMELESS|jstor=24603545|journal=American Libraries|volume=45|issue=11/12|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing issue of homelessness has been met with increasingly strict anti-homeless legislation that seeks to reduce the visibility of unhoused individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These measures penalize individuals from performing necessary, life-sustaining practices (such as sleeping) outside of the private domain, and disproportionately impact unhoused populations who have no choice but to occupy public space for these activities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Jonathan|date=Fall 2013|title=A Homeless Bill of Rights: Step by Step from State to State|url=https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=pilr|journal=Public Interest Law Reporter|volume=19|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by the [[Western Regional Advocacy Project]] (WRAP) have documented the impacts of such anti-homeless legislation by interviewing over 1,300 unhoused individuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of those interviewed, 81% of individuals reported being "harassed, cited or arrested for sleeping", 77% said they had been "harassed, cited or arrested for sitting or lying on the sidewalk", and 26% "knew of a safe place to sleep at night".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As [[The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]] concludes its report on the "[[criminalization of homelessness]]":&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;[[The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]], "[http://www.nlchp.org/view_report.cfm?id=366 Criminalizing Crisis: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities]", November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Laws that criminalize visible homelessness are immoral and offend our basic human instincts. They are contrary to the fundamental religious and political principals from which the American people seek guidance, and their existence demonstrates that we have fallen vastly short of our religious and foundational aspirations.}}

Homeless Bills of Rights seek to amend local codes that outlaw [[loitering]], [[vagrancy]], [[Sit-lie ordinance|sitting or lying on the sidewalk]], [[begging]], [[Urination|urinating]], eating in public, and other behaviors that disproportionately affect homeless people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most homeless advocates agree that the issue of homelessness can only be alleviated if there is a focus placed on changing laws that criminalize homelessness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy over Legislation Affecting the Homeless==
[[File:BedsNotJails.jpg|thumb|The "Beds Not Bars" slogan suggests that society must help homeless people instead of outlawing their behavior.]]

[[File:Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg|thumb|Skid Row in Los Angeles is sometimes mentioned as an area that would deteriorate if homelessness was not regulated]]

Opposition to legislature that supports the rights of unhoused individuals primarily comes from state and city officials, housed citizens, and varied business interests.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Marek, Heather, and Katie Sawicki. ''Decriminalizing Homelessness: Why Right to Rest Legislation Is the High Road for Oregon''. American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, 2017, ''Decriminalizing Homelessness: Why Right to Rest Legislation Is the High Road for Oregon'', aclu-or.org/en/publications/decriminalizing-homelessness-oregon.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the visibility of homelessness as a public issue is an implicit goal of many Homeless Bill of Rights advocates.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Marina|last2=Miller|first2=Nathaniel|last3=Walter|first3=Lindsay|last4=Selbin|first4=Jeffrey|date=2015-02-12|title=California's New Vagrancy Laws: The Growing Enactment and Enforcement of Anti-Homeless Laws in the Golden State|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2558944|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2558944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visible homelessness, especially in the form of encampments, is typically regarded as a failure of the city or state.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Most anti-homeless legislation seeks to mitigate the issue by moving unhoused individuals from one space to another and thus decrease the visibility of "undesirable" individuals in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Business interests, represented by the [[California Chamber of Commerce]], have called Assemblymember Tom Ammiano's Homeless Person's Bill of Rights &lt;ref name=2013AB5 /&gt; a "job killer" which would create "costly and unreasonable mandates on employers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/04/updated-homeless-bill-of-rights-passes-committee.html Updated homeless 'bill of rights' passes CA legislative committee]"; ''Sacramento Bee'', 23 April 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706224640/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/04/updated-homeless-bill-of-rights-passes-committee.html |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/california-homeless-bill-of-rights_n_3147926.html| title=California Homeless Bill Of Rights Bill Narrows, Advances In State Assembly| last=White| first= Jeremy B.| work=Sacramento Bee| date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities and local politicians also oppose the laws, which impose state authority to overturn local regulations. San Francisco Supervisor [[Scott Wiener]] commented:&lt;ref name=Johnston30May2013 /&gt;

{{quote|text=Our local laws against forming encampments, passing out and blocking sidewalks, and otherwise monopolizing public spaces would be wiped off the books. Think we have a street behavior problem now? Just wait until this passes.}}

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' suggested in an editorial that the Homeless Bill of Rights does not go far enough unless accompanied by economic resources allocated to provide housing.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial: "[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-homeless-bill-of-rights-20130111,0,1281934.story Homeless rights bill is wrong: There's no point in criminalizing homelessness. But a proposed 'bill of rights' is not the answer either. What the homeless really need are resources]", ''Los Angeles Times'', 11 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Joel John Roberts, CEO of People Assisting the Homeless, argued similarly that the Homeless Bill of Rights may be toothless and even enabling. Roberts writes:&lt;ref&gt;Joel John Roberts, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-john-roberts/homelessness-bill-of-rights_b_1617389.html Is a Homelessness Bill of Rights Just a Bill of Goods?]", ''Huffington Post'', 22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=There needs to be a balance between criminalizing homelessness with ordinances that persecute people who are forced to live on the street, and giving those same people the right to do whatever they want without any consequences. ... A more powerful Bill of Rights for people who are homeless, however, would consist of one simple right: the right to housing.}}

==Legislation in the United States==
The idea of a "Homeless Bill of Rights" has been discussed periodically in the U.S., and was presented formally by a group of New York City ministers on [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchett, David. "Homeless 'Bill of Rights' to revive Dr. King's 'fading voice'", ''New York Amsterdam News'', 11 January 1992; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/226364509 via ProQuest], 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; City Councilperson [[Peter Vallone Sr.|Peter Vallone]] introduced several versions of such a Bill in 1998, despite [[Mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani#Relations with the homeless|strong opposition from Mayor Rudy Giuliani]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Thrus, "[http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/504/vallone-plans-to-beat-rudy-on-homeless-rights-bill#.Ud7tBb8mz34 Vallone Plans to Beat Rudy on Homeless Rights Bill]", ''City Limits'', 31 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Rico and some states have passed laws adding homeless people to their lists of groups protected against hate crimes.&lt;ref name=NCH2012&gt;"[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/hatecrimes/hatecrimesmanual12.pdf Hate Crimes Against the Homeless: An Organizing Manual for Concerned Citizens]", ''National Coalition for the Homeless'', January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhode Island===
Rhode Island was the first state in the U.S. to pass a "Homeless Bill of Rights". John Joyce, who was homeless for a period in his life, is responsible for the initial introduction of the bill. The Rhode Island law, S-2052, was ratified in the state of [[Rhode Island]] on June 21, 2012 and signed into law by Governor [[Lincoln Chafee]] on June 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.630wpro.com/Article.asp?id=2483553&amp;spid=38785 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629182822/http://www.630wpro.com/Article.asp?id=2483553&amp;spid=38785 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-06-29 |title=Hundreds celebrate signing of Homeless Bill of Rights |date=2012-06-27 |publisher=WPRO }}&lt;/ref&gt; It amends the [[Rhode Island Fair Housing Act]] with wording intended to protect the rights of [[homelessness|homeless]] people and prevent discrimination against them. It is the first U.S. state-level law designed to protect the rights of homeless people.

The well-established Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless (and a newer subgroup called Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project) collaborated with the more radical [[Occupy Providence]] group to lobby successfully for the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wengronowitz, "Lessons From Occupy Providence", ''The Sociological Quarterly'' 54(2), March 2013. Accessed [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tsq.2013.54.issue-2/issuetoc via Wiley]; 3 July 2013. "OP would not have been able to negotiate the deal with the City without the decades-long effort by RICH and later RIHAP to create organizational infrastructure—for example, communication networks, development of coalitional relationships, and media contacts. In fact, RICH's infrastructure itself significantly supported the founding of RIHAP. Rhode Island became the first state to pass a Homeless Bill of Rights in late June 2012, an action less likely without RICH, RIHAP, OP, and their ability to work across differences. For instance, some RICH members were concerned that OP was "too radical," but OP was fortunate in that RICH considers seriously the concept of coalition building. Ryczek (2011, capitalization in original) defended the collaboration this way to RICH members: 'Coalitions rarely see eye to eye on each and every single factor concerning their common interests ... We certainly ... will not agree on all issues. Yet, where common ground and common goals DO exist it must be our role to move on such commonalities.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallory Moretti, "[http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/providence/occupy-providence-march-rally-for-homelessness-affordable-housing-in-rhode-island Occupy Prov. marches for homelessness: Governor allows tents on State House law]"; ''WPRI'', 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation passed in Rhode Island guaranteed unhoused individuals seven [[negative rights]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, while it expressly states that "[n]o person's rights, privileges, or access to public services may be denied or abridged solely because he or she is homeless", the law does not guarantee [[Negative and positive rights|positive rights]] such as housing or food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Because the legislation simply restates the rights of all citizens of Rhode Island, some homeless advocates are concerned that it has not had enough impact.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jake Grovum, "[http://www.governing.com/news/state/sl-first-homeless-bill-of-rights.html Nation's 1st Homeless Bill of Rights Slow to Cause Change in Rhode Island]", 12 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this Bill is still noteworthy because the rights it does guarantee are judicially enforceable, and because it was the first of its kind to be passed in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Illinois===

Illinois is the second state to adopt a homeless bill of rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagohomeless.org/illinois-becomes-2nd-state-to-enact-a-homeless-bill-of-rights/&lt;/ref&gt; The measure, SB 1210, was passed in May 2013 by the Illinois General Assembly and immediately went into effect after being signed by Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] on August 22 of that year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

|-
|Section 10. Bill of Rights.

(a) No person's rights, privileges, or access to public services may be denied or abridged solely because he or she is homeless. Such a person shall be granted the same rights and privileges as any other citizen of this State. A person experiencing homelessness has the following rights:

# the right to use and move freely in public spaces, including but not limited to public sidewalks, public parks, public transportation, and public buildings, in the same manner as any other person and without discrimination on the basis of his or her housing status;
# the right to equal treatment by all State and municipal agencies, without discrimination on the basis of housing status;
# the right not to face discrimination while seeking or maintaining employment due to his or her lack of permanent mailing address, or his or her mailing address being that of a shelter or social service provider; 
# the right to emergency medical care free from discrimination based on his or her housing status;
# the right to vote, register to vote, and receive documentation necessary to prove identity for voting without discrimination due to his or her housing status;
# the right to protection from disclosure of his or her records and information provided to homeless shelters and service providers to State, municipal, and private entities without appropriate legal authority; and the right to confidentiality of personal records and information in accordance with all limitations on disclosure established by the federal Homeless Management Information Systems, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the federal Violence Against Women Act; and
# the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her personal property to the same extent as personal property in a permanent residence.

(b) As used in this Act, "housing status" has the same meaning as that contained in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.
|}
The Illinois implementation of the Homeless Bill of Rights was significant because it included the ability to maintain employment as a right that unhoused individuals could claim. Many people struggling with homelessness also face employment discrimination, which makes it more difficult for them to attain financial and housing security. The Illinois law is also noteworthy because it allows plaintiffs to recover monetary damages and attorney's fees should their rights be infringed upon, something that is not covered in the Connecticut legislation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Connecticut ===

On June 5, the Connecticut Assembly passed a Homeless Bill of Rights (SB 896) with seven protections similar to those passed in Rhode Island. After it was signed by Governor [[Dan Malloy]], the bill took effect on October 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Connecticut law significantly includes freedom from police harassment in its first section.&lt;ref name=Keyes12June2013&gt;Scott Keyes, "[http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/06/12/2139181/connecticut-homeless/?mobile=nc Connecticut Passes Landmark ‘Homeless Person’s Bill Of Rights’ Law]", ''ThinkProgress'', 12 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" style="width:100%; background:inherit"
! Excerpt from Connecticut bill SB 896
|-
|
(a) There is created a Homeless Person's Bill of Rights to guarantee that the rights, privacy and property of homeless persons are adequately safeguarded and protected under the laws of this state. The rights afforded homeless persons to ensure that their person, privacy and property are safeguarded and protected, as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, are available only insofar as they are implemented in accordance with other parts of the general statutes, state rules and regulations, federal law, the state Constitution and the United States Constitution. For purposes of this section, "homeless person" means any person who does not have a fixed or regular residence and who may live on the street or outdoors, or in a homeless shelter or another temporary residence.

(b) Each homeless person in this state has the right to:

# Move freely in public spaces, including on public sidewalks, in public parks, on public transportation and in public buildings without harassment or intimidation from law enforcement officers in the same manner as other persons;
# Have equal opportunities for employment;
# Receive emergency medical care;
# Register to vote and to vote;
# Have personal information protected;
# Have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her personal property; and
# Receive equal treatment by state and municipal agencies.

(c) Each municipality shall conspicuously post in the usual location for municipal notices a notice entitled "HOMELESS PERSON'S BILL OF RIGHTS" that contains the text set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

Laws in cities throughout Connecticut prohibit a person without a bed from sleeping on a park bench, ban someone without a place to be during the day from standing in a public plaza, and restrict the ability of a person without access to food to ask for money to buy something to eat.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Frankel, Allison, et al.

===California===

State Assemblymember [[Tom Ammiano]] (D-San Francisco) introduced a Homeless Person's Bill of Rights&lt;ref name=2013AB5&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB5 Assem.

California's Homeless Bill of Rights(Right2Rest Act), SB 608, was introduced by Senator Carol Liu (D) in February 2015.  The  "Right to Rest Act," would, among other things, protect the rights of homeless people to move freely, rest, eat, perform religious observations in public space as well as protect their right to occupy a legally parked motor vehicle.  Also refer to UC Berkeley's Policy Advocacy Clinic Presents: California's New Vagrancy Laws a New Report on the Growing Criminalzation of Homeless People in California.

A vote was not rendered during the 2015 process in the Housing and Transportation Committee and was asked to come back for a vote in the next California legislation session with amendments in order to get the necessary votes and pass to the next house.

=== Colorado ===
The Colorado Right-to-Rest Act, known as HB-1284, was proposed to the State Legislature in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tony. "No Right to Rest: Police Enforcement Patterns and Quality of Life Consequences of the Criminalization of Homelessness." ''Urban Affairs Review'', 2017, pp. 1–33., doi:10.1177/1078087417690833.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the bill proposed in California, HB-1284 seeks to protect the rights of unhoused individuals to move without fear of harassment, sleep, eat and share food, engage in religious practices, and occupy a legally parked vehicle in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Robinson, Tony, and Allision Sickels. ''No Right to Rest: Criminalizing Homelessness in Colorado''. Denver Homeless Out Loud, 2015, ''No Right to Rest: Criminalizing Homelessness in Colorado'', www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/homelessness-study.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the Homeless Bills of Rights proposed before it, this legislation does not guarantee the rights of unhoused individuals to obtain safe shelter.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The bill is currently under consideration by the Colorado State Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb17-1314|title=Colorado Right To Rest Act {{!}} Colorado General Assembly|website=leg.colorado.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Halevi Horowitz Weiler''' (born 2 September 1951) is a [[South Africa]]n-American academic, currently serving as European Union [[Jean Monnet Chair]] at [[New York University Law School]] and Senior Fellow of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard. 

He was President of the [[European University Institute]] in Florence from 2013 until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eui.eu/About/Organization/PresidentSecretaryGeneral/Index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a diploma from the [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. Weiler is the author of works relating to the [[sui generis]] character of the [[European Union]]. He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. On 7 December 2012 the European University Institute's High Council approved his selection as the European University Institute's new President. He started his term on 1 September 2013 and served through 31 August 2016.

==Career==
He holds degrees from Sussex (BA); Cambridge (LLB and LLM) and The Hague Academy of International Law (Diploma of International Law); he earned his PhD in European Law at the EUI, Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=WEILER, JOSEPH H. H. |title= Who's Who in America 2006 |place= New Providence, NJ  |publisher=Marquis Who's Who |year=2005 |volume= 2 (M-Z)|page= 4981 |edition=60th |url= https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinamerica2005marq|via= Internet Archive |accessdate= November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is recipient of Doctorates Honoris Causa from [[London University]], [[Sussex University]], the [[University of Macerata]], the [[University of Navarra]], the [[University of Ljubljana]], [[University of Edinburgh]], [[CEU San Pablo University]] - Madrid, [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], [[Roma Tre University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniroma3.it/news2.php?news=2808&amp;p=1 Laurea Honoris Causa al Professor Joseph H.H. Weiler,   31 gennaio 2013, l’Università degli Studi Roma Tre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142906/http://www.uniroma3.it/news2.php?news=2808&amp;p=1 |date= 5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democritus University of Thrace]] - Greece, [[University of Bucharest]], the [[Catholic University of America]] and the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]].

From 1978 to 1985 he was member of the Department of Law at the European University Institute, Florence, where in 1989 he was co-founder of its Academy of European Law. He later served as Professor of Law at the [[University of Michigan Law School]] (1985–1992) and as Manley Hudson Professor and Jean Monnet Chair at [[Harvard Law School]] (1992–2001).

He is Visiting Professor at, among others, the [[University of Paris]], the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po), the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], the [[Max Planck Institute for International Law]] at [[Heidelberg]], the [[College of Europe]] in [[Bruges]] and [[Natolin]], [[All Souls College, Oxford]], [[Chicago Law School]], [[Stanford Law School]], [[Yale Law School]], the [[Ortega y Gasset]] Institute, Madrid, the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], the University of Ljubljana and [http://www.catolicalaw.fd.lisboa.ucp.pt/ Católica Global School of Law].

One of the topics of his specific interest is the influence of (Christian) church on [[European integration]]. He coined the term "[[Christophobia]]" in his book ''A Christian Europe: An Exploratory Essay'': &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/11/does-it-make-sense-to-speak-of-christophobia Does it make sense to-speak of "christophobia" ?] by Matthew Schmitz. ''First Things,'' 29 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is a Europe that, while celebrating the noble heritage of Enlightenment humanism, also abandons its '''Christophobia''' and neither fears nor is embarrassed by the recognition that Christianity is one of the central elements in the evolution of its unique civilization. It is, finally, a Europe that, in public discourse about its own past and future, recovers all the riches that can come from confronting one of its two principal intellectual and spiritual traditions.}}

The term was then popularized by [[George Weigel]]'s  ''The Cube and the Cathedral''. 

Weiler contributes to the legal theory of European integration, he writes on many areas of [[EU law]] (internal market, external relations, social law, and above all, institutional law). He is a particular authority on the role of the [[European Court of Justice]]. He is the Editor-in-chief of the ''[[European Journal of International Law]]'' (EJIL) and the ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'' (I•CON).

== Court cases ==

=== Calvo-Goller libel action ===
Weiler was a defendant in a criminal libel action brought in the French courts by Israeli scholar Dr Karin Calvo-Goller&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clb.ac.il College of Law and Business, Ramat-Gan, Israel&lt;!--her homepage is no longer listed--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning a review of her book ''The Trial Proceedings of the International Criminal Court. ICTY and ICTR Precedents'' ([[Martinus Nijhoff]], 2006) that appeared on the Global Law Books website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globallawbooks.org/reviews/detail.asp?id=298 globallawbooks.org]&lt;/ref&gt; which Weiler edits. The review was written by Professor Thomas Weigend of the [[University of Cologne]]. Calvo-Goller contended that it was libelous. Upon complaint by Calvo-Goller, Weiler declined to remove the review from the website and Calvo-Goller subsequently filed suit.

The suit was notable for the issues that it raised concerning the balance between academic freedom and the rights of those who consider themselves to have been libeled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conflictoflaws.net/2010/book-reviews-criminal-libel-and-the-jurisdiction-of-french-courts/ conflictoflaws.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zoë |last=Corbyn |title=Scholar vs scholar: libel case's 'disturbing implications' for free speech |publisher=''[[Times Higher Education]]''|date= 25 February 2010 |url=
http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=410542&amp;c=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dean of the Investigating Judges of Paris accepted Calvo-Goller's complaint and the District Attorney decided to bring suit against Weiler. The case was heard by the Tribunal de Grand Instance de Paris on January 20, 2011, with the verdict handed down in Paris on March 3, 2011, dismissing the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=chronicle.com|url=http://chronicle.com/article/French-Court-Finds-in-Favor-of/126599/ |title=French Court finds in favor of journal editor sued for libel over book review }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its verdict, the Paris Tribunal said it had no jurisdiction in the case since Calvo-Goller did not bring proof by a court-appointed clerk that the book review website was visible in French territory the day or before the day she brought the case to the dean of the investigating judges in Paris. The Paris Tribunal also declared that the words used by Weigend did not constitute ''libel'' and were within the limits of ''free critical book review speech''. The court said his words in the review were ''measured'', and the court therefore dismissed the case. The court ordered Calvo-Goller to pay 8,000 euros (around US$10,000 ) in damages to Dr Weiler to cover his expenses.

=== ''Lautsi v. Italy'' ===
In June 2010 Weiler intervened ''[[pro bono]]'' on behalf of eight governments before the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case ''[[Lautsi v. Italy]]''. He was defending [[Italy]]'s right to require the [[crucifix]] to be displayed in public school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comparativeconstitutions.org/2011/03/landmark-ecthr-ruling-on-crucifix-in.html |title=Landmark ECtHR ruling on Crucifix in the Italian Classroom |publisher=Constitutionmaking.org |date=2011-03-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DoQjHw1L?url=http://www.comparativeconstitutions.org/2011/03/landmark-ecthr-ruling-on-crucifix-in.html |archivedate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reversing the unanimous (7:0) decision of the lower Chamber, the Grand Chamber ruled by a large majority (15:2) that the display of crucifixes in Italian classrooms does not contravene the [[European Convention of Human Rights]].

In an interview Weiler stated that he was intervening on behalf of Italy not because he wanted to defend [[Christianity]] but to defend [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/tackling-taboos-jews-and-christians-cross-and-deicide |title=Tackling taboos on Jews and Christians, the cross and deicide |publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |author=[[John L.

'''Kenneth Addison Duncan''' (born August 23, 1945)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Home/Home?uid=2133884 |title=Kenneth Duncan, August 1945 |publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]] |accessdate=July 5, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[lawyer]] from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], who from 1996 to 2000 served a single term as the elected [[Louisiana]] [[state treasurer]]. He was unseated in the 1999 [[primary election]] by fellow Democrat, later [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[John Kennedy (Louisiana politician)|John Kennedy]], now the state's junior [[U.S. Senate|U.S. senator]].

==Biography==

Duncan was reared and educated in the [[State school|public schools]] of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] but later moved to [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], where he graduated in 1963 from [[Neville High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/people/Ken-Duncan/7341133935|title=Ken Duncan|publisher=classmates.com|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan received a [[Juris Doctor]]ate from [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] in Baton Rouge and was admitted to the bar in 1971. He received a [[Master of Laws]] in [[taxation]] from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;"Louisiana: Duncan, Ken", ''Who's Who in American Politics, 2003-2004'', 19th ed., Vol. 1 (Alabama-Montana) (Marquis Who's Who: [[New Providence, New Jersey|New Providence]], [[New Jersey]], 2003), p. 777&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1978, he has headed Duncan &amp; Associates in Baton Rouge, a firm of law, business entrepreneurship, and public service.&lt;ref name=cubahoy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubahoy.org/agenda/ |title=Ken Duncan |publisher=cubahoy.org |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095428/http://www.cubahoy.org/agenda/ |archivedate=May  2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he announced for treasurer, Duncan owned Savant Insurance Services. He is a co-founder of the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], an organization originally associated with former [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. He promised if elected to act as the [[chief executive officer]] of the state and to stop fraud in the popular [[Food Stamp Program|food stamp]] program.&lt;ref&gt;"Duncan runs for Louisiana State Treasurer", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', October 2, 1995, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In his initial election as treasurer to succeed Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]], who ran unsuccessfully for [[governor of Louisiana]] in 1995, Duncan with 448,182 votes (34.9 percent) led a four candidate field of two Republicans, Mary Chehardy and Gayle Joseph, and his fellow Democrat [[Steve Theriot]], who ran second with 372,500 votes (29 percent). Chehardy and Joseph finished with 335,463 (26.1 percent) and 128,272 (10 percent), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10211995/10211995_Statewide.html|title=Election Results|date=October 21, 1995|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second balloting, called the [[general election]] in Louisiana though both candidates were Democrats, Duncan defeated Theriot, a departing [[Louisiana House of Representatives|state representative]] from [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], 798,280 (56.7 percent) to 610,964 (43.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11181995/11181995_Statewide.html |title= Election Results |date= November 18, 1995 |publisher= Louisiana Secretary of State |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan is a former chairman, general counsel, and executive director of the National Association of Democratic State Treasurers.&lt;ref name=cubahoy/&gt; In 1999, Duncan announced the establishment of the Louisiana State Investment Task Force composed of officials from the four largest state pension funds, state employees, teachers, other school employees, and [[Louisiana State Police]], all based in Baton Rouge. The task force was charged with studying economically-targeted in-state investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pionline.com/article/19990204/ONLINE/902040704/louisiana-treasurer-ken-duncan-will-officially-announce-the-formation |title= Louisiana Treasurer Ken Duncan will officially announce the formation |date=February 4, 1999 |agency= Pensions &amp; Investments |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As treasurer, Duncan was also the chairman of the Louisiana Bond Commission, which reviews and approves all state and local issuances of bonds. Early in his tenure as treasurer, Duncan sought the refunding of as much as $610 million of state [[general obligation bond]]s that was expected to save the state $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Ken-Duncan.html|title=Ken Duncan|publisher=engagingnews.us|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kennedy, no relations to the [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]] of [[Massachusetts]], unseated Duncan, 621,796 (55.6 percent) to 497,319 (44.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10231999/10231999_Statewide.html|title=Louisiana election returns for state treasurer, October 23, 1999|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy remains the state treasurer and is expected to be a candidate for a fifth term in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] set for October 24, 2015.

Duncan was a delegate to both the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|1996]] and the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]]s, which confirmed the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-[[Al Gore|Gore]] and Gore-[[Joseph Lieberman|Lieberman]] [[ticket (politics)|tickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/duncan.html|title=Ken Duncan|publisher=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a co-founder and member of the Louisiana Democratic Leadership Council.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

The '''Kenya Law Reports''' are the official law reports of the Republic of [[Kenya]] which may be cited in proceedings in all courts of Kenya (section 21 of the Act). The enactment of the National Council for Law Reporting Act arose from the need to bridge the gap that existed in official law reporting and to institutionalize law reporting within Kenya's government structure. The Council was established on 20 May 1996 under the chairmanship of [[Abdul Majid Cockar]], then Chief Justice. The first volume of the re-launched Kenya Law Reports, the [1981] KLR, was released on 11 January 2002. The Council has published 11 years of this backlog (1981–1991) and simultaneously published law reports for years (2001–2004). In 2006, the Council commenced the publication of specialized law reports that presented the varied subjects of law, beginning with Environment and Land Law reports.

{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}
A '''key generator''' ('''key-gen''') is a computer program that generates a [[product key|product licensing key]], such as a [[serial number]], necessary to [[Product activation|activate]] for use of a [[software application]]. Keygens may be legitimately distributed by software manufacturers for licensing software in commercial environments where software has been licensed in bulk for an entire site or enterprise, or they may be distributed illegitimately in circumstances of [[copyright infringement]] or software piracy. Illegitimate key generators are typically distributed by [[software cracking|software crackers]] in the [[warez scene]] and [[demoscene]]. These keygens often play "Keygen music", which may include the genres [[dubstep]] or [[chiptunes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Driscoll et. Diaz|first1=Kevin et. Joshua|title=Endless loop: A brief history of chiptunes|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/96/94|website=Transformative Works and Cultures|publisher=Transformative Works and Cultures|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the background and have artistic user interfaces.

==Software licensing==
A [[software license]] is a legal instrument that governs the usage and distribution of computer software.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103947/http://knol.google.com/k/jon-gillespie-brown/what-is-software-licensing/3v64x901bjfe2/2%23 What is Software licensing?&lt;/ref&gt; Often, such licenses are enforced by implementing in the software a [[product activation]] or [[digital rights management]] (DRM) mechanism,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111121001926/http://knol.google.com/k/why-product-activation-for-software-is-becoming-widespread%23&lt;/ref&gt; seeking to prevent unauthorized use of the software by issuing a code sequence that must be entered into the application when prompted or stored in its configuration.{{better source needed|date=April 2017}}

==Key verification==
Many programs attempt to verify or validate licensing keys over the Internet by establishing a session with a licensing application of the software publisher. Advanced keygens bypass this mechanism, and include additional features for key verification, for example by generating the validation data which would otherwise be returned by an activation server. If the software offers phone activation then the keygen could generate the correct activation code to finish activation. Another method that has been used is activation server emulation, this patches the program memory to use the keygen as activation server.

==Multi-keygen==
A multi-keygen is a keygen that offers key generation for multiple software applications. Multi-keygens are sometimes released over singular keygens if a series of products requires the same [[algorithm]] for generating [[product key]]s. In this case, only a single value encoded within the key has to be changed in order to target a different product.

==Authors and distribution==
Unauthorised keygens that typically violate software licensing terms are written by programmers who engage in [[reverse engineering]] and [[software cracking]], often called ''crackers'', to circumvent [[copy protection]] of software or [[digital rights management]] for [[multimedia]].

Keygens are available for download on [[warez]] sites or through [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks.

==Malware keygens==
Many unauthorised keygens, available through P2P networks or otherwise, contain [[Malware|malicious payloads]].&lt;ref name=msir13&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/1/F/C1F6A2B2-F45F-45F7-B788-32D2CCA48D29/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_13_English.pdf Microsoft Security Intelligence Report Volume 13, p14]&lt;/ref&gt; These key generators may or may not generate a valid key, but the embedded malware loaded invisibly at the same time may, for example, be a version of [[CryptoLocker#Imitators|CryptoLocker]] ([[ransomware]]).&lt;ref name=eset-cl2&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptolocker 2.0 – new version, or copycat?|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/12/19/cryptolocker-2-0-new-version-or-copycat/|work=WeLiveSecurity|publisher=ESET|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm-newcl&gt;{{cite web|title=New CryptoLocker Spreads via Removable Drives|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-cryptolocker-spreads-via-removable-drives/|publisher=Trend Micro|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antivirus software]] may discover malware embedded in keygens; such software often also identifies unauthorised keygens which do not contain a payload as [[Malware#Grayware|potentially unwanted software]], often labelling them with a name such as Win32/Keygen or Win32/Gendows.&lt;ref name=msir13/&gt;

==Keychan==
A key changer or keychan is a variation of a keygen.  A keychan is a small piece of software that changes the license key or serial number of a particular piece of proprietary software installed on a computer.

The '''Mahkamah Mosque''' (also known as '''Mosque of Birdibak''' or '''Madrasa of Amir Bardabak'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] transliteration: ''Jāmi' al-Mahkamah al-Birdibakiyyah'') is a [[congregational mosque]] and ''[[madrasa]]'', built in 1455. It was destroyed by Israeli bombing during the [[Gaza war (2014)|attack on Gaza]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=720543|title=Long-neglected Gaza heritage wilts in war|publisher=Ma'an News Agency|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was located along Baghdad Street near the main western entrance of the [[Shuja'iyya]] district in [[Gaza City]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"&gt;Sadeq, Mu'en. [http://www.explorewithmwnf.net/monument.php?cn=pa&amp;location=38&amp;th=1&amp;mid=822 Madrasa of Amir Bardabak (el-Mahkama Mosque)]. Excerpt from Sadeq's ''Pilgrimage, Sciences and Sufism: Islamic Art in the West Bank and Gaza'' provided by Museum With No Frontiers. 2004-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mosque was built in 1455 on the orders of Sayf al-Din Birdibak al-Ashrafi, the ''[[majordomo|dawadar]]'' of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Sayf al-Din Inal]]. Birdibak was highly religious and convened an annual conference to discuss the [[hadith]] of the 9th-century [[Muslim]] scholar [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]. He reached high positions within the Mamluk state and built two other Friday mosques in [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]]. The Mahkamah Mosque was originally part of a ''[[madrasa]]'' ("religious school"), and education served as the building's principal function. Prayers were also held regularly and on Fridays.&lt;ref name="Sharon166"/&gt;

During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule between the 16th and early 20th centuries, the school functioned as a courthouse for the city's ''[[qadi]]s'' ("judges"), hence its Arabic name ''al-Mahkamah'' ("the Court.")&lt;ref name="Sharon166"&gt;Sharon, 2009, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=P2LtyFVNJmcC&amp;pg=PA166  166]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th-century Swiss scholar Max van Berchem found a [[Kufic]] inscription fixed over the ''[[mihrab]]'' ("pulpit") of the mosque that belonged to the tombstone of Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Hashimi,&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P2LtyFVNJmcC&amp;pg=PA41  41]&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[Hashemite]] family who had died in Gaza in the late 9th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P2LtyFVNJmcC&amp;pg=PA44  44]&lt;/ref&gt; On top of the mosque's entrance is the foundation inscription crediting Birdibak for the mosque's construction and honoring Sultan Inal.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P2LtyFVNJmcC&amp;pg=PA167  167]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period following [[World War I]] it served as boy's religious school under the name Madrasa al-Shuja‘iyya al-Amiriyya. The mosque was destroyed by the Israeli airforce in Operation "Protective Edge".&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt;

==Architecture==
The mosque was constructed in the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluk]] style.&lt;ref name="Shahin437"&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a unique example of [[Mamluk architecture]], having been highly influenced by earlier [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] mosque-madrasas. In particular, the niches of the northern facade strongly resemble the architectural elements of Ayyubid structures in Egypt and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Sadeq"&gt;Sadeq, 2007, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The complex consists of a central ''[[sahn]]'' ("courtyard") situated 1.2 meters below street level.&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt; There are several [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] places in the courtyard area.&lt;ref name="Shahin437"/&gt;

North of the courtyard is the [[facade]] where the main entrance is located. The entrance portal is topped by a pointed [[arch]] with floral decorations. The northern part of the mosque consists of the entrance hall and three other rectangular-shaped rooms each measuring 3.77 meters by 3.69 meters. Each room, including the entrance hall, is topped by a small dome. The southern part of the complex was laid out in a similar manner, but is in ruins. The rooms on both sides of the mosque served as lodging for the [[sheikh]] and his students and provided other services as well. This particular layout makes the Mahkamah Mosque the only ''madrasa'' of its kind still standing in Gaza.&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt;

The courtyard is bordered to the southwest by the ''[[iwan]]''. The ''iwan'' is divided into three sections and is the largest part of the mosque complex. The central portion serves as the principal section and is covered by a fan-shaped [[cross vault]]. It contains the ''[[mihrab]]'' ("niche" that indicates the ''[[qibla]]'' which is the direction towards [[Mecca]]) and the ''[[minbar]]'' ("pulpit").&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt; The ''minbar'' is adorned with [[marble]] paneling, floral motifs and [[Quran|Qur'anic]] inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Sadeq"/&gt; The main section is bordered by two smaller outer sections with [[barrel vault]]ing and pointed arches connecting both structures with the main section. In the northwest, a smaller Mamluk-era ''iwan'' that previously faced the main ''iwan'' is extant.&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt; The western facade is mostly in ruins as well.&lt;ref name="Shahin437"/&gt;

In the northwestern corner of the mosque is the Mamluk-style [[minaret]]. The base of the minaret is rectangular, while the shaft is composed of two octagonal stories topped by the octagonal [[muezzin]]'s gallery. The sides of the base contain niches that "alleviate the austerity of the structure" according to [[Islamic art]] researcher Mu'en Sadeq. The octagonal levels of the minaret's body are designed with [[embrasure]]s decorated with translucent floral and geometric ornamentation. The embrasures allow light and ventilation into the interior spiral staircase that leads to the muezzin's gallery which rests on stone [[muqarnas]].&lt;ref name="SadeqMWNF"/&gt;

'''Martin H. "Marty" Tankleff''' (born August 29, 1971) is a [[Long Island, New York]], resident who was convicted of murdering his wealthy parents, Seymour and Arlene Tankleff, on September 7, 1988, when he was 17 years old.  After serving more than 17 years of imprisonment, his conviction was [[vacated judgment|vacated]] and he was released from prison in 2007.

== Imprisonment ==

Tankleff was admitted to the New York State Department of Correctional Services in October 1990. In State custody, Tankleff was incarcerated at the [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] in Dannemora, New York, in a special housing unit called "APPU" for high-profile inmates and inmates at high risk of victimization.

== Trial and acquittal ==

Tankleff was convicted of killing his parents, Seymour and Arlene Tankleff, on June 28, 1990 and sentenced to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life in prison. A 2003 appeal, however, presented new evidence from 20 witnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/t/martin_tankleff/index.html|publisher=The New York Times | first=Bruce | last=Lambert|title=Questions About a Son's Guilt, and a Cop's Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an appellate court ultimately overturned his conviction after Tankleff served 17 years in prison. Tankleff was represented by attorney Barry Pollack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|title=Man's Appeal in Killings of Parents Takes a Twist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/nyregion/man-s-appeal-in-killings-of-parents-takes-a-twist.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the Suffolk County District Attorney dropped the charges, New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]] appointed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny.gov/governor/press/0112081.html Www.Ny.Gov – Governor Spitzer Announces Appointment Of Attorney General Cuomo As Special Prosecutor To Investigate Tankleff Murders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404094955/http://www.ny.gov/governor/press/0112081.html |date=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]] as special prosecutor in the case. From his staff, Cuomo selected Chief Trial Counsel, Benjamin Rosenberg, and veteran homicide prosecutor, Thomas Schellhammer, to reinvestigate the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/01/18/2008-01-18_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_appoints_t-2.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 2008, Rosenberg announced the results of the Attorney General's investigation. "The issue in this case is not whether there is evidence," he said to Justice Doyle, "but whether there is sufficient evidence." Rosenberg then announced: "The people move to dismiss the indictment." In the same motion, prosecutors announced they would not proceed against suspects identified by Tankleff's defense team, revealing that, "on balance, the defense theory does not appear to be supported by clear evidence." 

On July 22, 2008, Justice Doyle concurred with the Attorney General's motion to dismiss. All charges facing Tankleff were dropped; he would not face retrial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/news/local/suffolk/ny-litank0723,0,4341550.story&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident and subsequent trials were the subject of ''A Criminal Injustice: A True Crime, a False Confession, and the Fight to Free Marty Tankleff'', published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 2008.

On January 7, 2014, Tankleff was awarded $3.4 million from the state after settling his wrongful conviction lawsuit. Tankleff graduated from law school at [[Touro Law Center]] on May 25, 2014. On April 2017, he passed the New York State bar exam. &lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2017/04/27/man-wrongfully-convicted-of-murder-is-becoming-a-lawyer/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal case ==
Tankleff and his attorneys appeared before the U.S. District Court, the Eastern District of New York in [[Central Islip, New York]] for a hearing on October 30, 2017. He sued [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], in addition to various people who were police and county employees at the time of his arrest and trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libn.com/2017/10/30/tankleff-case-heads-for-trial/?ep=1/ |publisher=Long Island Business News| title=Tankleff case heads for trial|date=October 30, 2017|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tankleff was represented by [[Barry Scheck]] of [[Innocence Project]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/tankleff-murder-suffolk-lawsuit-1.14687745 |publisher=New York Newsday|date=October 30, 2017| title=Federal judge gives Tankleff, Suffolk time to settle suit|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, Tankleff reached a settlement with Suffolk County for $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/martin-tankleff-1.18153221 |publisher=New York Newsday|date=April 19, 2018| title=Martin Tankleff awarded $10 million settlement in Suffolk|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite news|work=The Times|title=Enron Three lose test case against extradition to US|date=21 February 2006|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article733156.ece|accessdate=14 April 2008|first=Simon|last=Freeman|location=London, UK}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; are three British businessmen – '''Giles Darby''', '''David Bermingham''' and '''Gary Mulgrew'''.&lt;ref name="hodder"/&gt; In 2002 they were [[indictment|indicted]] in [[Houston, Texas]] on seven counts of [[wire fraud]] against their former employer [[Greenwich NatWest]], at the time a division of [[National Westminster Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 July 2006|title=NatWest Three: the US indictment|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5174358.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a high-profile battle in the British courts they were [[extradition|extradited]] from the United Kingdom to the United States in 2006. On 28 November 2007, each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in exchange for the other charges being dropped.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|date=28 November 2007|title=NatWest Three plead guilty to wire fraud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/28/2|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK|first=Andrew|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. Initially they were jailed in the US, but were later repatriated to UK prisons to serve out the rest of their sentences and released from custody in August 2010.

==Background==
In the year 2000 the three had been working for Greenwich NatWest, then a unit of [[National Westminster Bank]], later acquired by [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (RBS). The three were involved in Greenwich NatWest's dealings with [[Enron Corporation]]. As a result of these dealings NatWest owned a stake in a [[Cayman Islands]]-registered partnership called '''Swap Sub'''.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swap Sub was a [[special purpose entity]] created by [[Andrew Fastow]], Enron's [[Chief Financial Officer|CFO]], ostensibly for the purpose of [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] Enron's investment in [[Rhythms NetConnections]], an [[internet service provider]]. Swap Sub's assets consisted of cash and Enron stock. Its liability was an option giving Enron the ability to require it to buy Enron's entire investment in Rhythms NetConnections at a predetermined price in 2004.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;Fox, pp. 152–53&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to NatWest, [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] held an equal stake in Swap Sub. The remainder was owned by a partnership managed by Fastow.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

In March 2000, Enron decided to terminate the hedging arrangement with Swap Sub. Fastow managed to persuade Enron to pay Swap Sub a $30 million fee to terminate the option and recover the Enron stock it owned,&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; even though, because of a decline in the price of the Rhythms stock, "Swap Sub owed Enron a ton of money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron|first=Robert|last=Bryce|location=New York|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2003|isbn=1-58648-201-7|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; $10 million of the payment went to Credit Suisse First Boston; Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the other $20 million would go to NatWest, but in fact only $1 million did so. The payment, which was formally agreed on 22 March 2000, resulted in large profits for Swap Sub, enriching several Enron employees who had acquired ownership interests in the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Fox (2004), pp. 159–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==The crime==
According to the Statement of Facts which was signed by all three defendants as part of their eventual [[plea bargain]], the Three realized in early 2000 that, because of rises in the stock prices of Enron and Rhythms, NatWest's interest in Swap Sub "had quite some value".&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 16&lt;/ref&gt;  On 22 February of that year, the three bankers made a presentation to   Enron CFO Andrew Fastow suggesting ways in which this value could be captured; however, Fastow ultimately rejected this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, Fastow contacted Gary Mulgrew in late February or early March 2000 and offered to purchase NatWest's interest in Swap Sub.&lt;ref name="facts_20"&gt;Statement of Facts, section 20&lt;/ref&gt;   He also offered Mulgrew what is described in the Statement of Facts as "an unspecified financial opportunity" if he were to leave NatWest.&lt;ref name="facts_20"/&gt; Mulgrew discussed this conversation with Darby and Bermingham. On 6 March 2000, Fastow's assistant Michael Kopper contacted Darby with a formal proposal that a company Kopper controlled should purchase NatWest's stake in Swap Sub for $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulgrew and Darby subsequently recommended to their superiors that NatWest should accept this offer.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, the three bankers learned that the "unspecified financial opportunity" which had been mentioned to Mulgrew involved their personally acquiring a portion of NatWest's stake in Swap Sub.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 23&lt;/ref&gt; In furtherance of this, Kopper set up a deal for the Three to acquire a [[put option]] on half of NatWest's former stake in the company. On 17 March, Darby collected the signatures needed to finalize the NatWest sale.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 26.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March the Three executed the option agreement with Kopper.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Three concealed both their dealings with Fastow and Kopper, and the fact that they now had a financial interest in the company that bought Swap Sub, from their superiors at NatWest.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Statement of Facts, the Three were unaware of the 22 March agreement to pay $30 million to Swap Sub.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 29&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2000, Bermingham, who had resigned from NatWest in the meantime, exercised the options, resulting in a profit of more than $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 31&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently split the proceeds with Darby and Mulgrew.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Facts, section 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of legal proceedings==
===FSA investigation===
In November 2001 the three bankers, having now moved to work at [[Royal Bank of Canada]], learned that the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) was investigating Fastow, voluntarily met with the British [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) to discuss the deal.&lt;ref name="hays"&gt;
{{cite news|work=Houston Chronicle|title=Source: British bankers to plead guilty in Enron case|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/5333449.html|date=27 November 2007|accessdate=16 November 2015|first=Kristen|last=Hays}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_q_and_a"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian|title=Q&amp;A: NatWest Three|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/13/corporatefraud.enron3|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their own account, the Three initiated this meeting in order to "ensure transparency". Bermingham later claimed that "[w]e gave [the FSA] everything because we thought we had nothing to hide."&lt;ref name="boggan"/&gt;

In February 2002 the FSA completed its inquiries without taking any action.&lt;ref name="hays"/&gt; It later emerged that the FSA had passed the results of its investigation to the SEC, which had in turn passed them on to the prosecutors in the US Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="times_fsa"&gt;
{{cite news|work=The Times|title=City watchdog's findings were crucial in US case against NatWest Three|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article2971588.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011185411/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article2971588.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2008|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK|first1=Tom|last1=Bawden|first2=Suzy|last2=Jagger}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ''[[The Times]]'' the FSA report was so detailed that it told the SEC whom to interview and what evidence would be needed to secure a conviction, and concluded that "there appears to be evidence that the three individuals were subject to a major conflict of interest".&lt;ref name="times_fsa"/&gt;

===Issue of arrest warrants and indictment===
US arrest warrants for the Three were issued in June 2002. They were [[indictment|indicted]] by a [[grand jury]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] in September of the same year on seven counts of [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/cftf/chargingdocs/berminghamindictment.pdf Indictment: United States of America v. David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew], United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, usdoj.gov; accessed 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The warrants were among the first issued by Enron prosecutors and media reports speculated that their main purpose was to induce the Three into a [[plea bargain]] whereby they would testify against Kopper and Fastow (seen as more important prosecution targets) in exchange for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Spectator |title=The NatWest Three case lacks common sense, proportion – and a victim |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200607/ai_n17178795 |first=Martin van der |last=Weyer |accessdate=14 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116234944/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200607/ai_n17178795/ |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scandal"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Observer|title=The bankers, the big deal and the taint of scandal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/16/enron.usnews|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK|first=Jamie|last=Doward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the long delay caused by the decision of the Three to fight extradition, however, Kopper and Fastow both pleaded guilty and entered into plea bargains themselves.  Thus, in an ironic turn of events, Kopper and Fastow were likely to have been the key prosecution witnesses against the Three if the case had gone to trial.

The indictment set out seven counts of wire fraud, each one corresponding to a document (fax, email or wire transfer) that was transmitted electronically in the United States in furtherance of the alleged fraudulent scheme.&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/enron/usbrmnghm91202ind.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indictment: United States of America v. David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew|accessdate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the facts agreed to as part of the eventual plea bargain, the indictment alleged that the Three knew, at the time they recommended the sale of Swap Sub to NatWest, that its value was significantly greater than $1 million, and that the 22 February presentation to Fastow was part of the fraudulent scheme.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt; Although Enron officials were involved, the indictment did not allege that Enron Corporation itself was a victim of the scheme, or that the Three's activities had any connection to Enron's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Fraud accused talks of MSP mother|date=19 October 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3756240.stm|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence against the NatWest Three included preparations for the 22 February presentation, which contained the phrase

&lt;blockquote&gt;Problem is that it is too obvious (to both Enron and LPs) what is happening (ie, robbery of LPs), so probably not attractive. Also no certainty of making money ...&lt;ref name="redhanded"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prosecutors alleged that the use of the word "robbery" in the presentation showed that the Three knew that they were planning to commit a crime,&lt;ref name="redhanded"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian|title=NatWest Three: hounded by the US or caught red-handed?|date=15 July 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/enron/story/0,,1821114,00.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK|first=Ian|last=Cobain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors pointed to the discrepancy between the $1 million accepted by NatWest, and the $10 million accepted by Credit Suisse First Boston for their equal stakes in Swap Sub.&lt;ref name="boggan"/&gt;

===Extradition to the United States===
US prosecutors began to pursue proceedings in what they expected to be a "routine" extradition in the summer of 2002. The Three were arrested in Britain on 23 April 2004 and extradition proceedings under the [[Extradition Act 2003]] commenced in June of that year amid widespread [[NatWest Three#Extradition controversy|controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/2619555.html Brits arrested in Enron case awaiting extradition hearing]
''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 10 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004 a judge at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] ruled that the extradition could proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Independent|title=Judge backs extradition of NatWest trio to face Enron trial|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/judge-backs-extradition-of-natwest-trio-to-face-enron-trial-543910.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|location=London, UK|first=Julia|last=Kollewe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Three responded by suing Britain's [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) in the [[High Court of Justice]], seeking [[judicial review]] to force a prosecution in the UK which would have taken precedence over the US investigation. Bermingham commented to the press that "I cannot imagine anyone has taken the SFO to court for not prosecuting them before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Evening Standard|title=NatWest trio sue Serious Fraud Office|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=398018&amp;in_page_id=2|accessdate=16 November 2015|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response the SFO issued a statement defending its decision to defer to prosecutors in the US: 

{{quote|When we considered a submission by the three former NatWest employees that we should open an investigation for potential prosecution in this jurisdiction the balanced view we took was that the US authorities had a stronger call on the matter. Alleged acts performed by the three were conducted in the US, thus their alleged fraud was conducted in the same jurisdiction as was the overall issue surrounding Enron. The place of residence of the three (ie, the UK) was not considered to be an over-riding consideration. The defendants were already indicted in the US in an investigation that had been in progress for some time and where the evidence had already been marshaled and assessed&lt;ref name="boggan"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times|title=We want British justice, not a US witchhunt|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3316797.ece|date=3 February 2005|accessdate=14 April 2008|first=Steve|last=Boggan|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After a significant delay, the extradition was endorsed by Home Secretary [[Charles Clarke]] in May 2005. The Three appealed this decision also in the High Court.  On 20 February 2006 both the appeal against extradition and the suit to force the SFO to prosecute (which were consolidated into one case) were rejected by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermingham &amp; Others (otao) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office and HM Attorney General|url=http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/new/casebook/cases/Cases%20Chapter%2026/Bermingham.doc|accessdate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankers appealed further to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], but this appeal failed on 21 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 June 2006|title=Enron trio fail to secure appeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5103730.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2006 the three lost an appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. There were then rumours in the UK press that the British government would support their case but this was rejected by [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] on 7 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK trial for Enron trio rejected|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5160094.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial court proceedings in the United States===
After all legal avenues of appeal against extradition had been exhausted, the Three arrived in Houston on 13 July 2006 and were taken to the Federal Detention Center there. The next day they were released into the custody of their attorney and ordered to wear electronic monitoring devices.  On 21 July a judge ruled that the Three could go free on bond but could not leave the Houston area, could not meet with each other without their lawyers present and must raise between $80,000 and $150,000 by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4062614.html "Judge: Brits in Enron case must stay put"], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 21 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  US immigration services gave them permission to accept employment in the US for a period of one year: however the judge did not give them permission to travel throughout the US in order to seek work.&lt;ref name="remain"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4064384.html "Judge limits travel of British Enron bankers"], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 22 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2006 the trial date was delayed indefinitely from 13 September 2006, in order to allow two of the Three to secure legal representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4088270.html Former bankers win delay in trial], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2006 the legal situation of the Three was complicated by [[subpoena]]s served on them in an Enron-related civil suit against [[Royal Bank of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1840041,00.html Enron investors call NatWest Three in civil lawsuit], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 August 2006 all three informed the judge that they had retained attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4112194.html Ex-bankers from Britain retain lawyers], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 12 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2006, the trial date was set for February 2007 if witnesses could be obtained in time, failing that for 4 September 2007.  Until that time the Three were required to wear monitoring devices and were forbidden from leaving the Houston area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4167119.html Trial set for next September in Enron-related case], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2007, the trial date was moved back yet again to January 2008. This was following another earlier postponement to 22 October. This further delay was a significant blow to the three, and their supporters stressed again the problems they were facing with the scale of legal fees and further separation from their families in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article2188564.ece Natwest Three devastated at new trial delay],''[[The Times]]'',2 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witnesses controversy===
On 6 August 2007, the Three asked the judge in the case to order six former colleagues living in Britain to provide video testimony for their defence.  In a court filing explaining this request, they alleged that "[s]everal individuals now refuse to travel to the United States to appear on defendants' behalf because they feel, or have been, threatened by the [US] government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Houston Chronicle|title=Accused British bankers urge videotaped depositions|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/5032163.html|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a request would have required the co-operation of British authorities.&lt;ref name="binham"/&gt;

The Three's filing also claimed that [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] was obstructing attempts to contact a larger group of thirty-six employees who were also potential witnesses, claiming that "[t]he Royal Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Canada have… taken steps to prevent Defendants from securing the testimony of former colleagues",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times|title=NatWest Three cry foul over witnesses|date=12 August 2007|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article2240251.ece|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=Ben|last=Laurance|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "counsel for the purported victim in this case [RBS] has interfered with the ability of defence counsel to obtain relevant testimony".&lt;ref name="binham"&gt;{{cite news|work=TheLawyer.com |title=NatWest Three lawyers in row with Travers over defence'interference' |first=Caroline |last=Binham |date=20 August 2007 |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=127942&amp;d=122&amp;h=24&amp;f=46 |accessdate=16 November 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that the Three's ability "to mount a vigorous defence has thereby been severely compromised, if not eviscerated".&lt;ref name="binham"/&gt; The Three went so far as to publicly name the prospective witnesses in the hope that that would encourage some of them to speak out.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Plea bargain===
On 28 November 2007, the three accepted a [[plea bargain]], pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop the other six counts, and to support the application by the Three to serve part of their sentences in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doj_plea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Former British Bankers Plead Guilty to Wire Fraud in Enron Case|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2007/November/07_crm_949.html|last=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plea_agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/NatWest_Three_David_Bermingham_Plea_Agr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Plea Agreement for David Bermingham|accessdate=13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the plea agreement, the Three pleaded guilty to count four of the indictment, relating to the email from London to Houston of the final Swap Sub sale documents. A "statement of facts" was appended to the plea agreement as Exhibit A and was signed by all three defendants.&lt;ref name="plea_agreement"/&gt;

Prosecutor Alice Fisher stated, "[t]hese three defendants admitted today that they defrauded NatWest by entering into a secret and illegal deal with officers from Enron – a deal that yielded millions in profits for them personally at the expense of their employer".&lt;ref name="doj_plea"/&gt;  However, an article in ''The Daily Telegraph'' argued that the guilty pleas were motivated not by actual guilt, but rather by the prospect of further delays before the trial and possible 35-year sentences if convicted.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Natwest Three hope plea will speed up ordeal|date=30 November 2007|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/11/29/bcnnatwest12.xml|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=James|last=Quinn|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other British commentators agreed that this was a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Financial Times|title=Judicial torture and the NatWest 3|date=29 November 2007|url=http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=judicial+torture&amp;y=0&amp;aje=true&amp;x=0&amp;id=071129000600&amp;ct=0|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=Martin|last=Wolf}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Telegraph'' piece went on to claim that the statement of facts did not state that the Three knowingly defrauded NatWest.&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; The original indictment alleged that the Three knew that NatWest's stake was worth far more than the $1 million it was being sold for; the statement of facts claimed only that bankers believed it was likely that they would make significant amounts of money as a result of the transaction, based on information that they concealed from their employer.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doj_plea"/&gt;

In August 2010 Bermingham and Mulgrew appeared in a video on ungagged.net, a site devoted to attacking the US Department of Justice's handling of the Enron collapse. In the video David Bermingham recanted his guilty plea, and both he and Mulgrew claimed that they had been pressured into accepting plea bargains, attacking the US judicial system and characterising their treatment as "torture".&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph, 15 August 2010"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7947139/NatWest-banker-claims-he-was-tortured-into-pleading-guilty-over-theft-of-7.3m-from-RBS.html "NAT West banker claims he was 'tortured' into pleading guilty"], Daily Telegraph, 15 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Giles Darby said that he "fundamentally" disagreed with the claims made by Bermingham and Mulgrew in the video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7948601/NatWest-Three-trial-Giles-Darby-fundamentally-disagrees-with-torture-outburst-from-David-Bermingham-and-Gary-Mulgrew.html "Giles Darby fundamentally disagrees with 'torture' outburst by David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew"], Daily Telegraph, 17 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing and prison===
The NatWest Three were sentenced on 22 February 2008 to 37 months of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{cite news|work=International Herald Tribune|title= 'NatWest 3' sentenced to 37 months each|date=22 February 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/22/business/natwest.php|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=Kate|last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were given no remission for the time they had spent in the United States awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian|title=NatWest Three express remorse as they are jailed for 37 months|date=22 February 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/22/banking.enron|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=Andrew|last=Clark|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2013}}  They were also required to repay $7.3 million to [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], the successor bank to Greenwich NatWest, of which $1.25 million would be due when the men surrendered themselves to prison authorities.&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Three Former British Bankers Sentenced in Enron Case|last=United State Department of Justice|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/February/08_crm_135.html|accessdate=13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sentencing, the three each made brief statements to the judge. Mulgrew said that he had shown a "lack of integrity" and "exercised poor judgement", concluding that "I have no one to blame but myself".&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt; Darby admitted that he was "wrong", and said "I deeply regret my involvement in this whole affair."&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;

Darby's lawyer stated that "Andy Fastow and the culture of greed at Enron corrupted everybody and everything it came in contact with", and added that the Three "are as much victims as anybody else."&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;  The Three requested to be assigned to the low-security [[Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood|federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt; In April 2008, each was assigned to a different prison: Mulgrew was ordered to surrender to the facility in [[Big Spring, Texas]] on 30 April; Giles Darby to the Allenwood facility on 7 May; and David Bermingham to the prison in [[Lompoc, California]], on 9 May.&lt;ref&gt;

Mulgrew, Darby and Bermingham were assigned consecutive federal inmate numbers (66096-179, 66097-179 and 66098-179 respectively).  They were later allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence in England. Bermingham was moved from Spring Hill Open Prison to a closed prison in Grendon Underwood in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Daily Mirror|title=Jailed NatWest fraudster working for an investment group|date=30 August 2008|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/30/the-nat-west-free-115875-21634316|accessdate=21 January  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three were released in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|work=Guardian|title=NatWest Three claim guilty plea was extracted under duress|date=15 August 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/15/natwest-three-recant-guilty-pleas|accessdate=21 March 2011|location=London, UK|first=Andrew|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public relations campaign in Britain==
Press coverage of the Three in Britain was initially mostly negative, focusing on the amount of money the men had gained and their extravagant lifestyles.&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Flat Earth news: an award-winning reporter exposes falsehood, distortion and propaganda in the global media|first=Nicholas|last=Davies|authorlink=Nick Davies|isbn=0-7011-8145-1|location=London, UK|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=2008|url=http://www.cityam.com/index.php?news=7222|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, ''The Independent'' wrote that the men saw themselves as "womanising buccanneers who played as hard and as fast as they pursued their deals", and ''The Sunday Times'' described Mulgrew as "fiercely competitive" with "a massive ego" and "scars on his arms" from his former career as a nightclub [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]].&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; The tone of the reporting changed when the Three secured the services of Bell Yard Communications, a [[public relations]] firm which specialised in "public reputation management during times of corporate crisis or dispute", headed by [[Melanie Riley]].&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; [[Adrian Flook]] of [[M: Communications]] was also involved.&lt;ref name="quainton"&gt;{{cite news|title=M and Bell Yard outline NatWest Three strategy|first=David|last=Quainton|date=6 July 2006|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/News/EmailThisArticle/570555/M-Bell-Yard-outline-NatWest-Three-strategy|work=PRWeek UK|accessdate=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both firms claimed to be working ''[[pro bono]]''. Riley said that "I have been working pro bono for the last six months because I believe in the case. We have worked hard to ensure that people understood the inequity of the Extradition Act."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

''Guardian'' journalist Nick Davies, in his book ''Flat Earth News'', described the strategy adopted by Bell Yard: 
{{quote|According to some of those involved, when Bell Yard took on the case of the three bankers, its founder, Melanie Riley, rapidly saw the story she wanted.  Fleet Street must stop talking about the alleged guilt and extravagance of these three men and must focus instead on one single aspect of their case, the new Extradition Act under whose terms the three men now faced trial in Texas.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;}}

Davies later recounted the reaction of the press:

{{quote|The media could have refused to go along with Bell Yard's strategy. In practice, they went for it, like a baby fastening on a teat. Melanie Riley pushed the story personally with journalists from every publication and broadcast outlet. The suspects became victims of the law.  The stories about high-living womanisers became features about family men, worried about their children. The former bouncer and his cronies became "the NatWest Three" with its echo of the wrongly convicted [[Guildford Four]] and [[Birmingham Six]].&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;}}

Riley summed up her strategy as follows: 

{{quote|Originally we focused on a political and civil liberties audience. ... But we moved the issue on to focus on the impact it would have on the business community in particular."&lt;ref name="quainton"/&gt;}}

M: Communications co-founder Nick Miles added: 

{{quote|It is not a matter of whether or not they are guilty – although they have always expressed their innocence... Our role was to convince editors of the validity of our argument: that Britain's new extradition laws have anomalies.&lt;ref name="quainton"/&gt;}}

An article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' also highlighted the achievements of the public relations team: 

{{quote|[PR experts involved with the case] believe that the main achievement of the campaign has been to highlight their side's view of the inequality of the extradition arrangements. But perhaps even more of an achievement is that the public perception of the three has been turned from that of apparently wealthy bankers, alleged to have been involved in an £11m fraud and attempting to escape justice, to deeply wronged men being ripped from the bosoms of their families, destined for servitude in a vile penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;The Way We Live Now, Maggie Urry, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Three feature as victims of British justice in the £500,000 documentary ''[[Taking Liberties (film)|Taking Liberties]]'', made by Bermingham's film finance acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1550275/New-film-%27exposes-Orwellian-Labour%27.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London, UK|title=New film 'exposes Orwellian Labour'|first=Nigel|last=Reynolds|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A23296043 ''Taking Liberties''], bbc.co.uk; accessed 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition controversy==
The extensive news coverage of the Three in Britain resulted in a large-scale debate over the merits of their extradition to the United States under the then new [[Extradition Act 2003]].  In particular, a high-profile campaign against the extradition was led by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news|date=13 July 2006|author=David Charter|title=PR machine wins bankers sympathy...for free|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/corporate_law/article686919.ece|publisher=The Times|accessdate=17 July 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several arguments were raised against the extradition.

===Jurisdiction argument===
It was argued that the crime was committed by [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens living in Britain against a British company based in [[London]], the nation's capital city and that, therefore, any resulting criminal case fell under British legal and territorial jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Jeff [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=M3&amp;xml=/money/2006/03/01/ccjeff01.xml "NatWest Three caught on extradition's one-way street"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and should be tried by a British court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5155596.stm "Try Natwest three in UK – Tories"], BBC News, 6 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, British authorities decided not to prosecute due to a purported lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4576281.stm "Enron charge trio facing US trial"], BBC News, 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair trial argument===
Some argued that it would be very difficult for Three to receive a fair trial in Texas. The case could have taken years to come to trial. The trial was scheduled to begin in September 2006, but was repeatedly postponed to January 2008.{{Why|date=November 2015}} The three accused men would be forced to remain in the US, far away from their families in the UK. Additionally, while on bail they would be unable to find gainful employment in order to fund a legal defence against the charges brought against them. (The Three were permitted to seek employment in the US provided they remained in Houston.)&lt;ref name="remain"/&gt;

It was also claimed that the defendants would be handicapped in preparing a defence because most of the evidence and witnesses were overseas in the UK. They argued that witnesses would be reluctant to come to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=International Herald Tribune|title=Lone Star limbo for the 'NatWest 3'|date=4 May 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/04/business/natwest.php|accessdate=13 April 2008|first=Kate|last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extradition inequality argument===
It was alleged that the [[Extradition Act 2003|extradition arrangements between the US and the UK]] were highly unequal. The Act's terms made it easier to extradite British citizens to America than ''vice versa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 July 2006|author=Tom Stevenson|title=Senior executives attack 'invidious, one-sided treaty'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/07/06/ccnat06.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/money/2006/07/06/ixcoms.html|publisher=TheTelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been much criticism of the fact that the Americans do not have to produce a ''[[prima facie]]'' case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 July 2006|title=Lib Dem leader joins bankers' extradition battle|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1812471,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=13 July 2006|location=London, UK|first=Oliver|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extradite UK citizens, whereas there was no comparable facility to extradite US citizens to the UK. Despite this, the head of Britain's [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]], Robert Wardle, has claimed that there would have been enough evidence to extradite the Three to the US even under the old extradition arrangements. He expressed astonishment that the men had become a "[[cause célèbre]]", and expressed confidence that the Three would get a fair trial in the US.&lt;ref name="redhanded"/&gt;  Supporters of the Three claim that when the extradition law was passed in the wake of [[11 September 2001 attacks|11 September]] the UK government stated that it was only to be used in the so-called [[War on Terrorism|war against terror]] ''and'' if the treaty was ratified by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 July 2006|author=Graeme Wilson and Alec Russell|title=11th-hour plea in battle of NatWest Three|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/07/10/natwest10.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/07/10/ixuknews.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 July 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, neither of these conditions was written into the text of the extradition law, and neither had been fulfilled in the case of the Three at the time of their extradition. (The treaty was subsequently ratified by the US in September 2006.){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==House of Commons debate==
In a highly unusual move, the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]], allowed an emergency debate, on 12 July 2006, on both the treaty and the 'Natwest Three' after a request by Liberal Democrat MP [[Nick Clegg]]. During the debate, news shocked the House that a former Royal Bank of Scotland executive and FBI prosecution witness [[Neil Coulbeck]] had been found dead, after committing [[suicide]] by slitting his wrists.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

It had been suggested by friends and family that the FBI 'hounded' him. At the inquest into his death, Coulbeck's wife stated that he had been deeply disturbed by the extradition of the Three, and it was known that he had provided a crucial statement which in part led to their extradition. On the day of his death he tried to contact NatWest's lawyers and shortly after left his home and was found dead a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Daily Mail|title=NatWest Three banker's suicide in the park|date=23 May 2007|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=457212&amp;in_page_id=1770|accessdate=13 April 2008|location=London, UK|first=Neil|last=Craven}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI denied this, saying that it had interviewed Coulbeck only once, four years earlier.&lt;ref name="redhanded"/&gt;

==After release==
In January 2012, Mulgrew's book ''Gang of One'' detailing his early life, trial, experiences in prison, his reconciliation with his son and search for his daughter was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gang Of One|first=Gary|last=Mulgrew|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London, UK|year=2012|isbn=1-4447-3790-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hodder"&gt;[https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781444737929 ''Gang of One''" review], hodder.co.uk; accessed 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086670/A-beating-shocking-savagery-new-threat-freedom-A-conclusion-gripping-story-NatWest-banker-Gary-Mulgrew-jailed-America.html#ixzz3riRy5AxD|location=London, UK|work=Daily Mail|title=A beating of shocking savagery and a new threat to his freedom: A conclusion to the gripping story about NatWest banker Gary Mulgrew who was jailed in America|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern California Innocence Project(NCIP) is a legal based organization at the [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] in [[Santa Clara, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/ncip/about/|title=About NCIP {{!}} Santa Clara Law|website=law.scu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization revisits previous convictions of individuals who are believed to be innocent of their crimes. Justice has been attained for 19 individuals who have collectively spent 235 years in jail. They are a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] clinical program of Santa Clara University School of Law, which looks to promote a more fair, effective and compassionate criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/northern-california-innocence-project/|title=Northern California Innocence Project|website=Santa Clara Law|publisher=SCU|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also take compassion and attempt to protect the rights of all parties involved so that they too may have an adequate trial. NCIP is a member of the national [[Innocence Project]] network of similar organizations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://californiainnocenceproject.org/about-the-project/|title=What is the Innocence Project {{!}} About the Project {{!}} CIP|work=California Innocence Project|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCIP was created in 2001 by Kathleen "Cookie" Ridolfi and Linda Starr, during this time new legislation in California (CA Penal Code Section 1405) &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2005/pen/1404-1405.html|title=2005 California Penal Code Sections 1404–1405 PROCEEDINGS|website=Justia US LAW|publisher=Justia|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; had permitted convicted inmates to seek [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]] to prove their innocence.&amp;nbsp;

== Founding ==
The Northern California Innocence Project was established after a landmark amendment  that was adopted by the California District Court. CA Penal Code Section 1405 provides currently incarcerated convicted person should seek DNA testing to reveal exculpatory evidence. Kathleen "Cookie" RIdolfi and Linda Starr worked as trial and appellate attorneys for the [[Criminal justice|Criminal Justice System]]. After numerous years of practice, they realized an opportunity to improve the errors within the system and free wrongly convicted individuals. In 2001, they co-founded the NCIP. The current executive director of the Northern Innocence Project is Linda Starr.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/ncip/ncip-history/|title=NCIP History|website=Northern California Innocence Project|publisher=Santa Clara Law|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The Northern California Innocence Project looks to primarily protect the rights of the innocent as well as make a more fair, effective and compassionate justice system. They primarily look to exonerate people whose case allows DNA evidence to be available and be retested in the light of an exoneration.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The NCIP promotes for more research and advocacy in wrongful convictions. The NCIP foresees a criminal justice system that correctly divides the innocent from the guilty along with treating all with their [[Natural and legal rights|inalienable rights]] and compassion.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://californiainnocenceproject.org/about-the-project/|title=About the Project|work=California Innocence Project|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae''''' ([[Latin]] for "Partition of the lands of the empire of ''Romania''{{efn|On the meaning of ''Romania'', an ambiguous term, see {{cite journal | first = R.L. | last= Wolff | title = Romania: The Latin Empire of Constantinople | journal = Speculum | volume = 23 | year = 1948 | pages = 1–34 | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/2853672 | doi=10.2307/2853672 }}}} [i.e., the Byzantine Empire]), or '''''Partitio regni Graeci'''''{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|p=452}} ("Partition of the kingdom of the Greeks"), was a treaty signed among the crusaders after the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital, [[Constantinople]], by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. It established the [[Latin Empire]] and arranged the nominal partition of the Byzantine territory among the participants of the Crusade, with the [[Republic of Venice]] being the greatest titular beneficiary. However, because the crusaders did not in fact control most of the Empire, with local Byzantine Greek nobles establishing the Byzantine successor kingdoms ([[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], [[Despot of Epirus]]), most of the crusaders' declared division of the Empire amongst themselves could never be implemented.

==Background==
In March 1204, shortly before the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack]] of [[Constantinople]] in April, the Crusaders made a preliminary arrangement on the partition of the Byzantine territories between themselves.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|pp=179–180}} This text, concluded between the principal leaders of the Crusade, the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], Marquess [[Boniface of Montferrat]], Count [[Baldwin of Flanders]], and Count [[Louis I of Blois]], has been preserved among the letters of [[Pope Innocent III]].{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=444–452}} According to its stipulations, the Venetians would retain their previous privileges granted by the Byzantine emperors, and a common committee, composed in equal numbers of Venetians and Crusaders, would elect an emperor for the [[Latin Empire]] to be established after the conquest of the city. The Latin Emperor would receive one quarter of all territories, as well as the palaces of [[Blachernae Palace|Blachernae]] and [[Boukoleon Palace|Boukoleon]] in the city. The remaining three quarters of the Byzantine territories would be divided equally between Venice and the other Crusaders.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=180}} On 9 May, Baldwin of Flanders was elected Latin Emperor, in place of the previous leader of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat. According to the Crusader and chronicler [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], by previous agreement, Boniface should receive the territories lying beyond the [[Bosporus]] and [[Marmara Sea]], "towards Turkey", as well as "the isle of Greece". However, to placate Boniface, Baldwin agreed to assign to him the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] instead.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=181}}

The agreement, which was promulgated either in late September or early October 1204 (according to the opinions of W. Heyd, [[Dionysios Zakythinos]], and A. Carile) or (according to [[Nikolaos Oikonomides]]) immediately after the sack in April–May 1204,{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591–1592}} was drafted by a 24-man committee consisting of 12 Venetians and 12 representatives of the other Crusader leaders.{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591–1592}} The Venetians played a major role in the proceedings, as they had first-hand knowledge of the area, and many of the final text's provisions can be traced to the imperial [[chrysobull]] [[Byzantine–Venetian treaty of 1198|granted to Venice in 1198]] by [[Alexios III Angelos]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=149}} It gave the Latin Emperor direct control of one fourth of the Byzantine territory, to Venice three eighths – including three eighths of the city of Constantinople, with [[Hagia Sophia]] – and the remaining three eighths were apportioned among the other Crusader chiefs. Through this division, Venice became the chief power in Latin Romania, and the effective power behind the Latin Empire, a fact clearly illustrated by the lofty title its [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] acquired: {{lang|la|Dominator quartae et dimidiae partis totius Romaniae}} ("Lord of a quarter and a half quarter of all of ''Romania''").

The treaty survives in a number of manuscripts, all from Venice: the ''Liber Albus'' (fols. 34ff.), the ''Liber Pactorum'' (Vol. I, fols. 246ff. and Vol. II, fols. 261ff.), the ''Codex Sancti Marci'' 284, folio 3, and the ''Muratorii codices Ambrosiani'' I and II.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|p=452}}{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=182}} The first critical edition of the treaty was published in the collection of Venetian diplomatic documents compiled by Gottlieb Tafel and Georg Thomas for the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna]] in 1856,{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=452–501}} while A. Carile published an up-to-date edition with full commentary in 1965.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=149}} 

== Territorial provisions ==
According to the treaty's provisions, the territories were divided in the portion of the "Lord Doge and [[Commune Veneciarum|Commune of Venice]]" (''pars domini Ducis et communis Venetiae''), the portion of the Latin Emperor (''pars domini Imperatoris''), and the remainder as the portion of the Crusaders, or "pilgrims" (''pars Peregrinorum'').

==Observations==
Based on the forms of the names, the source material for the compilation of the treaty was in Greek, while the prevalence of fiscal terms like ''episkepsis'' points to the use of the cadastral and tax registers of the central Byzantine administration.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=182}}{{sfn|Zakythinos|1952|p=161}} 

Several areas are left out of the ''Partitio''. in Europe, the lands of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]], between the [[Maritsa]] and [[Vardar]] rivers, as well as the northeastern [[Peloponnese]], [[Boeotia]], and central [[Euboea]], are absent. These were lands assigned to Boniface of Montferrat, and thus evidently excluded from the general partition. This fact also helps to assign the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the treaty, namely the agreement of 16 May 1204 between Boniface and Baldwin of Flanders that established the Kingdom of Thessalonica.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|pp=180–182}}

As Zakythinos points out, the territorial division shown in the ''Partitio'' and in the 1198 chrysobull for Asia Minor is much more conservative, and reflects far closer the "traditional" thematic structure than in the European provinces.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1955|p=127}} On the other hand, the two documents differ considerably in the extent of territory they mention: the 1198 chrysobull contains the central and northern portions of western Asia Minor, but also the southern shore with [[Attaleia]], [[Cilicia]], and even [[Antioch]], whereas in the ''Partitio'', includes the Black Sea shore from [[Paphlagonia]] up to [[Bafra|Pavrae]].{{sfn|Zakythinos|1955|pp=127–129}} 

== Effects ==
The ''Partitio Romaniae'' initiated the period of the [[history of Greece]] known as ''[[Frankokratia]]'' or ''Latinokratia'' ("Frankish/Latin rule"), where [[Catholic]] West European nobles, mostly from France and Italy, established states on former Byzantine territory and ruled over the mostly [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] native [[Byzantine Greeks]]. The provisions of the ''Partitio Romaniae'' were not fully carried out; much of the Byzantine realm fell into the hands not of the crusaders who had sacked the capital but of the local Byzantine Greek nobles, who established the Byzantine successor states of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], while the Crusaders also squabbled among themselves. The Latin Empire itself, consisting of the area surrounding [[Constantinople]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]] was also drawn into a [[Bulgarian–Latin Wars|disastrous conflict]] with the powerful [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. Latin rule became most firmly established and lasted longest in southern Greece (the [[Principality of Achaea]] and the [[Duchy of Athens]]), as well as the Aegean islands, which came largely under the control of Venice.

== Importance as a historical source ==
As the division was based on now lost documents and tax registers from the Byzantine imperial chancery, along with Alexios III's 1198 chrysobull, the ''Partitio Romaniae'' is a crucial document for the administrative divisions of the Byzantine Empire and the estates of the various Byzantine magnate families {{circa|1203}}, as well as the areas still controlled by the Byzantine central government at the time.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=179}}

[[Image:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, home to the Permanent Court of International Justice]]
The '''Permanent Court of International Justice''', often called the '''World Court''', existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an [[international court]] attached to the [[League of Nations]]. Created in 1920 (although the idea of an international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation. With the heightened international tension of the 1930s, the Court became less used. By a resolution from the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist and were replaced by the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[United Nations]].

The Court's mandatory jurisdiction came from three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and special bipartite international treaties. Cases could also be submitted directly by states, but they were not bound to submit material unless it fell into those three categories. The Court could issue either judgments or advisory opinions. Judgments were directly binding while advisory opinions were not. In practice, member states of the League of Nations followed advisory opinions anyway, as they feared that otherwise, they could undermine the moral and legal authority of the Court and League.

On occasion, the Court was accused of extending its jurisdiction. Strictly speaking, it was allowed to intervene only in matters of international law, but became involved in municipal law during the [[Loans Cases (PCIJ)|Loans Cases]]{{Examples}}.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
An international court had long been proposed; [[Pierre Dubois]] suggested it in 1305 and [[Émeric Crucé]] in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1922) p.245&lt;/ref&gt; An idea of an international court of justice arose in the political world at the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|First Hague Peace Conference]] in 1899, where it was declared that arbitration between states was the easiest solution to disputes, providing a temporary panel of judges to arbitrate in such cases, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, a draft convention for a permanent Court of Arbitral Justice was written although disputes and other pressing business at the Conference meant that such a body was never established, owing to difficulties agreeing on a procedure to select the judges.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1920) p.581&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[First World War]], and, in particular, its conclusion made it clear to many academics that some kind of world court was needed, and it was widely expected that one would be established.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1922) p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Article 14 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]], created after the [[Treaty of Versailles]], allowed the League to investigate setting up an international court.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1922) p.247&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1920, an Advisory Committee of jurists appointed by the League of Nations finally established a working guideline for the appointment of judges, and the Committee was then authorised to draft a constitution for a permanent court not of arbitration but of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1920) p.582&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice]] was accepted in [[Geneva]] on December 13, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 6, pp. 380-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court first sat on 30 January 1922, at the [[Peace Palace]], [[The Hague]], covering preliminary business during the first session (such as establishing procedure and appointing officers) Nine judges sat, along with three deputies, since [[Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven]], [[Ruy Barbosa]] and [[Wang Ch'ung-hui]] were unable to attend, the last being at the [[Washington Naval Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The Court elected [[Bernard Loder]] as President and [[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]] as Vice-President; Huber was replaced by [[Andre Weiss (jurist)|Charles Andre Weiss]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1925) p.49&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February the Court was officially opened, and rules of procedure were established on 24 March, when the court ended its first session.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The court first sat to decide cases on 15 June.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1923) p.704&lt;/ref&gt; During its first year of business, the Court issued three advisory opinions, all related to the [[International Labour Organization]] created by the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial reaction to the Court was good, from politicians, practising lawyers and academics alike. [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth|Ernest Pollock]], the former [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] said, "May we not as lawyers regard the establishment of an International Court of Justice as an advance in the science that we pursue?" [[John Henry Wigmore]] said that the creation of the Court "should have given every lawyer a thrill of cosmic vibration", and [[James Brown Scott]] wrote that "the one dream of our ages has been realised in our time".&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  Much praise was heaped upon the appointment of an American judge despite the fact that the United States had not become a signatory to the Court's protocol, and it was thought that it would soon do so.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing work ===
[[File:WGHardingOfficialportrait.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]], who had first suggested American involvement; the U.S. demanded a veto, however, and never joined.]]
The Court faced increasing work as it went on, allaying the fears of those commentators who had believed the Court would become like the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which was not presented with a case for its first six terms.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1924) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Court was given nine cases during 1922 and 1923, however, with judgments called "cases" and advisory opinions called "questions". Three cases were disposed of during the Court's first session, one during an extraordinary sitting between 8 January and 7 February 1923 (the [[Tunis-Morocco Nationality Question]]), four during the second ordinary sitting between 15 June 1923 and 15 September 1923 ([[Eastern Carelia Question]], [[S.S. "Wimbledon" case]], [[German Settlers Question]], [[Acquisition of Polish Nationality Question]]) and one during a second extraordinary session from 12 November to 6 December 1923 ([[Jaworznia Question]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1924) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement for [[Ruy Barbosa]] (who had died on 1 March 1923 without hearing any cases) was also found, with the election of [[Epitácio Pessoa]] on 10 September 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1924) p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The workload the following year was reduced, containing two judgments and one advisory opinion; the [[Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case]], the [[Interpretation of the Treaty of Neuilly Case]] (the first case of the Court's Chamber of Summary Procedure)&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1925) p.55&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Monastery of Saint-Naoum Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1925) p.48&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, a new President and Vice-President were elected, since they were mandated to serve for a term of three years. At the elections on 4 September 1924, [[Andre Weiss (jurist)|Charles Andre Weiss]] was again elected Vice-President and [[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]] became the second President of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1925) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial pensions were created at the same time, with a judge being given 1/30th of his annual pay for every year he had served once he had both retired and turned 65.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1925) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

1925 was an exceedingly busy year for the court, which sat for 210 days, with four extraordinary sessions as well as the ordinary session, producing 3 judgments and 4 advisory opinions. The first judgment was given in the [[Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations Case]], the second (by the Court of Summary Procedure) was on the interpretation of the [[Interpretation of the Treaty of Neuilly Case]], and the third in the [[Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1926) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The 4 advisory opinions issued by the Court were in the [[Polish Postal Service in Danzig Question]], the [[Expulsion of the Ecumenical Patriarch Question]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne Question]] and the [[German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1926) p.19&lt;/ref&gt; 1926 saw reduced business, with only one ordinary session and one extraordinary session; it was, however, the first year that all 11 judges had been present to hear cases.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1927) p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard two cases, providing one judgment and one advisory opinion; a second [[German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia Case|question on German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia]], this time a judgment rather than an advisory opinion,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1927) p.27&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisory opinion on the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1927) p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reduction of work in 1926, 1927 was another busy year, the Court sitting continuously from 15 June to 16 December, handing down 4 orders, 4 judgments and 1 advisory opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1928) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The judgments were in the [[Belgium-China Case]], the [[Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow]], the [[Lotus Case]] and a continuation of the [[Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions Case]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1928) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; 3 of the advisory opinions were on the [[Competence of the European Commission on the Danube Questions|Competence of the European Commission on the Danube]], and the 4th was on the [[Jurisdiction of Danzig Courts Question|Jurisdiction of Danzig Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1928) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The 4 orders were on the [[German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia Case|German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1928) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; This year saw another set of elections; on 6 December, with [[Dionisio Anzilotti]] elected President and [[Andre Weiss (jurist)|Charles Andre Weiss]] elected Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1928) p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss died the following year, and [[John Bassett Moore]] resigned; [[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]] was elected Vice-President on 12 September 1928 to succeed Weiss,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1929) p.28&lt;/ref&gt; while a second death ([[Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay|Lord Finlay]]) left the Court increasingly understaffed.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (Jan 1930) p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Replacements for Moore and Finlay were elected on 19 September 1929; [[Henri Fromageot]] and [[Cecil Hurst]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (Jan 1930) p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second round of elections in September 1930, the Court was reorganised. On 16 January 1931 [[Mineichirō Adachi]] was appointed President, and [[José Gustavo Guerrero|Gustavo Guerrero]] Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1932) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States never joins===
The United States never joined the World Court, primarily because enemies of the League of Nations in the Senate argued that the Court was too closely linked to the League of Nations.  The leading opponent was Senator [[William Borah]], Republican of Idaho.  The United States finally recognised the Court's jurisdiction, following a long and drawn out process. President [[Warren G. Harding]] had first suggested US involvement in 1923, and on 9 December 1929, three court protocols were signed.  The U.S. demanded a veto over cases involving the U.S. but other nations rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt; L. Ethan Ellis, ''Republican foreign policy, 1921-1933'' (1968) pp 70-75.&lt;/ref&gt; 

President Franklin Roosevelt did not risk his political capital and gave only passive support even though a two-thirds vote of approval was needed in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert N. Kahn, "Presidential Passivity on a Nonsalient Issue: President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 1935 World Court Fight." ''Diplomatic History'' 4.2 (1980): 137-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  A barrage of telegrams flooded Congress, inspired by attacks made by [[Charles Coughlin]] and others. The treaty failed by seven votes on January 29, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michla Pomerance|title=The United States and The World Court as a "Supreme Court of the Nations": Dreams, Illusions and Disillusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrsldNbU6pgC&amp;pg=PA132|year=1996|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States finally accepted the Court's jurisdiction on 28 December 1935, but the treaty was never ratified, and  the U.S. never  joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/pcijmemberstates.htm|title=Signature and Ratification of the Protocol of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) Member States|publisher=Archives of the League of Nations|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Francis Boyle]] attributes the failure to a strong isolationist element in the US Senate, arguing that the ineffectiveness shown by US nonparticipation in the Court and other international institutions could be linked to the start of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle (1985) p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growing international tension and dissolution of the court ===
1933 was a busy year for the court, which cleared its 20th case (and "greatest triumph"); the [[Eastern Greenland Case]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1933) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This period was marked by growing international tension, however, with Japan and Germany announcing their withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]], to come into effect in 1935. That did not directly affect the Court, since the protocol accepting Court jurisdiction was separately ratified, but it influenced whether a nation would be willing to bring a case before it, as evidenced by Germany's withdrawal from two pending cases.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1934) p.18&lt;/ref&gt; 1934, the Court's 13th year, "has been in keeping with the [[13 (number)#Unlucky 13|traditions associated with that number]]", with few cases since the world's governments were more concerned with the growing international tension.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1935) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's business continued to be small in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1936) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; 1936, 1937, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1939) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1940) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; although 1937 was marked by [[Monaco]]'s acceptance of the Court protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1938) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's judicial output in 1940 consisted entirely of a set of orders, completed in a meeting between 19 and 26 February, caused by [[Second World War|an international situation]], which left the Court with "uncertain prospects for the future". Following the German invasion of the Netherlands, the Court was unable to meet although the Registrar and President were afforded full [[diplomatic immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1941) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Informed that the situation would not be tolerated after diplomatic missions from other nations left [[The Hague]] on 16 July, the President and Registrar left the Netherlands and moved to Switzerland, accompanied by their staff.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1941) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court was unable to meet between 1941 and 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1945) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; but the framework remained intact, and it soon became apparent that the Court would be dissolved. In 1943, an international panel met to consider "the question of the Permanent Court of International Justice",&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1957) p.570&lt;/ref&gt; meeting from 20 March to 10 February 1944. The panel agreed that the name and functioning of the Court should be preserved but for some future court rather than a continuation of the current one. Between 21 August and 7 October 1944, the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] was held, which, among other things, created an international court attached to the [[United Nations]], to succeed the Permanent Court of International Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1957) p.571&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these conferences and others, the judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice officially resigned in October 1945 and, via a resolution by the [[League of Nations]] on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist, being replaced by the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1957) p.569&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judges ===
{{main article|Judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice}}
[[File:Max Huber.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]], the first Vice-President and second President of the Permanent Court of International Justice]]
The Court initially consisted of 11 judges and 4 deputy judges, recommended by member states of the [[League of Nations]] to the [[Secretary General of the League of Nations]], who would put them before the Council and Assembly for election. The Council and Assembly were to bear in mind that the elected panel of judges was to represent every major legal tradition in the League, along with "every major civilization". Each member state was allowed to recommend 4 potential judges, with a maximum of 2 from its own nation. Judges were elected by a straight majority vote, held independently in the Council and Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1921) p.556&lt;/ref&gt; The judges served for a period of nine years, with their term limits all expiring at the same time, necessitating a completely new set of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1930) p.719&lt;/ref&gt; The judges were independent and rid themselves of their nationality for the purposes of hearing cases, owing allegiance to no individual member state, but it was forbidden to have more than one judge from the same state. As a sign of their independence from national ties, judges were given full diplomatic immunity when engaged in Court business. The only requirements for judges were "high moral character" and "the qualifications required in their respective countries [for] the highest judicial offices" or to be "jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law".&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.504&lt;/ref&gt;

The first panel was elected on 14 September 1921, with the 4 deputies being elected on the 16th. On the first vote, [[Rafael Altamira y Crevea]] of Spain, [[Dionisio Anzilotti]] of Italy, [[Bernard Loder]] of the Netherlands, [[Ruy Barbosa]] of Brazil, [[Yorozu Oda]] of Japan, [[Andre Weiss (jurist)|Charles Andre Weiss]] of France, [[Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven]] of Cuba and [[Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay|Lord Finlay]] of the United Kingdom were elected by a majority vote of both the Council and Assembly on the first ballot taken. The second ballot elected [[John Bassett Moore]] of the United States, and the sixth [[Didrik Nyholm]] of Denmark and [[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]] of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1921) p.557&lt;/ref&gt; As the deputy judges, [[Wang Ch'ung-hui]] of China, [[Demetre Negulesco]] of Romania and [[Michaelo Yovanovich]] of Yugoslavia were elected. The Assembly and Council disagreed on the fourth deputy judge, but [[Frederik Beichmann]] of Norway was eventually appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1921) p.558&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy judges were only substitutes for absent judges and were not afforded a vote in altering court procedure or contributing at other times.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.508&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they were allowed to act as counsel in international cases where they were not sitting as judges.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.509&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the number of judges was increased to 15, and a new set of elections were held.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1931) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The election was held on 25 September 1930, with 14 candidates receiving a majority on the first ballot and a 15th, [[Francisco José Urrutia]], receiving a majority on the second.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1931) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The full court was Urrutia, [[Mineichiro Adachi]], [[Rafael Altamira y Crevea]], [[Dionisio Anzilotti]], Bustamante, [[Jonkheer van Eysinga]], [[Henri Fromageot]], [[José Gustavo Guerrero]], [[Cecil Hurst]], [[Edouard Rolin-Jaequemyns]], [[Frank B. Kellogg]], Negulesco, [[Michał Jan Rostworowski]], [[Walther Schücking]] and [[Wang Ch'ung-hui]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1931) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges were paid 15,000 Dutch florins a year, with daily expenses of 50 florins to pay for living expenses, and an additional 45,000 florins for the President, who was required to live at The Hague. Travelling expenses were also provided, and a "duty allowance" of 100 florins was provided when the court was sitting, with 150 for the Vice-President. This duty allowance was limited to 20,000 florins a year for the judges and 30,000 florins for the Vice-President; as such, it provided for 200 days of court hearings, with no allowance provided if the court sat for longer. The deputy judges received no salary but, when called up for service, were provided with travel expenses, 50 florins a day for living expenses and 150 florins a day as a duty allowance.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.506&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedure ===
Under the Covenant of the League of Nations, all League members agreed that if there was a dispute between states they "recognize to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy", the matter would be submitted to the Court for arbitration, with suitable disputes being over the interpretation of an international treaty, a question on international law, the validity of facts, which, if true, would breach international obligations and the nature of any reparations to be made for breaching international obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.500&lt;/ref&gt; The original Statutes of the Court provided that all 11 judges were required to sit in every case. There were three exceptions: when reviewing Labour Clauses from a peace treaty such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which was done by a special chamber of 5 judges, appointed every 3 years), when reviewing cases on communications or transport arising from a peace treaty (which used a similar procedure) and when hearing summary procedure cases, which were reviewed by a panel of 3 judges.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.501&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the appearance of any bias in the court's makeup, if there was a judge belonging to one member state on the panel and the other member state was not "represented", they had the ability to select an ''[[ad hoc]]'' judge of their own nationality to hear the case. In a full court hearing, that increased the number to 12; in one of the 5-man chambers, the new judge took the place of one of the original 5. That did not apply to summary procedure cases.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.506&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ad hoc'' judge, selected by the member state, was expected to fulfil all the requirements of a normal judge; the President of the Court had ultimate discretion over whether to authorise him to sit.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1931) p.673&lt;/ref&gt; The Court was mandated to open on 15 June each year and continue until all cases were finished, with extraordinary sessions if required; by 1927, there were more extraordinary sessions than ordinary ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's business being conducted in English and French as official languages, and hearings were public unless it was otherwise specified.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1922) p.507&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving files in a case calculated to lead to a [[Cases of the Permanent Court of International Justice|judgment]], the judges would exchange their views informally on the salient legal points of the case, and a time limit for producing a judgment would then be set. Then, each judge would write an anonymous summary containing his opinion; the opinions would be circulated among the Court for 2 or 3 days before the President drafted a judgment containing a summary of those submitted by individual judges. The Court would then agree on the decision that they wished to reach, along with the main points of argument they wished to use. Once this was done, a Committee of 4, including the President, the Registrar and two judges elected by secret ballot, drafted a final judgment, which was then voted on by the entire Court.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p.330&lt;/ref&gt; Once a final judgment was set, it was given to the public and the press.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p.334&lt;/ref&gt; Every judgment contained the reasons behind the decision and the judges assenting; dissenting judges were allowed to deliver their own judgment, with all judgments read in open court before the agents of the parties to the dispute. Judgments could not be revised except on the discovery of some fact unknown when the Court sat but not if the fact was known but not discussed because of negligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p.331&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court also issued "[[Cases of the Permanent Court of International Justice|advisory opinions]]", which arose from Article 14 of the Covenant creating the Court, which provided, "The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute referred to it by the Council or Assembly". Goodrich interprets that as indicating that the drafters intended a purely advisory capacity for the Court, not a binding one. [[Manley Ottmer Hudson]] (who sat as a judge) said that an advisory opinion "was what it purported to be. It is advisory. It is not in any sense a judgement... hence it is not in any way binding on any state", but [[Charles De Visscher]] argued that in certain situations, an advisory opinion could be binding on the League of Nations Council and, under certain circumstances, some states; M. Politis agreed, saying that the Court's advisory opinions were equivalent to a binding judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1938) p.738&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, the Court appointed a committee to look at this issue, and it reported that "where there are in fact contending parties, the difference between contentious cases and advisory cases is only nominal... so the view that advisory opinions are not binding is more theoretical than real".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1938) p.739&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, advisory opinions were usually followed, mostly due to the fear that if this "revolutionary" international court's decisions were not followed, it would undermine its authority.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1938) p.740&lt;/ref&gt; The court retained the discretion to avoid giving an advisory opinion, which it used on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p.338&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registrar and Registry ===
Other than the judges, the Court also included a Registrar and his Secretariat, the Registry.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; When the Court met for its initial session, opened on 30 January 1922 to allow for the establishment of procedure and the appointment of Court officials, the Secretary-General of the [[League of Nations]] passed an emergency resolution through the Assembly, which designated an official of the League and his staff as the Registrar and Registry respectively,&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; with the first Registrar being [[Åke Hammarskjöld]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Registrar, required to reside within [[The Hague]],&lt;ref&gt;Bustamante (1923) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; was initially tasked with drawing up a plan to create an efficient Secretariat, using the smallest number of staff possible and costing as little as possible. As a result, he decided to have each member of the Secretariat as the head of a particular Department, so the numbers of actual employees could be increased or decreased as necessary without impacting on the actual Registry. In 1927, the post of Deputy-Registrar was created, tasked with dealing with legal research for the Court and answering all diplomatic correspondence received by the Registry.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Deputy-Registrar was [[Paul Ruegger]]; after his resignation on 17 August 1928, [[Julio Lopez Olivan]] was selected to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1929) p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Olivan resigned in 1931 to take over from Hammarskjöld as Registrar,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1937) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by M. L. J. H. Jorstad.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1932) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The three principal officers of the Registry, after the Registrar and Deputy-Registrar, were the three Editing Secretaries. The first Editing Secretary, known as the Drafting Secretary, was tasked with drafting the Court's publications (including the Confidential Bulletin, a document exclusively received by judges of the court) and Sections D and E of the official journal, comprising the legislative clauses conferring jurisdiction on the Court and the Court's Annual Report.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The second Editing Secretary, known as the Oral Secretary, was mainly responsible for the oral interpretation and translation of the Court's discussions. For public hearings, he was assisted by interpreters, but for private meetings, only he, the Registrar and the Deputy-Registrar were admitted. As a result of this duty, the Oral Secretary was also tasked with writing Section C of the official journal, which comprised the oral interpretations of Court minutes, along with cases and questions put before the court.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The third Secretary, known as the Written Secretary, was tasked with the written translations of the Court's business, which were "both numerous and voluminous". He was assisted in this by the other Secretaries and by translators for languages not his own; all Secretaries were expected to speak English and French fluently and to have working knowledge of German and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The Registry was split into several Departments; the Archives, the Accounting and Establishment, the Printing Service and the Copying Department. The Archives included a distribution service for the Court's documents and the legal texts used by the Court itself and was described as one of the most difficult departments to organise. The Accounting and Establishment Department dealt with the requests for and allocation of the Court's yearly budget, which was drawn up by the Registrar, approved by the Court and submitted to the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The Printing Department, run from a single printing plant in [[Leiden]], was created to allow the circulation of the Court's publishings.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; The Copying Department comprised shorthand, typing and copying services, and included secretaries for the Registrar and judges, emergency reporters capable of taking notes down verbatim and copyists; the smallest of the departments, it comprised between 12 and 40 staff depending on the business of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarskjold (1927) p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurisdiction ==
The Court's jurisdiction was largely optional, but there were some situations in which they had "compulsory jurisdiction", and states were required to refer cases to them. That came from three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and "special [[Bilateral treaty|bipartite]] international treaties".&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (July 1923) p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The Optional Clause was a clause attached to the protocol establishing the court and required all signatories to refer certain classes of dispute to the court, with compulsory judgments resulting. There were approximately 30 international conventions under which the Court had similar jurisdiction, including the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the [[Air Navigation Convention]], the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] and all mandates signed by the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (January 1923) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; It was also foreseen that there would be clauses inserted in bipartite international treaties, which would allow the referral of disputes to the Court; that occurred, with such provisions found in treaties between [[Czechoslovakia]] and Austria, and between Czechoslovakia and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (July 1923) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its existence, the Court widened its jurisdiction as much as possible. Strictly speaking, the Court's jurisdiction was only for disputes between states, but it regularly accepted disputes that were between a state and an individual if a second state brought the individual's case to the Court. It argued that the second state assertsled its rights, and the cases therefore became one between two states.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby (1936) p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

The proviso that the Court was for disputes that could not "be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy" never made it require evidence that diplomatic discussions had been attempted before bringing the case. In the Loan Cases, it asserted jurisdiction despite the fact that there was no alleged breach of international law, and it could not be shown that there was any international element to the claim. The Court justified itself by saying that the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]] allowed it to have jurisdiction in cases over "the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of international obligations" and argued that since the fact "may be of any kind", it had jurisdiction if the dispute is one of municipal law. It had been long established that municipal law may be considered as a side point to a dispute over international law, but the Loan Cases discussed municipal law without the application of any international points.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby (1936) p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quick Reference Guide on Arbitration, Conciliation &amp; Mediation''''' is a book authored by Vishnu S Warrier published by [[Lexis Nexis]] in 2015.

The book studies the concept of [[Arbitration]], [[Mediation]] and [[Conciliation|Conciliation Procedure]] in Ancient India and present. Considering law students in mind, author did justice to conceptualize the Alternative Dispute Resolutions such as Arbitration, Mediation &amp; Conciliation into an easily understanding language.

== Key Concepts ==
In pursuit of globalisation, India responded positively by opening up its economy. Along with the benefits promised, it also brought lots of issues. As we all know major concern of law is the conflict resolution. Traditional justice delivery system through the adjudication of courts, had already given way a large extent of alternative mode of dispute Resolution in common law countries. Following are the Key Concepts covered under this Book.
Alternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted to accommodate the harmonisation mandates of UNCITRAL Model. To streamline the Indian legal system the traditional civil law known as Code of Civil Procedure, (CPC) 1908 has also been amended and section 89 has been introduced. 
Section 89 (1) of CPC provides an option for the settlement of disputes outside the court. It provides that where it appears to the court that there exist elements, which may be acceptable to the parties, the court may formulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for arbitration, conciliation, mediation or judicial settlement

=== Arbitration ===
The process of arbitration can start only if there exists a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties prior to the emergence of the dispute. As per Section 7, such an agreement must be in writing. The contract regarding which the dispute exists, must either contain an arbitration clause or must refer to a separate document signed by the parties containing the arbitration agreement. The existence of an arbitration agreement can also be inferred by written correspondence such as letters, telex, or telegrams which provide a record of the agreement. An exchange of statement of claim and defense in which existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by other is also considered as valid written arbitration agreement.

=== Conciliation ===
Conciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator. One conciliator is preferred but two or three are also allowed. In case of multiple conciliators, all must act jointly. If a party rejects an offer to conciliate, there can be no conciliation.

=== Mediation ===
The term "mediation" broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach agreement. More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable and dynamics that "ordinary" negotiation lacks. The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law. Participation is typically voluntary. The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs the process.

=== Negotiation ===
Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, resolve points of difference, to gain advantage for an individual or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61397">The '''regulation of genetic engineering''' varies widely by country.  Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use ''[[substantial equivalence]]'' as the starting point when assessing safety, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis.  Many countries allow the import of GM food with authorization, but either do not allow its cultivation (Russia, Norway, Israel) or have provisions for cultivation, but no GM products are yet produced (Japan, South Korea).  Most countries that do not allow for GMO cultivation do permit research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/|title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms |date=22 January 2017|publisher= Law Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in 64 countries.&lt;ref name="Burlington-2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hallenbeck |first=Terri |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/27/gmo-labeling-came-pass-vermont/8166519/ |title=How GMO labeling came to pass in Vermont |work=Burlington Free Press |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2014-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.&lt;ref name=Botha&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Botha | first1 = Gerda M. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = Christopher D. | year = 2009 | title = South Africa: A case study for voluntary GM labelling | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814608007632 | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 1060–64 | doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.06.050}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and the USA labeling of GM food is voluntary,&lt;ref name=RegGMFood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/sr-sr/pubs/biotech/reg_gen_mod-eng.php|title=The Regulation of Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe all food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"&gt;John Davison (2010)"GM plants: Science, politics and EC regulations" Plant Science 178(2):94–98 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945209003112]&lt;/ref&gt;

These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002). These foods have been assessed for increased risks to human health by several national regulatory authorities (inter alia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and the United States) using their national food safety procedures (ICSU). To date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science Review Panel). Many millions of people have consumed foods derived from GM plants—mainly maize, soybean and oilseed rape—without any observed adverse effects (ICSU)."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://genetics.org/content/188/1/11.long|title=Plant Genetics, Sustainable Agriculture and Global Food Security|first=Pamela|last=Ronald|journal=Genetics|date=May 5, 2011|volume=188|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.128553|quote="There is broad scientific consensus that genetically engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat.

Both the U.S. National Research Council and the Joint Research Centre (the European Union's scientific and technical research laboratory and an integral part of the European Commission) have concluded that there is a comprehensive body of knowledge that adequately addresses the food safety issue of genetically engineered crops (Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human Health and National Research Council 2004; European Commission Joint Research Centre 2008). These and other recent reports conclude that the processes of genetic engineering and conventional breeding are no different in terms of unintended consequences to human health and the environment (European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 2010)."|pmid=21546547|pmc=3120150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But see also:&lt;p&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://gaiapresse.ca/images/nouvelles/28563.pdf|title=A literature review on the safety assessment of genetically modified plants|first1=José L.|last1=Domingo|first2=Jordi Giné|last2=Bordonaba|journal=Environment International|date=2011|volume=37|issue=4|pages=734–742|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2011.01.003|quote="In spite of this, the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of GM plants is still limited. However, it is important to remark that for the first time, a certain equilibrium in the number of research groups suggesting, on the basis of their studies, that a number of varieties of GM products (mainly maize and soybeans) are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-GM plant, and those raising still serious concerns, was observed. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

==History==

The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], California. The first use of [[Recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology had just been successfully accomplished by [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] and [[Herbert Boyer]] two years previously and the scientific community recognized that as well as benefits this technology could also pose some risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.185.4148.303|journal=Science|year=1974|volume=185|issue=4148|pages=303|title=Letter: Potential biohazards of recombinant DNA molecules|vauthors=Berg P, Baltimore D, Boyer HW, Cohen SN, Davis RW, Hogness DS, Nathans D, Roblin R, Watson JD, Weissman S, Zinder ND |url=http://beck2.med.harvard.edu/week13/The%20Science%20Letter.pdf|pmid=4600381|bibcode=1974Sci...185..303B|pmc=388511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA|Asilomar meeting]] recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981|journal=Proc.

The basic concepts for the safety assessment of foods derived from GMOs have been developed in close collaboration under the auspices of the OECD, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). A first joint FAO/WHO consultation in 1990 resulted in the publication of the report ‘Strategies for Assessing the Safety of  Foods Produced by Biotechnology’ in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040704145649/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/en/1990.pdf FAO/WHO Report 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on that, an international consensus was reached by the OECD’s Group of National Experts on Safety in Biotechnology, for assessing biotechnology in general, including field testing GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/science/biotechnologypolicies/2375496.pdf OECD(1992) Safety Considerations for Biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;  That Group met again in Bergen, Norway in 1992 and reached consensus on principles for evaluating the safety of GM food; its report, ‘The safety evaluation of foods derived by modern technology – concepts and principles’ was published in 1993.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;OECD(1993) Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles [http://www.oecd.org/science/biosafety-biotrack/41036698.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That report recommends conducting the safety assessment of a GM food on a case-by-case basis through comparison to an existing food with a long history of safe use. This basic concept has been refined in subsequent workshops and consultations organized by the OECD, WHO, and FAO, and the OECD in particular has taken the lead in acquiring data and developing standards for conventional foods to be used in assessing substantial equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2010) [http://www.oecd.org/env/chemicalsafetyandbiosafety/biosafety-biotrack/46815346.pdf Consensus Document on Molecular Characterisation of Plants Derived  from Modern Biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/chemicalsafetyandbiosafety/biosafety-biotrack/consensusdocumentsfortheworkonharmonisationofregulatoryoversightinbiotechnology.htm|title=Consensus documents: work on harmonisation of regulatory oversight in biotechnology |publisher= OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] was adopted on 29 January 2000 and entered into force on 11 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bch.cbd.int/protocol/background/|title=About the Protocol|work=The Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an international treaty that governs the transfer, handling, and use of genetically modified (GM) organisms.

==In the laboratory==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Institutions that conduct certain types of scientific research must obtain permission from government authorities and ethical committees before they conduct any experiments. Universities and research institutes generally have a special committee that is responsible for approving any experiments that involve [[genetic engineering]]. Many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group. Most countries have exempt dealings for [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) that only pose a low risk. These include systems using standard laboratory strains as the hosts, [[recombinant DNA]] that does not code for a [[vertebrate]] toxin or is not derived from a [[micro-organism]] that can cause disease in humans. Exempt dealings usually do not require approval from the national regulator. GMOs that pose a low risk if certain management practices are complied with are classified as notifiable low risk dealings. The final classification is for any uses of GMOs that do not meet the previous criteria. These are known as licensed dealings and include [[cloning]] any genes that code for vertebrate toxins or using hosts that are capable of causing disease in humans. Licensed dealings require the approval of the national regulator.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Work with exempt GMOs do not need to be carried out in certified laboratories. All others must be contained in a Physical Containment level 1 (PC1) or Physical Containment level 2 (PC2) laboratories. Laboratory work with GMOs classified as low risk, which include [[knockout mice]], are carried out in PC1 lab. This is the case for modifications that do not confer an [[selective advantage|advantage]] to the animal or doesn't secrete any infectious agents. If a laboratory strain that is used isn't covered by exempt dealings or the inserted DNA could code for a pathogenic gene, it must be carried out in a PC2 laboratory.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology and the development and release of GMOs vary from country to country, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the United States and Europe. The U.S. regulatory policy is governed by the [[Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology]]&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;[http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ United States Regulatory Agencies Unified Biotechnology Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117144031/http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ |date=2012-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has three tenets:  "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products."&lt;ref name="Marsden"&gt;Emily Marden, Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture, 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003)[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2236&amp;context=bclr]&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Union]] by contrast enacted regulatory laws in 2003 that provided possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt; All GMOs, along with [[irradiated food]], are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA).  The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety," "freedom of choice," "labelling," and "traceability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html GMO Compass: The European Regulatory System.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814025652/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html |date=2012-08-14 }} Retrieved 28 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union has heavily contrasted its regulations and restrictions regarding genetic engineering compared to those of the United States. The European Parliament's Committee on the Environmental, Public Health, and Consumer Protection pushed forward and adopted a "safety first" principle regarding the case of GMOs, calling for any negative health consequences from GMOs to be held liable. On the other hand, the United States still takes on a less hands-on approach to the regulation of GMOs, with the FDA and USDA only looking over pesticide and plant health facets of GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endres|first=A.

However, although the European Union has had relatively strict regulations regarding the genetically modified food,  Europe is now allowing newer versions of modified maize and other agricultural produce. Also, the level of GMO acceptance in the European Union varies across its countries with Spain and Portugal being more permissive of GMOs than France and the Nordic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa-Font|first=Montserrat|last2=Gil|first2=José M.|last3=Traill|first3=W.

In this country, the government has declared that the GMO definition (according to Directive 2001/18/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32001L0018 Directive 2001/18/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;) stipulates that foreign DNA needs to be present in an organism for it to qualify as a genetically modified organisms. Organisms that thus have the foreign DNA removed (for example via selective breeding&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/europe-s-genetically-edited-plants-stuck-in-legal-limbo-1.19028 Europe’s genetically edited plants stuck in legal limbo]&lt;/ref&gt;) do not qualify as GMO's, even if [[Genome editing|gene editing]] has thus been used to make the organism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/gene-editing-in-legal-limbo-in-europe-1.21515 Gene editing in legal limbo in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a genetically modified organism to be approved for release in the U.S., it must be assessed under the [[Plant Protection Act]] by the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) agency within the USDA and may also be assessed by the FDA and the EPA, depending on the intended use of the organism. The USDA evaluate the plants potential to become weeds, the FDA reviews plants that could enter or alter the food supply,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/Biotechnology/default.htm FDA page for GM Food]&lt;/ref&gt; and the EPA regulates genetically modified plants with pesticide properties, as well as agrochemical residues.&lt;ref name="pewtrusts2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and Agricultural Biotechnology Products|work=The Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts|location=Washington, DC|year=2001|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the EFSA reports to the [[European Commission]] who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Agricultural Ministers]]. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt;   However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are "justifiable reasons" that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case.&lt;ref name="Europa safety"&gt;"Health and Consumers: Food and feed safety."

=== Other countries ===
The level of regulation in other countries lies in between Europe and the United States. [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMASA) is responsible for assessing the safety of GMOs in most of Africa, although the final decision lies with each individual country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/467633b.html Transgenic harvest] Editorial, ''Nature'' 467, pp. 633–34, 7 October 2010, {{doi|10.1038/467633b}}.

=== Labeling ===
One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.&lt;ref name="Botha" /&gt; In Canada and the United States labeling of GM food is voluntary,&lt;ref name="RegGMFood" /&gt; while in Europe all food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt; In the US state of Oregon., voters rejected Measure 27, which would have required labeling of all genetically modified foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grobe|first=Deana|last2=Raab|first2=Carolyn|date=2004|title=Voters' Response to Labeling Genetically Engineered Foods: Oregon's Experience|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs|volume=38|pages=320–331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Australia require labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v5/n1/8/ Northwestern.edu] Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property Paper on: "Consumer Protection" Consumer Strategies and the European Market in Genetically Modified Foods&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
{{main|International trade of genetically modified foods}}

The Cartagena Protocol sets the requirements for the international trade of GMO's between countries that are signatories to it.  Any shipments contain geneticially modified organisms that are intended to be used as feed, food or for processing must be identified and a list of the transgenic events be available.

===Substantial equivalence===
{{main|Substantial equivalence}}
"Substantial equivalence" is a starting point for the safety assessment for GM foods that is widely used by national and international agencies—including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the [[World Health Organization]] and the OECD.&lt;ref name="whybiotech.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120450/http://foodsafety.ksu.edu/en/article-details.php?a=3&amp;c=17&amp;sc=131&amp;id=497 Substantial Equivalence in Food Safety Assessment, Council for Biotechnology Information, March 11, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

A quote from FAO, one of the agencies that developed the concept, is useful for defining it: "Substantial equivalence embodies the concept that if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety (i.e., the food or food component can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food or food component)".&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety.  Rome, Italy, 30 September to 4 October 1996 [ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/food/biotechnology.pdf] p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of substantial equivalence also recognises the fact that existing foods often contain toxic components (usually called antinutrients) and are still able to be consumed safely—in practice there is some tolerable chemical risk taken with all foods, so a comparative method for assessing safety needs to be adopted. For instance, potatoes and tomatoes can contain toxic levels of respectively, solanine and alpha-tomatine alkaloids.&lt;ref name=OECD2000&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Report of the Task Force for the Safety of Novel Foods and Feeds C(2000)86/ADD1.  May 17, 2000 [http://www.biosafety.be/ARGMO/Documents/report_taskforce.pdf] Quote: "Much experience has been gained in the safety assessment of the first generation of foods derived through modern biotechnology, and those countries that have conducted assessments are confident that those GM foods they have approved are as safe as other foods."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=W. K.|last2=Haslberger|first2=A. G.|title=Substantial equivalence of antinutrients and inherent plant toxins in genetically modified novel foods|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=1 June 2000|volume=38|issue=6|pages=473–83|issn=0278-6915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To decide if a modified product is substantially equivalent, the product is tested by the manufacturer for unexpected changes in a limited set of components such as toxins, nutrients, or allergens that are present in the unmodified food.  The manufacturer's data is then assessed by a regulatory agency, such as the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]. That data, along with data on the genetic modification itself and resulting proteins (or lack of protein), is submitted to regulators.  If regulators determine that the submitted data show no significant difference between the modified and unmodified products, then the regulators will generally not require further food safety testing.  However, if the product has no natural equivalent, or shows significant differences from the unmodified food, or for other reasons that regulators may have (for instance, if a gene produces a protein that had not been a food component before), the regulators may require that further safety testing be carried out.&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt;

A 2003 review in ''Trends in Biotechnology'' identified seven main parts of a standard safety test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kok EJ, Kuiper HA |title=Comparative safety assessment for biotech crops |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=439–44 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14512230 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Study of the introduced DNA and the new proteins or metabolites that it produces;
# Analysis of the chemical composition of the relevant plant parts, measuring nutrients, anti-nutrients as well as any natural toxins or known allergens;
# Assess the risk of gene transfer from the food to microorganisms in the human gut;
# Study the possibility that any new components in the food might be allergens;
# Estimate how much of a normal diet the food will make up;
# Estimate any toxicological or nutritional problems revealed by this data in light of data on equivalent foods;
# Additional animal toxicity tests if there is the possibility that the food might pose a risk.

There has been discussion about applying new [[biochemical]] concepts and methods in evaluating substantial equivalence, such as metabolic profiling and protein profiling.  These concepts refer, respectively, to the complete measured biochemical spectrum (total fingerprint) of compounds (metabolites) or of proteins present in a food or crop.  The goal would be to compare overall the biochemical profile of a new food to an existing food to see if the new food's profile falls within the range of natural variation already exhibited by the profile of existing foods or crops.  However, these techniques are not considered sufficiently evaluated, and standards have not yet been developed, to apply them.&lt;ref&gt;FAO.  Safety aspects of genetically modified foods of plant origin – Consultations 4.

==Genetically modified animals==

[[Transgenic animals]] have genetically modified DNA. Animals are different from plants in a variety of ways—biology, life cycles, or potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=J.D|title=Opinion: A new paradigm for regulating genetically engineered animals that are used as food|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2016|volume=113|issue=13|pages=3410–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1602474113|pmid=27035930|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602474113|pmc=4822638|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.3410M}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM plants and animals were being developed around the same time, but due to the complexity of their biology and inefficiency with laboratory equipment use, their appearance in the market was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vàzquez-Salat|first1=Núria|title=Are good ideas enough?

'''Security breach notification laws''' or '''data breach notification laws''' are [[law]]s that require an entity that has been subject to a [[data breach]] to notify their customers and other parties about the breach and take other steps to remediate injuries caused by the breach. Such laws have been enacted in all 50 [[U.S. states]] since 2002. These laws were enacted in response to an escalating number of breaches of [[consumer]] databases containing [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="ncsl.org"&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx Security Breach Notification Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such law, the [[California S.B. 1386|California data security breach notification law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[SB 1386]], Cal. Civ. Code 1798.82 and 1798.29.&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html SB 1386 Senate Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613110357/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As related in the bill statement, law requires "a state agency, or a person or business that conducts business in California, that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to disclose in specified ways, any breach of the security of the data, as defined, to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person." In addition, the law permits delayed notification "if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation." The law also requires any entity that licenses such information to notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the data.

In general, most state laws follow the basic tenets of California's original law: Companies must immediately disclose a [[data breach]] to customers, usually in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/221322/CSO_Disclosure_Series_Data_Breach_Notification_Laws_State_By_State|title=CSO Disclosure Series - Data Breach Notification Laws, State By State|author=Scott Berinato|date=12 February 2008|work=CSO Online|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; California has since broadened its law to include compromised medical and health insurance information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1251-1300/ab_1298_bill_20071014_chaptered.html|title=AB 1298   Assembly Bill - CHAPTERED|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] maintains a list of enacted and proposed security breach notification laws.&lt;ref name="ncsl.org"/&gt;

A number of bills that would establish a national standard for data security breach notification have been introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]], but none passed in the [[109th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsa.com/blog/entry.asp?id=1173 Speaking of Security... | Blog Entry: Shannon Kellogg | Data security a: 1173&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2015 State of the Union speech, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] proposed new legislation to create a national data breach standard that would establish a 30-day notification requirement from the discovery of a breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Personal Data Notification &amp; Protection Act|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/letters/updated-data-breach-notification.pdf|website=Obamawhitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] implemented a breach notification law in the [[Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications]] (E-Privacy Directive) in 2009, specific to personal data held by telecoms and Internet service providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:01:EN:HTML Amendment of Article 4 lit 3-5 of Directive 2002/58/EC (E-Privacy Directive) by Article 2 lit 4 c) of Directive 2009/136/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/new-specific-rules-consumers-when-telecoms-personal-data-lost-or-stolen-eu|title=New specific rules for consumers when telecoms personal data is lost or stolen in EU|date=5 November 2016|work=Digital Single Market|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This directive has to be implemented by national law until 25 May 2011.

Furthermore, the traffic data of the subscribers, who use voice and data via a network company, are saved from the company only for operational reasons. However, the traffic data must be deleted when they aren’t necessary anymore, in order to avoid the breaches.
On the other hand, the traffic data are necessary for the creation and treatment of subscriber billing. The use of these data is available only up to the end of the period that the bill can be repaid based on the law of European Union (Article 6 - paragraphs 1-6 &lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058&lt;/ref&gt;).
Regarding the marketing usage of the traffic data for the sale of additional chargeable services, they can be used from the company only if the subscriber gives his/her consent (but, the consent can be withdrawn at every time). Also, the service provider must inform the subscriber or user of the types of traffic data which are processed and of the duration of that based on the above assumptions. Processing of traffic data, in accordance with the above details, must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services handling billing or traffic management, customer enquiries, fraud detection, marketing electronic communications services or providing a value added service, and must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of such activities.

'''Sexual harassment''' is [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature and the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paludi | first1 = Michele A. | last2 = Barickman | first2 = Richard B. | chapter = Definitions and incidence of academic and workplace sexual harassment | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vx4qhVPOYUUC&amp;pg=PA2 | title = Academic and workplace sexual harassment: a resource manual  | pages = 2–5 | publisher = SUNY Press | location = Albany, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780791408308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault|assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda.

In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a "general civility code".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Oncale v.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.'', 528 U.S. 75 (1998) |findlaw=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/75.html |justia=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.

Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal [[employment discrimination]]. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.

==Etymology and history==
The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s, although related concepts have existed in many cultures.

=== The term "sexual harassment" ===
Although legal activist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] is sometimes credited with creating the laws surrounding sexual harassment in the United States with her 1979 book entitled ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women'',&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the first known use of the term ''sexual harassment'' was in a 1973 report about discrimination called ''"Saturn's Rings"''  by [[Mary Rowe]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamberi|first=Ferdi|last2=Gollopeni|first2=Besim|date=2015-12-01|title=The Phenomenon of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in Republic of Kosovo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316515762|journal=International Review of Social Sciences|volume=3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Rowe has stated that sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s, and wasn't likely the first person to use the term. At the time, Rowe was the Chancellor for Women and Work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary, "Saturn's Rings," a study of the minutiae of sexism which maintain discrimination and inhibit affirmative action results in corporations and non-profit institutions; published in Graduate and Professional Education of Women, American Association of University Women, 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–9. "Saturn's Rings II" is a 1975 updating of the original, with racist and sexist incidents from 1974 and 1975. Revised and republished as "The Minutiae of Discrimination: The Need for Support," in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1981, Ch. 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–171. {{ISBN|978-0-13-645382-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her efforts at MIT, the university was one of the first large organizations in the U.S. to develop specific policies and procedures aimed at stopping sexual harassment.

In the book ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution'' (1999), journalist [[Susan Brownmiller]] quotes [[Cornell University]] activists who believed they had coined the term 'sexual harassment' in 1975 after being asked for help by [[Carmita Dickerson Wood]], a 44-year-old single mother who was being harassed by a faculty member at Cornell's Department of Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timeline.com/carmita-wood-sexual-harrassment-f2c537a0e1e8|title=Groping in the Ivy League led to the first sexual harassment suit—and nothing happened to the man|date=2017-10-20|work=Timeline|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuY_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=women+fight+intimidation+ithaca+journal#v=onepage&amp;q=carmita%20wood&amp;f=false|title=Cornell: A History, 1940–2015|last=Altschuler|first=Glenn C.|last2=Kramnick|first2=Isaac|date=2014-08-12|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801471889|location=|pages=146|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |first=Susan |last=Brownmiller |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activists, [[Lin Farley]], [[Susan Meyer (Cornell University)|Susan Meyer]], and [[Karen Sauvigne]] went on to form the [[Working Women's Institute]] which, along with the [[Alliance Against Sexual Coercion]] (founded in 1976 by [[Freada Klein]], [[Lynn Wehrli]], and [[Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz]]), were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to public attention in the late 1970s. One of the first legal formulations of the concept of sexual harassment as consistent with sex discrimination and therefore prohibited behavior under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] appeared in the 1979 seminal book by Catharine MacKinnon&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=camtwo|title=MacKinnon, Catharine A. - University of Michigan Law School|website=www.law.umich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Sexual Harassment of Working Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine |  title = Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination.  | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1979 | isbn = 9780300022995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key sexual harassment cases ===
Sexual harassment first became codified in U.S. law as the result of a series of sexual harassment cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the early women pursuing these cases were African American, often former civil rights activists who applied principles of civil rights to sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' (1976) and ''[[Paulette L. Barnes, Appellant, v. Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (1977) determined it was sex discrimination to fire someone for refusing a supervisor's advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Diane+Williams%22+sexual+harassment#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Diane%20Williams%22&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521879354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, ''[[Bundy v. Jackson]]'' was the first [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|title=#HerToo: 40 Years Ago This Woman Helped Make Sexual Harassment Illegal|date=2018-03-04|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed with this holding in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]].'' Another pioneering legal case was ''[[Alexander v. Yale]]'', which established that the sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination under [[Title IX]], and was thus illegal.

The term was largely unknown (outside academic and legal circles) until the early 1990s when [[Anita Hill]] witnessed and testified against [[Supreme Court of the United States]] nominee [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name="techrep"&gt;Bowers, Toni; Hook, Brian. [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/hostile-work-environment-a-managers-legal-liability/5035282 Hostile work environment: A manager's legal liability], Tech Republic. October 22, 2002. Retrieved on March 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual harassment cases reported in the US and Canada increased 58 percent and have climbed steadily.&lt;ref name="techrep" /&gt;

* There may or may not be other witnesses or attendances.
* The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her behavior is offensive or constitutes sexual harassment. The perpetrator may be completely unaware that his or her actions could be unlawful.&lt;ref name="eeoc"/&gt;
* The incident can take place in situations in which the harassed person may not be aware of or understand what is happening.
* The incident may be a one time occurrence but more often the incident repeats.
* Adverse effects on the target are common in the form of stress, social withdrawal, sleep, eating difficulties, and overall health impairment.
* The victim and perpetrator can be any gender.
* The perpetrator does not have to be of the opposite sex.
* The incident can result from a situation in which the perpetrator thinks they are making themselves clear, but is not understood the way they intended. The misunderstanding can either be reasonable or unreasonable. An example of unreasonable is when a woman holds a certain stereotypical view of a man such that she did not understand the man’s explicit message to stop.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Richard (1994).

With the advent of the internet, social interactions, including sexual harassment, increasingly occur online, for example [[sexual harassment in video gaming|in video games]] or in chat rooms.

According to the 2014 PEW research statistics on online harassment, 25% of women and 13% of men between the ages of 18 and 24 have experienced sexual harassment while online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/ Duggan, Maeve] "Online Harassment", PEW Research Center, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) defines workplace sexual harassment as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment” (EEOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/|title=EEOC Home Page|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals detained by the military are also vulnerable to sexual harassment.

Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents, typically out of fear of reprisals, according to research in Australia, Canada, France, the UK, and the US.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/assets/FORCES_Internet/docs/en/caf-community-support-services-harassment/era-final-report-(april-20-2015)-eng.pdf|title=External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces|last=Deschamps|first=Marie|date=2015|website=forces.gc.ca|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenceabusetaskforce.gov.au/Reports/Documents/Dart-final-report-2016.pdf|title=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce: Final report|last=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|date=2016|website=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1168765/dod-releases-latest-military-sexual-assault-report/|title=DoD Releases Latest Military Sexual Assault Report|last=US, Department of Defence|date=2017-05-01|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;

Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer [[Stress (biology)|stress]]-related [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] afterwards.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Research in the US found that when [[sexual abuse]] of female military personnel is [[Psychological trauma|psychiatrically traumatic]], the odds of suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Varied behaviors==
[[File:Bullying Sexual.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A man makes an unwanted sexual advance on a woman.]]
One of the difficulties in understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of [[behavior]]s. In most cases (although not in all cases) it is difficult for the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[humiliation]] experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louise|first=Fitzgerald|year=1995|title=Why Didn't She Just Report Him?

* A predatory harasser: a person who gets sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become involved in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass just to see how targets respond. Those who don't resist may even become targets for rape.
* A dominance harasser: the most common type, who engages in harassing behavior as an ego boost.
* Strategic or territorial harassers who seek to maintain privilege in jobs or physical locations, for example a man's harassment of a female employee in a predominantly male occupation.
* A [[Street harassment|street harasser]]: Another type of sexual harassment performed in public places by strangers. Street harassment includes verbal and nonverbal behavior, remarks that are frequently sexual in nature and comment on physical appearance or a person's presence in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women |first=Cynthia Grant |last=Bowman |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=Jan 1993 |pages=517–80 |jstor=1341656 |doi=10.2307/1341656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sororities and fraternities in the United States take preventative measures against [[hazing]] and hazing activities during the participants' pledging processes (which may often include sexual harassment). Many [[Greek organization]]s and universities nationwide have anti-hazing policies that explicitly recognize various acts and examples of hazing, and offer preventative measures for such situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazingprevention.org/ Pualwan, CEO Emily N. ] HazingPrevention.org.

== Impact ==

The impact of sexual harassment can vary. In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against women : an EU-wide survey : main results|others=European Union. Agency for Fundamental Rights.|isbn=9789292393427|location=Vienna|oclc=876847362|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Koss, Mary P. "Changed Lives: The Psychological Impact of Sexual Harassment." in ''Ivory Power: Sexual Harassment On Campus.'' Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1987. pp. 73-92 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0457-7}}.{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1995, Judith Coflin committed suicide after chronic sexual harassment by her bosses and coworkers. (Her family was later awarded six million dollars in punitive and compensatory damages.)&lt;/ref&gt; Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.

As an overall social and economic effect every year, sexual harassment deprives women from active social and economic participation and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost educational and professional opportunities for mostly girls and women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quantity of men implied in these conflicts is significant.

===Coping===
{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}} 
Sexual harassment, by definition, is unwanted and not to be tolerated. There are ways, however, for offended and injured people to overcome the resultant psychological effects, remain in or return to society, regain healthy feelings within personal relationships when they were affected by the outside relationship trauma, regain social approval, and recover the ability to concentrate and be productive in educational and  work environments. These include [[stress management]] and therapy, [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11495093 |year=2001 |last1=Foa |first1=EB |last2=Street |first2=GP |title=Women and traumatic events |volume=62 Suppl 17 |pages=29–34 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; friends and family support, and advocacy.&lt;ref name="Advocacy as coping mechanism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cope-with-the-current-news-cycle-as-a-sexual-abu-1820823444 |title=How to Cope With the Current News Cycle as a Sexual Abuse Survivor |last=Schwartz |first=Deb |date=2017-12-05 |website=Lifehack |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual Assault Advocates"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-metoo-affects-sexual-assault-advocates |title=HOW #METOO AFFECTS SEXUAL ASSAULT ADVOCATES  As public awareness of harassment grows exponentially in the wake of #MeToo, the advocates staffing sexual assault hotlines are taking more calls—and teaching more callers—than ever before. |last=OLSEN |first=HANNA BROOKS OLSEN |date=2017-12-22 |website=PacificStandard |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate psychological and legal counseling are recommended since self-treatment may not release stress or remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities may not have the desired effect, may be ignored, or may further injure the victim at its response.

A 1991 study done by K.R. Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the "lady", the "flirt", and the "tomboy".
The "ladies" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the "ladies" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "flirts" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments. Consequently, they became perceived as the "embodiment of the female stereotype,...as particularly lacking in potential and were given the fewest opportunities to develop job skills and to establish social and self-identities as miners."&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The "tomboys" were generally single women, but were older than the "flirts". They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a "thick skin". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

The findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.&lt;ref name="Landrine 1997"/&gt;

===Common effects on the victims===
{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}
Common psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:
* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people "evaluate" the victim to establish if he or she is "worth" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)
* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip
* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions; increased [[absenteeism]] in fear of harassment repetition
* [[Defamation]] of character and reputation
* Effects on sexual life and relationships: can put extreme stress upon relationships with [[significant other]]s, sometimes resulting in divorce
* Firing and refusal for a job opportunity can lead to loss of job or career, loss of income
* Having one's personal life offered up for public scrutiny—the victim becomes the "accused", and his or her dress, lifestyle, and private life will often come under attack.
* Having to drop courses, change academic plans, or leave school (loss of tuition) in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress
* Having to relocate to another city, another job, or another school
* Loss of references/recommendations
* Loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred
* Loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or his or her colleagues, especially in case they are not supportive, difficulties or stress on peer relationships, or relationships with colleagues
* Psychological stress and health impairment
* Weakening of support network, or being ostracized from professional or academic circles (friends, colleagues, or family may distance themselves from the victim, or shun him or her altogether)

Some of the psychological and health effects that can occur in someone who has been sexually harassed as a result of [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[humiliation]]:
[[Major depressive disorder|depression]]; [[anxiety]]; [[panic attack]]s; sleeplessness; [[nightmare]]s; [[shame]]; [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]; difficulty concentrating; headaches; [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]; loss of motivation; stomach problems; [[eating disorder]]s (such as weight loss or gain); [[alcoholism]]; feeling betrayed, violated, angry, violent towards the perpetrator, powerless or out of control; increased blood pressure; loss of confidence or self-esteem; withdrawal; [[Solitude|isolation]]; overall loss of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] in people; traumatic stress; [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD); [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]; [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]] or attempts, and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html|deadurl=yes|title=Women's Crisis Support Services|date=9 July 2007|archivedate=9 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |title=Sexual Harassment: Myths and Realities |publisher=Uoregon.edu |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085341/http://www.uoregon.edu/~counsel/harass.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopvaw.org/Effects_of_Sexual_Harassment.html |title=Effects of Sexual Harassment |publisher=Stop Violence Against Women |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |title=Psychosocial and Organizational Factors: Sexual Harassment |publisher=Ilo.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220123857/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/gender/encyclo/psy14ae.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-complaint retaliation and backlash===
Retaliation and backlash against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who speak out against sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who are on their own "power trips", or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of [[rape]] or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dittman, M. |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/harass.html |title=Sexual harassment too often leads to humiliation for victims |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=October 2003 |volume=34 |issue=9 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends. They may become the targets of [[mobbing]] or [[relational aggression]].&lt;ref name="SHSF_effects"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html Effects of Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118134554/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/effects.html |date=January 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are not necessarily sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues.&lt;ref name="webcom"&gt;[http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html Dealing With Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html |date=2007-07-09 }} (link is not active)&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility.&lt;ref name="backlash"&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html Sexual harassment retaliation, backlash, and victim blaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215113203/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html |date=February 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women [[shunning|shunned]] her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit.&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, Clara; Gansler, Laura Leedy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ur03ZVbot6IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Class Action: The Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law]''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} New York, Anchor Books, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-385-49613-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.&lt;ref name="backlash" /&gt;

Retaliation has occurred when a sexual harassment victim suffers a negative action as a result of the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects [[sabotage]]d, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be [[firing|fired]] from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also [[stalking]] and [[cyberstalking]] of the victim.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="backlash" /&gt; Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.

Of the women who have approached her to share their own experiences of being [[Sexual harassment in education|sexually harassed by their teachers]], [[Feminism|feminist]] and writer [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote in 2004:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf |first=Naomi |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |title=The Silent Treatment |publisher=New York Metro |date=March 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083501/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another woman who was interviewed by sociologist Helen Watson said, "Facing up to the crime and having to deal with it in public is probably worse than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment itself."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Helen. "Red herrings and mystifications: Conflicting perceptions of sexual harassment," in Brant, Clare, and Too, Yun Lee, eds., ''Rethinking Sexual Harassment''.

===Backlash stress===
Backlash stress is stress resulting from an uncertainty regarding changing norms for interacting with women in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Taylor Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kimberly |last=Taylor Schneider |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bystander_Stress.html?id=gH18NQAACAAJ|title=Bystander Stress: The Effect of Organizational Tolerance of Sexual Harassment on Victim's Co-workers |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlash stress now deters many male workers from befriending female colleagues, or providing them with any assistance, such as holding doors open. As a result, women are being handicapped by a lack of the necessary networking and mentorship.&lt;ref name="daubney"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11904203/Well-done-feminism.-Now-man-are-afraid-to-help-women-at-work.html|title=Well done, feminism.

==Organizational policies and procedures==
Most companies have policies against sexual harassment, however these policies are not designed and should not attempt to "regulate romance" which goes against human urges.&lt;ref name="markschickman"/&gt;

Act upon a report of harassment inside the organization should be:

{{quote|The investigation should be designed to obtain a prompt and thorough collection of the facts, an appropriate responsive action, and an expeditious report to the complainant that the investigation has been concluded, and, to the full extent appropriate, the action taken.|Mark I. Schickman, Sexual Harassment. The employer's role in prevention. [[American Bar Association]]&lt;ref name="markschickman"&gt;Schickman, Mark I. Sexual Harassment. The employer's role in prevention. [[American Bar Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When organizations do not take the respective satisfactory measures for properly investigating, stress and psychological counseling and guidance, and just deciding of the problem this could lead to:
* Decreased productivity and increased team conflict
* Decreased study or job satisfaction
* Loss of students and staff. Loss of students who leave school and staff resignations to avoid harassment. Resignations and firings of alleged harassers.
* Decreased productivity and increased absenteeism by staff or students experiencing harassment
* Decrease in success at meeting academic and financial goals
* Increased health-care and sick-pay costs because of the health consequences of harassment or retaliation
* The knowledge that harassment is permitted can undermine ethical standards and discipline in the organization in general, as staff or students lose respect for, and trust in, their seniors who indulge in, or turn a blind eye to, or treat improperly sexual harassment
* If the problem is ignored or not treated properly, a company's or school's image can suffer
* High jury awards for the employee, attorney fees and litigation costs if the problem is ignored or not treated properly (in case of firing the victim) when the complainants are advised to and take the issue to court.&lt;ref name="techrep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW_effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="org_factor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boland, 1990{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janaraver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qnc.queensu.ca/story_loader.php?id=42b98262192e9 Sexual harassment bad for victims and for business] June 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/guides/S/63925/7 |title=For Help with the Handling of Harassment |publisher=Western Cape Government |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that [[organizational climate]] (an organization's tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment are essential for understanding the conditions in which sexual harassment is likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the job’s gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is atypical for women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00067.x |title=A Meta-Analysis of the Antecedents and Consequences of Workplace Sexual Harassment |year=2007 |last1=Willness |first1=Chelsea R. |last2=Steel |first2=Piers |last3=Lee |first3=Kibeom |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=60 |pages=127–162|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.6532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Orit Kamir, the most effective way to avoid sexual harassment in the workplace, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to "air out the dirty laundry" with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.&lt;ref&gt;קמיר אורית, "החוק הישראלי למניעת הטרדה מינית- איפה אנחנו במלואת לו עשור? / "Israeli law against sexual harassment - where we all had a decade"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maryrowe"&gt;Rowe, Mary.

Most prefer a pragmatic solution that would stop the harassment and prevent future contact with the harasser rather than turning to the police. More about the difficulty in turning an offense into a legal act can be found in Felstiner &amp; Sarat's (1981) study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William L.F. |last1=Felstiner |first2=Richard L. |last2=Abel |first3=Austin |last3=Sarat |year=1980 |title=The Emergence and Transformation of Disputes: Naming, Blaming, Claiming… |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=631–54 |jstor=3053505 |doi=10.2307/3053505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes three steps a victim (of any dispute) must go through before turning to the justice system: naming – giving the assault a definition, blaming – understanding who is responsible for the violation of rights and facing them, and finally, claiming – turning to the authorities.

==Evolution of law in different jurisdictions==
It may include a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda. ''The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Chicago Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-8070-3100-1}}; Boland, 2002{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment is a form of [[Law|illegal]] [[employment discrimination]] in many countries, and is a form of [[abuse]] (sexual and [[psychological abuse]]s) and [[bullying]].

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] classifies [[violence against women]] into three categories: that occurring in the family, that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. The term ''sexual harassment'' is used in defining violence occurring in the general community, which is defined as: "Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104. Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual harassment is subject to a [[Directive (European Union)|directive in the European Union]].&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF "{O}n the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women ... (76/207/EEC)"], Council of the [[European Communities|European Economic Communities]], 9 February 1976. Amended 23 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]]' [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) states, "It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex."

In India, the case of [[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan]] in 1997 has been credited with establishing sexual harassment as illegal.&lt;ref name="india_rape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/rape_laws.htm |title=Sexual Harassment and Rape Laws in India |publisher=Legal Service India |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the 1988 Equal Employment Opportunity Law made it a crime for an employer to retaliate against an employee who had rejected sexual advances, but it wasn't until 1998 that the Israeli Sexual Harassment Law made such behavior illegal.&lt;ref name="Kamir" /&gt;

In May 2002, the [[European Union]] Council and Parliament amended a 1976 Council Directive on the equal treatment of men and women in employment to prohibit sexual harassment in the workplace, naming it a form of sex discrimination and violation of dignity. This Directive required all Member States of the European Union to adopt laws on sexual harassment, or amend existing laws to comply with the Directive by October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Legal_Framework.html?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={D7FABC81-256E-41C1-BF3A-563AD89AA809} Domestic Legal Framework] November 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, "The Shanghai Supplement" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varied legal guidelines and definitions===
'''The [[United Nations]] General Recommendation 19 to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' defines sexual harassment of women to include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;such unwelcome sexually determined behavior as physical contact and advances, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While such conduct can be harassment of women by men, many laws around the world which prohibit sexual harassment recognize that both men and women may be harassers or victims of sexual harassment. However, most claims of sexual harassment are made by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment.cfm |title=Sexual Harassment Charges: EEOC &amp; FEPAs Combined: FY 1997 - FY 2011 |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many similarities, and also important differences in laws and definitions used around the world.

===Africa===

====Morocco====
In 2016 a stricter law proscribing sexual harassment was proposed in Morocco specifying fines and a possible jail sentence of up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="tmt_24March2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Up to 6 Months in Jail if You Sexually Harass a Woman in Morocco|url=http://themoroccantimes.com/2016/03/18929/sexual-harrassement-morocco-jail-sentence|accessdate=11 October 2016|publisher=themoroccantimes.com|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing law against harassment was reported to not be upheld, as harassment was not reported to police by victims and even when reported, was not investigated by police or prosecuted by the courts.&lt;ref name="tmt_24March2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_mag_10Oct2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Moroccan women fighting daily sexual harassment|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37589687|accessdate=11 October 2016|work=BBC Magazine|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 defines sexual harassment as "... a person sexually harasses another person (the person harassed ) if: (a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed; or (b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed; in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|sda1984209|Sex Discrimination Act 1984|28A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the [[European Union]], there is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] on sexual harassment. The ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states:&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (...)
* sexual harassment: where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] also addresses the issue of sexual harassment (Article 40), using a similar definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe - Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Sexual harassment is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action is used to change a victim's sexual status against the will of the victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.&lt;ref name="Denmark law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.dk/regel/2/2002.html#LOV%20nr%201385 |title=Denmark Law |publisher=Ku.dk |accessdate=2012-10-07|date=2016-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], both the Criminal Code and the Labor Code are relevant to the issue of sexual harassment. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described sexual harassment as "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors of a sexual nature".&lt;ref&gt;Art. 179 of the Law no. 2002-73 of 17 January 2002 on social modernization&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr Conseil constitutionnel] (French Supreme Court) quashed the definition of the criminal code as being too vague.&lt;ref&gt;Decision no. 2012-240 QPC of May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 decision resulted from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality. As a consequence of this decision, all pending procedures before criminal courts were cancelled. Several feminist NGOs, such as AFVT, criticized this decision. President [[François Hollande]], the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira) and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem) asked that a new law be voted rapidly. As a result, ''LOI n°2012-954 du 6 août 2012'' was voted in, providing a new definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000021796942&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719 "Code pénal: Article 222-33" (in French)], ''legifrance.gouv.fr''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criminal provisions, the French Labor code also prohibits sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Act of 2 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The legislator voted a law in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Act of 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive&lt;ref&gt;Directive of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions&lt;/ref&gt; definition without modifying the French Labour Code.

====Germany====
Sexual harassment is no statutory offense in Germany. In special cases it might be chargeable as "Insult" (with sexual context) as per § 185 [[Strafgesetzbuch]] but only if ''special circumstances'' show an insulting nature.

The victim has only a right to self-defend while the attack takes place. If a perpetrator kisses or gropes the victim, they may only fight back while this is happening. If the victim would, for instance, slap back after the attacker already stopped, the victim might be chargeable for assault as per § 223 [[Strafgesetzbuch]].&lt;ref&gt;Nina Adelmann: [http://www.juraexamen.info/wp-content/uploads/jura.2009.24.pdf Die Straflosigkeit des »Busengrapschens«] (PDF; 123&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the governing coalition decided about the key points of a tightening of the law governing sexual offenses (Sexualstrafrecht, literally: law on the punishment of sexual delicts). At July 7, 2016 the Bundestag passed the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Votum: Bundestag beschließt neues Sexualstrafrecht |journal=Spiegel Online |language=German |trans-title=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-beschliesst-neues-sexualstrafrecht-a-1101813.html |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by autumn 2016 the draft bill will be presented to the second chamber, the Bundesrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |date=2016-07-07 |title=Neues Sexualstrafrecht: Nein heißt Nein.

====Greece====
In response to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, [[Greece]] enacted Law 3488/2006 (O.G.A.'.191). The law specifies that sexual harassment is a form of gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Victims also have the right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId%3D10297%26baseHREF%3Dcountry%26baseHREFId%3D563 |title=AW 3488/2006 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIELDS OF ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT, VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND PROMOTION, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WORK |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201171917/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10297&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=563 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this law, the policy on sexual harassment in Greece was very weak.

====Russia====
In the Criminal Code, Russian Federation, (CC RF), there exists a law which prohibits utilization of an office position and material dependence for coercion of sexual interactions (Article 118, current CC RF). However, according to the Moscow Center for Gender Studies, in practice, the courts do not examine these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |title=Sexual Harassment in Russian Workplaces - Sexual Harassment Support Forum |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060132/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?s=a1f5e83af0f492d74310d4d1a073b792&amp;showtopic=279 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' quotes a survey in which "100 percent of female professionals [in Russia] said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by their bosses, 32 per cent said they had had intercourse with them at least once and another seven per cent claimed to have been raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2470310/Sexual-harrassment-okay-as-it-ensures-humans-breed-Russian-judge-rules.html |title=Sexual harassment okay as it ensures humans breed, Russian judge rules |last1=Blomfield |first1=Adrian |date=29 Jul 2008 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
A ban on discrimination was included in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19950082/index.html|title=Federal Act on Gender Equality|last=|first=|date=1995-03-24|website=The Federal Council - The Portal of the Swiss Government|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Article 4 of the GEA of 1995 discusses the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace: "Any harassing behaviour of a sexual nature or other behaviour related to the person's sex that adversely affects the dignity of women or men in the workplace is discriminatory. Such behaviour includes in particular threats, the promise of advantages, the use of coercion and the exertion of pressure in order to obtain favours of a sexual nature."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The Discrimination Act of 1975, was modified to establish sexual harassment as a form of discrimination in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc-law.org.uk/default.aspx?page=4666|title=Strathclyde Regional Council v Porcelli [1986&amp;#93; IRLR 134 Court of Session|work=eoc-law.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that harassment occurs where there is unwanted conduct on the ground of a person's sex or unwanted conduct of a sexual nature and that conduct has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. If an employer treats someone less favourably because they have rejected, or submitted to, either form of harassment described above, this is also harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |title=Sexual Harassment: what the law says |publisher=Eoc.org.uk |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831002533/http://www.eoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=15657 |archivedate=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Further|Sexism in India|Eveteasing|The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013}}
Sexual harassment in [[India]] is termed "[[Eve teasing]]" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour whether directly or indirectly as sexually coloured remarks; physical contact and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature or passing sexually offensive and unacceptable remarks. The critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="india_rape" /&gt; According to the [[Indian constitution]], sexual harassment infringes the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life and live with dignity under Article 21.&lt;ref name="amicus.iupindia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202183755/http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-12-02 |title=ICFAI University - Workplace Harassment |publisher=Amicus.iupindia.org |accessdate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a [[Public Interest Litigation]], defined sexual harassment at workplace, preventive measures and redress mechanism. The judgment is popularly known as [[Vishaka Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Vishaka 001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1031794/ |title=Vishaka &amp; Ors vs State Of Rajasthan &amp; Ors on 13 August 1997 |author1=Manohar, SV |author2=Kirpal, BN |journal=Supreme Court of India - |date=August 1997 |volume=241 |id=SCC Ref:(1997)6.

Almost 16 years after the Supreme Court's landmark guidelines on prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace (known as the "[[Vishaka Guidelines]]"), the Act has endorsed many of the guidelines, and is a step towards codifying gender equality. The Act is intended to include all women employees in its ambit, including those employed in the unorganized sector, as well as domestic workers.

The Act has identified sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution; as well as the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment. The Act also states that the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognized human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]] introduced changes to the [[Indian Penal Code]], making sexual harassment an expressed offense under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.

====Israel====
The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offense to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment".&lt;ref name="Kamir"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamir | first1 = Orit | year = | title = Israel's 1998 Sexual Harassment Law: Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Stalking, and Degradation Based on Sexual Orientation in the Workplace and in all Social Settings | url = http://sitemaker.umich.edu/Orit_Kamir/files/sexharas2.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Discrimination and Law | volume = 2005 | issue = 7| pages = 315–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====

Sexual Harassment, or ''sekuhara'' in Japanese, appeared most dramatically in Japanese discourse in 1989, when a court case in Fukuoka ruled in favor of a woman who had been subjected to the spreading of sexual rumors by a co-worker. When the case was first reported, it spawned a flurry of public interest: 10 books were published, including English-language feminist guidebooks to ‘how not to harass women’ texts for men.&lt;ref name=Huen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huen|first1=Y|title=Workplace Sexual Harassment in Japan: A Review of Combating Measures Taken|journal=Asian Survey|date=2007|volume=47|issue=5|pages=811–827|doi=10.1525/as.2007.47.5.811|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/47/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sekuhara was named 1989’s ‘Word of the Year.’ The case was resolved in the victim’s favor in 1992, awarding her about $13,000 in damages, the first sexual harassment lawsuit in Japanese history.&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=MacGregor|first1=Hillary|title=In Japan, Many Men Just Don't Get It : Nation only got word for sexual harassment after '89 court case.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-13/news/mn-56533_1_sexual-harassment/2|journal=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=13 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws then established two forms of sexual harassment: ''daisho'', in which rewards or penalties are explicitly linked to sexual acts, and ''kankyo'', in which the environment is made unpleasant through sexual talk or jokes, touching, or hanging sexually explicit posters. This applies to everyone in an office, including customers.&lt;ref name=Huen /&gt;

====Pakistan====
Pakistan has promulgated harassment law in 2010 with nomenclature as "The Protection Against Harassment of Women at The Workplace Act, 2010".
This law defines the act of harassment in following terms.
"Harassment means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitude, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to such a request or is made a condition for employment."
Pakistan has adopted a Code of Conduct for Gender Justice in the Workplace that will deal with cases of sexual harassment. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment At workplace (AASHA) announced they would be working with the committee to establish guidelines for the proceedings. AASHA defines sexual harassment much the same as it is defined in the U.S. and other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasha.org.pk/ |title=Alliance Against Sexual Harassment |publisher=AASHA |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
The Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 was enacted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;primarily to protect and respect the dignity of workers, employees, and applicants for employment as well as students in educational institutions or training centers. This law, consisting of ten sections, provides for a clear definition of work, education or training-related sexual harassment and specifies the acts constituting sexual harassment. It likewise provides for the duties and liabilities of the employer in cases of sexual harassment, and sets penalties for violations of its provisions. It is to be noted that a victim of sexual harassment is not barred from filing a separate and independent action for damages and other relief aside from filing the charge for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |title=Republic Act No. 7877 Anti Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 |publisher=Filipiniana.net |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713063240/http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Evolution of sexual harassment law====

=====Workplace=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}

In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[color]], [[national origin]] or [[religion]]. Initially intended to only combat sexual harassment of females, {42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2} the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers males and females. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|title=Sexual Harassment|work=eeoc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment] October 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v.

Vinson]], reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|EEOC]] per year before 1986 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=978-0700613236|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic%3D445 |title=Sexual Harassment Support Forum |accessdate=2006-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223845/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=445 |archivedate=2007-03-10 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

Ellerth |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

During 2007 alone, the ''U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission'' and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=David |title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners |url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks |accessdate=18 March 2011 |author2=Andronici, Justine |date=23 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203063912/http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.]] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and [[pornography]] are present. A [[hostile workplace]] may exist even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.employmentlawblog.info/2010/01/reeves-v-ch-robinson-worldwide-inc-no-07-10270-11th-cir-jan-20-2010.shtml|title=Reeves v.

From 2010 through 2016, approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were made by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in education in the United States}}
[[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

In ''Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools'' (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when teachers sexually harassed their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0503_0060_ZS.html |title=Franklin v.

Fraser'' (1986) the courts ruled that schools have the power to discipline students if they use "obscene, profane language or gestures" which could be viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and inconsistent with the "fundamental values of public school education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Doug Linder |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/firstamendment/bethel.html |title=Bethel School District v.

====Additionally====
There are a number of legal options for a complainant in the U.S.: [[mediation]], filing with the EEOC or filing a claim under a [[U.S. state|state]] Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace sexual harassment), filing a common law [[tort]], etc.&lt;ref name="whattodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/911/harasswhatdo.html |title=Sexual Harassment Fact Sheet: What to Do if You or Someone You Know is Sexually Harassed |publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sexual harassment will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EEOC Definition====
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.&lt;ref name="eeoc"/&gt; In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

1. and 2. are called "[[quid pro quo]]" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".

Type 3. known as "[[hostile work environment]]", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.&lt;ref name="webcom" /&gt;

'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====
[[File:Stop à la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]
Quid pro quo means "this for that". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html Sexual Harassment In The Workplace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708062743/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html |date=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====
{{Main|Hostile work environment}}
This occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent." Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html |title=The Law &amp; Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment? |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between "[[quid pro quo]]" and "hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment] 03/19/90&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hostile environment" harassment may acquire characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====
In the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.

=====Retaliation=====
Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment—any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |title=Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, Sheila |accessdate=2006-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052101/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.

== Historical antecedents ==

=== Ancient Rome ===
In [[ancient Rome]], according to [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1896 – 1970|Bruce W. Frier]] and [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1971 – 1990|Thomas A.J. McGinn]], what is now called ''sexual harassment''&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, [pbk.] 2004 ({{ISBN|0-19-516186-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;468 (author Frier prof. classics &amp; Roman law, Univ. of Michigan, &amp; coauthor McGinn assoc. prof. classical studies, Vanderbilt Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt; was then any of ''accosting'', ''stalking'', and ''abducting''. ''Accosting'' was "harassment through attempted seduction"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; or {{Nowrap|"assault[ing]}} another's chastity with smooth talk&amp;nbsp;... contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; which was more than the lesser offense(s) of "obscene speech, dirty jokes, and the like",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; "foul language",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and "clamor",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; with the accosting of "respectable young girls" who however were dressed in slaves' clothing being a lesser offense&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; and the accosting of "women&amp;nbsp;... dressed as prostitutes" being an even lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Stalking'' was "silently, persistently pursuing"&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; if it was "contrary to good morals",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-pp468-469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;468–469.&lt;/ref&gt; because a pursuer's "ceaseless presence virtually ensures appreciable disrepute".&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt; ''Abducting'' an attendant, who was someone who follows someone else as a companion and could be a slave,&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469"&gt;Frier, Bruce W., &amp; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;469.&lt;/ref&gt; was "successfully forcing or persuading the attendant to leave the side of the intended target",&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p469" /&gt; but abducting while the woman "has not been wearing respectable clothing" was a lesser offense.&lt;ref name="CasebkRomanFamL-FrierMcGinn-p468" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Though the phrase ''sexual harassment'' is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur. In the US, sexual harassment law has been criticized by persons such as the [[criminal defense lawyer]] [[Alan Dershowitz]] and the legal writer and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Eugene Volokh]], for imposing limits on the right to [[free speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volokh |first=Eugene |url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass/ |title=Freedom of Speech vs. Workplace Harassment Law — A Growing Conflict |publisher=UCLA Law School |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jana Rave, professor in organizational studies at the [[Queen's School of Business]], criticized sexual harassment policy in the ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'' as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as "delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same time complaints are lowering company profits.&lt;ref name="janaraver"&gt;Esau, Jeff. [http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 Sexual harassment: Poisoning profit prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020062419/http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1 |date=2012-10-20 }} &lt;!-- prev. journal link http://www.ffeusa.org/html/statements/statements_harassment.html --&gt;, ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'', August 10, 2005. Retrieved on March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm Playboy interview, Camille Paglia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm |date=June 22, 2006 }} May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at [[Yale University]] comments, "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM Love, Lust, and the Law Sexual Harassment in the Academy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203104653/http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM |date=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist [[Jane Gallop]] sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "[[power feminist]]s" who are [[pro-sex]] (like herself) and what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a ''perversion'' of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Jane. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V1ZKUQtIVWEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment]''.{{page needed|date=October 2012}} Duke University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-1918-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers and administrators using false or frivolous accusations as a way of expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. These employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the [[at-will]] law in most US states.&lt;ref&gt;Westhues, Kenneth. ''Eliminating Professors: A Guide to the Dismissal Process''. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-7734-8210-4}}.{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jip.43 |title=Pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment |year=2006 |last1=O'Donohue |first1=William |last2=Bowers |first2=Adrian H. |journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling |volume=3 |pages=47–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also discussion of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kathleen. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses]." ''New York Daily News''. June 30, 2008. Based on ''Save the Males'' by Kathleen Parker, 2008, Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many debates about how organizations should deal with sexual harassment. Some observers feel strongly that organizations should be held to a zero tolerance standard of "Must report - must investigate - must punish."

Others write that those who feel harassed should in most circumstances have a choice of options.&lt;ref name="maryrowe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoiBFMissing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=Mary|title=Negotiations and Change: From the Workplace to Society|year=2003|publisher=ILR Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.

{{Evidence law}}

In the [[common law]], '''spousal privilege''' (also called '''marital privilege''' or '''husband-wife privilege''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Husband-wife privilege |url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Statutes/statute.aspx?id=20378 |publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission |date=n.d. |accessdate=25 October 2013|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in the [[law of evidence]] to describe two separate [[Privilege (evidence)|privileges]] that apply to spouses: the spousal communications privilege and the spousal [[Testimony|testimonial]] privilege.

Both types of privilege are based on the policy of encouraging spousal harmony and preventing spouses from having to condemn, or be condemned by, their spouses: the spousal communications privilege or confidences privilege is a form of [[privileged communication]] that protects the contents of confidential communications between spouses during their marriage from [[Testimony|testimonial]] disclosure, while spousal testimonial privilege (also called spousal incompetency and spousal immunity) protects the individual holding the privilege from being called to testify in proceedings relating to his/her spouse.  However, the spousal privileges have their roots in the [[legal fiction]] that a husband and wife were [[coverture|one person]].

==Around the world==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], federal [[case law]] dictates the privileges' permissible and prohibited invocation in federal trials,&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Rules of Evidence]], Rule 501.&lt;/ref&gt; while state case law outlines their scope in state courts.

====Communications privilege====

A spousal communications privilege applies in civil and criminal cases.

Both the witness-spouse and the party-spouse hold the spousal communications privilege, so either may invoke it to prevent the witness-spouse from testifying about a confidential communication made during marriage.

The communications privilege begins on marriage, and can be invoked to protect confidential communications between now-married spouses that occurred prior to their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/Ethics/Confidentiality/OtherPrivilegedRelationships.asp "For the privilege to attach, the communication must have been made during a valid marriage."&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike testimonial privilege, the communications privilege survives the end of a marriage, and may be asserted by a spouse to protect confidential communications that were made during the marriage—even after divorce or death.

The spousal communications privilege may not be invoked if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; if one of the spouses has initiated a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses.  These three scenarios are identical to the limitations which also apply to limit the spousal testimonial privilege. Two further scenarios apply to defeat the attachment of the spousal communications privilege: if the confidential communication was made in order to plan or commit crime or fraud, or if a defendant-spouse wishes, in a criminal trial, to testify in their own defense, about a confidential marital communication.  In these five cases, a court will not allow either spouse to assert the privilege to block the testimony.

====Testimonial privilege====
A minority of states apply testimonial privilege in both criminal and civil cases.  For example, under [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §970, California permits the application of testimonial privilege to both civil and criminal cases, and includes both the privilege not to testify as well as the privilege not to be called as a witness by the party adverse to the interests of the spouse in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=18757911381+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve California Evidence Code §970]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[United States Code|U.S. federal]] [[common law]], the spousal testimonial privilege is held by the witness-spouse, not the party-spouse, and therefore does not prevent a spouse who wishes to testify from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] | url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/445/40/case.html | title=''Trammel v. United States'', 445 U.S. 40, 100 S. Ct. 906 (1980) | publisher=Justia | accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rationale of this rule is that if a witness-spouse desires to testify against the party-spouse, there is no marital harmony left to protect through the obstruction of such testimony.  This common law principle is the view in a minority of U.S. states.  A majority of U.S. jurisdictions, however, do not follow U.S. federal common law; in most states, the party-spouse, and not the witness-spouse, is the holder of spousal testimonial privilege.

Spousal testimonial privilege covers observations, such as the color of the clothing the party-spouse was wearing on a certain day, as well as communications, such as the content of a telephone conversation with the party-spouse.

The witness-spouse may invoke testimonial privilege regarding events which occurred (1) during the marriage, if the spouses are still married; and (2) prior to the marriage if he is married to his spouse in court proceedings at the time of trial.  If, by the time the trial occurs, the spouses are no longer married, the former spouse-witness may testify freely about any events which occurred prior to, after, or even during the marriage.  Spousal testimonial privilege, in other words, only lasts as long as the marriage does.

Spousal testimonial privilege may not be invoked if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; if one of the spouses has initiated a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses.

Both rules may be suspended depending on the jurisdiction in the case of divorce proceedings or [[child custody]] disputes, but are suspended in cases where one spouse is accused of a crime against the other spouse or the spouse's child. Courts generally do not permit an [[adverse party|adverse spouse]] to invoke either privilege during a [[trial (law)|trial]] initiated by the other spouse, or in the case of [[domestic abuse]]. The privileges may also be suspended where both spouses are joint participants in a crime, depending on the law of the jurisdiction.

===England and Wales===

==== Testimonial privilege ====
Spouses are, in general, both competent to give evidence in civil cases, and can be compelled to do so.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/13/9780199583607.pdf|title=Evidence: Text and Materials|last=Durston|first=Gregory|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=368&amp;ndash;370|chapter=Competence and Compellability|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was established in section 1 of the [[Evidence Amendment Act 1853]] and extended in the [[Evidence Further Amendment Act 1869]] to proceedings instituted in consequence of adultery, the position on compulsion being clarified in ''Tilley v Tilley'' (1949).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rSpousesandWitnesses.htm|title=Report on Competence and Compellability of Spouses as Witnesses|last=|first=|date=July 1985|website=|publisher=Law Reform Commission|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal cases, however, the [[common law]] long held that wives were not in general competent to give evidence against their husbands (i.e. for the prosecution). This derived from a view of husbands and wives as one person, which extended the defendant's protection against [[self-incrimination]] to their wife.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manchester|first=Colin|year=1979|title=Wives as Crown Witnesses|jstor=4506099|journal=Cambridge Law Journal|volume=37|pages=249&amp;ndash;251}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wife could however give evidence for the prosecution where her husband was accused of personal violence against her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Section 4(1) of the [[Criminal Evidence Act 1898]] made spouses competent witnesses in many more circumstances, including giving evidence for the defence. It was initially assumed that the Act also meant spouses could be ''compelled'' to give evidence, but the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] disagreed in ''Leach v R'' (1912).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Distinguishing ''Leach'', the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] held in ''R v Lapworth'' (1930) that spouses were nevertheless compellable witnesses for the prosecution in cases of personal violence, on the basis that the common law position prior to the 1898 Act had not been unaffected by its entry into law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in ''Hoskyn v Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' (1978) the House of Lords overruled ''Lapworth'', ending the personal violence exception in favour of spouses being competent but not compellable witnesses for the prosecution in all cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In reaching this view, judges were swayed by the special status of marriage, and the "natural repugnance" that the public would feel at seeing a wife give evidence against her husband in a wide range of scenarios.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This lasted only until the entry into force of section 80 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], which restored the ability of the prosecution to compel the testimony of the husband or wife of the accused (later amended to include civil partners) where the defendant has been charged with "assault on, or injury or a threat of injury to" the spouse or a person under 16, or a sexual offence toward a persons under 16.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, under the 1984 Act, the defence can almost always compel testimony,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  and as set out in section 53 of the [[Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999]], spouses will generally be competent to offer their testimony voluntarily.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/competence_and_compellability/|title=Competence and Compellability: Legal Guidance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, where the spouse or civil partner is an active co-defendant to the charges, they may only testify for the defence (and cannot be compelled to testify by either side).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; No privilege extends to couples who are neither married nor in a civil partnership,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; a source of major criticism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Communications privilege ====
The existence of a communications privilege in the common law is disputed. Its existence was assumed by late nineteenth century writers, but [[Wilfred Greene, 1st Baron Greene|Sir Wilfred Greene]] noted in ''Shenton v Tyler'' [1941] that having researched the subject he found no evidence to support this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=Donald|year=1959|title=Husband-Wife Privileged Communications Summarized|url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3524&amp;context=clevstlrev|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=8|pages=531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, any such privilege was the result of statute, and, in particular, section 3 of the Evidence Amendment Act 1853 which provided that "no husband shall be compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, and no wife shall be compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage". This provision was  based on the Second Report of the [[Commissioners on Common Law Procedure]], who referenced the "inviolability of domestic confidence".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was then repeated in section 1 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1898|chapter=36|act=Criminal Evidence Act 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served to confirm its applicability to the criminal law.

The provision made in the 1853 Act was both limited – it did not extend to third party disclosure or prevent voluntary disclosure – and asymmetric, as it did not stop the speaker from being compelled to disclosure any communications, only the listener.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, in its Report on Privilege in Civil Proceedings published in December 1967 the English Law Reform Committee recommended its abolition in civil cases, which was done in the [[Civil Evidence Act 1968]] and for criminal cases in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 1984 Act also repealed section 43(1) of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1965]] (evidence as to marital intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1984|chapter=60|act=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], both the common law privilege of confidentiality between married people and the privilege of spouses not to testify against each other were assumed to have continued with the "[[Reception statute|reception]]" of English law.&lt;ref name="PM - ABC - 30 Nov 2011 - High Court rules spouses have no right to privacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3380420.htm |title=High Court rules spouses have no right to privacy |last=Hall |first=Ashley |date=30 November 2011|work=[[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2011, the [[High Court of Australia]] decided that neither privilege existed in common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/high-court-rules-no-spousal-privilege/story-e6frfku0-1226210111473 |title=High Court rules no spousal privilege |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=[[news.com.au]] |accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AustLII - 30Nov2011 - Australian Crime Commission v Stoddart "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2011/47.html |title=''Australian Crime Commission v Stoddart'' (2011) HCA 47 (30 November 2011) |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=[[AustLII]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a form of spousal privilege in regards to criminal trials is preserved by the Evidence Acts.{{Citation needed|reason=The QLD Evidence Act for example explicitly abolishes spousal privilege|date=November 2018}}

'''Substantive rights''' are basic [[human rights]] possessed by people in an ordered [[society]] and include [[rights]] granted by [[natural law]] as well as the [[substantive law]]. Substantive rights involve a right to the substance of being human (life, liberty, happiness), rather than a right to a procedure to enforce that right, which is defined by [[procedural law]].

The '''Tarnovo Constitution''' ([[Bulgarian language|in Bulgarian]]: Търновска конституция) was the first [[constitution]] of [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. D.

It was adopted on 16 April 1879 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) by the Constituent [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]] held in [[Veliko Tarnovo]] as part of the establishment of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]].  It remained the fundamental law of Bulgaria after the country was [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|elevated to a kingdom]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=  |first=  |author-link= |year=1906 |editor-last=  |editor-first= |contribution= Конституция на българското княжество (законъ от 16 априлий 1879) |title=Сборник на действующите съдебни закони на княжеството (1878-1906) |volume=  |edition= |publisher= Официално издание на Министерството на Правосъдието  |publication-date=1906 |publication-place= София |pages=  |url= https://archive.org/stream/sborniknadiestv00pravgoog#page/n12/mode/2up=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Hertslet |first= Edward |author-link=Edward Hertslet |year=1891 |editor-last=  |editor-first= |contribution= Constitution of the Principality of Bulgaria |title= The Map of Europe by Treaty; which have taken place since the general peace of 1814.

[[File:BASA-173K-6-3116-Tarnovo Constitution.jpg|right|thumb|Front cover of the Tarnovo Constitution|250px]]
Based on the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian charter of 1831]],&lt;ref&gt;Evgeni Tanchev, Martin Belov, Cristian Ionescu ''et al.'', ''Constitutional Law of 2 EU Member States: Bulgaria and Romania'', p. I-8. Alphen aan den Rijn: Kluwer, 2008. {{ISBN|978-901-3056-35-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the constitution was bourgeois-liberal in character, and was considered advanced for its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bulgaria/History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It defined the function and competence of the central organs of state authority according to the principle of [[separation of powers]] among an [[executive (government)|executive]], a [[legislature|legislative]], and a [[judiciary]] branch. It provided for ministerial responsibility, immunity of the deputies, and inviolability of private property.  The constitution included a clause that formally established the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as the official religion of the nation, although people of other religions were considered equal to those who followed the official faith.

With amendments in 1893 and 1911 that strengthened royal power, the Tarnovo Constitution remained in use until 4 December 1947, when it was replaced by the [[Dimitrov Constitution]].

== Form of government and head of state ==
According to the constitution of 1879, [[Bulgaria]] was declared to be a constitutional, hereditary monarchy with a parliament whose members were elected by the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch bore the title of [[Prince]] and not [[tsar]], as it was during the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], since the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|treaty of Berlin from 1878]] restricted Bulgaria’s independence to a certain degree and made it a de facto vassal state of [[Turkey]]. The Prince was supposed to be male and of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religion,&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 38&lt;/ref&gt; although, in a legal act, an exception to the religious restriction was made when electing [[Alexander of Battenberg]] as the first Prince.

The Prince had the power to initiate a legislative campaign&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 9&lt;/ref&gt; and to coordinate the activities of the prime minister and the cabinet. Although the ministers were entitled to act as if they were representing the Prince, by signing with their own signature they agreed to take responsibility for what resulted from their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince’s signature was also required for a bill to become law after it had passed through parliament.

In 1908, when [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Prince Ferdinand Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] proclaimed the [[independence of Bulgaria]], he raised the country to a kingdom and assumed the title "tzar" (translated as [[king]] outside of Bulgaria).  The Tarnovo Constitution was amended to change the official name of the country to the "Kingdom of Bulgaria" and substituting the word "Prince" with "tzar" wherever it occurred throughout the document.

== General regulations regarding citizens and society ==

[[File:Bulgarian parliament building Veliko Tarnovo.jpg|right|thumb|The former palace of Ottoman general-governor of Tarnovo, where the constitution was adopted.]]
In accordance with its constitution, Bulgaria promulgated [[Equality before the law|equality]] for all its citizens&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 57&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite being a monarchy, prohibited the promotion of any kind of [[Nobility|aristocratic titles]].&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorship]] was prohibited, although the article which stated this was suspended several times.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;'''"Български хроники III", Стефан Цанев, 2008''' ("Bulgarian Chronicles III" by Stefan Tsanev). {{ISBN|978-954-528-861-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 61, which dealt with [[slavery]] and [[human trafficking]], was one of the reasons why the Tarnovo Constitution was considered to be liberal and ahead of its time:

{{centered pull quote|Nobody in the Principality of Bulgaria is permitted to buy or sell human beings. Each and every enslaved human being, regardless of his/her gender, faith or ethnicity is declared free at the moment he/she sets foot in our land.}}

The Constitution declared [[property rights]] to be sacrosanct&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 67&lt;/ref&gt; and implied that all citizens, except for the monarch and his successor, must pay [[Taxation|taxes]] to the state. All (male) citizens were obliged to serve in the military;&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 71&lt;/ref&gt; this requirement included the monarch (who was head of the military forces) and his successors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All citizens were allowed freedom of association, and were free to form political parties or start their own companies.

The Tarnovo Constitution prohibited punishment of a citizen whose case had not been examined by a court.&lt;ref&gt;Конституция на Княжество България от 1879 г. (Tarnovo Constitution), Article 73&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was ignored by the “People’s Tribunal” of 1945, during the [[Red army invasion of Bulgaria|Soviet occupation of the country]]. The tribunal did not hold the statute of а court yet passed on more than 10,000 sentences to people who were seen as a threat by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], which was coming to power at the time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;'''"Български хроники IV", Стефан Цанев, 2009''' ("Bulgarian Chronicles IV" by Stefan Tsanev)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temporary suspensions ==
The article prohibiting censorship was suspended in the 1880s by a law enforced by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] general [[Leonid Sobolev|Sobolev]]; this law restricted media to seven selected newspapers and magazines, and limited comments critical of the government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similar regulations were in effect in the late era of [[Stefan Stambolov]]'s government.

In 1881, the Grand National Assembly (the supreme form of parliament) was manipulated by the principal [[Alexander of Battenberg|Alexander I of Battenberg]] in order to suspend the entire constitution. During the next seven years, the monarch had unlimited power and issued a series of ordinances which were only technically approved by the ministers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This period, which Bulgarian historians refer to as a regime, ended in 1888 when the constitution was restored.

The Tarnovo Constitution was temporarily suspended several times more, most notably during the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1934|Coup d’état of 1934]] led by [[Kimon Georgiev]] and the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|Coup d’état of 1944]] organized by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

== Definitive abolishment ==
The [[Bulgarian republic referendum, 1946|Referendum of 1946]] led to the transition from a constitutional monarchy to a [[People’s Republic of Bulgaria|people’s republic]]. The referendum took place during the Soviet occupation of the country, was also technically illegal since the Tarnovo Constitution did not provide for a change in the type of government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Tarnovo Constitution was permanently abolished in 1947 when another one, bearing the name of the communist party’s leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]], came into effect. The [[Dimitrov Constitution]] was a thoroughly Communist document that allowed censorship and the establishment of a [[One-party state|one-party system]] while depriving citizens of certain [[Civil rights|fundamental rights]] including the right of private property.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26205">{{US taxation}}
Under the federal law of the United States of America, '''tax evasion''' or '''tax fraud''', is the purposeful illegal attempt of a taxpayer to evade assessment or payment of a tax imposed by Federal law. Conviction of tax evasion may result in fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 7201.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tax evasion]] is separate from "[[tax avoidance]]", which is the legal utilization of the tax regime to one's own advantage in order to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law. Tax evasion is illegal while tax avoidance is legal.

In ''[[Gregory v. Helvering]]'' the [[US Supreme Court]] concurred with Judge [[Learned Hand]]'s statement that: "Any one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes." However, the court also ruled there was a duty not to illegally distort the tax code so as to evade paying one's legally required tax burden.&lt;ref&gt;''Helvering v. Gregory'', 69 F.2d 809, 810 (2d Cir. 1934), ''aff'd'', 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The tax code, 26 United States Code section 7201, provides:

::Sec. 7201. Attempt to evade or defeat tax

::Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7201}}. For an individual, the $100,000 fine prescribed in this statute can be increased to a maximum of $250,000. See subsection (b), paragraph (3) of {{usc|18|3571}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove a violation of the statute, the prosecutor must show (1) the existence of a tax deficiency (an unpaid federal tax), (2) an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of either the assessment or payment of that tax, and (3) willfulness (connoting the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty).&lt;ref&gt;See generally Steven R. Toscher, J.D., Dennis L. Perez, J.D., Charles P. Rettig, J.D., LL.M. &amp; Edward M. Robbins, Jr., J.D., LL.M., ''Tax Crimes'', U.S. Income Portfolios, Vol. 636 (3rd ed. 2012), Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

A genuine, good faith belief that one is not violating the Federal tax law based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law is a defense to a charge of "willfulness", even though that belief is irrational or unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cheek v. United States]]'', 498 U.S. 192, 203 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Toscher, Dennis L. Perez, Charles P. Rettig &amp;  Edward M. Robbins, Jr., ''Tax Crimes'', Tax Management Portfolio, Volume 636, Bloomberg BNA (3d ed. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; A belief that the Federal income tax is invalid or unconstitutional is not a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law,&lt;ref&gt;See generally Dan M. Kahan, "Ignorance of Law ''Is'' An Excuse -- But Only for the Virtuous," 96 ''Michigan Law Review'' 127, 146 (Oct. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and is not a defense to a charge of "willfulness", even if that belief is genuine and is held in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Denniston, "Court widens use of ignorance plea in tax cases," ''Baltimore Sun'', Jan. 9, 1991, at [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-09/news/1991009114_1_taxpayer-criminal-tax-ignorance].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', 498 U.S. at 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) has identified small business and sole proprietorship employees as the largest contributors to the tax gap between what Americans owe in federal taxes and what the federal government receives. Small business and sole proprietorship employees contribute to the tax gap because  there are few ways for the government to know about skimming or non-reporting of income without mounting more significant investigations.

The willful failures to report tips, income from side-jobs, other cash receipts, and barter income items are examples of illegal cheating. Similarly, those persons who are self-employed (or who run small businesses) evade the assessment or payment of taxes if they intentionally fail to report income. One study suggested that the fact that [[sharing economy]] firms like [[Airbnb]], [[Lyft]], and [[Etsy]] do not file [[Form 1099-K|1099-K]] forms when participants earn less than $20,000 and have fewer than 200 transactions, results in significant unreported income.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/05/23/airbnb-others-pay-out-billions-beneath-irs-radar-study-finds/o57SNCizMzHSEjH0A1MNMM/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey found that the amount of unreported income for 2016 in the United States numbered at US $214.6 billion, with one in four Americans not reporting the money made on side-jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.finder.com/side-hustle |title=Side hustle and tax evasion: The telling statistics |last=McDermott |first=Jennifer |date=3 September 2017 |website=finder.com |access-date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical tax evader in the United States is a male under the age of 50 in the highest tax bracket and with a complicated return, and the most common means of tax evasion is overstatement of [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|charitable contributions]], particularly church donations.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Sabatini, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, "Tax Cheats Cost U.S. hundreds of billions," http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07084/772106-28.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign tax havens ===
{{Main|Tax haven}}
Jurisdictions which allow for limiting taxation, known as tax havens, may be used for both legally avoiding taxes and illegally evading taxes. In 2010, the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] was passed to better enforce taxation in foreign jurisdictions.

===Illegal income===
{{See also|Taxation of illegal income in the United States}}
U.S. citizens are required to report unlawful gains as income when filing annual tax returns (see e.g.,&amp;nbsp;''[[James v. United States (1961)|James v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;366 U.S. 213 (1961), "overruling" ''[[Commissioner v. Wilcox]]'', 327 U.S. 404 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;) although such income is typically not reported. Suspected lawbreakers, most famously [[Al Capone]], have been successfully prosecuted for tax evasion when there was insufficient evidence to try them for their non-tax related crimes. Reporting illegal income as earned legitimately may be illegal [[money laundering]].

In the United States, the IRS estimate of the 2001 tax gap was $345&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=154496,00.html |title=IRS Updates Tax Gap Estimates |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2006, the tax gap is estimated to be $450 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Gap for Tax Year 2006 Overview Jan. 6, 2012|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12overvw.pdf|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study estimates the 2008 tax gap in the range of $450 to $500 billion, and unreported income to be approximately $2&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cebula and Edgar Feige, "America's Underground Economy:  Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S" https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 18 to 19 percent of total reportable income is not properly reported to the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cebula and Edgar Feige "America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S" https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement ===

Beginning in 1963 and continuing every 3 years until 1988, the IRS analyzed 45,000 to 55,000 randomly selected households for a detailed audit as part of the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) in an attempt to measure unreported income and the "tax gap".&lt;ref name=Andreoni&amp;Erard1998&gt;James Andreoni &amp; Brian Erard &amp; Jonathan Feinstein, 1998. "[http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/Andreoni_etal_(JEL98).pdf Tax Compliance]," ''Journal of Economic Literature'', American Economic Association, vol. 36(2), pages 818-860, June&lt;/ref&gt; The program was discontinued in part due to its intrusiveness, but its estimates continued to be used as assumptions. In 2001, a modified random-sampling initiative called the National Research Program was used to sample 46,000 individual taxpayers and the IRS released updated estimates of the tax gap in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Slemrod, Joel. 2007. "[http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/Slemrod_%28JEP07%29.pdf Cheating Ourselves: The Economics of Tax Evasion." ''Journal of Economic Perspectives]'', 21(1): 25–48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out numerous problems with the tax gap measure.&lt;ref&gt;Toder, E. "What is the Tax Gap?" http://www.urban.org/publications/1001112.html&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS direct audit measures of noncompliance are augmented by indirect measurement methods, most prominently currency ratio models&lt;ref&gt;Feige, Edgar L. (ed.), 1989. ''The Underground Economies: Tax Evasion and Information Distortion''. Cambridge Books, Cambridge University Press, number 9780521262309.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the TCMP audits, the IRS focused on two groups of taxpayers: those with just a small change in the balance due, and those with a large (over $400) change in the balance due. Taxpayers were further partitioned into "nonbusiness" and "business" groups and each group was divided into five classes based on total positive income. Using line items from the auditor's checksheet, discriminant analysis, and a scoring mechanism, each return was awarded a score, known as a "Z-score". Higher Z-scores were associated by IRS personnel with a higher risk of tax evasion. However, the Discriminant Index Function (DIF) system did not provide examiners with specific problematic variables or reasons for the high score and so each filing had to be manually examined by an auditor.&lt;ref name="Nigrini"&gt;{{cite web| last = Nigrini| first = Mark| title = Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.| location = Hoboken, NJ| ISBN = 978-0-470-89046-2| date = June 2011| url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470890460.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigatory procedures ==
The IRS may carry out investigations to determine the correctness of any tax return and collect necessary income tax, including requiring the taxpayer to provide specific information such as books, records, and papers.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 7602.&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS whistleblower award program was created to assist the IRS in obtaining necessary information. While these investigations can lead to criminal prosecution, the IRS itself has no power to prosecute crimes. The IRS can only impose monetary penalties and require payment of proper tax due. The IRS performs audits on suspicion of noncompliance but has also historically performed randomly selected audits to [[#Estimates of lost government revenue|estimate total noncompliance]]; the former audits have much higher chance of noncompliance.&lt;ref name=Andreoni&amp;Erard1998/&gt;

===Net worth and cash expenditure methods of proof===
Under the net worth and cash expenditure methods of proof, the IRS performs year-by-year-by-year comparisons of net worth and cash expenditures to identify under reporting of net worth.  While the net worth method and the cash accrual method may be used separately, they are often used in conjunction with one another.  Under the net worth method, the IRS chooses a year to determine the taxpayer's opening net worth at year's end. This provides a snapshot of the taxpayer's net worth at a particular point in time.

The snapshot includes the taxpayer's cash on hand, bank accounts, brokerage (stocks and bonds), house, cars, beach house, jewelry, furs, and other similar items.  Generally the IRS learns about these items through very thorough and in-depth investigations, sometimes casing the suspected fraudulent taxpayer. In addition, the IRS also assesses the taxpayer's liabilities. Liabilities include expenses such as the taxpayer's mortgage, car loans, credit card debts, student loans, and personal loans. The opening net worth is the most critical point at which the IRS must assess the taxpayer's assets and liabilities. Otherwise, the net worth comparison will be inaccurate.

The IRS then evaluates new debts and liabilities accumulated in the next year, and assesses the taxpayer's new net worth at the next year's end. In addition, the IRS reviews the taxpayer's cash expenditures throughout the tax year. The IRS then compares the increase in net worth and the cash expenditures with the reported taxable income over time in order to determine the legitimacy of the taxpayer's reported income.

The net worth method was first used in the case of ''Capone v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;IRA L. SHAFIROFF, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE DESKBOOK  14-29 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  The cash method was approved in 1989 in ''United States v. Hogan''.&lt;ref&gt;886 F.2d 1497 (7th Cir. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank deposit cash expenditure method===
First approved by the Eighth Circuit in 1935 in ''Gleckman v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;80 F.2d 394 (8th Circ. 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; the bank deposit cash expenditure method identifies tax evasion through review of the taxpayer's bank deposits. This method of investigation primarily focuses on whether the taxpayer's total bank deposits throughout the year are equal to the taxpayer's reported income. This method is most appropriate when the majority of the taxpayer's income is deposited in the bank and most expenses are paid by check.&lt;ref&gt;D. LARRY CRUMBLEY, LESTER E. HEITGER, G. STEVENSON SMITH, FORENSIC AND INVESTIGATIVE ACCOUNTING 6-19 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is most commonly used for surveillance of tipped employees and is combined with statistical analysis to determine what a tipped employees actual wages are. Information gathered through this method is most successful when the credibility of tipped employees can be destroyed. This method is used less frequently now for tipped employees because the IRS negotiates with hotels or casinos, the largest employers of tipped employees, to identify a tip estimate.  If the tipped employee reports the minimal amount agreed upon, he is not questioned by the IRS. However, it is recommended for corroborating other methods of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/irm/part9/irm_09-005-009.html#d0e1812 IRS]&lt;/ref&gt; Given the uncertainty of this method, this method likely could not be used in criminal prosecutions where the guilt must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.

===Whistleblower program===
In addition to the methods of proof the IRS has developed, the [[Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006]] created the [[Whistleblower Office|IRS Whistleblower Office]],&lt;ref name=Novack&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1214/investment-guide-10-ubs-irs-spondello-tax-informants-on-loose.html|title=Tax Informants Are On The Loose|first=Janet|last=Novack|author2=William P. Barrett |publisher=Forbes|date=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows anonymous [[whistle blower]]s to receive 15 to 30 percent of any recovery by the IRS which comes to at least $2 million including all penalties, interests and any other monies collected from the government. The whistle blower program seeks information based on evidence and analysis which can provide a solid basis for further investigation rather than speculation and hearsay.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/compliance/article/0,,id=180171,00.html  |title=Fraud |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is designed to provide incentive to ordinary citizens to inform on tax cheats. The program provides far greater incentives for whistle blowers than previous programs because under prior programs the government was not required to compensate whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scherzer |first=Lisa |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/taxes/article/102599/the-irs-will-pay-you-to-turn-in-tax-cheaters |title=IRS will pay you to turn in tax cheaters |publisher=Finance.yahoo.com |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this program, a taxpayer may file a lawsuit in court if he or she does not receive a deserved award.&lt;ref name="irs.gov" /&gt;

The '''Treaty of Limits''' was a 1906 [[treaty]] between [[Brazil]] and the [[Netherlands]] which established the [[international boundary]] between Brazil and the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]]. The treaty defined the border as being

&lt;blockquote&gt;formed from the French border [French Guiana] to the British border [British Guiana], the line of the watershed between the Amazon basin to the south, and the basins of the rivers flowing into north to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The treaty also established the possibility of designating a joint Brazilian–Dutch commission that would physically demarcate the border with markers if that was deemed necessary. The boundary defined by the treaty is still the recognized border between Brazil and now-independent Suriname. There are no [[border checkpoints]] along the border, and much of the border region consists of impenetrable [[rainforest]], but the boundary commission has set down 60 border markers along the Brazil–Suriname border.

The border described in the treaty was the result of a negotiation process between the Netherlands and Brazil and followed the establishment of the borders between Brazil and France ([[French Guiana]], to the west) and Brazil and the United Kingdom ([[British Guiana]], to the east. ) that were based on the same watershed. The latter borders were established after an [[arbitration]] process that was headed by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] of [[Italy]] and a decision of Switzerland, respectively. 

The treaty was signed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 5 May 1906. Brazil and the Netherlands both ratified the treaty in 1908.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">The '''undistributed profits tax''' was enacted in 1936 by the United States administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR), during the [[Great depression|Great Depression]]. The UP tax was a revenue program for FDR's [[New Deal]]. The act was  controversial even within FDR's [[United States Treasury Department]], as some economists such as [[Alfred G. Buehler]] thought that it would harm the ability of business to put capital towards company growth. In particular, Buehler reasoned that the UP tax would hit small business especially hard, as smaller businesses have fewer options in raising capital than large ones, usually by keeping a percentage of their profits for re-investment back into the business. The UP Tax was part of FDR's "[[Second New Deal]]".

The bill established the principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. The idea was to force businesses to distribute profits in dividend and wages, instead of saving or reinvesting them. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929 – 1945'', Oxford University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-19-503834-7}}, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative critics{{Who|date=August 2012}} of the New Deal considered this a burden on business growth.  Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax was reduced to 2½ percent in 1938 and completely eliminated in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Graham. ''Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002. pp. 386–287&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uniform Gifts to Minors Act''' ('''UGMA''') is an act in some [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]] that allows assets such as [[Security (finance)|securities]], where the donor has given up all possession and control, to be held in the custodian's name for the benefit of the minor without an attorney needing to set up a special [[Trust (law) USA|trust fund]]. This allows a minor in the United States to have property set aside for the minor's benefit and may achieve some income tax benefit for the child's parents. Once the child reaches the age of maturity (18 or 21 depending on the state), the assets become the property of the child and the child can use them for any purpose. Contributing money to an UGMA account on another person's behalf could be subject to [[gift tax]]; however, the [[Internal Revenue Code]] of the United States allows persons to give up to the annual gift tax exclusion to another person without any gift tax consequences, and gifts exceeding that amount as long as total gifts are below the lifetime limits.

In the majority of states that have adopted the [[Uniform Transfers to Minors Act]] (UTMA), the assets are treated similarly. The assets are held in the custodian's name until the child reaches age of maturity.  States that adopted UTMA also repealed UGMA; UTMA specifically provides that contracts in UTMA states which reference UGMA are governed by UTMA.  Thus, UGMA is often still referred to in contracts designed for use in multiple states, even though it may actually mean UTMA in a particular state. Under the UGMA or UTMA, the ownership of the funds works like it does with any other trust and the donor must appoint a custodian (the trustee) to look after the account for the benefit of the beneficiary.

Until 1986, a UGMA or UTMA account allowed the assets to be taxed at the minor's [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] bracket. Tax law changes in 1986, 2006 and 2007 known as the "kiddie tax" have substantially reduced the tax savings of UGMAs and UTMAs.  The current rule is that for beneficiaries under 19 (23 if a student), the first $1,000 of income is tax-free, the second $1,000 is taxed at the minor's rate (typically zero or 15%), and the amount over $2,000 is taxed at the parent's rate. Minors can also invest in the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merrilledge.com/college-savings/custodial&lt;/ref&gt;

One negative effect of UGMA or UTMA assets for minors who plan to attend college is that financial aid is typically reduced by 20-25% of the UGMA or UTMA balance.  Some financial advisers therefore advise depleting the balance in these accounts, always for purposes benefiting the minor such as summer camp, books, computer and similar expenses, well before the minor begins the process of applying to college.

[[File:Unisex pictogram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pictogram for a unisex toilet in [[Saint Paul (Minnesota)]] "Anyone can use this restroom, regardless of gender identity or expression".]]

'''Unisex public toilets''' (also called '''gender-inclusive''', '''gender-neutral''' or '''all-gender toilets''') are [[public toilet]]s that are not separated by [[gender]]. Unisex public toilets can be designed to benefit a range of people with or without special needs, for example [[Disability|people with disabilities]], the elderly, and anyone who needs the help of someone of another gender.  They are also valuable for parents wishing to accompany one or more of their children needing a toilet facility.

Unisex public toilets can be used by people of any gender or [[gender identity]], i.e. [[male]], [[female]], [[transgender]], [[intersex]]. Gender-neutral toilet facilities can benefit [[transgender]] populations and people outside of the [[gender binary]]. 

[[Sex segregation]] in public toilets, as opposed to unisex toilets, is the separation of [[public toilets]] into male and female. This separation is sometimes enforced by both city laws and building codes.  

Key differences between male and female public toilets in most western countries include the presence of [[urinals]] for men and boys and sanitary bins for the disposal of [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]] for women and older girls.

==Terminology==

Several alternative terms are in use for unisex public toilets: All-gender toilets, gender neutral toilets, gender free toilets or all-user toilets.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jen|first=Slater|last2=Jones|first2=Charlotte|date=2018|title=Around the Toilet: a research project report about what makes a safe and accessible toilet space|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/21258/|language=en|doi=10.7190/9781843874195}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all toilets which can (in theory) be used by anybody, regardless of [[gender identity]] or presentation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The term "all-gender toilets" highlight that these are toilets that can be used by people of any [[gender]]. 

The "Public Toilet Advocacy Toolkit" by the NGO Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human (PHLUSH) in Portland, Oregon (United States) from 2015 uses the term "all-gender". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toolkit.phlush.org/|title=Public Toilet Advocacy Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human (PHLUSH)|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, they have changed to the term "all user".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phlush.org/|title=PHLUSH website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the unisex toilets described here are "[[accessible toilets]]" which are also referred to as "disabled toilets". This term is generally used when talking about the larger toilet cubicle with handrails etc., which usually have a [[wheelchair]]-user sign on the outside door.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Types ===
Some unisex public toilets are designed to be used by [[Disability|people with disabilities]]. Many public toilets have either individual or [[gender-neutral]] facilities. They can accommodate people with disabilities, elderly persons who may require assistance from a carer of another gender, or other cases where public gender-segregated facilities might lead to discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Unisex public toilets are also common in cases where space is limited, such as in [[aircraft lavatory|aircraft lavatories]] and [[passenger train toilets]]. 

Several types can be distinguished:
* The single occupancy facility where only one single room or enclosure is provided. This room could be used by several people at once, e.g. a whole family, a carer helping a person needing help. 
* Multi-user facilities which are open to all and where users may either share sinks in an open area or each have their own sink in their private cubicle, stall or room.
* The re-labelling of existing multi-cubicle public toilets, with no real change. For example at the [[Barbican Centre]].

=== Toilets ===

Provided that more than one toilet is available in unisex restrooms, toilets are accommodated in enclosed cubicles as in sex-segregated toilets. To ensure visual privacy, these should be provided with floor-to-ceiling walls.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;Sanders, J., &amp; Stryker, S. (2016). Stalled: Gender-neutral public bathrooms. South Atlantic Quarterly, 115(4), 779-788 {{doi|10.1215/00382876-3656191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sinks ===

Sinks are either installed in open arrangement as in sex-segregated toilets and used collectively by people of all gender.&lt;ref&gt;Huesmann, M. (2016). Transgressing Gender Binarism in the Workplace? Including Transgender and Intersexuality Perspectives in Organizational Restroom Policies. In Sexual Orientation and Transgender Issues in Organizations (pp. 539-552). Springer, Cham {{doi|10.1007/978-3-319-29623-4_32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt; Alternatively, a sink is provided in each cubicle or toilet room, e.g. where the unisex toilet is set up to be used by families and carers.

=== Urinals ===

The issue of urinals is creating somewhat of a conundrum for many unisex restroom designers.  In many public toilets, the widespread use of urinals for males means that there are more opportunities to meet their needs. Since about 90% of public toilets are used for urination, there are often regular queues in front of female toilets with unused toilet cubicles in the male area.  While toilets are usually located in cubicles with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in rows in gender-separated toilet rooms. This construction leads to a smaller space consumption and thus to more possibilities for urinating, while promoting better hygiene and economic efficiency for men and boys.

Urinals have primarily been offered in male bathrooms, with [[female urinal]]s being only a niche product so far. Abolishing all urinals would superficially reduce inequality. However, this would also sacrifice the advantages of urinals and the convenience for male users while doing nothing to improve sanitation or wait time for females. Another possibility would be to offer separate male and female urinals or unisex urinals that can be used by males and females alike, which allows increased flexibility of use. However, this would raise the problem of arrangement.  One option would be to continue to offer urinals in rows, with separation by screens. However, it is questionable whether the less private sphere, compared to cubicle toilets, would be met with acceptance. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the open use of urinals by men/boys in front of women/girls would likely create awkwardness for both genders and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. There are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination.  An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cubicles or to continue to offer them only in male bathrooms. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of urinals. 

Urinals arranged in cubicles often could not prevail in previous concepts; the advantages over conventional toilets were not obvious due to the unreduced space requirement. With all things considered, many unisex restroom designers are now creating plans in which urinals would be constructed in an isolated section or corner of the restroom so that they would not be directly visible to anyone in other areas of the restroom.  This is seen by many as the best possible solution that would balance efficiency with modesty.

==Advantages  ==

=== Better use of available space ===

Especially where space is limited, the double design of the sanitary facilities is not possible or only possible to a limited extent. Unisex toilets are often used in many public transport systems, such as rail vehicles or airplanes.

Women/girls often spend more time in [[Toilet (room)|toilet rooms]] than men/boys, both for physiological and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="Plaskow"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plaskow |first=Judith |date=8 July 2008 |title=Embodiment, Elimination, and the Role of Toilets in Struggles for Social Justice |journal=Cross Currents |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=51–64 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-3881.2008.00004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to use a cubicle rather than a urinal means that urination takes longer&lt;ref name="Plaskow"/&gt; and sanitation is a far greater issue, often requiring more thorough hand washing. Females also make more visits to washrooms. [[Urinary tract infection]]s and [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]] are more common in females.&lt;ref name="Plaskow"/&gt; [[Pregnancy]], [[menstruation]], [[breastfeeding]], and [[diaper]]-changing increase usage.&lt;ref name="Plaskow"/&gt;  The elderly, who are disproportionately female, take longer and more frequent toilet visits.&lt;ref name="ramster"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramster |first1=G. |last2=Greed |first2=C. |last3=Bichard |first3=J.

=== Avoiding social exclusion ===

Public toilets and sanitation facilities in general need to cater for all people, including those part of the [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] community. This is an issue with respect to the [[human right to water and sanitation]] and also from the perspective of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6]], which aim for universal access to sanitation and gender equality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Benjamin, C, Hueso, A. (2017) [https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/resources/conference/40/Benjamin-2649.pdf LGBTI and sanitation: what we know and what the gaps are]. 40th WEDC International Conference, Loughborough, UK, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[genderqueer]] people and people of the [[third gender|third sex]], such as [[intersexuals]], [[butch lesbians]] or people with a non-binary transgender identity, it is difficult or even impossible to go to a gender-separated toilet, as they do not feel that they belong clearly to any sex.&lt;ref name="ramster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watkins"&gt;Watkins, P. J., &amp; Moreno, E. (2017). Bathrooms without Borders: Transgender Students Argue Separate is not Equal.

Parents of small children also face a dilemma if they want to accompany their small (opposite sex) child to the toilet.

Sex segregation of public toilets began gaining traction as a controversial issue for [[transgender|transgender identity]] in [[US politics]] in 2010. It has been argued that "walking into a toilet segregated by sex requires that each of us in effect self-segregate" and that some [[transgender]] people report being challenged on what public toilet they choose to use and subsequently "do their best to forego use of public toilets altogether".&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;

Many questions concerning exactly how social and legal enforcement of the division should take place has been the subject of many a debate. Transgender people often face harassment based on their choice in public toilets regardless of whether they use the [[Toilet (room)|toilet room]] corresponding to their [[gender identity]] or their [[sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]], which has led many [[transgender activism|activists in the transgender community]] to call for legal protection for people wishing to use restrooms which most accurately reflect their gender identity. Others have questioned the need for gender-based toilet segregation in the first place. In addition to transgender issues, those questioning the need for gendered bathrooms cite dilemmas caused by the need for [[caregiver|caretakers]] of dependents (who include [[children]], the [[old age|elderly]], and the mentally and physically [[Disability|disabled]]) to enter the toilet room used by their charge, regardless of which toilet rooms they may use themselves.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/tperae.pdf |title=Why Not Abolish the Laws of Urinary Segregation? |last=Case |first=Mary Anne |journal=Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing |date=2010 |access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/opinion/for-transgender-americans-legal-battles-over-restrooms.html |title=For Transgender Americans, Legal Battles Over Restrooms |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 July 2015 |access-date=2 April 2016|last1=Board |first1=The Editorial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancaster"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/bathroom-bill-transgender-rights-public-services-segregation/ |title=Imagining the Socialist Bathroom |last=Lancaster |first=Roger |publisher=Jacobin |access-date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have proposed laws which require transgender individuals to use public toilets corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. Some advocates of these laws claim that transgender people, or men claiming to be transgender, will be responsible for [[sexual assault]] in public toilets matching their gender identity.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article15120632.html |title=Moving forward: Transgender bathroom bill passes second Florida House committee |date=17 March 2015 |access-date=2 April 2016 |newspaper=The Miami Herald |first=Margie |last=Menzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate legislation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/03/10/texas-doubles-down-transphobic-legislation-adding-2000-fine-wrong-ba |title=Texas Doubles Down on Trans-phobic Legislation, Adding $2,000 Fine for 'Wrong' Bathroom Use |website=The Advocate |access-date=2 April 2016 |date=10 March 2015 |first=Sunnivie |last=Brydum}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, statistics on sexual assault in public toilets show no incidence of assaults where the perpetrator was a transgender person using a restroom corresponding to their gender identity,&lt;ref name="Mic sexual assault"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/114066/statistics-show-exactly-how-many-times-trans-people-have-attacked-you-in-bathrooms |title=Statistics Show Exactly How Many Times Trans People Have Attacked You In Restrooms |website=Mic |access-date=2 April 2016 |date=2 April 2015 |first=Marcie |last=Bianco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 70% of transgender people report facing harassment or assault while trying to use a restroom in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herman |first=Jody L. |date=June 2013 |title=Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and its Impact on Transgender People's Lives |url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf |journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy |access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, with increased exposure of the transgender community, there have been some initiatives calling for gender-neutral public toilets, instead of only male and female ones, to accommodate [[genderqueer]] individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing - Page 192, Laura Noren - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Political activists have drawn on the commonality between public toilets being segregated formerly by race and still by sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ganga|first1=Maria L|title=From Jim Crow to transgender ban: the bathroom as battleground for civil rights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/transgender-ban-bathrooms-north-carolina-civil-rights|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milhiser|first1=Ian|title=How The Religious Right Learned To Use Bathrooms As A Weapon Against Justice|url=https://thinkprogress.org/how-the-religious-right-learned-to-use-bathrooms-as-a-weapon-against-justice-fa8db0e7e949#.q2rwmiug5|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=Think Progress|date=6 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has become an increasingly contentious issue, as shown in the battles over North Carolina's [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] 2016.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages  ==
The consolidation of previously gender-separated toilets and the construction of new unisex toilets is sometimes accompanied on the one hand by administrative and building law difficulties, and on the other by some public moral concerns. 

=== Legal constraints ===
Building laws in some states require that toilets be physically separated for both sexes, making unisex toilets virtually illegal. In the USA, especially in large cities and at universities, unisex toilets have been increasingly put into operation since 2010.

===Comfort and safety===
In both developed and [[developing countries]], many of the organizations active in [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] provision have asserted in the past that separate toilets for boys and girls at school are very important to make girls feel comfortable and safe using the sanitation facilities at schools.  This concern could potentially apply to boys as well, especially if open urinals are maintained.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF (2012). [https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2521 Raising even more clean hands - Advancing health, learning and equity through WASH in schools].

[[WaterAid]] is researching options of appropriate unisex public toilets in developing countries. In 2017 they stated that those kinds of gender-neutral toilets, where people can access all toilets irrespective of their gender, is not recommended in contexts where it may increase the risk of [[violence against women]] or transgender people, or where it is deemed culturally inappropriate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washmatters.wateraid.org/blog/sanitation-and-gender-looking-beyond-the-binary|title=Sanitation and gender – looking beyond the binary|last1=Hueso|first1=Andrés|date=25 July 2017|website=WaterAid|access-date=18 May 2018|last2=Nath|first2=Priya}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many women, especially those who have been victims of sexual abuse in the past, have asserted the right to continue using all-female bathrooms to minimize the risk of any kind of sexual harassment in public restrooms. 

There is limited evidence that in [[Developing country|developing countries]], some activists favour ‘[[third gender]]’ public toilets which would only be used by transgender people. However, this is still being debated and may reinforce stigma and result in people being banned from accessing the toilets of the gender they identify with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In some African countries where transgender people are being prosecuted, this option would likely bring no benefit at all.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Criticism of unisex toilets==

{{refimprove|date=May 2018}}

The unisex toilets are met with opposition especially from the conservative side, for instance from the [[Christian right|Christian conservative]] [[Alliance Defending Freedom]].&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt; The sharing of toilets is presented as immoral and against prevailing habits.&lt;ref name="Alex Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, S. L. (2010). Queering bathrooms: Gender, sexuality, and the hygienic imagination. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is sometimes controversial and bears the hallmarks of [[moral panic]], especially in the USA.&lt;ref name="PacificStandard"/&gt; 

Aspects of [[cultural identity]] and the feared change in values play into the controversy: with the abolition of gender segregation in public toilets, a decay of morals and public order is called for.&lt;ref name="Alex Jones"/&gt; Similar discursive patterns are used as in the argument against the abolition of racial segregation in the USA in the 1950s, a warning is issued against the looming threats: violence and sexual assaults would increase.&lt;ref name="PacificStandard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel"&gt;"Restroom doors and drinking fountains: Perspective, mobility and the fluid grounds of race and gender" in: Abel, E. (2010). Signs of the times: the visual politics of Jim Crow. Univ of California Press. {{ISBN|0520261836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gillian"/&gt;  Also, while many transgender rights advocates see unisex restrooms as a positive step, others assert that they are not actively lobbying to change anything about how restrooms are traditionally designed.  In cases where schools have unisex bathrooms as an alternative to those separated for boys and girls, transgender rights advocates have asserted that transgender students should not be forced to use the unisex bathrooms if that is not what they prefer.

The concept of the unisex toilet became a political emotive word, particularly within the [[Alt Right]] and [[paleoconservatism]], whereby this pars pro toto stands for the abolition of gender boundaries, [[gender mainstreaming]] and [[liberalism]]. For instance, [[Alex Jones]] regards the unisex toilet as a major threat to public morality.&lt;ref name="Alex Jones"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHYp7p1SIg&amp;feature=youtu.be Germany to Introduce Gender-Neutral Urinals For Men &amp; Women] - The Alex Jones Show&lt;/ref&gt; Christian conservatives compare the introduction of unisex toilets with the abolition of [[bible]] reading in state schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/06/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-christians-lgbt-rights Transgender 'bathroom bill' leaves Texas Christians deeply divided] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele Bublies-Leifert, member of the [[Germany|German]] [[right-wing]] party [[Alternative for Germany|Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)]] regards the unisex toilet as a danger for German women and relates it to sexual assaults by ″criminal foreigners″.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stern.de/familie/leben/unisex-klo--eine-toilette-fuer-alle-geschlechter---wo-ist-da-eigentlich-das-problem--7318024.html Eine Toilette für alle Geschlechter – wo ist da eigentlich das Problem?] - Stern&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, there were escalations between users and opponents of unisex toilets: in [[Los Angeles]] in 2016 there were violent clashes between students and opponents of toilets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc7.com/news/students-protesters-fight-near-la-school-with-gender-neutral-bathroom/1299809/ ''Students, protesters fight outside LA school with gender-neutral bathroom''] In: ''abc7.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the newly installed unisex toilets at the German [[Bielefeld University]] have repeatedly been vandalized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tag24.de/nachrichten/bielefeld-uni-unisex-toilette-zerstoert-vandalismus-kaputt-klobrillen-muelleimer-559250 Täter zerstören wiederholt Unisex-Toiletten- Immer wieder wird "All Gender"-Toilette an Uni Bielefeld beschädigt] - Tag24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
=== China ===
Unisex toilets have appeared in China since before 2013 in Shenyang and Chengdu by 2015. However, it was not until November 19, 2016 that Shanghai China opened its first public unisex toilet near the Zhangjiabin River in a park, in the Pudong district. Many of these toilets have opened in high-traffic areas for the convenience of users as opposed to existing for the benefit of those in need of a gender neutral toilet, for example sexual minorities or those who are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/unisex-public-toilets-china-get-warm-reception/|title=China gives unisex loos warm reception|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016 a Beijing- based non-governmental organization launched an 'All Gender Toilets' campaign to bring awareness to this issue in China. This resulted around 30 locations opening unisex public toilets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.sina.com/china/s/2016-06-16/doc-ifxtfrrc3662829.shtml|title=30 Beijing locations embrace China NGO's unisex bathroom campaign|last=|first=|date=June 16, 2016|website=English Sina|access-date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

[[LGBT rights in Nepal]] have existed for a number of years but it wasn't until [[Sunil Babu Pant]] who was elected into Parliament, used part of the Parliamentarian Development Fund to build the first two gender neutral toilets in [[Nepalganj]], one of which is in Bageshwori Park.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kyle-knight/nepal-flushes-out-genderism_b_1464279.html|title=Nepal Flushes Out Genderism|last=Knight|first=Kyle|date=2012-05-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014 The Nepal Country Report, A Participatory Review and Analysis of the Legal and Social Environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Persons and Civil Society recommended that in schools separate toilets or gender neutral toilets should be built for transgender students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1861/Being_LGBT_in_Asia_Nepal_Country_Report.pdf|title=Being LGBT in Asia Nepal Country Report|last=|first=|date=2014|website=US Aid |access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Building laws in some states require that toilets be physically separated for both sexes, making unisex toilets virtually illegal. In the USA, especially in large cities and at universities, unisex toilets have been increasingly put into operation since 2010.

American public toilets are regulated by two federal agencies. The U.S. Department of Labor is in charge of workplace restrooms, which means setting state guidelines through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For non-work related restroom guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services governs regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/11/gender-neutral-bathrooms-building-codes|title=The Biggest Obstacle to Gender Neutral Bathrooms? Building Codes.|last=Brown|first=Elizabeth|date=11 April 2014|website=Reason|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex segregation can also be caused by building codes, as buildings from different eras are subject to different codes. In many situations, building owners do not update existing features because it allows them to continue following the older building codes that go along with those older features.These regulations are mostly based on the precedent created by original legislation, though they sometimes also work to eliminate the longer wait time females often face by creating a ratio of more female restrooms than male restrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/11/gender-neutral-bathrooms-building-codes|title=The Biggest Obstacle to Gender Neutral Bathrooms?

==== Laws restricting access ====
In May 2016, North Carolina and the U.S. Justice Department disagreed on the issue, resulting in the Justice department engaging in a civil rights lawsuit over North Carolina's '[[bathroom bill]]' in order to stop its implementation. This bill disallowed transgender people to use public toilets if the gender of the restroom does not match their birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/09/politics/north-carolina-hb2-justice-department-deadline/index.html|title=U.S., North Carolina file lawsuits over bathroom bill in transgender rights fight|last=CNN|first=Joe Sterling, Eliott C.

State legislatures in Arizona, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas have proposed anti-transgender bills that would restrict public toilet access.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Transgender Equality.

==Unisex toilets in educational institutions ==

=== Public schools ===

==== United States ====
Many colleges and universities (such as [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio) have had gender-neutral or all gender bathrooms as early as 2000. In February 2016, Michigan was the first state in the US to pass a bill that forces transgender children and teenagers in school to use sanitation facilities that correspond with their 'chromosomes and anatomy' at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-fight-over-transgender-rights-in-school-restrooms-intensifies/|title=The fight over transgender rights in school restrooms intensifies|last=Left|first=Lisa|date=22 February 2016|work=PBS|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 2017, the Trump administration ended federal protection for transgender students that had been published by the Obama administration in 2016.

==== United Kingdom ====
In 2015 Scotland aimed to create its first unisex toilet in Strathean Community Campus in Crieff, a secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=School gets unisex toilets - but for whose convenience?|last=Simpson|first=Jane|date=|work=Mail on Sunday|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Unisex toilets were set to be introduced into every new school to be built in Scotland in a campaign to eradicate bullying. All future primary and secondary schools will have non-segregated toilets. The Scottish Futures Trust which is in charge of Scotland's government's schools building program has already trialled this in one primary school and two secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Loo-sing the plot? Now all new schools will have unisex toilets|last=Blackley|first=Michael|date=21 June 2015|work=Mail on Sunday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 the Glasgow City Council announced that toilets in school will no longer be labeled as 'girls' and 'boys' but instead be labelled as unisex to help students who may be struggling with the issue of gender identity. This will be implemented in three schools first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/03/06/primary-schools-will-have-unisex-bathrooms-council-reveals/|title=No more separate boys' and girls' toilets at primary schools in Glasgow to help pupils who are 'confused about their gender'|last=Yorke|first=Harry|date=March 6, 2017|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College campuses ===
As of 2014, there has been a trend on college campuses in the US to open all-gender public toilets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/gender-neutral-bathrooms-colleges_n_5597362.html|title=Gender-Neutral Bathrooms Are Quietly Becoming The New Thing At Colleges|last=Bellware|first=Kim|date=2014-07-18|newspaper=Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some campuses are renaming their existing restrooms and toilets to do this. The motive is in part an effort to make students of any gender to use the restroom and feel safe. Activists also say they hope that anyone - not only gender-nonbinary people - can feel safe, raising the convenience it provides to disabled people to get assistance from someone with a differing gender. According to a [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] LGBTQ organization, The Stonewall Centre, there were more than 150 campuses in the US in 2014 with gender-neutral public toilets.&lt;ref name=Huffpost1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellware|first1=Kim|title=Gender-Neutral Bathrooms Are Quietly Becoming The New Thing At Colleges|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/gender-neutral-bathrooms-colleges_n_5597362.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=20 December 2014|language=|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the same organization comments on the need for gender neutral restrooms and the issue of safety. It says that certain people feel threatened using facilities that do not adhere to their gender identity, and this can become an issue when students are harassed by their peers. The organization states that this is more of an issue in restrooms that are designated for male use than those that are designated for female use.&lt;ref name=umass1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beemyn|first1=Genny|title=Gender-Neutral Restrooms|url=http://www.umass.edu/stonewall/uploads/listWidget/8749/bathroom%20FAQ.pdf|website=umass.edu|publisher=Stonewall Center, University of Massachusetts|accessdate=20 December 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research article by Olga Gershenson of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, restrooms have always been an issue for one group or another. First, women around the world petitioned for the right to their own facilities; next were racial minorities in the US during the time of segregation. After this fight, people with disabilities raised the issue to get fully equipped facilities. That fight ended with changes to building codes to make washroom more accessible. Now the issue concerns transgender and other [[gender variant]] people.&lt;ref name=OlgaGershenson&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Restroom Revolution: Unisex toilets and campus politics|encyclopedia=Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing|date=2010|last1=Gershenson|first1=Olga|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City|editor1-first=Harvey|editor1-last=Molotch|editor2-first=Laura|editor2-last=Norén|url=http://people.umass.edu/olga/MyArticles/Gershenson_Restroom-Revolution_chapter.pdf|isbn=978-0-8147-6120-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Oklahoma]] continually adds gender-neutral restrooms to their campus to accommodate students who may require use of a less excessively gendered bathroom. (Students that fit under this umbrella may identify as [[non-heterosexual]]). As of February 2014, the university had 13 unisex bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender-neutral restrooms create a safe place for all people|url = http://www.oudaily.com/news/gender-neutral-restrooms-create-a-safe-place-for-all-people/article_1f745ac4-937a-11e3-aad0-001a4bcf6878.html#.Uvvp1qzgslM.facebook|website = OUDaily.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the university has vowed to include a gender neutral bathroom in all new buildings to be constructed.

Forcing trans / non-binary students to use normative gendered restrooms can stigmatize them daily by singling them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/gender-neutral-bathrooms-colleges_n_5597362.html|title=Gender-Neutral Bathrooms Are Quietly Becoming The New Thing At Colleges|last=Bellware|first=Kim|date=18 July 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 150 college campuses across the US that are creating unisex public toilet or "gender-neutral restrooms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/stonewall/uploads/listWidget/8749/bathroom%20FAQ.pdf|title=Gender-Neutral Restrooms|website=University of Massachusetts Stonewall Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319005410/http://www.umass.edu/stonewall/uploads/listWidget/8749/bathroom%20FAQ.pdf|archive-date=19 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, [[New York City]] private college [[Cooper Union]] moved to remove gender designations from campus bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cooper.edu/about/bathroom-signage|title=RESTROOM SIGNAGE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/29/gender-bathrooms-cooper-union-college-new-york|title=New York college moves to strip gender markings from all bathrooms|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 March 2016|last1=Redden|first1=Molly|access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California Berkeley]] converted several restrooms into gender-neutral washrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/10/31/campus-moves-forward-on-gender-inclusive-restrooms/|title=Campus moves forward on gender-inclusive restrooms|last=|first=|date=2016-10-31|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, all-gender restrooms are sometimes found on university campuses. In early 2013, [[Brighton and Hove]] city council introduced unisex toilets, which did not feature the words 'men/gentlemen' or 'women/ladies' (as is traditional), but instead used 'universal symbols'. Other British universities including Bradford Union, Sussex and Manchester, have already or are in the process of building unisex facilities.&lt;ref name="cavanagh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cavanagh |first=Sheila |date=July–August 2011 |title=You are where you urinate |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/you-are-where-you-urinate/ |journal=The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=18 |issue=4 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy examples==
[[File:Gender neutral bathroom sign.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Some toilets use a combined [[gender symbol]] to indicate a gender-neutral or transgender-friendly bathroom.]]

=== Gender equality ===

Clara Greed, professor of inclusive urban planning at the [[University of the West of England]], related the gender segregation and the associated discrimination against women to the [[racial segregation]] at the time of the [[Jim Crow laws]] in the USA, which took place for similar argumentative reasons.&lt;ref name="Abel"/&gt; Referring to the principle of racial segregation: "Separate but equal", Senfronia Thompson, the Democratic Party's colored representative in the Texas House of Representatives, criticized the current situation:
{{quote|text=''„White. Colored. I was living through that era … bathrooms divided us then, and it divides us now. America has long recognized that separate but equal is not equal at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/05/22/discrimination-sunday-texas-rushes-to-pass-transgender-bathroom-bill-and-measure-allowing-bias-in-adoptions-foster-care/ ‘Discrimination Sunday’: Texas rushes to pass transgender ‘bathroom bill’ and measure allowing bias in adoptions, foster care] - The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;"'' - [[Senfronia Thompson]]}}

Steps to create bathroom equity are being pushed for. The issue of bathroom equity is thus pushed for by feminists in order to allocate a space that is more fair and equal for women.

Since the 1980s, "[[potty parity]]" activists campaigned for laws requiring more female-designated public toilets than male-designated public toilets in public buildings, based on the idea that women require more time to use the toilet and thus women's toilets tend to have longer lines.&lt;ref name="PHLUSH2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phlush.org/2016/08/31/social-inclusion-toilet-rights-and-legal-protection-for-transgender-americans/|title=Social inclusion, toilet rights, and legal protection for transgender Americans {{!}} PHLUSH|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/14/news/cl-12081|title=Is 'Potty Parity' Just a Pipe Dream?|last=HALL|first=CARLA|date=2001-01-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0119/p16s01-lihc.html|title="Potty parity" aims to remedy long lines|last=Bradley|first=Matt|date=2006-01-19|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; California passed the first law of this kind in 1987, and as of 2009 twenty states in the US have passed similar legislation.&lt;ref name="PHLUSH2" /&gt;

However, women are not only disadvantaged by the fact that no urinals are provided for them and thus the possibilities for urination are limited. A two-tier system is also indirectly generated via the "toilet apartheid" by excluding women from important networking processes in men's toilets.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Greene: [https://thoughtcatalog.com/jo-greene/2017/08/its-time-to-get-rid-of-gender-specific-toilets/ ''It’s Time To Get Rid Of Gender-Specific Toilets | Thought Catalog''] In: ''thoughtcatalog.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Anne Case, feminist and professor of law at the [[University of Chicago]], found out that important agreements and decisions are made at the urinal where women are previously excluded. Accordingly, she argues that: 
{{quote|text=''„Equality will never be achieved while sex-segregated restrooms persist!"&lt;ref name="PacificStandard"&gt;[https://psmag.com/magazine/how-social-bias-is-segregating-americas-bathrooms Kate Wheeling: Stalled Out: How Social Bias Is Segregating America's Bathrooms] - The Pacific Standard&lt;/ref&gt;'' - Mary Anne Case}}

===The Netherlands===
[[File:Zeikwijf campaign logo.jpg|thumb|upright|We support Zeikwijven!]]
In the [[Netherlands]] a protest movement has formed under the name of ''Zeikwijven'' ("the wild-peeing women"), which advocates urination equality and takes action against the discrimination of women through limited possibilities of micturition. The initiative was triggered after 23-year-old Geerte Piening was sentenced to a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] for urinating in public on the street. Her complaint was rejected on the judicial grounds that Piening should have used a street urinal common in the Netherlands. The objection that this was designed only for men was not accepted: "it may not be comfortable, but it is possible".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vendor.nl/vrouwen-plassen-gratis-vendor-washrooms-tijdens-urinoiractie-zeikwijf/ ''Vrouwen plassen gratis bij Vendor Washrooms tijdens urinoiractie #zeikwijf''] - ''vendor.nl''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/weinig-animo-onder-vrouwen-voor-actie-zeikwijf-toch-succes~af3acf49/ ''Weinig animo onder vrouwen voor Actie Zeikwijf, toch succes''] - ''ad.nl''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/protests-planned-amsterdam-urinals-women-toilets ''Protests planned at Amsterdam urinals over lack of women's toilets''] - ''theguardian.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/dutch-women-protest-lack-of-female-friendly-public-toilets/a-40655098 ''Dutch women protest lack of female-friendly public toilets''] - ''dw.com''&lt;/ref&gt; According to one campaign initiator, the problem is that:

As part of this campaign, women in the Netherlands began to urinate demonstratively in public urinals for men.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Meanwhile, the Dutch city authorities are planning to increasingly offer an unisex version of the Urilift street urinals, which are now available in Dutch city centres and can be used comfortably by men and women.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Canada===
In April 2014, the [[Vancouver Park Board]] decided to install all-gender restrooms in public buildings, with different signs to identify them. Amongst the options discussed was the rainbow triangle (based on the [[pink triangle]] used during [[the Holocaust]]), an 'all-inclusive' gender symbol, an icon representing a toilet or the phrases 'washroom' or 'gender-neutral washroom' placed on the entrances to the toilets. According to [[Global News]], a [[Canadian newspapers|Canadian online newspaper]], many different regions across Canada offer unisex toilets and other gender-neutral facilities, but Vancouver was the first municipality to change [[building codes]] to require unisex toilets be built in public buildings. This movement, according to commissioner Trevor Loke, was aimed to make everyone feel welcomed and included: "We think that the recommendation of universal washrooms is a good idea [...] [w]e will be using more inclusive language based on the BC Human Rights Code." Some initiatives to make washrooms more diverse and inclusive have focused on language simply by using the phrases 'washroom' or 'gender-neutral washroom' in order to be inclusive of all [[gender]]s and [[gender identities]], or using specifically geared language such as 'women and trans women' as opposed to just 'women' (and vice versa for men and trans men).&lt;ref name="GlobalNews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1298000/vancouver-park-board-votes-to-install-gender-neutral-washrooms/|title=Vancouver Park Board votes to install gender-neutral washrooms|last1=Judd|first1=Amy|website=globalnews.ca|publisher=[[Global News]]|language=|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalNews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1237581/vancouver-park-board-asking-for-input-on-universal-washrooms-and-signage/|title=Vancouver Park Board asking for input on universal washrooms and signage|last1=Judd|first1=Amy|website=globalnews.ca|publisher=Global News|language=|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private companies===
In March 2017 Yelp announced that they will add a gender neutral toilet finder feature on their app. Yelp was one of over 50 companies that signed a 'friend-of-the-court' amicus brief in favor of a transgender high school student [[Gavin Grimm]] who claims that his school board denied him access to the boys' bathroom in school and thereby violating Title IX. HRC President Chad Griffin stated on the brief that, "These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America’s leading businesses have their backs,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39154129|title=Yelp to help people find gender-neutral bathrooms|last=|first=|date=3 March 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/yelp-is-making-it-possible-to-find-businesses-with-gender-neutral-bathrooms/|title=Yelp is making it possible to find businesses with gender-neutral bathrooms|last=Dickey|first=Megan|date=3 March 2017|website=Techcrunch|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making public facilities accessible to diverse populations has long been an issue. Historically in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere public toilets have been segregated by race, class, religion, and gender, and have frequently been completely inaccessible to certain people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Molotch |editor1-first=Harvey |editor2-last=Noren |editor2-first=Laura |title=Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing |location=New York |publisher=NYU Press |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penner |first=Barbara |title=Bathroom |publisher=Reaktion Books |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender segregated public toilets in the United States and Europe are a vestige of the Victorian era where women's modesty and safety were considered at risk and under constant need of surveillance and discipline. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1739 the very first gender-segregated toilets were created specifically for a ball in a Parisian restaurant.&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; The organizers of the ball made a chamber box (a chamber pot in a box along with a seat) for men in one room and for women in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/54692-why-bathrooms-are-gender-segregated.html|title=The Weird History of Gender-Segregated Bathrooms|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public water closets were considered necessary for [[sanitation]] reasons, they were viewed as offending public sensibilities. Because public facilities were associated with access to public spaces, extending these rights to women was viewed as "immoral" and an "abomination".&lt;ref&gt;Greed, Clara. ''Inclusive Urban Design: Public Toilets''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Victorian era codes, women were delegated to the private sphere, away from the public, fulfilling their roles as dutiful wives and mothers where any association with sexuality or private body parts was taboo. For women, the female lavatory in a public space was associated with danger, unrespectability, and even immoral sexual conduct.&lt;ref name="Nirta" /&gt;

The decision to create separate toilets in the U.S. for males and females was a reflection of their shift and growth in society. As women entered the workforce and factories, they needed to have a place to relieve themselves. In the U.S., the very first regulation that enforced separate toilets for males and females passed in 1887 and was titled "An Act To Secure Proper Sanitary Provisions in Factories and Workshops."&lt;ref name="Kogan"/&gt; At this time, Massachusetts required establishments to have separate privies in businesses.

While some public facilities were available to women in London by 1890, there were much fewer than those available to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penner |first=Barbara |title=Bathroom |publisher=Reaktion Books |date=2013 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Suk |first=Jeannie |title=Who’s Afraid of Gender-Neutral Bathrooms? |work=The New Yorker |date=January 25, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/whos-afraid-of-same-sex-bathrooms |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118194804/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/whos-afraid-of-same-sex-bathrooms |archivedate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, concerns over public health and sanitation led to the sanitarian movement in which citizens rallied for better sanitary conditions and advocated for better public waterworks systems and plumbing.&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; Although sanitary reforms continued through the 1900s, it became a source of political debate.&lt;ref name="Nirta"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nirta |first=Caterina |date=2014-08-03 |title=Trans Subjectivity and the Spatial Monolingualism of Public Toilets |journal=Law and Critique |language=en |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=271–288 |doi=10.1007/s10978-014-9141-9 |issn=0957-8536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of sex segregated toilets in the 19th century ===
[[File:L-toilet4.png|thumb|right|Plan of public toilets in [[Charing Cross Road]], London, 1904. The men's facilities (left) comprise 12 cubicles and 13 urinals; whereas the women's facilities (right) comprise just 5 cubicles.]]
Sex-segregated toilets date back to the 18th century in Paris.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herman|first=Jody|date=June 2013|title=Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and Its Impact on Transgender People's Lives|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy|volume=19|issue=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122015434/http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A separation of the sexes in public toilets and public lavatories was rather unusual until the 19th century. Usually there was a room for both sexes. It was not until the [[Victorian era]], starting in [[Great Britain]], that gender segregation began in the toilet area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Kathryn H.|last2=Dufresne|first2=Meghan|date=2007-02-01|title=Potty Parity in Perspective: Gender and Family Issues in Planning and Designing Public Restrooms|url=http://jpl.sagepub.com/content/21/3/267|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=267–294|doi=10.1177/0885412206295846|issn=0885-4122|hdl=2142/11713}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barbara Penner, professor of architectural history at [[University College London]], this was an expression of the gender ideology of that era: 
{{quote|Prior to the modern industrial period, toilets were frequently communal and mixed. It was only in the nineteenth century, with increasingly strict prohibitions on bodily display and the emergence of a rigid ideology of gender, that visual privacy and the spatial segregation of the sexes were introduced into lavatory design, and they continue to be its dominant features. |Barbara Penner (2001): "A world of unmentionable suffering: Women's public conveniences in Victorian London"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penner |first=Barbara |year=2001 |title=A world of unmentionable suffering: Women's public conveniences in Victorian London |journal=Journal of Design History |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=35–51 |doi=10.1093/jdh/14.1.35 |pmid=20037960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

=== United States===
In 1887 the Massachusetts legislature introduced and enacted a law that mandated the separation of bathrooms by sex.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=729717|title=Toilet|last=Kogan|first=Terry|publisher=NYU Press|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Molotch|editor-first=Harvey |location= |pages=|chapter=7 Sex Separation}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there existed separate public toilets for males and females prior to 1887, this was the first law of its kind. The provision, titled “An Act To Secure Proper Sanitary Provisions In Factories and Workshops,” called for suitable and separate restrooms for females in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1887 Massachusetts became the first of the United States to pass legislation requiring any workplace with female employees to have a female-specific restroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Massachusetts (State). Legislature. General Court.'' 1887 Chap. 0183. An Act to Secure Proper Sanitary Provisions in Factories and Workshops.''

Legal scholar Terry S. Kogan lists four primary rationales for sex-segregated toilets as detailed by state statutes and related literature during this time period: sanitation, women's privacy, the protection of women's bodies, which were seen as weaker, and to protect social morality especially as it pertained to the nineteenth century ideology of [[separate spheres]].&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; 

The separation of bathrooms by sex in the United States was influenced by a number of factors. A combination of [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] morals and concerns over public health fueled the desire to create separate toilet facilities. These Victorian Era morals of the 19th century held women accountable for being virtuous and modest, as well as cast them into the role of homemakers, mothers, and wives. As a consequence, men and women were placed into separate spheres: the former occupied the public (such as the workplace), whereas the latter were assigned to the private sphere (the home).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Industrial Revolution, paired with the emergence of new technology and a booming economy, began to draw women out of the home and into the workplace– as a result, women began to enter the public sphere, a domain that was previously occupied by men. This was a cause for concern for Victorian regulators– they deemed the public dangerous and held the view that women, their morality, and their privacy were at stake by the “predatory” male; they pushed for separate toilet facilities for women in order to protect their reputation and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;More, Alex. “Coming Out of the Water Closet: The Case Against Sex Segregated Bathrooms.” ''Texas Journal of Women &amp; the Law'' 17.2 (2008): 297–315. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow period]], public washrooms were racially segregated in part to protect the morality and sensibilities of white women.&lt;ref name="gillian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Frank |first1=Gillian |title=The Anti-Trans Bathroom Nightmare Has Its Roots in Racial Segregation |work=Slate |date=November 10, 2015 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/11/10/anti_trans_bathroom_propaganda_has_roots_in_racial_segregation.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203084623/http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/11/10/anti_trans_bathroom_propaganda_has_roots_in_racial_segregation.html |archivedate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Godfrey |first1=Phoebe |date=2003 |title=Bayonets, Brainwashing, and Bathrooms: The Discourse of Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Desegregation of Little Rock's Central High |journal=The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=42–67|doi=10.2307/40023302|jstor=40023302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, architectural isolation was imposed– through isolation and partitioning, blacks and whites were kept in separate spheres and allowed whites to hold the upper hand in society. Strategies to keep African Americans out of sight included the “basement solution;” by locating public toilets for coloured people in the basement next to janitor supply rooms, Jim Crow laws were able to maintain separation of the races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weyeneth |first=Robert R. |title=The Architecture of Racial Segregation: The Challenges of Preserving the Problematical Past. |journal=The Public Historian |volume=27 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=11–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence or absence of public toilets is a reflection of its society’s class inequalities and social hierarchies. For instance, the lack of public toilets for women reflects the exclusion of females from the public sphere. Until 1992, U.S. female senators had to use toilets located on different floor levels than the ones they were working on, a reflection of their intrusion in an all-male profession.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Plaskow, Judith. “EMBODIMENT, ELIMINATION, AND THE ROLE OF TOILETS IN STRUGGLES FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE.” ''CrossCurrents'' 58.1 (2008): 51–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Until a bathroom for them was built, their presence and admittance into this professional field was not welcome.

In contemporary times, there are gender neutral toilets in some public spaces in the United States. Despite this, transgender and non-conforming gendered people are still sometimes subject to visual and/or verbal scrutiny; this is reinforced by the architectural design and heteronormative gendered codes of conduct that are still present within the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Queering Bathrooms: Gender, Sexuality, And the Hygienic Imagination|last=Cavanagh|first=Sheila|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-4154-9|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasons for sex segregation ===
[[File:Restroom signs.jpg|thumb|Restroom signage for sex-segregated toilets]]
Legal scholar Terry S.

Kogan's argument that modern-day public toilet segregation emerged out of this Victorian model of gender has been cited in historical overviews of this topic by [[Time (magazine)|Time]],&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; [[Public Radio International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-05-12/why-1920s-legal-move-responsible-gender-segregated-bathrooms-we-have-today|title=Why a 1920s legal move is responsible for the gender-segregated bathrooms we have today|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/why-america-cant-stop-fighting-over-the-politics-of-public-restrooms/2016/04/01/16af2f94-f6b6-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33_story.html|title=How the bathroom became a political battleground for civil rights|last=Hesse|first=Monica|date=2016-04-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-04|last2=|first2=|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition towards segregation ===
The presence or absence of public toilets is a reflection of its society’s class inequalities and social hierarchies.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For instance, the lack of public toilets for women reflects the exclusion of females from the public sphere. Until 1992, U.S. female senators had to use restrooms located on different floor levels than the ones they were working on, a reflection of their intrusion in an all-male profession.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Plaskow, Judith. “EMBODIMENT, ELIMINATION, AND THE ROLE OF TOILETS IN STRUGGLES FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE.” ''CrossCurrents'' 58.1 (2008): 51–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Public toilet facilities in 19th and 20th century Europe and United States were strongly segregated by sex, race, class, and religion,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; but only sex segregation remained normative at the end of the 20th century. Though unisex public toilets have become more common worldwide in the early 21st century, such facilities have proven highly controversial.

All-gender restrooms are designed to ensure that restrooms are fully accessible to all members of society. While the issue of gender inclusive restrooms has been raised as an equity and human rights issue for people who identify outside of the [[gender binary]], eliminating gender segregation in bathrooms also benefits disabled populations who may have attendants of a different gender, parents with children, and anyone who may need additional assistance using public toilet facilities. All-Gender restrooms can eliminate discrimination and harassment for people who may be perceived to be in the "wrong" bathroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While opponents of unisex bathrooms have often referenced the fear of women and children being assaulted in bathrooms by trans women, there is no credible research to support this claim.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Instead, there is substantial evidence that demonstrates that transgender people and gender non-conforming people experience substantial and significant harassment in public toilets.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  One survey of transgender populations conducted in [[Washington, DC]], by the group ''DC Trans Coalition'', "found that 70 percent of survey respondents report experiencing verbal harassment, assault, and being denied access to public toilets."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also found that "54 percent of all respondents reported having some sort of physical problem from trying to avoid using public toilets, such as dehydration, kidney infections, and urinary tract infections" making access to safe restrooms a public health issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Penner, Barbara. ''Bathroom''. Reaktion Books, 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the practice of [[pay toilet]]s emerged, where public toilet stalls could only through accessed by paying a fee. Activist groups including The Committee to End Pay Toilets in America claimed that such practices disadvantaged women because men did not have to pay for urinals. As an act of protest against this phenomenon, in 1969 California Assemblywoman [[March Fong Eu]] destroyed a toilet on the steps of the California State Capitol.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phlush.org/2016/08/31/social-inclusion-toilet-rights-and-legal-protection-for-transgender-americans/|title=Social inclusion, toilet rights, and legal protection for transgender Americans {{!}} PHLUSH|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''''Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General''''' was a 2013 decision of the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] of [[Singapore]] which held that Article 49(1) of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] requires the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] to call a [[by-elections in Singapore|by-election]] when a [[casual vacancy]] arises in a [[parliamentary elections in Singapore#Composition and term of Parliament|Single Member Constituency]] ("SMC"), though the election need only be called within a reasonable time.

The holding was an ''[[obiter dictum]]'', that is, not required for the decision in the case and therefore not a [[precedent#Binding precedent|binding precedent]], though it may be [[precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive]] in future cases. This was because the Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appellant, Madam Vellama, lacked [[standing (law)|standing]]. She had originally applied for [[judicial review]] in 2012 to ask the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] to order the Prime Minister to call a by-election in [[Hougang Single Member Constituency]] following the expulsion of her Member of Parliament (MP) by his political party, the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]]. However, by the time the matter came on appeal, the [[Singaporean by-election, 2012|2012 by-election]] had been called and held. Therefore, she was arguably no longer directly affected by the lack of an MP in her constituency. Her only remaining interest was in having the Prime Minister correctly interpret Article 49(1) of the Constitution. This was a public right that she shared equally with all other [[Singaporean nationality law|citizens]]. Since she was unable to prove "special damage"&amp;nbsp;– she was neither affected to a greater extent nor in a different manner from other citizens&amp;nbsp;– she did not have standing to proceed with the appeal.

Although the Court of Appeal rejected Vellama's appeal on the preliminary ground of a lack of standing, it went on to consider the substantive issues raised. Disagreeing with the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal interpreted Article 49(1) of the Constitution as providing that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether or not to call a by-election when a casual vacancy in an SMC arises. Noting the absence in Article 49(1) of a specific time frame within which a parliamentary vacancy must be filled, the Court held that the Prime Minister must do so with "all convenient speed" in line with the [[common law]] concept of [[reasonable time]]. However, given the [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] nature of the decision, the Court felt it was undesirable to lay down specific considerations or factors which would determine whether the Prime Minister had or had not called a by-election in reasonable time.

==Facts==

During a [[Parliament of Singapore|parliamentary]] debate on 27 August 2008, the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Hsien Loong]], asserted that since [[Singapore]]'s [[parliamentary elections in Singapore|system of elections]] focuses on political parties rather than on individual candidates, in the event of a parliamentary seat falling [[casual vacancy|vacant]] in the middle of a term, the Prime Minister retains "full discretion as to when and whether to call a by-election as the vacancy does not affect the mandate of the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Lee Hsien Loong|mplink=Lee Hsien Loong|office=[[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]]|title=Parliamentary Elections|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00002617-WA|date=27 August 2008|volume=84|columns=3397–3399}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaw Shin Leong]], a member of the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]], was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Hougang Single Member Constituency]] (SMC) at the [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 general election]].

The abbreviation ''d/o'' means "daughter of".&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred the applicant, Madam Vellama d/o (daughter of) Marie Muthu, a voter resident in Hougang SMC, to commence [[judicial review]] proceedings in the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] on 2 March 2012 to compel the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] to call a [[by-elections in Singapore|by-election]]. She sought a [[remedies in Singapore constitutional law#Declarations|declaration]] as to the proper construction of Article 49(1) of the Constitution and a [[remedies in Singapore constitutional law#Mandatory orders|mandatory order]] requiring the Prime Minister to advise the [[President of Singapore|President]] to issue a [[writ of election]] for Hougang SMC within three months from the date of the vacancy, or such other reasonable period as the Court deemed fit.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 705, para. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after Vellama's application, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] announced in Parliament that he intended to call a by-election in Hougang SMC but had yet to decide on its timing. On 2 April 2012, the High Court granted Vellama leave to apply for judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v.

Vellama subsequently abandoned her application for the mandatory order but proceeded with her application for the declaration in the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 706, para. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2012, the High Court dismissed her application. Dissatisfied, she appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] which dismissed her appeal on 5 July 2013. However, in an ''[[obiter dictum]]'', the Court of Appeal agreed with her interpretation of Article 49(1) of the Constitution rather than the Prime Minister's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v.

==Decisions of the High Court==

===Preliminary issue===
Before a person can apply to the High Court for a prerogative order such as a mandatory order, he or she must be granted leave to do so by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Rules of Court|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=51275724-5b10-409d-8b9f-919c35b327c3;page=0;query=DocId%3A9c08961a-718d-4fe6-b2e0-df0963d62b05%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0|cap=322|sltype=R|no=5|ed=2014}}, O.&amp;nbsp;53, r. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for leave is a preliminary step that helps to sieve out "groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage" and "prevent a wasteful use of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment".&lt;ref&gt;''Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda'' [2001] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 133 at 142, para.&amp;nbsp;23, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore); see also ''Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts'' [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 627 at 635–636, para.&amp;nbsp;21, H.C. (Singapore) ("the applicant must show ''[[prima facie]]'' that the application is not frivolous or vexatious and that there is some substance in the grounds supporting the application").&lt;/ref&gt; Leave will be granted if the Court is satisfied of the following:&lt;ref name="Vellama 10"&gt;''Vellama'' (leave), p. 1036, para. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The matter complained of is susceptible to judicial review.
*The applicant has sufficient interest or [[standing (law)|standing]] in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts'' [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 627 at 631, para.&amp;nbsp;8, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The evidence shows a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of reasonable suspicion that the Government has acted unlawfully.

However, as prerogative orders are discretionary remedies, the Court retains discretion to refuse leave if the circumstances warrant it.&lt;ref name="Vellama 10"/&gt;

Justice Philip Pillai found that on the facts the first two limbs of the test were obviously satisfied as it was undisputed that "the matter relates to the performance of powers and duties which involve a public element" and that "the applicant has sufficient interest in the matter".&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (leave), p. 1036, para. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the third requirement, the judge held that it posed a very low threshold for leave. Consequently, based on the material before the court, it had been satisfied. He therefore granted leave for the merits of the case to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (leave), p. 1039, para. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive issue: interpretation of Article 49(1)===
In the subsequent High Court hearing where the substantive issues were heard, Justice Pillai held that Article 49(1) of the Constitution does not mandate that the Prime Minister call a by-election to fill a casual vacancy arising in an SMC.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 207, para. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Article states:

{{quote|'''Filling of vacancies'''

'''49'''.— (1) Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, the vacancy shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to Parliamentary elections for the time being in force.}}

The judge was persuaded that the expression ''shall be filled by election'' in the Article referred to a process and not an event.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 207, para. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He approached the interpretation of the Article on three modes of analysis&amp;nbsp;– textual, contextual and historical. The High Court's textual analysis considered Article 66 of the Constitution which provides for [[parliamentary elections in Singapore|general elections]] to be held three months after the dissolution of Parliament. Article 66 states that "[t]here shall be a general election", whereas Article 49(1) merely states that a vacancy "shall be filled by election". In Justice Pillai's view, the absence of the word ''an'' before the word ''election'' in Article 49(1) suggested that the Article was merely stating the process by which a parliamentary vacancy should be filled and not an event that must be held, unlike Article 66.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 182, para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge's contextual approach afforded more weight to his reasoning that Article 49(1) provides for the process for the filling of vacant seats for elected MPs. In his opinion, the placement of Article 49 in Part VI of the Constitution is significant,&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 183, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; as that Part "prescribes different rules for different types of Members, and [similarly] different processes for filling each type of Member vacancies".&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 191, para. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Pillai's historical consideration of Article 49 centred on section 51 of the Singapore Colony [[Order in Council]] 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Colony Order in Council 1955 ([[Statutory Instrument]] (S.I.) 1955 No. 187, UK), made on 1 February 1955 and in force on 8 February 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; which he noted was the original source of Article 49(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 198, para. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 51(1) of the 1955 Order in Council specified that a vacated seat of a Nominated Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] "shall be filled by appointment by the [[list of Governors of Singapore|Governor]]". Section 51(2) stipulated that the vacated seat of an Elected Member of the Assembly "shall be filled by election". In the judge's opinion, there was no ambiguity in the meaning of the expression ''shall be filled by election'' in section 51(2) because section 51 was clearly referring to the process of filling a seat and not an event. The judge opined that subsequent constitutional provisions originating from section 51(2) of the 1955 Order in Council that contained the same expression must have the same meaning unless the text was intentionally changed. Accordingly, the High Court dismissed Madam Vellama's application.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (H.C.), p. 199, para. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision of the Court of Appeal==

===Preliminary issue: standing===
Vellama appealed the High Court's decision to the Court of Appeal. Before the High Court, Vellama's standing to bring the suit was not disputed. However, during the Court of Appeal hearing, the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] contended that she no longer possessed standing as the by-election in Hougang SMC had been held. Accordingly, the Court had to consider whether standing should be regarded as having crystallized at the point the proceedings were initiated, or treated as an ongoing issue to be determined at every stage of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 8, paras. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whether standing is open to review====
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Judge of Appeal [[Chao Hick Tin]]. The Court cited the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Inland Revenue Commissioners v. National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Limited'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Inland Revenue Commissioners v. National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Limited|court=UKHL|year=1981|num=2|parallelcite=[1982] A.C. 617|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the judges unanimously decided that the lower court's decision on standing was open to review on appeal. This conclusion was justified as the court at the leave stage might not have the full evidence to make a conclusive determination of the applicant's standing.&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 645.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposition in the ''National Federation'' case has been endorsed in subsequent United Kingdom cases.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Co.'' [1990] 1 Q.B. 504 at 519–520, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[High Court of Justice#Queen's Bench Division|Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales); ''R. v. International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Ltd., ex parte Else (1982) Ltd.'' [1993] Q.B. 534 at 551, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of such "overwhelming authority", the Court held that the issue of Vellama's standing was not limited to a preliminary determination at the initiation of proceedings, but was subject to review until the Court had arrived at a final determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 9, para. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whether Vellama continued to have standing====
The Court of Appeal proceeded to consider whether Vellama still retained standing given that the Hougang by-election had already been held&amp;nbsp;— a pertinent change in circumstances that affected the very basis of her application.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 9, para. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United Kingdom position=====
The Court discussed the position under [[English law]] extensively. Legislative amendments made in 1977&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;[[Rules of the Supreme Court]] (Amendment No. 3) 1977 (S.I. 1977 No. 1955, UK).&lt;/ref&gt; established a single test for standing applicable to all remedies which only required an applicant to have a "sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates".&lt;ref name="SCA"&gt;Now see the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/contents c. 54], UK), s.&amp;nbsp;31(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[Courts of England and Wales]] have wide scope to grant leave for judicial review to be brought where there is a public interest element in the proceedings, even though the applicant may not be personally affected.&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'' p. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Singapore has not adopted the 1977 UK legislative changes, the Singapore Court of Appeal noted that English cases based on this law were "nevertheless instructive" in determining an applicant's standing after changed circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 10, para. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court then considered a line of English cases where the application was dismissed for a lack of standing. In ''R. v. Legal Aid Board, ex parte Hardiman'',&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Legal Aid Board, ex parte Hardiman'' (CO/3193/95).&lt;/ref&gt; an application was dismissed after leave was granted due to a change of factual circumstances. The Court held that the principal relief sought would have been "entirely a purposeless exercise" for the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Hardiman'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in ''R. v. Head Teacher of Fairfield Primary School, ex parte W'', the action was denied as there would be "no practical benefit" to the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Head Teacher of Fairfield Primary School ex parte W'' (CO/541/97).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, there are some English cases where the application was allowed to proceed despite a change in circumstances. In ''Gibson v. Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers'' (1968),&lt;ref&gt;''Gibson v. Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers'' [1968] 1 W.L.R. 1187, H.C. ([[High Court of Justice#Chancery Division|Chancery]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court of England and Wales]] allowed the action to proceed as there remained "a good ground of complaint, not of an academic character but involving substantial legal issues".&lt;ref&gt;''Gibson'', p. 1189.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the court in ''R. (Giles) v. Parole Board'' (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Giles) v. Parole Board|court=UKHL|year=2003|num=42|parallelcite=[2004] A.C. 1|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that even though the proceedings was entirely without any practical significance for the applicant, he had raised a matter of public importance which affected the liberty of other persons. Even though the application was "strictly moot", the House of Lords held that the application was "rightly held to raise an important point of principle".&lt;ref&gt;''Giles'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, when an application no longer has any practical significance to the applicant after an important change in circumstances, English courts are generally reluctant to find that the applicant continues to have standing. However, an exception to this is when there are compelling issues of public interest so much so that "a large number of similar cases exist or are anticipated and will need to be solved in the near future".&lt;ref name="Salem 457"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem|court=UKHL|year=1999|num=8|parallelcite=[1999] A.C. 450 at 457|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore position=====
The leading local authority on the requirements for standing is ''Karaha Bodas Co. L.L.C. v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd.'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Karaha Bodas Co. L.L.C. v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd.|court=SGCA|year=2005|num=47|parallelcite=[2006] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 112|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was a [[private law]] case, in ''Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2012|num=45|parallelcite=[2012] 4 S.L.R. 476|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal applied the ''Karaha Bodas'' test to a constitutional judicial review case. Three basic propositions were distilled:&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Eng Hong'', p. 511, para. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The applicant must have a "real interest" in bringing the action.
*There must be a "real controversy" between the parties to an action for the court to resolve.
*The declaration must relate to a right which is personal to the applicant and which is enforceable against an adverse party to the litigation.

In ''Tan Eng Hong'', the Court had generally affirmed the English position. In cases where a declaration will be "of value to the parties or to the public", a court may still continue to hear the case even though "the facts on which the action is based are theoretical".&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Eng Hong'', p. 531, para. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In so holding, the Court seemed to suggest that the first two limbs of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test would be concurrently satisfied since "it can be logically said that where there is a real legal interest in a case being heard, there is a real controversy to be determined".&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Eng Hong'', p. 530, para. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tan Eng Hong'' appeared to stand for the proposition that only the first and second limbs of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test are required, notwithstanding the lack of a violation of a personal right. However, in ''Vellama'' the Court of Appeal qualified the proposition and cautioned that ''Tan Eng Hong'' must be viewed in its proper context. The applicant in ''Tan Eng Hong'' was originally charged under [[section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|section 377A]] of the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the charge was dropped and substituted with one for a lesser offence, which he pleaded guilty to. Although this arguably rendered his challenge to the constitutionality of section 377A theoretical, the application was still of "great practical significance" to him. Given the applicant's sexual orientation, so long as the constitutionality of section 377A was not decisively settled, a similar act committed by him could possibly attract prosecution. Therefore, the applicant's personal rights were affected. Thus, there was no contradiction between the adoption of the English position and the third requirement of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test in ''Tan Eng Hong''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), pp. 13–14, para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Private v. public rights=====
In ''Vellama'', the Court of Appeal then considered the nature of the right allegedly violated in the third requirement of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test. Although private citizens can bring actions to defend both private and public rights, the test for standing changes depending on the nature of the right contended.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), pp. 14–15, para. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tan Eng Hong'' had approved the decision of the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Supreme Court of Malaysia]] in ''Government of Malaysia v. Lim Kit Siang'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;''Government of Malaysia v. Lim Kit Siang'' [1988] 2 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 12, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Supreme Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguished between a private and public right.&lt;ref&gt;''Lim Kit Siang'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; A public right is one held and vindicated by public authorities, while a private right is one which is held and vindicated by a private individual.&lt;ref name="Tan Eng Hong 69"&gt;''Tan Eng Hong'', p. 510, para. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Court of Appeal endorsed the reasoning in ''Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council'' (1902)&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;''Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council'' [1903] 1 Ch. 109, H.C. (Ch.) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; which explained the applicable test for standing regarding public rights. Since public rights are shared by everyone in common because they arise from public duties owed by public authorities to the general class of persons as a whole, an applicant must prove "special damage" peculiar to himself or herself to distinguish his or her claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class.&lt;ref&gt;''Boyce'', p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court justified the need for special damage in cases involving public rights to prevent frivolous or vexatious actions. Otherwise, courts will be swamped by an array of actions raised by "mere busybodies and social gadflies, to the detriment of good public administration" where the burden of bearing costs may not be a sufficient deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 16, para. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaning of "special damage"=====
As ''Tan Eng Hong'' involved a case of private rights, there was little elaboration on the principles on standing regarding public rights. Thus, in ''Vellama'' the Court of Appeal took the opportunity to explain the applicable principles regarding the need to prove "special damage" for applicants asserting a violation of public rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 16, para. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court noted that there is "no categorical answer" as to what constitutes special damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 19, para. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court considered the view of Peter Cane, an English academic, who had argued that special damage was either damage to the common interests to all members of the public but suffered to a greater degree by the applicant, or damage qualitatively different from that suffered by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Cane|title=The Function of Standing Rules in Administrative Law|journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]|year=1980|pages=303–328 at 313–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also agreed with the [[High Court of Australia]]'s decision in ''Australia Conservation Foundation Inc. v. Commonwealth'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Australia Conservation Foundation Inc. v. Commonwealth|court=HCA|year=1980|num=53|parallelcite=(1980) 146 C.L.R. 493|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which equated the special damage criterion to a requirement for "special interest" in the subject matter of the action.&lt;ref name="ACF 527"&gt;''Australia Conservation Foundation'', p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; However, special interest cannot be a "mere intellectual or emotional concern". If the applicant's action succeeds, he or she must gain some advantage "other than the satisfaction of righting a wrong, upholding a principle or winning a contest". If the application fails, he or she must suffer some disadvantage "other than a sense of grievance or a debt for costs".&lt;ref&gt;''Australia Conservation Foundation'', pp. 530–531.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, upon a review of the pre-1977 English and present-day Australian case law, the Court of Appeal concluded that special damage is not limited to actual pecuniary loss, and it is not required that the applicant alone has suffered damage.&lt;ref name="ACF 527"/&gt; An applicant asserting a violation of a public right must show that his "personal interests are directly and practically affected over and above the general class of persons who hold that right". The Court declined to offer more specific guidelines as the special damage requirement is necessarily fact sensitive, dependent on individual cases.&lt;ref name="Vellama 43"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 20, para. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Application to the facts=====
The Court of Appeal held that the first and second limbs of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test were satisfied. Although the Hougang by-election had been held, rendering the basis for Vellama's application factually moot, there were a real interest and real controversy at hand. The public undoubtedly had an interest in the outcome of the case as "casual vacancies can arise from time to time whereupon the issue will become real".&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 14, para. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the third requirement of the ''Karaha Bodas'' test, the Court did not expressly decide whether a private right was involved as the Attorney-General did not raise this issue. Even though Vellama first brought the action as a voter who had been directly affected by being resident in an unrepresented constituency, the Court noted that there was "considerable doubt" whether a private right had been violated as the Prime Minister had expressed an intention to call a by-election.&lt;ref name="Vellama 37"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 18, para. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the by-election was held, Vellama's basis for bringing the action was rendered factually moot. Thus, she could only claim a public right, rendering her "no different from any other citizen interested in the proper construction of Art 49".&lt;ref name="Vellama 37"/&gt; On the facts, Vellama was unable to show any special damage or special interest over and above that enjoyed by other members of the public in having the case heard; her interest was no more than a "general desire to have Art 49 interpreted by the court".&lt;ref name="Vellama 43"/&gt; Thus, the Court dismissed the appeal on the basis of Vellama's lack of standing.&lt;ref name="Vellama 44"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 20, para. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive issue: interpretation of Article 49(1)===
Even though Vellama's appeal was dismissed on the ground of lack of standing, the Court of Appeal went on to clarify the substantive issue regarding the interpretation of Article 49(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 21, para. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical background====
The current Article 49 in the Constitution replaced Article 33 of the 1963 Constitution of the State of Singapore, which applied when Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia. The latter was first [[promulgation|promulgated]] in the Third Schedule to the Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963&lt;ref&gt;Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963 (S.I.&amp;nbsp;1963 No.&amp;nbsp;1493, UK; reprinted as ''Gazette'' Notification (G.N.) Sp. No. S&amp;nbsp;1/1963), which was enacted under the [[Malaysia Act 1963]] ([[:File:Malaysia Act 1963.pdf|1963 c.&amp;nbsp;35]], UK), s.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; pursuant to Singapore's intent to join Malaysia as a constituent state.&lt;ref name="Vellama 58"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 26, para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of Article 33 included a time-limit clause, which mandated that an election had to be held "within three months" of a seat of an MP becoming vacant for any reason except for the dissolution of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Vellama 58"/&gt; In 1963, the Singapore Legislative Assembly requested for the time-limit clause to be removed. However, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] turned the request down and Article 33 was not amended. The time-limit clause was only deleted from Article 33 upon Singapore's separation from Malaysia by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965 (No. 8 of 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 33 was subsequently renumbered as Article 49 in the 1980 Reprint of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 27, paras. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Parliament House, Singapore, Feb 06.JPG|thumb|[[Old Parliament House, Singapore|Old Parliament House]] in Singapore in February 2006. The building previously served as seat of the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore]].]]

In the Court of Appeal, both parties made submissions based on parliamentary debates which took place in 1963 regarding the Legislative Assembly's request to remove the time-limit clause in Article 33 to justify their positions. The Attorney-General argued that there was no constitutional duty for casual vacancies to be filled on the following grounds:&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), pp. 27–28, paras. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1963, opposition MPs had argued against its removal&amp;nbsp;– for example, Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammar Akib said the removal of the clause would leave future vacancies to "the whims and fancies of the Party in power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammad Akib|office=[[Southern Islands Single Member Constituency|Southern Islands]]|title=Malaysia Agreement|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00051662-ZZ|date=1 August 1963|volume=21|column=689}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This implied that the majority stand and hence the law on by-elections in Singapore in 1963 was that the Prime Minister should have discretion as to whether a by-election had to be called in the event of casual vacancies.
*Other comments by opposition MPs also implied that the Prime Minister had the discretion as to whether to call a by-election. For example, in another parliamentary debate on 9 April 1963, [[Lim Yew Hock]] commented that the date of the by-election in [[Sembawang Single Member Constituency|Sembawang]] "could be June, it could be July, it could not even be held at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Lim Yew Hock|mplink=Lim Yew Hock|office=[[Cairnhill Single Member Constituency|Cairnhill]]|title=Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech (Debate on the Address) (Second Day)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00051409-ZZ|date=9 April 1963|volume=20|column=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1963 debates had to be viewed in the context of the Sembawang casual vacancy in 1962. While the Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] had informed the Legislative Assembly that a by-election would be held soon after the electoral registers had been updated, the fact that a general election was held five months after Lee's statement instead of a by-election showed that there was no constitutional duty for casual vacancies to be filled.

On the other hand, Vellama argued it was not possible to extrapolate a principle of unfettered discretion from the fact that no by-election was called in Sembawang. She submitted that the by-election had not been held solely because of logistical reasons. This was seen from how the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill (Bill No. 198 of 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; provided for a time extension for the revision of the electoral registers for 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 28, para. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prime Minister has no unfettered discretion under Article 49(1)====
The Court of Appeal analysed the High Court's textual and historical interpretation of Article 49(1), and also considered the role of an MP. The Court found that Article 49(1) does place a duty upon the Prime Minister to call a by-election to fill casual vacancies. However, this only applies to SMCs since a special provision for the calling of by-elections for GRCs exists in section 24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vellama 80"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 38, para. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's analysis involved answering the following questions:&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 32, para. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Whether the Prime Minister has unfettered discretion to advise the President to issue a writ of election to fill a casual vacancy of an elected Member.
*Whether he can delay the tendering of such advice indefinitely, or even declare that he is not going to fill the vacancy even if Parliament is not dissolved.

=====Textual interpretation=====
The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court's textual interpretation of Article 49(1) because it failed to see how the presence of absence of the word ''an'' could resolve the questions. The Court believed that even if the word ''election'' was describing a process, this interpretation on its own would not answer the question of whether the Prime Minister had unfettered discretion. As such, the omission or inclusion of the word ''an'' did not add value to the understanding of Article 49(1), given that the phrase ''shall be filled by election'' was not any clearer than ''shall be filled by an election'' in determining the issue. Further, the phrase ''shall be filled by election'' is capable of being read in a "double-barrelled sense", meaning that it could in fact refer to both an event and process at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), pp. 32–33, paras. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal noted that the word ''shall'' is a mandatory verb, and that the key to the questions lay with that word rather than the word ''election'' in Article 49(1). The Court held that the High Court's textual emphasis on the word ''election'' had actually substantially modified the meaning of Article 49. This would lead to the less definitive construction that a vacancy ''may'' be filled and, if so, it ''shall'' be filled by election.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 33, paras. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analysis of the historical development=====
The Court of Appeal held that while both parties had relied heavily on the subtexts of statements made in the 1963 parliamentary debates, "one should not read too much into [them]". This was because the phrase ''shall be filled by election'' itself is inherently filled with ambiguity. The Court noted that no member of the ruling party, including the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, had ever denied there was a constitutional obligation to call a by-election to fill a casual vacancy. Instead, the 1963 debates had only focused on the time-frame within which such by-elections should be called.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 29, paras. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Court's opinion that it was likely that the sequence of events following the Sembawang vacancy was the motivating factor for the Legislative Assembly's proposal to remove the time-limit clause from Article 33 in 1965, on grounds that it "should no longer apply".&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 31, paras. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Court found it difficult to rely on the Sembawang vacancy as a historical precedent to conclude that there was no constitutional duty to fill casual vacancies. This was because no express statements to that effect were made at that point in time. Also, the delay in holding a by-election was actually a result of the electoral registers being updated. The failure to call the Sembawang by-election could thus at most be seen as an example of the discretion vested in the Prime Minister to call for either a by-election or a general election. Finally, the Court noted that legislative interventions throughout the years showed that there was no consensus as to the meaning of ''shall be filled by election''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), pp. 31–32, paras. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====MP as the representative of the people=====
The Court of Appeal stated that Singapore follows the [[Westminster system|Westminster system of government]] under which a voter at a general election performs a dual function: he votes a candidate into Parliament as an MP for a constituency ''and'' as a member of the political party that the voter seeks to return to power as the government.&lt;ref name="Vellama 79"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 38, para. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court cited {{citation|author=Robert Blackburn|author2=Andrew Kennon|author3=Michael [Addison John] Wheeler-Booth|author3-link=Michael Wheeler-Booth|title=Griffith &amp; Ryle on Parliament: Functions, Practice and Procedures|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|year=2003|at=para. 2-073|isbn=978-0-421-60910-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some modifications to the Westminster model in Singapore, the Court held that the basic character of an elected MP in Singapore as the citizen's representative remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="Vellama 80"/&gt;

The Judges of Appeal felt that since the authority of the Government emanates from the people, every voter is entitled to have a member representing them and speaking on their behalf in Parliament. As such, the Court felt that an MP is "not just the mouthpiece but the voice of the people of the constituency". This is especially the case in a Single Member Constituency where voters only have a single representative in Parliament. The court thus felt that Article 49 does impose a duty upon the Prime Minister to call a by-election to fill casual vacancies in SMCs,&lt;ref name="Vellama 79"/&gt; unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 35, para. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exercising the Article 49 discretion with "all convenient speed"====
After holding that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion to indefinitely postpone the holding of an election to fill a casual vacancy, the Court of Appeal went on to consider the time frame within which the Prime Minister must act. The Court referred to section 52 of the Interpretation Act ("IA")&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Interpretation Act|cap=1|ed=2002}} ("IA").&lt;/ref&gt; which provides: "Where no time is prescribed or allowed within which anything shall be done that thing shall be done with all convenient speed and as often as the prescribed occasion arises." Section 52 is relevant to the interpretation of Article 49(1) by virtue of section 2 of the IA which provides that the IA is applicable to "written law", including the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 35, para. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2013 Singapore Haze - Before, Middle, After.png|thumb|400px|A series of photographs comparing the effects of the [[2013 Southeast Asian haze]] ''(centre, 19 June)'' with how the same part of Singapore looked before and after the haze ''(left and right, 4 May and 23 June)'']]

The Court drew a parallel between the common law concept of a [[reasonable time]] with that of "all convenient speed" in section 52 of the IA, and concluded that the Prime Minister is required to take into account all circumstances relevant to the act to be carried out, and this is not limited to logistical factors but also other policy matters including the physical well-being of the country. Two examples of such relevant considerations were the 2003 [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] outbreak in Singapore and the [[2013 Southeast Asian haze]] which was affecting Singapore at the time the vacancy arose. However, the Court did not wish to lay down specific considerations or factors that the Prime Minister is entitled to take into account. This was because it felt that the timing for the holding of an by-election is a dynamic issue and no predetermination of such considerations would be warranted.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 36, paras. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court was also referred to the House of Lords case of ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union|link=R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|court=UKHL|year=1995|num=2|parallelcite=[1995] 2 A.C. 513|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their Lordships held that the [[Home Secretary]] only had a duty to keep the implementation of a statutory scheme under active consideration until and unless Parliament decided to repeal the statute. The Singapore Court of Appeal distinguished ''ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' from the issue at hand on two grounds. First, the word ''shall'' in Article 49(1) indicated that the Prime Minister is under a duty to call an election to fill the vacancy, as opposed to the word ''may'' which appeared in the statute in ''ex parte Fire Brigades Union''. Secondly, the Prime Minister's discretion under Article 49(1) is not solely and largely dictated by policy considerations, unlike the Home Secretary's discretion in ''ex parte Fire Brigades Union''. Rather, in deciding when to call a by-election, the Prime Minister must bear in mind the equally important consideration of the interests of the people of the constituency in which a vacancy has arisen.&lt;ref name="Vellama 87"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 38, para. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, while the Prime Minister has a measure of latitude in deciding when to hold a by-election, the Court reiterated that this does not mean that the Prime Minister is entitled to defer the calling of an election to fill a vacancy indefinitely, or to simply declare that he will not be advising the President to issue a writ of election.&lt;ref name="Vellama 85"&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 36, para. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court opined that even if at a particular point in time the Prime Minister felt that it would not be appropriate to call for an election to fill a vacancy, he would still be compelled to review the circumstances from time to time and call one if and when the circumstances changed.&lt;ref name="Vellama 87"/&gt;

====Power to call a by-election subject to judicial review====
The Court of Appeal held that the Prime Minister's discretion under Article 49(1) of the Constitution as to the timing of an election to fill a casual vacancy is subject to judicial review. It is a basic requirement of the [[rule of law doctrine in Singapore|rule of law]], that all discretionary power is subject to legal limits. However, the Court indicated that such judicial intervention would only be warranted in exceptional cases due to the fact-sensitive nature of the Prime Minister's discretion. Given the MP's role as the voice of the constituents, leaving a parliamentary seat vacant for too long could [[disfranchisement|disenfranchise]] the residents of that constituency. Thus, there was a need to balance the Prime Minister's discretion as to the timing of the election and the rights of voters.&lt;ref name="Vellama 85"/&gt;

====Application to the facts====
The Court of Appeal held that Vellama's filing of the action barely two weeks after her MP's seat in Parliament fell vacant was premature because the Prime Minister had yet to make his stand on the matter. There was thus no basis to make any complaint against the Prime Minister as the application had pre-empted any decision by the Prime Minister. Further, the Prime Minister's decision to advise the President to file a writ of election on 9 May 2012 meant that thereafter there was no factual basis for the Court to rule on the reasonableness or otherwise of the Prime Minister not calling a by-election to fill the vacancy. As such, Vellama had no factual basis upon which to proceed with her case and this alone was sufficient to dismiss her case.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 39, para. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, since the Court agreed with Vellama that the Constitution requires the Prime Minister to fill casual vacancies arising in SMCs within a reasonable time, it ordered each party to bear its own costs.&lt;ref&gt;''Vellama'' (C.A.), p. 40, paras. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of the case==

===Standing===
While the earlier case of ''Tan Eng Hong'' had established the test for standing, namely that "[when] a public right was involved, the applicant must show that he had suffered special damage as a result of the public act being challenged and that he had a genuine private interest to protect or further",&lt;ref name="Tan Eng Hong 69"/&gt; the Court of Appeal did not elaborate on the meaning of "special damage" in that case as it did not concern a public right.&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam"&gt;''[[Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20150606171424/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/15402-jeyaretnam-kenneth-andrew-v-attorney-general-2013-sgca-56 &amp;#91;2013&amp;#93; SGCA 56], [2014] 1 S.L.R. 345 at 363, para. 47, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/15402-jeyaretnam-kenneth-andrew-v-attorney-general-2013-sgca-56 the original] on 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal applied its judgment in ''Vellama'' in the later case of ''[[Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam"/&gt; Expanding on the meaning of special damage, the Court noted "that 'special damage' might also possibly encompass those rare and exceptional situations where a public body has breached its public duties in such an egregious manner that the courts are satisfied that it would be in the public interest to hear it".&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 62"&gt;''Jeyaretnam'', p. 370, para. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''National Federation'' case, the House of Lords also suggested the theoretical possibility that an ordinary taxpayer might have standing to bring a claim if a public authority had failed to perform its statutory duty, but it would have to be "a most extreme case".&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 662, cited in ''Jeyaretnam'', p.&amp;nbsp;369, para.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, erring on the side of caution, the Court specified that this is "a very narrow avenue which concerns only extremely exceptional instances of very grave and serious breaches of legality&amp;nbsp;... [and] should not in any way be taken as a spurring move towards the surge of public interest litigation".&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 62"/&gt;

The Court of Appeal in ''Jeyaretnam'' proceeded to emphasize that the principles in ''Boyce'',&lt;ref name="Boyce"/&gt; which represent the view that an individual must have a sufficient personal stake in a matter to have standing, is still the predominant test for most cases. ''Boyce'' been unequivocally applied by the Court of Appeal in both ''Tan Eng Hong'' and ''Vellama'', and it did not depart from this in ''Jeyaretnam''.&lt;ref&gt;''Jeyaretnam'', pp. 370–371, para. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the English position pertaining to standing has become more liberal following the issuance in 1977 of Order 53, rule 3(5), of the Rules of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="RSC"/&gt; As a result of this amendment, an applicant is only required to have "sufficient interest in the matter".&lt;ref name="SCA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court (UK), O. 53, r. 3(5).&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that a wider discretion is conferred on the English courts to grant leave for judicial review applications to be brought since the presence of a public interest element in the matter suffices even though the applicant may not be personally affected. However, although the discretion is wide, it does not entail that judges can treat any interest as "sufficient".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Timothy [Andrew Orville] Endicott|authorlink=Timothy Endicott|title=Administrative Law|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|page=409|isbn=978-0-19-960175-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''National Federation'' case, [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]] cautioned that "the court must decide on legal principles".&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn of Hadley]] also opined in ''ex parte Salem'' that courts must exercise caution when establishing standing. Additionally, appeals which are academic between the parties should not be heard unless there is strong public interest in doing so.&lt;ref name="Salem 457"/&gt;

As the only House of Lords decision on what constitutes sufficient interest,&lt;ref&gt;Endicott, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''National Federation'' case is instructive. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] held that the Federation's allegation gave it sufficient interest in the matter since the Federation was not a mere busybody but had a genuine grievance.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Business Ltd.'' [1980] Q.B. 407 at 425, C.A. (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this decision was overturned by the House of Lords as their Lordships were of the opinion that the Federation would only have standing if it was "a case of sufficient gravity",&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 633 ''[[wikt:per#Etymology 1|per]]'' Lord Wilberforce.&lt;/ref&gt; there was "some exceptionally grave or widespread illegality",&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 647 ''per'' [[Ian Fraser, Baron Fraser of Tullybelton|Lord Fraser of Tullybelton]].&lt;/ref&gt; or a breach of statutory duty due to "some grossly improper pressure or motive".&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 662 ''per'' [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Lord Roskill]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] went further, adding that the Federation would have standing to seek judicial review of any ''[[ultra vires]]'' conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''National Federation'', p. 644.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''National Federation'' case, English courts have adopted a much broader approach towards standing. In ''[[R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte World Development Movement Ltd|R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte World Development Movement Ltd.]]'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v.

([[divisional court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]])|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[divisional court (England and Wales)|divisional court of England and Wales]] held that the following factors are relevant when determining whether litigants who lack any direct personal interest in a matter should be recognized as having standing:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte World Development Movement'', pp.&amp;nbsp;395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The importance of vindicating the rule of law.
*The importance of the issue raised.
*The likely absence of any responsible challenger.
*The nature of the breach of duty against which relief is sought.
*The role of the applicants in giving advice, guidance and assistance with regards to the subject matter of the dispute.

The ''Vellama'' decision was described as "a surprise to those used to a judicial stance that is fairly deferential towards the Government".&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Hougang by-election case: What court decision on by-election reveals|url=http://www.todayonline.com/commentary/what-court-decision-election-reveals?singlepage=true|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607052502/http://www.todayonline.com/commentary/what-court-decision-election-reveals?singlepage=true|archivedate=7 June 2015|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=8 August 2012|pages=16 &amp; 18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts take such a deferential stance when dealing with certain types of decisions, often involving complex policy issues or national security. However, the court's statement indicating it would only intervene in "exceptional cases" while taking a "fact sensitive" approach represents a reservation of a fair amount of leeway for the Prime Minister in making such decisions.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

It has also been noted that the Court of Appeal's approach to constitutional interpretation in the case reflects the approach taken by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in ''Minister for Home Affairs v. Fisher'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Minister for Home Affairs v. Fisher|court=UKPC|year=1979|num=21|format=1|parallelcite=[1980] A.C. 319 at 329|courtname=auto|juris=Bermuda}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach deems a constitutional instrument as ''[[sui generis]]'' and calling for principles of interpretation of its own because full recognition and effect must be given to fundamental rights and freedoms. The Court of Appeal's focus on the suggestion that residents have an entitlement or right to representation rather than on the purpose behind the statute has been described as embracing the ''Fisher'' approach&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benjamin Joshua Ong|title=Developments in the Law on Constitutional and Statutory Interpretation|publisher=Singapore Law Watch|year=2013|page=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a departure from the interpretive approach to constitutional interpretation espoused in section 9A of the Interpretation Act read with Article 2(9) of the Constitution. Section 9A requires a [[purposive approach]] to be taken when interpreting laws, and states that an interpretation of a law that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Article 2(9) states: "Subject to this Article, the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1) shall apply for the purpose of interpreting this Constitution and otherwise in relation thereto as it applies for the purpose of interpreting and otherwise in relation to any written law within the meaning of that Act".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 2(9).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vellama'' decision has also been described as enshrining the principle of [[judicial independence in Singapore|judicial independence]] and impartiality in Singapore by dispelling unfounded beliefs by some members of the public that the [[judicial system of Singapore|judiciary]] is subject to influence by the legislative and executive branches of government. It has also been said that the decision serves as a definition and recognition of the rights of Singaporeans with regards to whether a by-election must be called.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hougang By-election Judgment: A Victory for All|magazine=Al-Mizan: An Official Publication of the Association of Muslim Lawyers|date=July 2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–14 at 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Vellama's appeal was in fact dismissed for lack of standing,&lt;ref name="Vellama 44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hougang By-election Judgment", pp. 12 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the holding of the Court with regards to the Prime Minister's discretion in calling a by-election was ''obiter dicta'' and, strictly speaking, is not binding on other courts faced with a similar decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=obiter dictum|editor=Bryan A.

'''Wildcat banking''' refers to the practices of [[bank]]s [[charter]]ed under [[U.S. state|state]] law during the periods of non-federally regulated state banking between 1836 and 1863 in the [[United States]], also known as the [[Free Banking Era]]. This era, commonly described as an example of [[free banking]], was not a period of true free banking, as banks were free of only federal regulation; banking was  regulated by the states. The actual regulation of banking during this period varied from state to state.

According to some sources, the term came from a bank in [[Michigan]] that issued private paper currency with the image of a [[wildcat]].  After the bank failed, poorly backed bank notes became known as wildcat currency, and the banks that issued them as wildcat banks.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Palmer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=%22wildcat+bank%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s-r_E8-Ou2&amp;sig=Rw11xGS8tyxUCXASrP3qI0MxRfE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i9d9S7vPKYWDnQfx46HXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wildcat%20bank%22&amp;f=false ''Speaking of Animals: A Dictionary of Animal Metaphors''], Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995, p.414.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to others, ''wildcat'' meant a rash speculator as early as 1812, and by 1838 had been extended to any risky business venture.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer, ''It's Raining Cats and Dogs ... and Other Beastly Expressions'' (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1989) 152&lt;/ref&gt; A common conception of the wildcat bank in Westerns and like stories was of a bank that left its safe somewhat ajar for depositors to see, in which the banker would display a barrel full of nails, grain or flour with a thin sprinkling of cash on top, thus fooling depositors into thinking it was a successful bank.

==About==
The traditional view of wildcat banks describes them as distributing nearly worthless [[currency]] backed by questionable security (such as [[Mortgage law|mortgages]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]). These actions ended when note circulation by state banks was stopped after the passage of the [[National Bank Act of 1863]]. [[Mark Twain]], in his autobiography, refers to the use of such currency in 1853, "The firm paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value".&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Mark Twain, Smith, page 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913, banks extended loans by issuing notes. An individual may take his promissory notes or bills of exchange to the bank for discount. Banks would issue their own bank notes to the borrowers.
Bank notes were usually backed by [[money|specie]] or government bonds. The holder of the bank note had a claim on the bank's assets. The overwhelming determinate of value on a bank's notes would be the quality of that bank's assets. Many of the states regulations required for the banks to back their notes with state bonds. Banks in states that had safe bonds would thrive whereas banks in states that had risky bonds would suffer. Of course other factors could influence the value of a bank note, the major secondary cause would be the likelihood of fraud, either from the bank or from forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Gerald P. [http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFCE.pdf "Wildcat Banking, Banking Panics, and Free Banking in the United States"]. ''Economic Review'', 1996. p. 2. Retrieved 6 December 2013. "Free banks did not always redeem their notes as promised, and there are fabulous stories of fraudulent activities, stories that appear frequently in histories of free banking and general histories of banking."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many varieties of money different banks traded at different discounts to their face value. Lists were published to help bankers and others to identify and appraise the bills (and forgeries). One of the major causes of discounting occurred due to the real cost of transferring the notes to the original bank.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22937">A '''zero-day''' (also known as '''0-day''') vulnerability is a [[computer software|computer-software]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] that is unknown to those who would be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software).

  | quote= A zero day vulnerability refers to an exploitable bug in software that is unknown to the vendor. This security hole may be exploited by crackers before the vendor becomes aware and hurries to fix it—this exploit is called a zero day attack.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a '''zero-day exploit,''' or '''zero-day attack.'''

In the jargon of computer security, "Day Zero" is the day on which the interested party (presumably the vendor of the targeted system) learns of the vulnerability. Up until that day, the vulnerability is known as a zero-day vulnerability. Similarly, an exploitable bug that has been known for thirty days would be called a 30-day vulnerability. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, the vendor will usually create [[patch (computing)|patches]] or advise [[workaround]]s to mitigate it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eset.co.uk/Press-Centre/Blog/Article/flash-zero-day Flash Vulnerabilities Causing Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fewer the days since Day Zero, the higher the chance no fix or mitigation has been developed. Even after a fix is developed, the fewer the days since Day Zero, the higher is the probability that an attack against the afflicted software will be successful, because not every user of that software will have applied the fix. For zero-day exploits, the probability that a user has patched their bugs is zero, so the exploit should always succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm About Zero Day Exploits]&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-day attacks are a severe [[Threat (computer)|threat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://eugene.kaspersky.com/2011/11/02/the-man-who-found-stuxnet-sergey-ulasen-in-the-spotlight/ The Man Who Found Stuxnet – Sergey Ulasen in the Spotlight] published on November 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack vectors ==

[[Malware]] writers can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities through several different attack vectors. Sometimes, when users visit rogue [[website]]s, malicious code on the site can exploit vulnerabilities in Web browsers. [[Web browser]]s are a particular target for criminals because of their widespread distribution and usage. Cybercriminals can also send malicious e-mail attachments via [[SMTP]], which exploit vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9005117 ''SANS sees upsurge in zero-day Web-based attacks'', ''Computerworld''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222035950/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9005117 |date=December 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploits that take advantage of common file types are numerous and frequent, as evidenced by their increasing appearances in databases like [[US-CERT]]. Criminals can engineer malware to take advantage of these file type exploits to compromise attacked systems or steal confidential data.&lt;ref&gt;"E-mail Residual Risk Assessment" Avinti, Inc., p. 2 http://www.avinti.com/download/case_studies/whitepaper_email_residual_risk.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Window of vulnerability ==
The time from when a software exploit first becomes active to the time when the number of vulnerable systems shrinks to insignificance is known as the Window of Vulnerability (WoV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-72367-9_32|title=New Approaches for Security, Privacy and Trust in Complex Environments|last=Johansen|first=Håvard|last2=Johansen|first2=Dag|last3=Renesse|first3=Robbert van|date=2007-05-14|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387723662|editor-last=Venter|editor-first=Hein|series=IFIP International Federation for Information Processing|pages=373–384|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-72367-9_32|editor-last2=Eloff|editor-first2=Mariki|editor-last3=Labuschagne|editor-first3=Les|editor-last4=Eloff|editor-first4=Jan|editor-last5=Solms|editor-first5=Rossouw von}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time-line for each software vulnerability is defined by the following main events: 
* &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: The vulnerability is discovered (by anyone).
* &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt;: A security patch is published (e.g., by the software vendor).
* &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;: An exploit becomes active.
* &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Most vulnerable systems have applied the patch.
Thus the formula for the length of the Window of Vulnerability is: &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;

In this formulation, it is always true that &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not the same as Day Zero.  For example, if a hacker is the first to discover (at &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) the vulnerability, the vendor might not learn of it until much later (on Day Zero). 

For normal vulnerabilities, &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. This implies that the software vendor was aware of vulnerability and had time to publish a security patch (&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt;) before any hacker could craft a workable exploit (&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;). For zero-day exploits, &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0 so that the exploit became active before a patch was made available.

By not disclosing known vulnerabilities, a software vendor hopes to reach &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; before &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt; is reached, thus avoiding any exploits. However, the vendor has no guarantees that hackers will not find vulnerabilities on their own. Furthermore, hackers can analyze the security patches themselves, and thereby discover the underlying vulnerabilities and automatically generate working exploits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halvar|first=Flake,|date=2016-10-25|title=Structural Comparison of Executable Objects|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.17877/DE290R-2007|language=en|doi=10.17877/de290r-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exploits can be used effectively up until time &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In practice, the size of the WoV varies between systems, vendors, and individual vulnerabilities. It is often measured in days, with one report from 2006 estimating the average as 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;"Internet Security Threat Report" Symantec Corp, Vol. X, Sept. 2006, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protection ==

Zero-day protection is the ability to provide protection against zero-day exploits. Since zero-day attacks are generally unknown to the public it is often difficult to defend against them. Zero-day attacks are often effective against "secure" networks and can remain undetected even after they are launched. Thus, users of so-called secure systems must also exercise common sense and practice safe computing habits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://what-is-what.com/what_is/zero_day_exploit.html What is a Zero-Day Exploit?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many techniques exist to limit the effectiveness of zero-day memory corruption vulnerabilities such as [[buffer overflows]]. These protection mechanisms exist in contemporary operating systems such as [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Windows Vista|Vista]] and beyond (see also: [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista]]), [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Linux]], [[Unix]], and Unix-like environments; [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP Service Pack 2 includes limited protection against generic memory corruption vulnerabilities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2mempr.mspx Changes to Functionality in Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and previous versions include even less. Desktop and server protection software also exists to mitigate zero-day buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Typically these technologies involve [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic termination analysis]]—stopping them before they cause any harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secplab.ppgia.pucpr.br/files/papers/2013-3.pdf|title=Mitigating XML Injection 0-Day Attacks through Strategy-Based Detection Systems|access-date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that a solution of this kind may be out of reach because it is algorithmically impossible in the general case to analyze any arbitrary code to determine if it is malicious, as such an analysis reduces to the [[halting problem]] over a [[linear bounded automaton]], which is unsolvable. It is, however, unnecessary to address the general case (that is, to sort all programs into the categories of malicious or non-malicious) under most circumstances in order to eliminate a wide range of malicious behaviors. It suffices to recognize the safety of a limited set of programs (e.g., those that can access or modify only a given subset of machine resources) while rejecting both some safe and all unsafe programs. This does require the integrity of those safe programs to be maintained, which may prove difficult in the face of a kernel level exploit.

The [[Zeroday Emergency Response Team]] (ZERT) was a group of software engineers who worked to release non-vendor patches for zero-day exploits.

In a March 9, 2017 press release on the [[Vault 7]] documents that had been released by [[WikiLeaks]] 2 days previously, [[Julian Assange]] states that much of the leak's remainder included unpatched vulnerabilities and that he was working with IT companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]] to get these vulnerabilities patched as he would not release information which would put the public at risk, and as fixes were released by manufacturers he would release details of vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=transc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steemit.com/wikileaks/@ausbitbank/wikileaks-vault-7-march-9th-press-conference-transcript|title=Wikileaks Vault 7 March 9th Press Conference [Full Transcript] — Steemit|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worms ==

Zero-day [[computer worms|worms]] take advantage of a surprise attack while they are unknown to [[computer security]] professionals. [[Notable computer viruses and worms|Recent history]] shows an increasing rate of worm propagation. Well designed worms can spread very fast with devastating consequences to the [[Internet]] and other systems.

== Ethics ==

Differing ideologies exist relative to the collection and use of zero-day vulnerability information. Many computer security vendors perform research on zero-day vulnerabilities in order to better understand the nature of vulnerabilities and their exploitation by individuals, computer worms and viruses. Alternatively, some vendors purchase vulnerabilities to augment their research capacity. An example of such a program is [[TippingPoint]]'s Zero Day Initiative. While selling and buying these vulnerabilities is not technically illegal in most parts of the world, there is a lot of controversy over the method of disclosure. A 2006 German decision to include Article 6 of the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] and the [[framework decision|EU Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems]] may make selling or even manufacturing vulnerabilities illegal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Most formal programs follow some form of [[RFPolicy|Rain Forest Puppy's disclosure guidelines]] or the more recent OIS Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response. In general these rules forbid the public disclosure of vulnerabilities without notification to the vendor and adequate time to produce a patch.

== Viruses ==
A '''zero-day virus''' (also known as '''zero-day malware''' or '''next-generation malware''') is a previously unknown [[computer virus]] or other malware for which specific [[antivirus software]] signatures are not yet available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstartnews.com/reviews/utilities/cyberhawk_zero_day_threat_detection_1.html|title=Cyberhawk – zero day threat detection review|website=Kickstartnews|access-date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, antivirus software relies upon [[Electronic signature|signature]]s to identify malware. This can be very effective, but cannot defend against malware unless samples have already been obtained, signatures generated and updates distributed to users. Because of this, signature-based approaches are not effective against zero-day viruses.

Most modern antivirus software still uses signatures, but also carries out other types of analysis.

=== Code analysis ===
In [[code analysis]], the [[machine code]] of the file is analysed to see if there is anything that looks suspicious. Typically, malware has characteristic behaviour and code analysis attempts to detect if this is present in the code.

Although useful, code analysis has significant limitations. It is not always easy to determine what a section of code is intended to do; particularly if it is very [[Complexity|complex]] and has been deliberately written with the intention of defeating analysis. Another limitation of code analysis is the time and resources available. In the competitive world of antivirus software, there is always a balance between the effectiveness of analysis and the time delay involved.

=== Emulation ===
One approach to overcome the limitations of code analysis is for the antivirus software to run suspect sections of code in a safe [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] and observe their behaviour. This can be orders of magnitude faster than analysing the same code, but must resist (and detect) attempts by the code to detect the sandbox.

=== Generic signatures ===
Generic signatures are signatures that are specific to certain behaviour rather than a specific item of malware. Most new malware is not totally novel, but is a variation on earlier malware, or contains code from one or more earlier examples of malware. Thus the results of previous analysis can be used against new malware.

=== Competitiveness in the antivirus software industry ===
It is generally accepted in the antivirus industry that most vendors' signature-based protection is identically effective. If a signature is available for an item of malware, then every product (unless dysfunctional) should detect it. However, some vendors are significantly faster than others at becoming aware of new viruses and/or updating their customers' signature databases to detect them.&lt;!--If this isn't the case these days, then the first sentence of this paragraph needs a source!--&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

There is a wide range of effectiveness in terms of zero-day virus protection. The German computer magazine [[c't]] found that detection rates for zero-day viruses varied from 20% to 68%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=21 December 2008|last=Goodin|first=Dan|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/12/21/dwindling_antivirus_protection|title=Anti-virus protection gets worse|website=The Channel|access-date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily in the area of zero-day virus performance that manufacturers now compete.

== U.S. government involvement ==
===NSA's use of zero-day exploits (2017)===
In mid-April 2017 the hackers known as [[The Shadow Brokers]] (TSB)—allegedly linked to the Russian government&lt;ref name="twitter_Snowden_2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514891813945344 |title=Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.

=== Vulnerabilities Equities Process ===
{{main|Vulnerabilities Equities Process}}
The [[Vulnerabilities Equities Process]], first revealed publicly in 2016, is a process used by the [[U.S. federal government]] to determine  on a case-by-case basis how it should treat [[zero-day vulnerability|zero-day]] [[computer security vulnerabilities]]; whether to disclose them to the public to help improve general computer security, or to keep them secret for offensive use against the government's adversaries.&lt;ref name=newman2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/vulnerability-equity-process-charter-transparency-concerns/|title=Feds Explain Their Software Bug Stash—But Don’t Erase Concerns|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|first=Lily Hay|last=Newman|date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process has been criticized for a number of deficiencies, including restriction by non-disclosure agreements, lack of risk ratings, special treatment for the NSA, and less than whole-hearted commitment to disclosure as the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/15/us_governments_vulnerability_disclosure_policy/|title=The four problems with the US government's latest rulebook on security bug disclosures|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en|work=The Register|date=15 November 2017|first= Kieren |last=McCarthy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signature-based detection ===
A virus signature is a unique pattern or code that can be used to detect and identify specific viruses. The antivirus scans file signatures and compares them to a database of known malicious codes. If they match, the file is flagged and treated as a threat.
The major limitation of signature-based detection is that it is only capable of flagging already known malware, making it completely useless against zero-day attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.safetydetective.com/blog/what-are-zero-day|title=What Are Zero-Day Attacks? {{!}} Safety Detective|website=Safety Detective|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
