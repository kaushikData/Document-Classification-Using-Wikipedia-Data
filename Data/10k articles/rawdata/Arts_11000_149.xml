'''Architectural design values''' make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the [[Timeline of architecture|pluralism in design]] outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.

Different design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.

==Aesthetic design values==
The expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], [[Deconstructivism]], [[Post-structuralism]], [[Neoclassicism]], New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc.&lt;ref&gt;KRIEGER, P. (2004) Contextualism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STEER, L. M. (2004) Supermodernism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLORES"&gt;FLORES, C. A. H. (2004) Symbolism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking,&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.

These aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt;

A number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.

Aesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.

===Artistic aspects and self-expression===
It is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing.&lt;ref name="Gelernter"&gt;Gelernter, M. (1995). Sources of architectural form: a critical history of Western design theory. Manchester, Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like [[Expressionism]] and the [[Avant-garde]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Fedders, K. (2004). Archigram. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heynen, H. (2004). Avant-garde. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 97 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.

===The spirit of the time design value===
This design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The [[Zeitgeist|Spirit of the Times]] denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1965). Of the standard of taste: and other essays. Indianapolis, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, [[collective consciousness]] and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some  extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.&lt;ref name="BROLIN"&gt;Brolin, B. C. (2000). Architectural ornament: banishment and return. New York, Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structural, functional and material honesty design value===
Structural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc.&lt;ref name="BROLIN" /&gt; Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “[[form follows function]]”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;KAUFMANN, E. (1955) Architecture in the age of reason; baroque and postbaroque in england, italy, and france, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for.&lt;ref&gt;NESBITT, K. (1996) Theorizing a new agenda for architecture: an anthology of architectural theory 1965-1995, New York, Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;WHITELEY, N. (1993) Design for society, London, Reaktion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The simplicity and minimalism design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Minimalism|simple forms]], i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;TOY, M. (1999) EDITORIAL. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RUBY, I. &amp; RUBY, A. (2003) Essential, Meta-, Trans-. The Chimeras of Minimalist Architecture. IN RUBY, I. (Ed.) Minimal architecture. Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.&lt;ref&gt;SILVESTRIN, C. (1999) Royal Academy and AD International Forum, Something or Nothing: Minimalism in Art and Architecture 8. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and organic design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Natural building|nature]] (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs.&lt;ref&gt;ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS, H. (2003) Zoomorphic : new animal architecture, London, Laurence King Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;PEARSON, D. (2001) New organic architecture: the breaking wave, Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;

===The classic, traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value===
This value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004"&gt;BEATLEY, T. &amp; WHEELER, S. M. (2004) The sustainable urban development reader, London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is also linked to [[Vernacular architecture|regional differences]] i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ"&gt;GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ, V. (2004) Regionalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The regionalism design value===
This design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ" /&gt; In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;ABEL, C. (1997) Architecture and identity: towards a global eco-culture, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;LEFAIVRE, L. &amp; TZONIS, A. (2003) Critical regionalism: architecture and identity in a globalized world, Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social design values==
Many architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population.&lt;ref&gt;SYMES, M., ELEY, J. &amp; SEIDEL, A. D. (1995) Architects and their practices: a changing profession, Oxford, Butterworth Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.

It should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. [[Social design]] values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;JOHNSON, D. L. (2004) Rationalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.

===The social change design value===
This design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;ZIPF, C. W. (2004) Arts and crafts movement. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HUGHES, R. (1991) The shock of the new art and the century of change, London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs.&lt;ref&gt;HATCH, C. R. (1984) The scope of social architecture, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.&lt;ref name="SANOFF"&gt;SANOFF, H. (2000) Community participation methods in design and planning, New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The consultation and participation design value===
This design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve [[Participatory design|stakeholders in the design process]].&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt; This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:
#Meeting social needs and an effective use of resources.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;
#Influencing in the design process as well as awareness of the consequences etc.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PREISER, W. F. E., WHITE, E. T. &amp; RABINOWITZ, H. Z. (1988) Post-occupancy evaluation, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing relevant and up-to-date information for designers.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ZIMRING, C. M. &amp; REIZENSTEIN, J. E. (1981) A Primer on [[post occupancy evaluation]]: uses and techniques of an increasingly valued tool. Architecture (AIA Journal), 70, 52 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crime prevention design value===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels,&lt;ref&gt;PRESS, M., COOPER, R. &amp; EROL, R. (2001) Design as a tool for social policy: the case of 'design against crime'. The Fourth European Academy of Design Conference. Aveiro Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: 
#Defensible space.&lt;ref&gt;NEWMAN, O. (1972) Defensible space: crime prevention through urban design, New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN"&gt;COLQUHOUN, I. (2004) Design out crime: creating safe and sustainable communities, Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Crime prevention through environmental design.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;
#Situational crime prevention.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEKERLE, G. R. &amp; WHITZMAN, C. (1995) Safe cities: guidelines for planning, design, and management, New York ; London, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'Third world' design value===
This is based on an eagerness to help developing countries [[Architecture for Humanity|through architecture]] and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the [[Third World]]).&lt;ref&gt;SERAGELDIN, I. (1997) The architecture of empowerment a survey. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STRASSMANN, P. W. (1998) Third world housing. IN VAN VLIET, W. (Ed.) The Encyclopedia of housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;YUNUS, M. (1997) Foreword. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ÖZKAN, S. (1997) Architecture to change the world? IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental design values==
The 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THOMPSON, I. H. (2000) Aesthetic, social and ecological values in landscape architecture: a discourse analysis. Ethics, place and environment, 3, 269-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2012}} that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on [[environmental design]] has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental [[high-tech architecture]], and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D"&gt;CUFF, D. (2000) Epilogue. IN KOSTOF, S. (Ed.) ''The Architect : chapters in the history of the profession''. Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce "eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability".&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.

The environmental design values category consists of three design values.

===Green and sustainability===
This value is based on a belief that a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;MCDONALD, M. K. (2004) Sustainability and sustainable architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture''. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2002) Sustainable architecture: low tech houses, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2003) Sustainable architecture: high tech housing, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WINES, J. &amp; JODIDIO, P. (2000) Green architecture, Köln, Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-use and modification===
This is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates.&lt;ref&gt;KALNER, S. (2004) Adaptwe re-use. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999"&gt;POWELL, K. (1999) Architecture reborn: the conversion and reconstruction of old buildings, London, Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a [[Sick building syndrome|healthy living environment]].&lt;ref name="FRANK"&gt;FRANK, L. D., ENGELKE, P. O. &amp; SCHMID, T. L. (2003) Health and community design: the impact of the built environment on physical activity, Washington, DC, Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BARTON, H., TSOUROU, C. &amp; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. REGIONAL OFFICE FOR, E. (2000) Healthy urban planning: a WHO guide to planning for people, London, Published on behalf of the World Health Organization Regional.&lt;/ref&gt; Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures.&lt;ref name="FRANK" /&gt; Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.&lt;ref&gt;BAKER-LAPORTE, P., ELLIOTT, E. &amp; BANTA, J. (2001) Prescriptions for a healthy house: a practical guide for architects, builders, and homeowners, Santa Fe, InWord Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional design values==
Within both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.

This design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as [[Classicism]], Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.

The Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.

===The tradition based design value===
This relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs.&lt;ref&gt;AMUNDSON, J. A. &amp; MILLER, C. C. (2004) Classicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this design value there are three main strategies:
#Critical traditionalist/regionalist i.e. interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them in an abstracted modern vocabulary.&lt;ref name="TILMAN"&gt;TILMAN, J. T. (2004) Historicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Revivalists i.e. adhering to the most literal traditional form.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;
#Contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings “demands” it.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;

===The design value of restoration and preservation===
This is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;ROSS, M. (1996) Planning and the heritage: policy and procedures, London, E &amp; FN Spon.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TOMLAN, M. A. (2004) Historic preservation. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; These are: 
#An archaeological perspective (i.e. preserving buildings and products of historical interest).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#An artistic perspective i.e. a desire to preserve something of beauty.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#A social perspective (i.e. a desire to hold on to the familiar and reassuring).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

===The vernacular design value===
This value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;OLIVER, P. (2004) Vernacular Architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Primitivism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; The design value of [[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular]] includes key concept such as: 
#Reinvigorating tradition (i.e. evoking the vernacular).
#Reinventing tradition i.e. the search for new paradigms.
#Extending tradition i.e. using the vernacular in a modified manner.
#Reinterpreting tradition i.e. the use of contemporary idioms.&lt;ref&gt;RUDOFSKY, B. (1964) Architecture without architects: a short introduction to non-pedigree architecture, New York, Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-based design values==
This design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (1992) Discrimination by design: a feminist critique of the man-made environment, Urbana, University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEISMAN"&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (2000) Prologue: 'women's environmental rights: a manifesto'. IN BORDEN, I., RENDELL, J. &amp; PENNER, B. (Eds.) Gender space architecture: an interdisciplinary introduction. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design,&lt;ref&gt;ATTFIELD, J. (1989) Form/female follows function/male: Feminist critiques of design. IN WALKER, J. A. &amp; ATTFIELD, J. (Eds.) Design history and the history of design. London, Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; which are: 
#Gender differences related to critique and reconstruction of architectural practice and history.&lt;ref name="MORTON"&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Feminist Theory. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The struggle for equal access to training, jobs and recognition in architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;
#The focus on gender based theories for the built environment, the architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;

Designers that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment.&lt;ref name="WEISMAN" /&gt; It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.

==The economic design value==
Many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;PYE, D. (1978) The nature and aesthetics of design, London, Barrie &amp; Jenkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACKSON, L. (Ed.) (1992) Strategic study of the profession: phase 1: strategic overview, London, Royal Institute of British Architects.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'.&lt;ref&gt;BLAU, J. R. (1984) Architects and firms: a sociological perspective on architectural practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours.&lt;ref name="CUFF"&gt;CUFF, D. (1991) Architecture: the story of practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: 
#Best design works comes from offices or individual designers which are willing to put in overtime (sometimes unpaid) for the sake of the design outcome.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Good architecture and design is rarely possible within fees offered by clients.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Architects and designers should care enough about buildings or products to uphold high design standards regardless of the payment offered.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;

The 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.

==The novel design value==
It is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.&lt;ref&gt;PORTER, D. (2000) Why do architects wear black? thinking beyond the trap. IN TOFT, A. E. (Ed.) Ethics in architecture : architectural education in the epoch of virtuality. [Leuven], European Association for Architectural Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as [[Modernism]], with is emphasis on “starting from zero”.&lt;ref&gt;WOLFE, T. (1981) From bauhaus to our house, London, Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges.&lt;ref&gt;LAWSON, B. (1997) How designers think: the design process demystified, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ROWE, P. G. (1987) Design thinking, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CROSS, N. (2004) Expertise in design: an overview. Design Studies, 25, 427 - 441.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.

The design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not.&lt;ref&gt;COLLINS, P. (1971) Architectural judgement, London, Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.

==Mathematical and scientific design values==
A movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of [[Christopher Alexander]] in the 1960s, ''[[Notes on the synthesis of form]]''. Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's [[Space syntax]] and Michael Batty's work on [[Spatial analysis]]. In architecture, the four-volume work [[The Nature of Order]] by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example [[A Theory of Architecture]]  is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia.  This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.

Social and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and in by [[Nikos Salingaros]] and others in the book "Biophilic Design".

An '''''aulos''''' ({{lang-grc|αὐλός}}, plural {{lang|grc|αὐλοί}}, ''auloi''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dau%29lo%2Fs αὐλός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''''tibia''''' ([[Latin]]) was an [[Music in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[wind instrument]], depicted often in [[Greek art|art]] and also attested by [[classical archaeology|archaeology]].

An '''aulete''' ({{Lang|grc|αὐλητής}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|aulētēs}}) was the musician who performed on an ''aulos''. The [[Music of ancient Rome|ancient Roman equivalent]] was the '''''tibicen''''' (plural ''tibicines''), from the Latin ''tibia,'' "pipe, ''aulos''." The [[neologism]] '''aulode''' is sometimes used by analogy with ''[[rhapsode]]'' and ''citharode'' ([[citharede]]) to refer to an ''aulos'' player, who may also be called an '''aulist'''; however, '''aulode''' more commonly refers to a singer who sang the accompaniment to a piece played on the aulos.

==Types==
[[File:Britannica Aulos Beak Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|70px|left|Drawing of the mouthpiece of an ''aulos''.&lt;ref&gt;Based on archaeological remains found at [[Pompeii]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There were several kinds of ''aulos'', single or double. The most common variety was a reed instrument.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt; Archeological finds, surviving iconography and other evidence indicate that it was [[double-reed]]ed, like the modern [[oboe]], but with a larger mouthpiece, like the surviving [[Armenia]]n [[duduk]].&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book |last= West |first= Martin L. |title=Ancient Greek Music |publisher= [[Clarendon Press]] |quote="The single reed or clarinet mouthpiece was known to other ancient peoples, and I should not venture to assert that it was not known to the Greeks. But the evidence of both art and literature indicates that it was the double reed that was standard in the Classical period. Under the Hornbostel-Sachs system, therefore, the aulos should be classified as an oboe. It must be admitted that 'oboe-girl' is less evocative than the 'flute-girl' to which classicists have been accustomed, and that when it is a question of translating Greek poetry 'oboe' is likely to sound odd. For the latter case I favor 'pipe' or 'shawm.'" |date=January 1992 |isbn= 0-19-814975-1 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=So-Qpz6WDS4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single pipe without a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] was called the ''monaulos'' (''μόναυλος'', from ''μόνος'' "single").&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Albert A.|year=1893|title=The Αὐλός or Tibia|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|publisher=Department of the Classics, Harvard University|volume=4|pages=1–60|doi=10.2307/310399}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2006-08-16 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A single pipe held horizontally, as the modern flute, was the ''plagiaulos'' (''πλαγίαυλος'', from ''πλάγιος'' "sideways").&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; A pipe with a bag to allow for continuous sound, that is a [[bagpipe]], was the ''askaulos'' (ἀσκαυλός from ἀσκός ''askos'' "[[wine-skin]]").&lt;ref name="google15"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOfuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 William Flood. "The Story of the Bagpipe" p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though ''aulos'' is often erroneously translated as "flute", it was a double-reeded instrument, and its sound — described as "penetrating, insisting and exciting"&lt;ref&gt;The History of Musical Instruments, Curt Sachs, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; — was more akin to that of the [[bagpipes]], with a [[chanter]] and (modulated) [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Like the [[Great Highland Bagpipe]], the ''aulos'' has been used for [[Military band|martial music]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.17.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 1.17.1], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  but it is more frequently depicted in other social settings. It was the standard accompaniment of the passionate [[elegiac couplet#Greek origins|elegiac poetry]]. It also accompanied physical activities such as wrestling matches, the broad jump, the discus throw and to mark the rowing cadence on [[trireme]]s, as well as sacrifices and dramas.&lt;ref name="West" /&gt; [[Plato]] associates it with the ecstatic cults of [[Dionysus]] and the [[Korybantes]], banning it from his [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] but reintroducing it in "Laws".

It appears that some variants of the instrument were loud, shrill, and therefore very hard to blow. A leather strap, called a ''phorbeiá'' (''φορβεία'') in [[ancient Greek|Greek]] or ''capistrum'' in [[Latin]], was worn horizontally around the head with a hole for the mouth by the ''auletai'' to help support the lips and avoid excessive strain on the cheeks due to continuous blowing. Sometimes a second strap was used over the top of the head to prevent the ''phorbeiá'' from slipping down. Aulos players are sometimes depicted with puffed cheeks. The playing technique almost certainly made use of [[circular breathing]], very much like the [[Sardinia]]n [[launeddas]] and [[Armenia]]n [[duduk]], and this would give the aulos a continuous sound.
[[File:Britannica Aulos Plagiaulos.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a ''plagiaulos''.]]
Although aristocrats with sufficient leisure sometimes practiced aulos-playing as they did the [[lyre]], after the later fifth century the aulos became chiefly associated with professional musicians, often slaves. Nevertheless, such musicians could achieve fame. The Romano-Greek writer [[Lucian]] discusses aulos playing in his dialogue ''Harmonides'', in which [[Alexander the Great]]'s aulete [[Timotheus (aulist)|Timotheus]] discusses fame with his pupil Harmonides. Timotheus advises him to impress the experts within his profession rather than seek popular approval in big public venues. If leading musicians admire him, popular approval will follow. However, Lucian reports that Harmonides died from excessive blowing during practicing.

==Mythic origin==
[[File:Sarcophagus Apollo Marsyas Louvre Ma2347.jpg|thumb|350px|The competition between Marsyas and Apollo on a Roman [[sarcophagus]] ''(290–300)'']]
[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Poeta Tragico - Theater 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Theatrical scene from a [[Pompeii]]an [[mosaic]] showing a performer with an aulos and phorbeiá.]]
{{Main|Marsyas}}
In myth, [[Marsyas]] the [[satyr]] was supposed to have invented the aulos, or else picked it up after [[Athena]] had thrown it away because it caused her cheeks to puff out and ruined her beauty. In any case, he challenged [[Apollo]] to a musical contest, where the winner would be able to "do whatever he wanted" to the loser—Marsyas's expectation, typical of a satyr, was that this would be sexual in nature. But Apollo and his lyre beat [[Marsyas]] and his aulos. And since the pure lord of [[Delphi]]'s mind worked in different ways from Marsyas's, he celebrated his victory by stringing his opponent up from a tree and [[flaying]] him alive. King [[Midas]] was cursed with donkey's ears for judging Apollo as the lesser player. Marsyas's blood and the tears of the Muses formed the river Marsyas in Asia Minor.&lt;ref name=goldhill&gt;{{cite book|editors=Simon Goldhill, Ron Osborne|title=Performance Culture and Athenian Democracy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara wedding.jpg|thumb|An aulos flute (right) and other instruments appear in this Hellenistic frieze from [[Jamal Garhi]] in [[Gandhara]].]]
{{citation needed span|This tale was a warning against committing the sin of "[[hubris]]", or overweening pride, in that Marsyas thought he might win against a god. Strange and brutal as it is, this myth reflects a great many cultural tensions that the Greeks expressed in the opposition they often drew between the lyre and aulos: freedom vs. servility and tyranny, leisured amateurs vs. professionals, moderation ([[sophrosyne]]) vs. excess, etc. Some of this is a result of 19th century AD "classical interpretation", i.e. Apollo versus Dionysus, or "Reason" (represented by the kithara) opposed to "Madness" (represented by the aulos). In the temple to Apollo at Delphi, there was also a shrine to Dionysus, and his Maenads are shown on drinking cups playing the aulos, but Dionysus is sometimes shown holding a [[kithara]] or lyre. So a modern interpretation can be a little more complicated than just simple duality.|date=December 2017}}

This opposition is mostly an Athenian one.  It might be surmised that things were different at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], which was a center of aulos-playing.  At [[Sparta]] &amp;ndash; which had no Bacchic or Korybantic cults to serve as contrast &amp;ndash; the aulos was actually associated with ''Apollo'', and accompanied the [[hoplites]] into battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/hoplite/|title=Hoplite|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction in  art==
=== Chigi vase ===
The battle scene on the [[Chigi vase]] shows an aulos player setting a lyrical rhythm for the [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]] to advance to. This accompaniment reduced the possibility of an opening in the formation of the blockage; the aulete had a fundamental role in insuring the integrity of the phalanx. In this particular scene, the phalanx approaching from the left is unprepared and momentarily outnumbered four to five. More soldiers can be seen running up to assist them from behind. Even though the front four are lacking a fifth soldier, they have the advantage because the aulete is there to bring the formation back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey M.|title=Reading the Chigi Vase|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=71|issue=1|year=2002|pages=1–22|jstor=3182058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Herakles in his tenth labor ===
An amphora from ca. 540-530 B.C. depicts [[Herakles]] in the process of completing his [[Labours of Hercules|tenth labor]]. Auletes can be seen playing in a procession going around on the neck of the amphora.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Mary B.|title=Herakles Takes Aim: A Rare Attic Black-Figured Neck-Amphora Attributed to the Princeton Painter|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=48|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern use and popular culture==
The sounds of the aulos are being digitally recreated by the Ancient Instruments Sound/Timbre Reconstruction Application ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150627231112/http://www.astraproject.org/index.html ASTRA]) project which uses [[physical modeling synthesis]] to simulate the aulos sounds. Due to the complexity of this process the ASTRA project uses [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905091435/http://www.isgtw.org/ grid computing] to model sounds on hundreds of computers throughout Europe simultaneously.

The aulos is part of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090902021150/http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1001954 Lost Sounds Orchestra], alongside other ancient instruments which ASTRA have recreated the sounds of, including the [[epigonion]], the [[salpinx]], the [[barbiton]] and the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]].

The Aulos was also featured in the movie [[Agora (film)|''Agora'']], wherein a character performs a solo in an amphitheatre. It is also visible in the movie [[300 (film)|300]].

{{Culture of Australia}}
'''Australian folklore''' refers to the [[folklore]] and [[urban legends]] that have evolved in Australia from [[Aboriginal Australian]] myths to colonial and [[contemporary]] folklore including [[Australians|people]], places and events, that have played part in shaping the [[Australian culture|culture]], image and traditions that are seen today in Australia.

==Australian Aboriginal mythology==
{{main|Australian Aboriginal mythology}}
*[[Baijini]] - Unknown race mentioned in [[Yolngu]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/340571/AHM_21-36.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Bora (Australian)|Bora]] - Sacred Aboriginal initiation ceremony. Many sites still exist throughout Australia.
*[[Bunyip]] – According to legend, they are said to lurk in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds, and waterholes.
*[[Dreamtime]] - The Dreamtime to [[Aboriginal Australians]] is the beginning of time, the creation of knowledge from which their culture began more than 60,000 years ago.

*[[Lake Mungo remains]] - Human skeletons found in 1969, believed to have lived between 40,000 and 68,000 years ago are the oldest human remains found in Australia.
*[[Rainbow Serpent]] – It is the sometimes unpredictable Rainbow Serpent, who vies with the ever-reliable Sun, that replenishes the stores of water, forming gullies and deep channels as he slithered across the landscape, allowing for the collection and distribution of water.
*[[Yara-ma-yha-who]] - According to Myth, the creature resembles a red frog-like creature that hides in trees waiting for an unsuspecting victim to consume.

== Animals &amp; Creatures ==
*[[Bob the Railway Dog]] - A Dog that was remembered for traveling along the South Australian Railway.
*[[Booie, Queensland#urban legend|Booie Monster]] - Reports of a monster lurking in a cave first reported in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gympietimes.com.au/news/cave-monster-legend-never-buried-for-gympie-family/3206191/#/0&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Drop bear]] – Stories of drop bears are frequently related to visiting tourists as a joke. (see also the [[Queensland tiger]])

[[File:"Benjamin".jpg|thumb|right|The last known thylacine photograph taken in 1933]]
*[[Megalania]] – A giant [[goanna]] (lizard), generally believed to be extinct.

*[[Platypus]] - Native Australian animal which is one of only two mammals that lay eggs (the other being the [[echidna]]), and one of the few species that is venomous. Due to its unique features the scientist who initially discovered and examined the creature thought it was made of several animals sewn together and deemed it to be a [[hoax]].
*[[Red Dog (Pilbara)|Red Dog]] - A dog that was known for his long travels through Western Australia's Pilbara region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiasnorthwest.com/Things_to_see_and_do/red-dog---the-pilbara-wanderer&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]] – Despite the widely held view that the thylacine (or Tasmanian tiger) became extinct during the 1930s, accounts of alleged sightings in eastern Victoria and parts of Tasmania have persisted to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2017/04/scientists-search-for-extinct-tasmanian-tiger/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Yowie (cryptid)]] – In the modern context, the Yowie is the generic (and somewhat affectionate) term for an unidentified hominid reputed to lurk in the Australian wilderness, analogous to the Himalayan [[Yeti]] and the North American [[Bigfoot]].
*The [[Dog on the Tuckerbox]] - an allegorical bullock driver's dog that loyally guarded the man's tuckerbox until its death. It has been immortalized in both a poem and a statue at Gundagai in southern NSW.  By way of explanation - tucker means food - so a tuckerbox is a (food) lunch box.

==Historical Events==

== People ==
[[Image:John batman.jpg|thumb|120px|[[John Batman]]]]
*[[John Batman]] - 19th century pioneer, controversial with how he dealt with [[Indigenous Australians]], but nevertheless signed a peaceful agreement with the [[Wurundjeri]] known as [[Batman's Treaty]] which would eventuality lead to the [[Foundation of Melbourne]]
[[Image:Donald Bradman australian cricket player pic.JPG|right|thumb|120px|[[Don Bradman]]]]
[[Image:Ned kelly day before execution photograph.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Ned Kelly]]]]
*[[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]] – Perhaps the greatest cricketer ever, the fact that he needed only 4 runs in his last innings in order to retire with a test average of 100 but was uncharacteristically bowled for a duck (leaving him stranded on an average of 99.94) has become a part of Australian folklore and added greatly to his mystique. (there are rumours that he has made the 4 runs in another match that was miscounted)
*[[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] – Australian convict who escaped and became famous for living in an Aboriginal community for more than thirty years. Believed by many Australians to be the source of the saying [[William Buckley (convict)#You've got Buckley's Chance|"You've got Buckley's Chance"]].
*[[Azaria Chamberlain]] – the name of two-month-old Australian baby who disappeared on the night of 17 August 1980 on a camping trip with her family. Her parents, Lindy Chamberlain and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a [[dingo]], but they were arrested, tried, and convicted of her murder in 1982. Both were later cleared, and thus the case is best remembered for what was an injustice. The Chamberlains were [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and an urban myth had developed that they were required to sacrifice a child as part of their religious beliefs and that the name Azaria meant "sacrifice". These statements are false.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/comment/a-dingo-took-baby-azaria-chamberlain-the-case-that-shattered-faith-in-the-jury-system-20170112-gtqj6f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Errol Flynn]] - first Australian born actor to achieve significant fame in [[Hollywood]].
*[[Dawn Fraser]] –  perhaps the greatest Australian female swimmer of all time. Known for her [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] behaviour or [[larrikinism|larrikin]] character as much as her athletic ability, Fraser won eight Olympic medals, including four golds, and six [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medals. It was alleged that she took the flag from Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s palace, while this was proved false, the incident became part of the folklore.
*[[Harold Holt]] – a [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] who [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|disappeared while swimming]] in 1967. Conspiracy theories include Holt being picked up by a Chinese submarine, faking his own death, suicide, and CIA involvement. Formal investigations determined that he drowned accidentally.
*[[Ned Kelly]] – Australian 19th-century [[bushranger]], many films, books and artworks have been made about him, possibly his exploits have been exaggerated in the public eye and become something of folklore. It especially surrounds his capture at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]] where the Kelly gang tried to derail a train of Victorian police which were arriving, and were surrounded in the hotel. Kelly had made armour from stolen iron mould boards of ploughs, and came out shooting, whereupon he was shot in the legs. Some consider him as Australia's [[Robin Hood]] whiles others would disagree.
[[File:Lalor.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Peter Lalor]]]]
*[[Peter Lalor]] - An Irish-Australian rebel in the [[Eureka Stockade]] who later became the only outlaw to make it to parliament.
*[[Eddie Mabo]] - challenged the Australian Government as to who owned the island of Mer where he was born and lived.

[[File:John Longstaff - Banjo Paterson, 1935.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[John Longstaff]]'s portrait of Banjo Paterson]]
*[[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] – an Australian opera [[soprano]], the first Australian to achieve international recognition in the form. The French dessert [[peach Melba]] is named after her. Many old theatre halls in regional Australia persist with rumours that she once graced their stage, most notably, that of the gold mining town of [[Gulgong, New South Wales]]. She is also remembered in the vernacular Australian expression "more comebacks than Nellie Melba", which satirised her seemingly endless series of "retirement" tours in the 1920s.
*[[Bert Newton]] - Looked upon as the most influential man in the history of Australian television.
*[[Pintupi Nine]] - Last indigenous Australian tribe who lived a traditional hunter-gatherer life in the [[Gibson Desert]] until they were discovered in 1984, almost 200 years since first colonization.

*[[White woman of Gippsland]] - A European woman who was allegedly held captive by Aboriginals against her will in the 1840s, although her existence has been debated.

== Places &amp; Structures==
*[[Finke River]] – "Oldest river in the world", a claim that has been attributed to "scientists" by a generation of [[central Australian]] bus drivers and tour brochure writers. Parts of the Finke River are likely the [[List of rivers by age|oldest major river known in the world]] or among the oldest, as shown in scientific literature, but this does not apply to the southern part of the river.   Neighboring, smaller rivers are just as old.
[[File:Pine Gap by Skyring.jpg|thumb|right|Pine Gap in The [[Northern Territory]]]]
*[[Franklin House (Launceston)#Review of haunting claims|Franklin House]] - Historic house in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] that has had reports of ghost sightings.
*[[Gallipoli]] – the name of a peninsula in [[Turkey]], but also the name given to the Allied [[Battle of Gallipoli|campaign]] on that peninsula during [[World War I]]. There were around 180,000 Allied casualties and 220,000 Turkish casualties. This campaign has become a "[[founding myth]]" for both Australia and [[New Zealand]], and [[Anzac Day]] is still commemorated as a holiday in both countries. The idea that Australian soldiers were mowed down by Turkish gunfire following stupid decisions of the British commanding officers is part of the folklore, as is the escape from Gallipoli, where the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s used rifles rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger to make it seem like there were still soldiers in the trenches as they were leaving. Another aspect of the [[ANZAC spirit]] is the story of [[Simpson and his donkey]].
*[[The bush#Australia|Gentle Annie]] - Name for selected especially steep sections of bush roads, difficult to climb in wet weather.  The folk term may have arisen as early as in bullock team days, whether drawing wagons or timber jinkers.
*[[Gympie Pyramid]] - A small pyramid like structure in [[Gympie]], [[Queensland]] (That has been mostly destroyed) that many believe to be a construction made by Chinese or Incan origin. Although researchers would more likely argue that it is a [[hoax]]. In the Ancient Indian poem [[Ramayana]], the structure is said to be mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.booksfact.com/archeology/gympie-pyramid-australia-in-ramayana.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Monte Cristo Homestead]] - Historic estate in [[Junee, New South Wales]], said to be the most Haunted property in Australia.
*[[Parkes Observatory]] – Landmark in New South Wales, responsible for helping NASA broadcast the [[moon landing]]s to the world.

*[[Australian regional rivalries|Sydney–Melbourne rivalry]] – there has been a long-standing rivalry, usually friendly yet sometimes heated, between the cities of Melbourne and Sydney, the two largest cities in Australia. It was this very rivalry that ultimately acted as the catalyst for the eventual founding of [[Canberra]] as the capital city of Australia.
[[File:Sydney Opera House, botanic gardens 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Opera House, backed by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], from the eastern [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens]]]]
*[[Snowy River]] – immortalised in another Banjo Paterson poem, "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]". The river has received much attention of late for now being nothing more than a trickle, and in fact has become a symbol for wider Australian interest in the health of its great rivers, particularly those in the [[Murray-Darling basin]].
*[[St James railway station, Sydney#Underground tunnels|St James station Underground tunnels]] - The tunnel is home to many urban legends including being a secret military bunker during World War II and a large bell that sounds like [[Big Ben]].
*[[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] &amp; [[Sydney Opera House]] – Two of Australia's most famous national landmarks. Know to people worldwide and cementing [[Sydney]] as Australia's global city.
*[[The Great Barrier Reef]] – the only landmark in Australia (or Oceania) to be one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]].
*[[Uluru]] - Large sandstone rock formation in central Australia. Has great cultural significance to Aboriginal Australians and is one of Australia's most famous landmarks.
*[[Westall UFO|Westall]] - biggest UFO sighting in Australian history, what actually was sighted remains a mystery to this day.
*[[Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort]] - Oldest European building in Australia, built in 1629 by survivors of the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]] shipwreck in which a mutiny took place.

== Socio-political events ==
* [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] – a real political crisis that has since taken on mythic proportions and elevated the protagonists to legendary status (depending on which side of the debate one takes). A visiting American politician at the time wryly observed that he was sure he had only heard the tip of the ice cube. [[Gough Whitlam]]'s speech "Well may we say [[God save the Queen]], because nothing will save the [[Governor General]]" is replayed frequently.
[[Image:Eureka stockade battle.jpg|thumb|330|right|Eureka Stockade battle by J. B. Henderson]]
* [[Eureka stockade]] – A miners' revolt in 1854 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia against the officials supervising the gold-mining region of [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], in particular, the high prices of digging licenses. It is often regarded as the "Birth of Australian Democracy" and an event of equal significance to [[History of Australia|Australian history]] as the [[storming of the Bastille]] was to [[History of France|French history]], but almost equally often dismissed as being of little or no consequence. 
* [[The Stolen Generation]] - From the late 1800s to the early 1970s, young Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their families as children between the 1900s and the 1960s, to be brought up by white foster families or in institutions. In 1999 then-prime minister [[John Howard]] avoided using the word "sorry", to the families. In 2008 [[Kevin Rudd]] made an official apology to the stolen generation and their families, on behalf of the Australian government.
* [[Tenterfield Oration]] - Speech given by [[Sir Henry Parkes]] in 1889 calling for the six Australian colonies to be Federated, which would eventually lead to the [[Commonwealth of Australia]].

== Sport ==
*[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] - Hailed as one of, if not the greatest [[Olympic games]] of all time, It captured the imagination of an entire country and gave birth to many Australian sporting moments and icons including [[Cathy Freeman]] &amp; [[Ian Thorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-15/sydney-games-a-lasting-legacy/2260648&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Australia II]]'' – A [[12-metre class]] [[yacht]] that was the first successful challenger for the [[America's Cup]] after 132 years. On the morning of the victory (Australian time) the then Australian Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]], famously said that any employer who sacked any of their employees for not coming in that day was a "bum". The challenge also resulted in the popularisation of the [[boxing kangaroo]] representation.
[[Image:Phar Lap wins the Melbourne Cup.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Portrayal of [[Phar Lap]] winning the 1930 Melbourne Cup, from the 1983 movie "Phar Lap"]]
*[[Collingwood Football Club|Colliwobbles]] – The "colliwobbles" refers to the [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood Football Club's]] apparent penchant for losing grand finals over a 32-year period between 1958 and 1990. During this premiership drought, fans endured nine fruitless grand finals (1960, 1964, 1966, 1970, 1977 (drawn, then lost in a replay the following week), 1979, 1980, 1981). The term "Colliwobbles" was to enter the Victorian vocabulary to signify a choking phenomenon.
*[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|The Invincibles]] - First [[Test cricket|Test match]] side to play an entire tour of England without losing, and is often considered to be one of the greatest cricket teams of all time.
*[[Kennett curse]] - A 5-year winning streak [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] had over [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] over comments made by then  Hawthorn club President [[Jeff Kennett]] saying that Geelong does not have the mental drive to defeat Hawthorn. Most games were decided by ten points or less and are considered some of the best in recent memory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/geelong-cats-got-your-tongue-no-but-theyve-got-your-measure/news-story/fc4d17ab1251697ed8e283b3ab9f6c39&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Phar Lap]] – A [[thoroughbred]] horse who is considered by many to be the world's greatest [[horse-racing|racehorse]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}, and is probably subject to more conspiracy theories than any other racehorse (in relation to the cause of his death). His name entered the Australian lexicon in the expression "to have a heart bigger than Phar Lap's", referring to someone's tenacity and courage. It is part of Australian folklore that Phar Lap's heart was physically twice the size of the average horse's heart.
*[[Steven Bradbury]] - An Australian short track speed skater who memorably won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics at the 1,000 m short track, going from last to first after all other skaters were involved in a pile-up during the final metres. This led to the phrase 'doing a Bradbury', meaning to achieve something with the odds stacked against you.

The major [[effects of the automobile on societies]] include the development of diverse customs and [[tradition]]s.
[[Image:Januaristormens förödelse.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Car accident omen]]

Some drivers believe that a new car is in greater danger than a used car of getting into an accident or having a collision.{{why|date=April 2018}} Some drivers will leave change under their seats. Others use one coin to scratch the car, based on the (false) belief that since the car is new and nothing has happened to it yet, the chances of something bad happening to the car is greater when compared to a used car which already has its fair share of dents and scratches. In hopes of preventing a high damaging accident, they will place a small nick or scratch on the car in an area where it will not be seen. The inside of the wheel well is one commonly scratched area.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

There are also a few practices associated with graduations. In the days leading up to a graduation, some drivers (and in some cases friends of the driver) will write on the car windows with washable paint. The messages usually congratulate the driver of the car and list the driver’s school and year of graduation. After graduating from high school or college, some drivers choose to hang their tassel from the rearview mirror.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

Some people throw change under a bed in hopes of bringing good luck to the new home. Change is known world wide as a good luck charm.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Mourning Car.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mourning Car decked with flags]]

==Religious==

There are also religious acts that are associated with automobiles. This can include getting the car blessed by a cleric or placing an object of religious significance inside the car.

A predominately [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] practice is to place a medal of [[Saint Christopher]], the patron saint of truck drivers and travelers in general,&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-christopher/ ''“Saint Christopher“''] Saints.SQPN.com. (Accessed 20/12/14)&lt;/ref&gt; inside the car.  Usually, the driver will have this medal blessed by a priest.  An ancient legend, mentioned by [[Erasmus]] in the ''[[Praise of Folly]]'', holds that those who see an image of Saint Christopher cannot die through misadventure during that day.  Not surprisingly,  images of Saint Christopher became popular automobile accessories.  Through the presence of the medal, the driver is asking the Saint to pray on his or her behalf for a safe and uneventful journey.

A somewhat more sombre purpose originally stood behind the familiar [[Depiction of Jesus|plastic Jesus]] that some Christians have mounted on their dashboards.  The original plastic Jesus was circulated by the [[Sacred Heart Auto League]], founded in 1955 by Father Gregory Bezy, [[Priests of the Sacred Heart|SCJ]].  This devotional society placed the traditional Roman Catholic figure of Jesus displaying his [[Sacred Heart]] on the dashboard.  Father Bezy was moved to do this as a "practical answer to what he considered the ever-increasing dangers of our overcrowded streets and highways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shl.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AutoLeague&amp;JServSessionIdr005=5jpwoj3pk1.app2a Sacred Heart Auto League], official site. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, in the event of a fatal accident, Father Bezy hoped that the last thing the riders would see would be the image of Jesus, and as such face Eternity with faith and contrition.

The plastic dashboard Jesus proved popular among non-Catholic Christians as well.  The figure is well known enough to have inspired a [[folk song]] ''Plastic Jesus'', originally attributed to [[Ed Rush]] and [[George Cromarty]], which has acquired many anonymous folk variants.  One frequent set of verses has it open:

:''I don't care if it rains or freezes&lt;br&gt;Long as I got my Plastic Jesus&lt;br&gt;Riding on the dashboard of my car.''
:''Through my trials and tribulations&lt;br&gt;And my travels through the nations&lt;br&gt;With my Plastic Jesus I'll go far.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/plastic0.htm ''Plastic Jesus''] lyrics and chords. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholics will also hang [[rosary beads]] from their rearview mirror.

Catholics and other Christians may also hang crosses or [[crucifix]]es from the rearview mirror.

==Cars for special occasions==
[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood Wedding.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wedding Transport]]
Cars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of [[wedding]]s and [[graduation]]s.

[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood hearse 1990s.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Hearse]]
[[Image:Limosin vid Keybar - Avenyn - i Göteborg, 11 aug 2006.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Limousine]]
A frequent [[wedding tradition]] in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony.  Typically, various ribbons and streamers are attached, and words written upon the surface of the vehicle, and often [[tin can]]s are attached to its fenders or bumpers by strings to serve as noisemakers.  [[Jan Brunvand]]'s ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the [[Charivari|shivaree]], a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when [[honeymoon]] travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Weddings")&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as [[limousines]].

==Truck drivers and taxicab drivers==
[[Image:LKWs.gif|left|thumb|180px|Trucks and Truck Drivers]]
[[Image:CB-Handfunkgeraet.jpg|right|thumb|180px|CB Radio]]
Various professions revolving around motor vehicles acquire a folklore of their own.  [[Truck driver]]s, since they tend to work in isolation, tend to develop a social network of their own.  They circulate a number of [[tall tale]]s that relate generally to their profession, usually involving the outwitting of [[state police]] and other traffic or tax authorities.  They also create an elaborate body of customs and lore surrounding the use of [[citizen's band radio]], with its own jargon and "[[pseudonym|handles]]", which came to national notice in the 1970s.  A widespread bit of popular folklore circulated among other motorists that truck drivers knew which [[restaurant]]s to patronize and which to avoid, so eateries that were obviously frequented by truck drivers were esteemed by the general public.  With the arise of national restaurant chains, this bit of folklore is fading.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Truck drivers")&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar folklore surrounds [[taxicab]] drivers, involving the tales they tell among each other, and the tales that circulate about them.
[[Image:Checker.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Taxicab]]

==Car coining==

There is a practice in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins onto the floor of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one.  Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars.  The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of his own money, he could always reach down and find some extra money on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchill.com/car-insurance/tips/driving-rituals&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBC Radio Cymru''' is [[BBC Cymru Wales]]' [[Welsh-language]] national radio network. It broadcasts two stations throughout Wales from studios in [[Cardiff]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Carmarthen]] on [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], digital TV and online. 

The main network broadcasts for {{frac|18|1|2}} hours a day from 5:30am to midnight with overnight programming carried from [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] during downtime. A second station, Radio Cymru 2, broadcasts on digital and online platforms, and provides separate breakfast programming for two hours every morning.

The managing editor of BBC Radio Cymru is Betsan Powys.

==Overview==
BBC Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the morning of Monday 3 January 1977, its first programme being an extended news bulletin presented at 6:45am by Gwyn Llewellyn and Geraint Jones. This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show ''{{lang|cy|Helo Bobol!}}'', presented by [[Hywel Gwynfryn]] with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was ''Ffrindiau Bore Oes'' by Hergest.

The station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] and, before that, the BBC Welsh [[BBC Regional Programme|Regional Programme]]).

At the time of the station's launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting exclusively on FM (VHF). Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime &amp; early evening and a number of off-peak opt outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed.

In November 1979, Radio Cymru's programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day.

Later developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, ''[[C2 (radio)|C2]]'', and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of [[Swansea City A.F.C.]] matches. The station has also been streaming online since January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Radio Cymru is similar in format to many "general" radio stations, with news programmes at breakfast (''{{lang|cy|Post Cyntaf}}'', 'First Post'), lunchtime (''{{lang|cy|Taro'r Post}}'' – a debate-centred programme), and [[drive-time]] (''{{lang|cy|Post Prynhawn}}'', 'Afternoon Post'); together with presenter-driven sequences mixing music with chat to invited studio guests, calls from listeners, competitions etc. Radio Cymru also produces drama, features, current affairs, youth, and sports programming. 

Over the years, it has done much to promote the language, with its sports commentators coining new terms which later became accepted by Welsh [[linguistics|linguists]]. One of its more unusual - and longest-running - programmes is ''{{lang|cy|Y Talwrn}}'', a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics.

==Listening figures==
As of March 2018, the station had 121,000 weekly listeners and a 2.9% market share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php RAJAR]&lt;/ref&gt; An average Radio Cymru listener listened to the station for 12.4 hours each week. Radio Cymru has seen its weekly audience increase by 2,000 listeners since March 2017, where its weekly audience amounted to 119,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.info/radio/stations/bbc-radio-cymru/listening-figures|title=BBC Radio Cymru - listening figures|website=media.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio Cymru 2==
On Monday 19 September 2016, BBC Cymru launched a second radio service, ''Radio Cymru Mwy'' (Radio Cymru More), as a trial pop-up station broadcasting for three months in the run-up to the station's 40th anniversary. Consisting of five hours of music-led entertainment programming each weekday, Radio Cymru Mwy was available on DAB in south east Wales and online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-radio-cymru-mwy-digital BBC Radio Cymru Mwy takes to the digital airwaves], bbc.co.uk, 2 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the station closed, BBC Cymru announced it would launch a permanent second station, '''Radio Cymru 2'''. The new service airs for two hours every morning on digital and online platforms, as a music and entertainment alternative to the main network. Radio Cymru's morning output on the main service consists of the breakfast news programme, ''Post Cyntaf'', and a topical magazine show presented by Aled Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-to-boost-wales-national-radio-stations BBC to boost Wales' national radio stations], bbc.co.uk, 23 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

BBC Radio Cymru 2 began broadcasting at 6.30am on Monday 29 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-radio-cymru-2-2018 The countdown begins - BBC Radio Cymru 2 takes to the airwaves in January 2018], bbc.co.uk, 27 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It airs as an opt-out service from 6.30am - 8.30am on weekdays, 7-9am on Saturdays and 8-10am on Sundays. The daily breakfast show broadcasts from Cardiff (Monday - Saturday) and Bangor (Sundays) with short news bulletins on weekdays from Aberystwyth.

'''''Black Like Me''''' (1964) is an American drama film based on the book ''[[Black Like Me]]'' by [[John Howard Griffin]]. The journalist disguised himself to pass as an African-American man for six weeks in 1959 in the Deep South to report on life in the segregated society from the other side of the color line. The film was directed by [[Gerda Lerner|Carl Lerner]] and the screenplay was written by Carl and [[Gerda Lerner]]. The film stars [[James Whitmore]], [[Sorrell Booke]] and [[Roscoe Lee Browne]].

The DVD was released December 11, 2012 in North America from Video Services Corp. The DVD includes a documentary titled ''Uncommon Vision'' about John Howard Griffin, the journalist on which the main character is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/59958/black-like-me|title=Black Like Me: DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2013|website=DVD Talk|last=Hartel|first=Nick|at=The DVD: The Extras|deadurl=no|quote=The film's bonus disc features a 60-min feature length documentary, ''Uncommon Vision: The Life and Times of John Howard Griffin'' on the film's real-life subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
John Finley Horton ([[James Whitmore]]) is a white journalist who artificially darkens his skin in order to pass for a black man.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Critical reception for the film has been mixed. Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' described the film as "melodramatic and unsubtle". He said it failed to place the viewer inside a Negro's skin, and to convince the audience that the protagonist "is truly passing for black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the film after the 2012 DVD release, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a positive 3 out of 4 stars. He said that, although some aspects of the film felt dated, the film's themes were still timely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Maltin, Leonard]]|title=Leonard Maltin's 2014 Movie Guide|date=2014|publisher=[[Penguin Press]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-451-41810-4|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

      <comment>/* China */ Hyphenated the adjectival phrases ‘high-tin’ and ‘low-tin’—a good idea in general, and crucial here, as ‘high’ and ‘low’ could also refer to the physical shape of the sword’s parts rather than their metallurgical composition. Also improved the last sentence, which was a bit awkward.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">[[File:Apa Schwerter.jpg|thumb|300px|Apa type swords, 17th century BC.]]
'''Bronze Age swords''' appeared from around the 17th century BC, in the [[Black Sea]] region and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as a further development of the [[dagger]]. They were replaced by [[Iron Age sword|iron swords]] during the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

From an early time the swords reached lengths in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The technology to produce blades of such lengths appears to have been developed in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]], using  alloys of copper and tin or arsenic, around 1700 BC. [[Bronze Age]] swords were typically not longer than 80&amp;nbsp;cm; weapons significantly shorter than 60&amp;nbsp;cm are variously categorized as ''[[short swords]]'' or daggers. Before about 1400 BC swords remained mostly limited to the Aegean and southeastern Europe, but they became more widespread in the final centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, to Central Europe and Britain, to the Near East, Central Asia, Northern India and to China.

==Predecessors==
[[File:Khopesh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|18th century BC [[Khopesh]], [[Shechem]], [[West Bank]]; blade decorations with [[electrum]] inlays.]]
Before [[bronze]], stone (such as [[flint]] and [[obsidian]]) was used as the primary material for edged cutting tools and weapons. Stone, however, is too brittle for long, thin implements such as swords. With the introduction of [[copper]], and subsequently bronze, knives could be made longer, leading to the sword.

Thus, the development of the sword from the [[dagger]] was gradual, and in 2004 the first "swords" were claimed for the Early Bronze Age (c. 33rd to 31st centuries), based on finds at [[Arslantepe]] by Marcella Frangipane, professor of Prehistory and Protohistory of the Near and Middle East at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dekunukem.deviantart.com/journal/Oldest-Swords-Found-in-Turkey-369725919 Oldest Swords Found in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, M. et.al. 2010: The collapse of the 4th millennium centralised system at Arslantepe and the far-reaching changes in 3rd millennium societies. ORIGINI XXXIV, 2012: 237-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, "The 2002 Exploration Campaign at Arslantepe/Malatya" (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A cache of nine swords and daggers was found; they are made of [[Arsenical bronze|arsenic-copper alloy]]. Among them, three swords were beautifully inlaid with [[silver]].

These are the weapons of a total length of 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm which could be described as either short swords or long daggers. Some other similar swords have been found in Turkey, and are described by Thomas Zimmermann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_b/backbone/rb_1_1.html First Swords] uni-kiel.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword remained extremely rare for another millennium, and became more widespread only with the closing of the 3rd millennium. The "swords" of this later period can still readily be interpreted as daggers, as with the copper specimen from Naxos (dated roughly 2800 to 2300 BC), with a length of just below 36&amp;nbsp;cm, but individual specimens of the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] "copper swords" of the period around 2300 reach a length up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.  The first weapons that can unambiguously be classified as swords are those found in [[Minoan Crete]], dated to about 1700 BC, which reach lengths of more than 100&amp;nbsp;cm. These are the "type A" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.

==Aegean==
{{Further|Military of Mycenaean Greece#Offensive weapons}}

The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (Middle to Late Aegean Bronze Age) swords are classified in types labeled A to H following [[Nancy Sandars|Sandars]] (1961, 1963), the "Sandars typology".&lt;!-- ?Killian-Dirlmeier typology--&gt;
Types A and B (''Tab-tang'') are the earliest from about the 17th to 16th centuries, types C (''Horned swords'') and D (''Cross swords'') from the 15th century, types E and F (''T-hilt swords'') from the 13th and 12th.
The 13th to 12th centuries also see a revival of the "Horned" type, classified as types G and H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords and daggers in Late Bronze Age Canaan |last=Shalev |first=Sariel |page=62 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-515-08198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type H swords are associated with the [[Sea Peoples]] and were found in  Anatolia ([[Pergamon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Omero tremila anni dopo: atti del Congresso di Genova, 6-8 luglio 2000 |chapter=Anatolia and the Eastern Aegean at the time of the Trojan War |last=Benzi |first=Marion |editor=Franco Montanari, Paola Ascheri |page=384 |year=2002 |publisher=Edizione di Storia e Letteratura |isbn=978-88-8498-059-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Greece.
Contemporary with types E to H is the so-called Naue II type, imported from south-eastern Europe.

Typologically, these swords are of the ''Sögel'' type, but their shape and decoration&lt;ref&gt;
"the decorative lines on the sword blades that had initially been regarded as incrustations consisted of pure copper hammered into channels that had presumably already been produced in the casting process. Thus the swords are among the very few Early Bronze Age examples of a true inlay technique outside the Mediterranean world [...] An interesting parallel to these has now been found in a sword from the parish of Vreta Kloster in Östergötland, Sweden."  Roland Schwab, Inga Ullén, Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich, ''A sword from Vreta Kloster, and black patinated bronze in Early Bronze Age Europe'', Journal of Nordic Archaeological Science 17, 27–35 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; shows influence of the ''Hajdúsámson-Apa'' type found in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;
"Typologically, the swords from Nebra and Vreta belong to the Sögel blades, which copy the shape and decoration of Hajdúsámson-Apa swords [...] Concerning the provenance of the swords, the area between the rivers Danube and Tisza in present-day Hungary and Romania has been suggested, as also the production in present Germany [...] Vandkilde (1996:240) proposed that these swords and daggers of the Sögel and Wohlde type in southern Jutland could have been manufactured locally." Roland Schwab, Inga Ullén, Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich, ''A sword from Vreta Kloster, and black patinated bronze in Early Bronze Age Europe'', Journal of Nordic Archaeological Science 17, 27–35 (2010).

===Naue II===
One of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of prehistoric European swords was the '''Naue II''' type, named for [[Julius Naue]] who first described them and also known as ''Griffzungenschwert'' or "grip-tongue sword". It first appears in c. the 13th century BC in [[Terramare culture|Northern Italy]] (or a general [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] background), and survived well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries, until the 6th century BC. During its lifetime the basic design was maintained, although the material changed from bronze to iron. Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as [[Ugarit]], beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Jung,  M. Mehofer, ''A sword of Naue II type from Ugarit and the Historical Significance of Italian type Weaponry in the Eastern Mediterranean'', Aegean Archaeology 8, 2008, 111–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Naue II swords could be as long as 85&amp;nbsp;cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm range.

Swords from the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] appear from ca. the 13th century BC, often showing characteristic spiral patterns. The early Nordic swords are also comparatively short; a specimen discovered in 1912 near Bragby, Uppland, Sweden, dated to about 1800 to 1500 BC, was just over 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. This sword was, however, classified as of the  Hajdúsámson-Apa type, and was presumably imported. The [[Vreta Kloster]] sword discovered in 1897 (dated 1600 to 1500 BC) has a blade length (the hilt is missing) of 46&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of National Antiquities (Statens Historiska Museum)   inventory number SHM 10419.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical variant for European swords is the '''leaf shaped''' blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, on the [[Bronze Age Britain|British Isles]] in particular.
The '''carp's tongue sword''' is a type of bronze sword that was common to Western Europe during ca. the 9th to 8th centuries BC. The blade of the carp's tongue sword was wide and parallel for most of its length but the final third narrowed into a thin tip intended for thrusting. The design was probably developed in north-western France, and combined the broad blade useful for slashing with a thinner, elongated tip suitable for thrusting. Its advantages saw its adoption across [[Atlantic Europe]]. In Britain, the metalwork in the south east derived its name from this sword: the [[Carp's Tongue complex]]. Notable examples of this type were part of the [[Isleham Hoard]].

The Bronze Age style sword and construction methods died out at the end of the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D)), around 600-500 BC, when swords are once again replaced by daggers in most of Europe. An exception is the [[Xiphos]] from Greece, the development of which continued for several more centuries.
The '''antenna sword''', named for the pair of ornaments suggesting antennae on its hilt,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antennae%20sword&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of the Late Bronze Age, continued in early [[iron swords]] of the [[East Hallstatt]] and Italy region.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis William, The archaeology of Celtic art, 2007,  p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Further|Bronze Age China}}

Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age [[Shang Dynasty]], from roughly 1200 BC. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the [[Warring States period]] and [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 207 BC). Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high-tin edges over softer, lower-tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see the [[sword of Gou Jian]]). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high-tin bronze (17-21% tin), which is very hard and breaks under excess stress, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends instead. China continued to make both iron and bronze swords longer than any other region; iron completely replaced bronze only in the early [[Han Dynasty]].

==India==
{{Further|Ochre Coloured Pottery culture}}
Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings of the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] throughout the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] [[Doab]] region of India, commonly made of copper, but in some instances made of bronze.  Diverse specimens have been discovered in [[Fatehgarh]], where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BC, but were probably used more extensively during  1200-600 BC ([[Painted Grey Ware culture]], [[Iron Age India]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10705">'''Budget albums''' (also known as '''drugstore records''' or, then, '''junk records''') were low-priced vinyl  LPs of [[pop music|popular]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music released during the 1950s to 1970s consisting either of previously released material (usually the releases from major labels featuring older performances of well-known performers) or material recorded especially for the line (often [[cover versions]] of popular songs made famous by name artists sung or performed on these albums by usually unidentified and unknown entertainers). Prices ranged from as low as 59 U.S. cents (minor label releases of the 1950s) to $2.98 (major label repackaging of older material in the 1970s). In the UK [[Pickwick Records]]' [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] record series, which operated between 1968 and 1985, was the most successful budget album range.

==Drugstore debut==
Discount stores (as well as Department stores) have had records produced by them by various record producing companies since the 1910s.  It was fashionable for a chain like McCrory's or Kress to have their own exclusive label.  Most of these records contained songs also available on many other 'exclusive' labels. (For example from the 1920s into the 1930s, Paramount produced the 'Broadway' label for Montgomery Ward, Cameo produced the 'Romeo' label for Kress, Columbia produced the 'Diva' label for W.T. Grant, and Plaza produced the 'Oriole' label for McCrory's, among many others.)

'''Drugstore records''' were called such as they were often sold in metal racks similar to the racks used for [[paperback]] books in [[Pharmacy|drugstores]] or [[Variety store|dimestores]] in the 1960s for prices from half to a quarter of regular [[LP album]]s. These records were markedly less expensive than major label recordings.

The initial "drugstore records" mostly comprised [[popular music]] played or sung by unknown orchestras or singers, or conversely, once famous singers or orchestras playing music or songs that were relatively unknown (popular singers' early and obscure recordings were often showcased as well). 

By the LP era, in some cases (notably the least expensive of the records) the record album would have only one [[cover version]] of a famous song or tune. Many of these albums had attractive [[album cover]] artwork (often picturing beautiful starlets such as [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Irish McCalla]], and the then-unknown [[Mary Tyler Moore]]). The album were often filled out with music in the [[public domain]] or obscure music never recorded by anyone else. Sometimes the "[[orchestra]]s" comprised very few musicians, were performed by background music companies, or were recorded outside the United States by orchestras credited under different names, such as ''[[101 Strings]]''.

Despite major record companies lowering their prices or starting their own budget labels, the budget album companies, such as Coronet who sold their LPs for 99 cents, remained popular.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|page=26|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugstore records originated with [[Pickwick International]], founded by [[Cy Leslie]]. Leslie's first business was a prerecorded [[greeting card]] service that turned into children's record label Voco Records in 1946. In 1950 Leslie founded [[Pickwick Records]] and by 1953 Pickwick entered the [[LP album|LP]] market providing lower priced records.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann, Frank Editor &amp; Ferstler, Howard Technical Editor ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound'' Routledge (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early producer of drugstore records was [[Enoch Light]], who started [[Waldorf Music Hall Records]] under the auspices of the [[F.W. Woolworth]] [[dime store]] chain. Unlike most drugstore record producers, Light was well regarded both  as a musician and for his technical recording knowledge; which he would make much use of later in establishing [[Command Records]].

Probably the best known and most prolific drugstore label was [[Crown Records]], an offshoot of [[Modern Records]], originally a jazz label owned by the Bihari brothers and operated from Los Angeles. From the mid-1950s to the early 80s, Crown turned out hundreds of cheaply produced LPS of country, Hawaiian, Latin, and other musical genres; often performed by pseudonymous studio groups; as well as jazz and blues material reissued from the Modern label.

==Major labels enter the budget album market==
In 1954 Pickwick entered into a licensing arrangement with [[Capitol Records]] giving Pickwick the rights to press and distribute Capitol's secondary and noncurrent titles on their label. Pickwick's records were mostly sold in stores other than record shops such as [[department stores]], [[dimestores]], [[Pharmacy|drugstores]], and [[supermarkets]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; Pickwick later had several subsidiaries such as Bravo, Design, International Award, Hurrah, Grand Prix, and [[Hallmark Records]] in the U.K.

[[RCA Records]] introduced [[RCA Camden Records]] in 1955, a budget label for re-releasing older recordings by currently popular artists on the label or vintage material from previous decades. Occasionally, original music was produced for release on RCA Camden such as children's music and instrumentals. RCA Camden also released single albums of country music recorded especially for the budget label by many of its newer country acts of the 1960s such as [[Connie Smith]], [[Liz Anderson]], and [[Dottie West]] to perhaps encourage sales of the artists' full-priced product. RCA Camden was particularly successful in repackaging older [[Elvis Presley]] recordings on the Camden label, as well as previously released and also unreleased material he recorded for his motion pictures, making these albums among the select few budget albums to actually make the national best-selling charts. At one point the Camden albums were doing so well that two of Presley's major hit singles of the early 1970s - "Burning Love" and "Separate Ways" (and their respective flipsides) made their album debuts not on mainstream RCA released, but on RCA Camden. Not long before Presley's death, RCA sold the Camden label to Pickwick.

The major labels' budget album releases were seldom sold at "drug stores", mainly at [[record shops]] and [[department stores]] just like the full-price product although RCA Camden did on occasion market their albums in speciality "drug store" racks. The major label budget albums usually had eight to ten songs on them (usually nine) as opposed to full-price releases which contained ten to twelve songs.

[[Columbia Records]] re-introduced the [[Harmony Records]] line around the same time for budget releases of older product repackaged. Harmony, however, seldom issued material that had not been previously released (Columbia has used the Harmony name from 1926 through 1932 and again in the late 1940's).

The budget albums' heyday was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when nearly every recording artist of note had one or more such collections on the market. Often these were recordings done for a previous record label before the star's current popularity.

Other major labels of the day with their own budget lines include:
*[[Atlantic Records]] had a short-lived budget label, [[Clarion Records]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/clarion.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cameo-Parkway]] created [[Wyncote Records]]
*[[Columbia Records]]' budget label was [[Harmony Records]]
*[[Decca Records]]' budget label was [[Vocalion Records]]
*[[EMI]] created [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] (In the UK)
*[[Dot Records]]' budget label was [[Hamilton Records]]
*[[Liberty Records]]' budget label was [[Sunset Records]]
*[[Mercury Records]] operated [[Wing Records]]
*[[MGM Records]] released [[Metro Records]] and [[Lion Records (MGM)|Lion Records]]
*[[Modern Records]] created Crown Records&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/crown.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RCA Victor Records]] released [[RCA Camden Records]] 
*[[Starday Records]] (arguably a budget label itself) created Nashville Records
*[[United Artists Records]] produced [[Unart Records]]

Other budget record labels were [[Somerset Records]] that became [[Alshire Records]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="spaceagepop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/shermana.htm|title=Al Sherman|publisher=spaceagepop.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo Fidelity, Audio Spectrum, Peter Rabbit (children's records), Azteca,&lt;ref&gt;Pavlakis, Christopher ''the American Music Handbook" Collier-Macmillan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Score Records, a subsidiary of [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]], Custom, and [[Diplomat Records (budget)|Diplomat Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014435/http://forbiddeneye.com/labels/diplomat.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a product of the [[Synthetic Plastics Company]] who made [[Peter Pan Records]] and Ambassador Records.

In [[United Kingdom|England, UK]] the [[Woolworths Group]] jointly owned [[Embassy Records]] with [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole Records]], later part of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]].

The [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure (MFP)]] label was set up in 1965 as a joint venture between [[EMI]], which provided the source material, and the publisher [[Paul Hamlyn]], which handled distribution in so-called non-traditional outlets, such as [[W.H. Smith]], the booksellers. The MFP catalogue consisted of both original material and reissues of existing EMI recordings.

== Notable artists ==

Notable artists to have begun their careers recording for budget albums include [[Lou Reed]], [[Jerry Cole]],&lt;ref name="hdtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=artistdetail&amp;id=2597|title=Hdtracks - UK Home page &amp;#124; HDtracks - The World's Greatest-Sounding Music Downloads|publisher=hdtracks.com|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Ra]], [[Al Kooper]] and [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]]. Perhaps the most notable artists to emerge from a career as a "cover artist" for budget albums include [[Dolly Parton]], who early in her career as a teenaged vocalist, recorded several covers of [[Kitty Wells]] hits for budget album release, and [[Elton John]], who recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the [[Top of the Pops (record series)|''Top of the Pops'']] album series.

'''Cafeterias del Malecón''' is an architectural project created by the (e)spacios Cuban design group and was shown for the first time at the Architecture [[wikt:biennale|Biennial]] of [[Havana]] in May 2004. It is composed of 5 ephemeral cafeterias, the design of each being inspired by the work of famous Cuban painters.

== The (e)spacios Group ==
The group was founded in 1998, and is composed of the architect Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia and of designers Raidán Valdés Hung and Maikel Sánchez. Their office is situated in [[Old Havana]]. The group’s aim is to erase the border between art, design and architecture.

== The project ==
Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia is the one who first came up with the idea of the [[Malecón]] project. Seeing that every time a building was demolished a cafeteria replaced it, she thought the group could come up with a new style and aesthetics.

With the help of designer Sulumi Sánchez Herrera, the (e)spacios group offered to create five ephemeral cafeterias, made of canvases stretched over metal frameworks. The design of these cafeterias was inspired by the work of five Cuban artists : [[Roberto Fabelo]], Ángel Ramírez, Arturo Montoto, [[Esterio Segura]] and Alfredo Sosabravo. Each cafeteria presents a specificity : the one based on the work of the artist Roberto Fabelo is specialized in seafood; another, inspired by Arturo Montoto’s work and whose theme is “fruity”, only sells vegetarian products etc.

The plans have been showcased at the Architecture Biennial of [[Havana]] in 2004 and received a warm welcoming from locals and art dealers.

The '''Carolinas Nature Photographers Association''' (CNPA) is a [[photography]] group based mainly in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. It is a group focused on photographing [[nature]] and [[wildlife]] and began in 1992. It is approaching 1200 members (May 2016) and is split into 13 regional groups.

Each regional group typically meets monthly to plan photo outings, photo workshops, gallery shows, and the occasional group project. For all of the regions there is one collective Annual Meeting where, for 3 days, there are nationally known nature photographers and educational speakers providing lectures on a variety of nature subjects and opportunities for photo outings, and a Mid-Year Outing that is held at different locations around the region with programs tailored for each location and a focus on field trips.

''Camera in the Wild'' is the official magazine for the Carolina Nature Photographers Association, mailed quarterly to all members.

The '''''Codex coemeterium''''' (sb423 National Library, [[Clementinum]], [[Prague]]) is a 16th-century [[grimoire]] manuscript. The text, composed in [[Latin]], is largely concerned with [[demonology]] and [[necromancy]]. The book falls into [[A.E.

'''Computational creativity''' (also known as '''artificial creativity''', '''mechanical creativity''', '''creative computing''' or '''creative computation''') is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]].

The goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* To construct a [[computer program|program]] or [[computer]] capable of human-level [[creativity]].
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans.
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

==Theoretical issues==
As measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms.  Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process?   Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some ''eminent'' (sometimes referred to as "Creativity" with a capital C) and some ''mundane''.

These are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to ''computational'' creativity:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* Can creativity be hard-wired? In existing systems to which creativity is attributed, is the creativity that of the system or that of the system's programmer or designer?
* How do we evaluate computational creativity? What counts as creativity in a computational system? Are [[natural language generation]] systems creative? Are [[machine translation]] systems creative? What distinguishes research in computational creativity from research in [[artificial intelligence]] generally?
* If eminent creativity is about rule-breaking or the disavowal of convention, how is it possible for an algorithmic system to be creative? In essence, this is a variant of [[Ada Lovelace]]'s objection to machine intelligence, as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The social psychology of creativity|first = Teresa|last = Amabile|year = 1983|publisher = New York, NY: Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do, how can its behavior ever be called ''creative''?

Indeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|booktitle=Design and Planning II-Computers in Design and Communication|year=1967|pages=120–125|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7511/307c10790f077e66844efd1e37e4f084dd1b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a key point in favor of computational creativity.

==Defining creativity in computational terms==

Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The process of creative thinking  | first = Shaw, J. G., and Simon, Herbert A.  |last =  Newell, Allen | year = 1963 | publisher =  H. E. Gruber, G. Terrell and M. Wertheimer (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking, pp 63 – 119. New York: Atherton }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:

# The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
# The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
# The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
# The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a "top-down" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among "bottom-up" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. M. (1991) [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/140338/ NEUROGEN, musical composition using genetic algorithms and cooperating neural networks], Second International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks: 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments involving recurrent nets&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = A connectionist approach to algorithmic composition | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 27–43 | doi=10.2307/3679551}}&lt;/ref&gt; were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.

Concurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by [[Stephen Wolfram]], that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how "rich," "complex," and "wonderful" creative cognition actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = http://newdualism.org/nde-papers/Thaler/Thaler-Journal%20of%20Near-Death%20Studies_1998-17-21-29.pdf | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial neural networks==

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G. (Eds.) (1991). Music and connectionism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Todd&lt;ref&gt;Todd, P.M. (1992). A connectionist system for exploring melody space.

extended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by
Paul Munro,&lt;ref&gt;A dual backpropagation scheme for scalar-reward learning. P Munro - Ninth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Werbos]],&lt;ref&gt;Neural networks for control and system identification. PJ Werbos - Decision and Control, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  D. Nguyen and [[Bernard Widrow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee373b/truckbackerupper.pdf The truck backer-upper: An example of self-learning in neural networks].

MI Jordan, DE Rumelhart - Cognitive Science, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. 
In later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.

More recently a neurodynamical model of [[semantic network]]s has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that [[semantic neural network]]s  that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Marupaka, Nagendra, and Ali A. Minai. "Connectivity and creativity in semantic neural networks." Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts from the literature==
Some high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

===Important categories of creativity===
Margaret Boden&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms  | first = Margaret  |last =  Boden | year = 1990 | publisher = London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Computational models of creativity. | first = Margaret |last = Boden | year = 1999 | publisher = Handbook of Creativity, pp 351&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to creativity that is novel ''merely to the agent that produces it'' as "P-creativity" (or "psychological creativity"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel ''by society at large'' as "H-creativity" (or "historical creativity"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V-" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative computing|url=http://www.apaonline.org/404.asp?aspxerrorpath=/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx#Thaler|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=16 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115232433/http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Publication_Info/Newsletters/APAOnline/Publications/Newsletters/HTML_Newsletters/Vol11N2Spring2012/Computers.aspx|archivedate=15 November 2012|location=Wayback machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory and transformational creativity===
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as ''exploratory creativity'' and the latter as ''transformational creativity'', seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4).  Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Preliminary Framework for Description, Analysis and Comparison of Creative Systems | first = Geraint   |last =  Wiggins | year = 2006 | publisher = Journal of Knowledge Based Systems 19(7), pp. 449-458  |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.5208&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation and evaluation===
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creative cognition: Theory, research and applications | first =  Ward, T., and Smith, S. |last = Finke, R.  | year = 1992 | publisher = Cambridge: MIT press.|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/oldmodelling/hi/theses/paulness/appendixd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.

===Combinatorial creativity===
A great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
*Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (e.g., [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting (e.g., a fish-out-of-water story such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'')
*Blending two superficially different objects or genres (e.g., a sci-fi story set in the Wild West, with robot cowboys, as in ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', or the reverse, as in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Japanese [[haiku]] poems, etc.)
*Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (e.g., "Makeup is the Western [[Burqa|burka]]"; "A [[zoo]] is a gallery with living exhibits")
*Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (e.g., adding a [[scalpel]] to a [[Swiss Army knife]]; adding a [[camera phone|camera]] to a [[mobile phone]])
*Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (e.g., the [[Emo Philips]] joke "Women are always using me to advance their careers. Damned anthropologists!")
*Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (e.g., using the [[Marlboro Man]] image to sell cars, or to advertise the dangers of smoking-related impotence).
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. [[Genetic algorithm]]s and [[neural network]]s can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.

====Conceptual blending====
{{Main article|Conceptual blending}}
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Way We Think|first =  Turner, Mark|last =  Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Conceptual Integration Networks|first =Turner, Mark|last =Fauconnier, Gilles | year = 2007 | publisher = Cognitive Science, 22(2) pp 133–187  }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ideas about [[The Act of Creation|creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title={The act of creation}|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|year=1964|publisher=London: Hutchinson, and New York: Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=Metaphors we live by
|last=Lakoff
|first=George
|author2=Johnson, Mark

|year=2008
|publisher=University of Chicago press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into [[mental space]]s and [[conceptual metaphors]]. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

*A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
*A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
*A ''generic space'' of stock conventions and image-schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
*A ''blend space'' in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here, sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs.

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations.  For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Veale2007"&gt;{{citation|title = Computation and Blending  | first = O'Donoghue, Diarmuid  |last = Veale, Tony  | year = 2007 | publisher =  Cognitive Linguistics, 11(3-4), special issue on Conceptual Blending }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Blending Approach | first = Francisco Câmara  |last = Pereira  | year = 2006 | url=http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~camara/AICreativity | publisher =  Applications of Cognitive Linguistics. Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from [[GOFAI]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.

==Linguistic creativity==
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, [[pun]]s, [[neologism]]s, [[rhyme]]s, [[allusion]]s, [[sarcasm]], [[irony]], [[simile]]s, [[metaphor]]s, [[analogy|analogies]], [[witticism]]s, and [[joke]]s. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages  frequently create new [[Word form|word-forms]] that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of [[natural language generation]] has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.

===Story generation===
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TALE-SPIN|first=James|last=Meehan|year=1981|publisher=Shank, R. C. and Riesbeck, C. K., (eds.), ''Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs plus Miniatures''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. TALE-SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem-solving effort, and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story's characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded. The MINSTREL&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Creative Process: A Computer Model of Storytelling|first = S.R.|last=Turner|year=1994|publisher =Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; system represents a complex elaboration of this basis approach, distinguishing a range of character-level goals in the story from a range of author-level goals for the story. Systems like Bringsjord's BRUTUS&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity. Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine.   | first = Ferrucci, D. A.  |last =  Bringsjord, S. | year = 2000 | publisher = Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex inter-personal themes like betrayal. Nonetheless, MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old. The MEXICA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = MEXICA: A computer model of a cognitive account of creative writing  | first = Sharples, Mike  |last = Pérez y Pérez, Rafael  | year = 2001 | publisher =  Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp 119-139 |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~dan/673/papers/perezyperez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling, and implements a version of the engagement-reflection cognitive model of creative writing.

The company [[Narrative Science]] makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game.  It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and simile===
Example of a metaphor: ''"She was an ape."''

Example of a simile: ''"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.''"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as [[Yorick Wilks]], James Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  A Computational Model of Metaphor Interpretation | first =  James |last =  Martin | year = 1990 | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fass, John Barnden,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Belief in Metaphor: Taking Commonsense Psychology Seriously  | first =  John  |last = Barnden  | year = 1992 | publisher =   Computational Intelligence 8, pp 520-552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., "as hard as steel") or ironic (e.g., "as hairy as a [[bowling ball]]", "as pleasant as a [[endodontic therapy|root canal]]"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprehending and Generating Apt Metaphors: A Web-driven, Case-based Approach to Figurative Language|first=Hao, Yanfen|last=Veale, Tony|year=2007|publisher=Proceedings of AAAI 2007, the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms "pencil", "whip", "[[whippet]]", "rope", "[[Phasmatodea|stick-insect]]" and "snake" are suggested).

===Analogy===
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by [[Dedre Gentner]], views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the [[structure mapping engine]] or SME,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The structure-mapping engine: Algorithm and examples | first = Forbus, Ken and Gentner, Dedre  |last =  Falkenhainer, Brian | year = 1989 | url = http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/smeff2(searchable).pdf| publisher =   Artificial Intelligence, 20(41) pp 1–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME ([[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]]) and ARCS ([[Analogical Retrieval Constraint System]]). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper,&lt;ref name="Veale2007" /&gt; which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Paul Thagard]], and [[Keith Holyoak]]. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's [[machine learning]] approach to the solving of [[SAT]]-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.

===Joke generation===
{{main article|Computational humor}}

Humour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Children's evaluation of computer-generated punning riddles|first=Pain, H., and Ritchie, G.|last=Binsted, K.|year=1997|publisher=''Pragmatics and Cognition'', 5(2), pp 309&amp;ndash;358|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Pain/publication/2337083_Children%27s_Evaluation_of_Computer--Generated_Punning_Riddles/links/0fcfd5100419c21c7c000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work includes the [[JAPE (software)|JAPE]] system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=HAHAcronym: Humorous agents for humorous acronyms|first=Strapparava, Carlo|last=Stock, Oliviero|year=2003|publisher=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 16(3) pp 297–314|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/5127042/twlt20.pdf#page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.

===Neologism===
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "[[portmanteau word]]s" (after [[Lewis Carroll]]). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =  Tracking the Lexical Zeitgeist with Wikipedia and WordNet | first = Tony  |last = Veale  | year = 2006 | publisher =Proceedings of ECAI'2006, the 17th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harvests neological [[headword]]s from [[Wikipedia]] and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in [[WordNet]]. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "[[wikt:chrononaut|chrononaut]]"). It then uses [[Web search]] to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel ("H-creative") and useful.

Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.

===Poetry===
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid gray; padding:5px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:right; background:lightyellow"&gt;
More than iron, more than lead, more than gold I need electricity.&lt;br&gt;I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber.&lt;br&gt;I need it for my dreams.
&lt;small&gt;Racter, from ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Like jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = An expert system for the composition of formal Spanish poetry|first=Pablo|last=Gervás|year=2001|publisher=Journal of Knowledge-Based Systems 14(3-4) pp 181&amp;ndash;188|url=http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/sites/default/files/gervasjkbs2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. [[Meter (poetry)|Metrical]] rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. [[Racter]] is an example of such a software project.

==Musical creativity==
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of [[Mozart]] and [[Bach]]) and [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, San Francisco: Computer Music Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ Triumph of the Cyborg Composer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226121804/http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/triumph-of-the-cyborg-composer-8507/ |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of contemporary classical music, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] played a piece for full orchestra, included in [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' debut CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iamus' debut CD|year = 2012|publisher = Melomics Records}}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4y_BRJokM&amp;feature=relmfu]&lt;/ref&gt; which ''[[New Scientist]]'' described as "The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melomics]], the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.

Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121763193|title=A Robot Named Shimon Wants To Jam With You|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1 = Shlomo | last1 = Dubnov | first2 = Greg | last2 = Surges | title = Delegating Creativity: Use of Musical Algorithms in Machine Listening and Composition | publisher = Newton Lee (Ed.), Digital Da Vinci, Springer | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagination-engines.com/iei_son.php|title=Song of the Neurons|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of musical composition, the patented works&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Article de presse : [http://www.realcomposer.com/Medal%20-%20RevuePresse.htm « Génération automatique d'œuvres numériques », article sur l'invention Medal de Béatrice Perret du Cray] », ''[[Science et Vie Micro]]''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[René-Louis Baron]] allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called "coherent" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention ''[[René-Louis Baron#Inventor.27s path|Medal-Composer]]'' raises problems of copyright.

==Visual and artistic creativity==
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Aaron's Code.|first = Pamela|last=McCorduck|author-link=Pamela McCorduck|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.

Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "[[neuroevolution|Neuro-Evolutionary]] Art") of Penousal Machado.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music|first= Machado, Penousal (eds.)|last=Romero, Juan|year = 2008|publisher =  Natural Computing Series. Berlin: Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypdCBD6JrAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.

[[The Painting Fool]], developed by [[Simon Colton]] originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as [[AARON]] does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.

The artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;"Methods, systems and software for generating sentences, and visual and audio compositions representing said sentences" Canadian Patent 2704163&lt;/ref&gt; The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/introducing-mechanic-miner/|title=Introducing Mechanic Miner|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2012/11/why-i-think-mechanic-miner-is-exciting/|title=Why I Think Mechanic Miner Is Cool|work=Games By Angelina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 [[Google]] released ''[[DeepDream]]'' – an [[Open-source software|open source]]&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{Github|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a dreamlike [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 researchers from [[Tübingen, Germany]] created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a [[Picasso]] or [[Van Gogh]] in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website [[DeepArt]] that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=This algorithm can create a new Van Gogh or Picasso in just an hour|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/08/31/this-algorithm-can-create-a-new-van-gogh-or-picasso-in-just-an-hour/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Culpan|first1=Daniel|title=This algorithm can create an imitation Van Gogh in 60 minutes|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=3 September 2015|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GitXiv - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|url=http://gitxiv.com/posts/jG46ukGod8R7Rdtud/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style|website=gitxiv.com|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gatys|first1=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style|arxiv=1508.06576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iqbal |first1=Azlan |last2=Guid  |first2=Matej |last3=Colton |first3=Simon |last4=Krivec |first4=Jana |last5=Azman |first5=Shazril |last6=Haghighi |first6=Boshra |series=SpringerBriefs in Cognitive Computation |title=The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity |publisher=Springer |location=Switzerland |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-28078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvub4ug2bM9nlx7VbF5nWhw Chesthetica's YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity in problem solving==
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in [[problem solving]]. In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], this research area is called [[creative problem solving]]. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]]-based computational model that allows for the simulation of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]] in problem solving.&lt;ref name ="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helie | first1 = S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in [[artificial intelligence]] projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.

==Debate about "general" theories of creativity==

Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a ''general theory of creativity''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a simple computational principle published by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J. 1991"&gt;Schmidhuber, J. (1991), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/170605/ Curious model-building control systems]. In Proc. ICANN, Singapore, volume 2, pp 1458-1463. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates that creativity and [[curiosity]] and [[selective attention]] in general are by-products of a simple [[algorithm]]ic principle for measuring and [[optimizing]] learning progress.

==Criticism of Computational Creativity==
{{Weasel|reason=Broad claims are made which contradict much of the rest of this article, without specific attribution|date=December 2018}}

Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  {{Citation needed|reason=This does not seem to line up with current approaches in generative AI. What does "limited set of computational functions" mean?|date=November 2018}}. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms {{Citation needed|reason=This seems like an opinion, one that uses a very specific definition of creativity, a very narrow definition of "traditional computer", and a fairly fundamental misunderstanding of how generative models actually work|date=November 2018}}. For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2013). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31140-6_1 Truth, Trust, and Turing–Implications for Modeling and Simulation]. In: Ontology, Epistemology, and Teleology for Modeling and Simulation, pp. 1-26. Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, G. J. (1987). Algorithmic information theory. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.

'''''Cromwell on his Farm''''' (1874) is a painting by [[Ford Madox Brown]] which depicts [[Oliver Cromwell]] observing a [[bonfire]] on his farm and thinking of a passage in the [[Book of Psalms]]: "Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself - forever? And shall thy wrath burn like fire?" (Psalm 89). The words are inscribed on the painting's frame along with a quotation from one of Cromwell's speeches, in which he describes his life before entering into politics: "living neither in any considerable height, nor yet in obscurity, I did endeavour to discharge the duty of an honest man."&lt;ref&gt;National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, ''Artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Circle: the First Generation'', 1988, pp. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The painting depicts Cromwell as a country squire on his lands in [[Cambridgeshire]], before he became a national figure in the power struggles which culminated in the [[English Civil War]]. Cromwell's identity as a leading revolutionary had been affirmed by [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s biography [http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf  ''Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations''] (1845), in which his reluctance to take up the role of leader was emphasised. Carlyle was an important influence on Brown.

==Composition==

The painting's central theme is that of enforced inertia. In it, Cromwell is portrayed as someone who has the capacity to become a major player on the national stage, but who is restricted to his own small world. It emphasises inertia through the portrayal of the distraction of Cromwell's horse by wayside fodder, which is also being eaten by a lamb from the farm: a reference to the concept of the Christian [[Local church|flock]]. The wandering piglets following a sow under Cromwell's horse refer to the story of the [[Legion (demon)|Gadarene swine]]. Cromwell carries an oak sapling in lieu of a whip, and a copy of the [[Bible]].

The farm is a metaphor for the state, a place in which orderly labour is threatened continually by forces of disorder and in which the most everyday details are potentially filled with moral and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] significance.&lt;ref&gt;Trodd, C, ''Culture and Energy, Ford Madox Brown and the Cromwellian grotesque'', Victorian Culture and the Idea of the Grotesque, 1998, pp. 68-73.&lt;/ref&gt; While the workers on the left of the composition are getting on with their labours, clearing away weeds, the servant at the right is demanding a response from Cromwell, her shout repeated by the screeching duck she carries. The pigs under the horse and the lamb all create a potential for disruption and instability. Behind the workers clearing weeds, a young farm worker barely controls the large herd of cattle streaming though the gate into Crowmell's farm, separating the latter from his wife and child, visible at the door of the house at the right. A spot of blood can be seen on Cromwell's collar, a reference to a famous description of him by [[Philip Warwick|Sir Philip Warwick]], and emblematic of a bloodstained future.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick wrote "He wore... a plain cloth-suit, which seemed to have been made by a poor tailor; his shirt was plain, and not very clean; and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his collar; [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUcromwellO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''''deFENCE'''' is an [[interactive]] [[conceptual art]] project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of [[Marcel Duchamp]], the ''two main roles'' of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a [[mirror]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.

The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

''Note:'' 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Marković from [[Serbia]], in January 2006. It has been selected to take part at the International Design Biennial in St. Etienne, in 2006.

In [[engineering]], a '''design choice''' is a possible solution to a problem.  Given a design task and a governing set of criteria (''design specifications''), several conceptual designs may be drafted.  Each of these preliminary concepts is a potential design choice. Many never advance beyond the preliminary phase; those that are developed to the point at which they could be applied become the pool from which the final selection is  made.  This process stems from the principle that there is usually no uniquely right way of accomplishing any task.  The final selection is often made on a financial basis; i.e., the least expensive design is chosen in a bid process.  

In [[civil engineering]],  design choices usually derive from basic principles of [[materials science]] and [[structural design]].  A suspension bridge, for example, uses the fact that [[steel]] is extremely efficient in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], while a [[prestressed concrete bridge]] takes advantage of [[concrete]]'s relatively low cost by weight and its ability to sustain high compressive loading (see [[compression (physical)|compression]]).

The '''Eagle, Globe, and Anchor''' is the official emblem and insignia of the [[United States Marine Corps]]. It is commonly referred to as an '''EGA''', although this verbiage is officially discouraged by the U.S. Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=EGA_Leatherneck&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-10

Before that time many devices, ornaments, ribbons, and distinguishing marks followed one another as official badges of the corps.

==History==
{{double image|left|Old EGA.png|150|USMC oldEGA button.jpg|150|Early insignia, seen today on modern uniform buttons|}}
[[File:Marine Hat Pin.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[American Civil War]] era insignia]]

In 1776, the device consisted of a [[Foul (nautical)|fouled]] [[anchor]] (tangled in its rope) of [[silver]] or [[pewter]]. Changes were made in 1798, 1821, and 1824. In 1834, it was prescribed that a [[brass]] eagle be worn on the cover, the eagle to measure {{convert|3.5|in|mm}} from wingtip to wingtip. An eagle clutching a fouled anchor with thirteen six-pointed [[Star (heraldry)|stars]] above was used on uniform buttons starting in 1804.&lt;ref name="RevMarines"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charles Richard|author2=Waterhouse, Charles H.|authorlink2=Charles Waterhouse (artist)|title=A Pictoral History: the Marines in the Revolution|publisher=United States Marine Corps Historical Division|year=1975|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/A%20Pictorial%20History-The%20Marines%20in%20the%20Revolution%20PCN%2019000317900.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815002251/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/A%20Pictorial%20History-The%20Marines%20in%20the%20Revolution%20PCN%2019000317900.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same insignia is used today on the buttons of [[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps|Marine dress and service uniforms]], with the six-pointed stars changed to five-pointed stars.&lt;ref name="RevMarines"/&gt;

During the early years numerous distinguishing marks were prescribed, including "black cockades", "scarlet plumes", and "yellow bands and tassels". In 1859, the first version of the present color scheme for the officer's dress uniform insignia appeared on an elaborate device of solid white metal and yellow metal. The design included a United States shield, half wreath, a [[bugle]], and the letter "M."

In 1868, the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]], Brigadier General [[Jacob Zeilin]], appointed a board "to decide and report upon the various devices of cap ornaments of the Marine Corps." On November 13, 1868, the board recommended the modern insignia. It was approved by the commandant four days later, and by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] on November 19, 1868.

==Design and symbolism==
{{double image|right|Officer EGA.png|100|Enlisted GlobeAnchor.jpg|100|Eagle, Globe, and Anchor for the dress uniform: officer (''left'') &amp; enlisted (''right'')}}
[[File:EGA on USMC MCCUU eight-point cover, 2002.png|thumb|left|Eagle, Globe, and Anchor embroidered on an MCCUU cover in June 2002]]

The emblem recommended by the 1868 board consisted of a ''globe'' (showing the continents of the [[Western Hemisphere]]) intersected by a ''fouled anchor'', and surmounted by a ''spread eagle''. On the emblem itself, there is a ribbon, clasped in the eagle's beak, bearing the [[Latin]] motto "''[[Semper fidelis|Semper Fidelis]]''" ({{lang-en|Always Faithful}}). The uniform insignias omit the motto ribbon.

The general design of the emblem was probably derived from the Royal Marines' "Globe and Laurel."&lt;ref name=EGA_tecom&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-09-01 
|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Customes_Traditions/Emblem_Seal.htm
|title=Customs and Traditions: Marine Corps Emblem and Seal
|publisher=History Division, United States Marine Corps}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe on the U.S. Marine emblem signifies the Corps' readiness to service in any part of the world. The eagle represents the United States. The anchor, which dates back to the founding of the corps in 1775, acknowledges the naval tradition of the Marines and their continual service within the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].

There are some differences between the uniform insignia for enlisted marines and that of officers: 
The enlisted Marines' dress blue uniform insignia is die-struck from a single sheet of brass and annodized a gold color.  The service uniform insignia is coated a flat black color.

The officers' insignia is assembled from four parts: a die-struck silver colored globe with eagle, and gold colored anchor with silver colored fouling rope, and gold colored continents.

==Current emblem and seal==
[[File:USMC logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|United States Marine Corps seal]]

In 1954, the Commandant, General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd]], Jr., requested the design of an official seal for the corps. 

The new seal included the traditional Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in gold, with the Globe and anchor rope in silver. The eagle is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a white ribbon bearing the Marine Corps motto "''Semper Fidelis''" (Always Faithful) with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor. An American [[bald eagle]] replaced the [[crested eagle]] depicted on the 1868 emblem.

The emblem is displayed on a scarlet background encircled with a blue band bearing the phrases "Department of the Navy" above and "United States Marine Corps" below in white letters, the whole edged in a gold rope 

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] approved the design on June 22, 1954. The emblem as shown on the seal was adopted in 1955 as the official Marine Corps emblem.

The emblem of the US Marine Corps became an inspiration of the marine corps insignia of Thailand and South Korea. The [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] (ROKMC) and [[Royal Thai Marine Corps]] (RTMC) uses an insignia patterned after the emblem of the USMC.

The emblem of ROKMC consist of a golden star superimposed into the fouled anchor. The eagle appeared similarly to that of the USMC's.

Whereas, the insignia of RTMC appears almost similarly to that of the USMC, with the exception of the golden [[Emblem of Thailand|Garuda]] above the globe, and the silhouette map of Thailand.

'''Emamzadeh Jafar''' ({{lang-fa|امامزاده جعفر}}) is an [[imamzadeh]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. It is located opposite the [[Emamzadeh Esmaeil, Isfahan|Esmaeil religious complex]]. It is one of the pre-eminent structures of the [[Ilkhanid dynasty|Ilkhanid]] era. It is related that this emamzadeh is the grave of [[Ja'far ibn Abī Tālib]], a companion of [[Mohammad]]. This structure was located formerly in the middle of a large yard, but it is now surrounded by residential buildings. The [[mausoleum]] is [[hexagon|hexagonal]] and short and it seems that it had had a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] [[dome]] before, but its dome was destroyed and another dome like the dome of [[Chalabioghlou mausoleum]] in [[Soltaniyeh]] was built for it. This Emamzadeh is partly decorated by [[tile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=116|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Frances "Fanny" Ronalds''' (August 23, 1839 – July 28, 1916) was an American socialite and amateur singer who is best known for her long affair with the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] in London in the last decades of the nineteenth century and for her musical [[Salon (gathering)|salons]].

After separating from her husband, Ronalds moved with her children from New York to Paris in 1867, then to Tunis in 1869, and eventually to London in 1875. She was accepted into royal social circles and was a popular hostess. A noted beauty, she became romantically involved with Arthur Sullivan during the 1870s and continued as his companion until his death in 1900.  She was much admired as a singer and became famously associated with one of Sullivan's most popular songs, "[[The Lost Chord]]".

==Early life==
'''Mary Frances Carter''' was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Joseph Ballard Carter (1813–1889) and his wife,&lt;ref name=Ainger129&gt;Ainger, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; Mary ([[née]] Chamberlain) Carter (died 1898).&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N5_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/03/14/102523924.pdf "Mrs. Joseph Ballard Carter Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 March 1898, accessed 6 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859 at age twenty, already known as a beauty with a talent for singing, she married Pierre Lorillard Ronalds (grandson of [[Pierre Lorillard II]]), a New Yorker called by ''The New York Times'', "The Father of American Coaching".&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/31/104683629.pdf "Mrs. Ronalds Dies in Her London Home"], ''The New York Times'', July 31, 1916, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The young Mrs. Ronalds quickly became a noted socialite and hostess. At one magnificent ball that she gave in the early 1860s, Ronalds famously appeared dressed "as Music, in a white satin gown embroidered with bars from [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''", wearing a harp-shaped, illuminated crown.&lt;ref name=Jacobs85&gt;Jacobs, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The Ronalds had four children.&lt;ref name=FrenchDivorce&gt;"French Divorce", ''[[New York Herald]]'', 29 April 1868, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary account described Ronalds as follows:  "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown &amp;ndash; ''châtain foncé'' [deep chestnut] &amp;ndash; and very abundant... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth."&lt;ref name=Jacobs85&gt;Jacobs, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1867, she had separated from her husband, whom she never divorced. She developed a relationship with the wealthy [[Leonard Jerome]] ([[Winston Churchill]]'s grandfather), a notorious womanizer, but somehow maintained a friendship with his wife and daughters, including [[Jennie Churchill]], who remembered Ronalds singing them to sleep.&lt;ref name=Jacobs85/&gt; She often visited their home in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and when Mrs. Jerome moved to Paris with her daughters, Ronalds followed, taking her younger children.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt; There, noted for her beauty and social talents, she joined the court circles of the pleasure-loving [[Empress Eugénie]] and [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobs86&gt;Jacobs, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; During a party, Napoleon rescued her after she fell into one of his ponds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/06/04/104937419.pdf "Mrs. Pierre L. Ronalds Dead"], ''The New York Times'', June 4, 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; She soon met [[Arthur Sullivan]] during one of his visits to Paris. According to ''The New York Times'', she became the leader of the American community in Paris.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; In 1868, in the French courts, Ronalds obtained a legal separation from her husband, giving her control over their children.&lt;ref name=FrenchDivorce/&gt;

Introduced by Napoleon and Eugénie to British society, she quickly became one of the many "friends" of the skirt-chasing [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] (later King Edward VII) and was soon known for hosting fashionable musical entertainments and elegant soirées for artists, musicians and high society.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Sir Ian. ''Fifty Years When Youth Was Gilded, War and the Larger Freedom The Times'', Mar 23, 1932, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; With the faltering of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] as unrest grew in France, her opportunities there collapsed, and Ronalds moved with her children to [[Tunis]] in 1869. There she became a partner in some farm property near [[Sidi Thabet]] with the French Count de Sancy.&lt;ref name=Tunis&gt;Schuman, Frederick L. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.24960 ''War and Diplomacy in the French Republic''], McGraw-Hill (1931), Chapter IV, "The Taking of Tunis", pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years as Sullivan's mistress==
[[File:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arthur Sullivan]]
In early 1875, Ronalds left Tunis and moved to London.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunis/&gt; She had continued to maintain her friendship with Jennie Jerome, who became [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=Jacobs86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, C. Brian and Ingrid Smyer. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ka0py52UcN4C&amp;pg=PA374 ''Best Little Stories from the Life and Times of Winston Churchill''], p. 374, Cumberland House, (2008) {{ISBN|1-58182-634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later became friendly with [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Queen Alexandra]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funeral&gt;''The Times'', August 3, 1916, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalds' affair with Sullivan began not long after she moved to London. Though three years his senior, she was still in her mid-thirties and beautiful, with a strong personality.&lt;ref name=Madison&gt;Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.php "Gilbert and Sullivan"], Madison Savoyards.org (2005), accessed 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Social conventions of the time compelled them to keep their relationship discreet. She was still married, but even had she been divorced, Sullivan would not have been willing to face the social stigma of marrying a divorcee.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship deepened after the deaths of his brother [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]] (1877) and his mother (1882).&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt; Sullivan became close with Ronalds' children and parents, especially after his brother Fred's family moved to America in 1883.  In his diaries, Sullivan referred to her as "Mrs. Ronalds" when he saw her in a public setting, but "L. W." (for "Little Woman") when they were alone together, often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 156–57, 161, 171, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Ronalds was pregnant on at least two occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 178 and 203-04&lt;/ref&gt; and she apparently procured an [[abortion]] in 1882 and again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 210 and 237-38&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[biographical film]] ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' depicts Sullivan and Ronalds discussing an abortion at around the time of the production of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  [[Eleanor David]] portrays Ronalds in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdtopsy.htm "Topsy-Turvy (1999)"], ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when one of his many other liaisons was discovered, but he always returned to Ronalds.&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  She was his constant companion until his death in 1900, but by about 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 306 and 342&lt;/ref&gt;  He started to refer to her in the diary as "Auntie" (she also was called "auntie" by his nephew, [[Herbert Sullivan]]), and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified and who were always referred to by their initials.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 289 and 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalds was an excellent and much admired singer, using her voice for good causes since her days in New York, when she gave concerts in aid of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] troops; later "in Paris she was known as the "[[Adelina Patti|Patti]] des Salons".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Frederick Townsend. ''Things I Remember'', pp. 49–51 and 183, London: Eveleigh Nash (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan described her as "the best amateur singer in London".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 167.  In the 1860s and 1870s, it was more respectable for "society" ladies to remain amateur (Jacobs, p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt;  She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;  She became particularly associated with one of his most popular songs, "[[The Lost Chord]]", which he composed in 1877 as he watched over his dying brother.  Ronalds became its most famous interpreter, singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan himself accompanying her.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, George. [https://books.google.com/books?id=penNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=jessie%20bond&amp;lr&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1879&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1943&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA256&amp;ci=175,210,291,653&amp;source=bookclip%22%3E%3Cimg#v=onepage&amp;q=jessie%20bond&amp;f=false "Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence"].  ''The Pall Mall'' magazine, Volume 23, p. 252, George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;  For Ronalds, Sullivan composed the song "St. Agnes' Eve".&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/songs/st_agnes/eve.html St. Agnes’ Eve”] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, June 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronalds also wrote songs, including "In Shadow" (1881).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Graphic]]'', July 2, 1881, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fanny Ronalds - grave.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ronalds's gravesite]]
In 1899 when the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out, Ronalds was elected treasurer of an effort to finance an American hospital ship, the ''S.S. Maine'', to be sent to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelteret.co.za/pdf/numismatics/s_s_maine_medallions.pdf S.S. Maine Medallions], Willem Joubert Collection, March 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also active in charitable work for the [[Red Cross]] and received the [[Royal Red Cross]] among other honors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/08/03/100218739.pdf "Funeral of Mrs. Ronalds",] ''The New York Times, August 3, 1916, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1901 she was appointed an Honorary Lady of Grace of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27330 |date=5 July 1901 |page=4469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
When Ronalds died in 1916, at the age of 76, a copy of the manuscript of "The Lost Chord" was buried with her, at her request.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Oyly Carte conductor David Mackie notes in his book ''Arthur Sullivan and The Royal Society of Musicians'' (The Royal Society of Musicians of Great Britain, 2006, p.143 {{ISBN|0-9509481-3-6}}) that Mrs. Ronalds is buried with a copy and bequeathed the original manuscript to Dame [[Clara Butt]], who had recorded the song several times (see Buckley, Jack. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2009/Jul-Dec09/sullivan_chord.htm "In Search of The Lost Chord"]. MusicWeb International, accessed 2 September 2010).  Butt's husband was the baritone [[Kennerley Rumford]].  In 1950, Rumford gave the manuscript [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]], which still owns it.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is buried in the [[Brompton Cemetery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Court Circular, ''The Times'', August 1, 1916, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription to a wreath that she sent to the funeral, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] described Ronalds as "one of the kindest and most unselfish of women".&lt;ref name=Funeral/&gt;  She was survived by her children, Pierre Lorillard Ronalds, Jr., Reginald Ronalds (who became a [[Rough Riders|Rough Rider]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06EFDB1239E433A2575AC2A9619C946196D6CF "Mrs. Ronalds Begins Suit for Separation",] ''The New York Times'', July 29, 1910, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and Fannette ("Fannie") Ritchie.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Funeral"/&gt;

'''''Finn's Hotel''''' is a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Irish author [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Written in 1923, the works were not published until 2013 by [[Ithys Press]], who claimed the work to be a precursor to Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref name=ithyspress&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/finns-hotel-by-james-joyce-first-edition-just-published/ "''Finn's Hotel'' by James Joyce"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of ''Finn's Hotel'' in June 2013.&lt;ref name=ithyspress /&gt; The edition was arranged with a preface by Danis Rose, an introduction by [[Seamus Deane]], featuring eleven illustrations by [[Casey Sorrow]], and design and letterpress printed by Michael Caine.

The publication attracted controversy as some Joyce scholars labeled the works as drafts, not meant for publication.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/specials/joyce-lost.html A Lost Work by Joyce Fuels Scholarly Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/06/ithys-press-to-release-10-lost-james-joyce-works.html Ithys Press to Release 10 Lost James Joyce Works as Finn's Hotel :: Books :: News :: Paste&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbook.com/literature-nerds-freaking-out-about-lost-james-joyce-collection/ Literature Nerds Freaking Out About ‘Lost’ James Joyce Collection | BlackBook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the spring of 2014, James O'Sullivan wrote an article for Genetic Joyce Studies, “Finn’s Hotel and the Joycean Canon”, which uses computational stylistics to analyze the text of ''Finn's Hotel'' to determine whether the text is merely early drafts or should be part of Joyce's canon.  O'Sullivan concluded that "the fragments within ''Finn’s Hotel'' are most likely drafts for what became ''Finnegans Wake''" and that statistically "the criticisms of Ithys Press are seemingly upheld."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=James|title=Using stylometry to weigh in on the Finn’s Hotel debate|url=http://josullivan.org/using-stylometry-to-weigh-in-on-the-finns-hotel-debate/|website=http://josullivan.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist attractions==
The German Fairy Tale Route passes through various scenic regions, which include eight nature parks including the [[Hesse|Hessian]] [[Spessart Nature Park]], [[Hoher Vogelsberg]] Nature Park, Kellerwald-Edersee Nature Park, Meißner-[[Kaufungen Forest]] Nature Park, [[Habichtswald]] Nature Park and the [[Weser Uplands-Schaumburg-Hamelin Nature Park|Weser Uplands Nature Park]].
The towns and cities associated with the [[Brothers Grimm]] and located along the route are Hanau, Steinau, Marburg and Kassel. The original ''Children’s and Household Tales'' (German: ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen''), edited and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812 and known today as ''Grimm’s Fairy Tales'' (German: ''Grimms Märchen''), can be found in Kassel. In 2005, this collection was added to the [[UNESCO World Document Heritage List]]. Several places along the Fairy Tale Route are connected with the fairy tales themselves. In the town of [[Alsfeld]], visitors can see what is known as the House of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (''Rotkäppchenhaus''); the spa Bad Wildungen offers a [[Snow White]] Museum (''Schneewittchen Museum''); and Dorothea Viehmann, from whom the Grimms learned about many of the fairy tales found in their collection, was born in what today is the community of Baunatal. According to legend, the hill Hoher Meissner is where Mother Hulda is said to have resided; Sababurg Castle, located in Reinhardswald Park, is referred to as the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. Further attractions include the town of Hamelin, of [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] fame; the spa of Bad Oeynhausen, which has a museum devoted to fairy tales and local legends (''Deutsches Märchen- und Wesersagenmuseum''); and the city of Bremen, which is famous for the tale of the [[Town Musicians of Bremen]].

Numerous picturesque medieval towns can be found among the Route's attractions as well. In 1975, the Council of Europe awarded [[Alsfeld]] the status of a model European community for the conservation of historic buildings. The old centre of the town of Hann. Münden comprises roughly 700 half-timbered houses; the 1300-year-old town of Fritzlar is famous for its imperial cathedral; and [[Hamelin]] contains beautiful examples of [[Weser Renaissance]] architecture.

The baroque grounds of [[Philippsruhe Castle]] in [[Hanau, Germany|Hanau]], the fountain displays in the Hillside Park of [[Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe]], as well as the [[Bremen Town Hall]] with the adjacent statue of Roland (both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List) are also of particular interest. The 200th anniversary of the first publication of '''''Children's and Household Tales''''' by the Brothers Grimm was observed in 2012-2013 with a series of events. Many other events, open-air festivals, exhibits, and performances dealing with the topic of fairy tales are held annually.

'''Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design''' is toy manufacturer located in [[Hochdorf, Esslingen|Hochdorf]], in Southern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grimm's company imprint|url=http://www.grimms.eu/index.php/en/imprint|publisher=Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm's produces primarily wooden toys including puzzles, building blocks, baby rattles and stackers, doll houses and dollhouse furniture, stacking rainbows of many sizes, mobiles, decorative items, roll-along animals and vehicles, and more.  In 2013, Grimm's began producing their own line of [[Waldorf doll]]s. These dolls are a natural progression of their product line, which is inspired by [[Waldorf education]] (in Europe, commonly referred to as Steiner education). 

Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design (sometimes referred to as "Grimm's" or "Grimm's Spiel &amp; Holz") was founded in 1978, at which time it was called Spiel und Holz Design. In 2006, the company came under new ownership, at which time the name was changed to Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design - ABOUT US|url=http://www.grimms.eu/index.php/en/about-us|publisher=Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood used for Grimm's production is sourced from sustainably managed forests in Europe and includes alder, [[Tilia|lime]], [[Beech wood|beech]] and [[maple]]. The wood is cut into the forms then coated with natural oil. If the product is colored, the wood is then stain with certified non toxic, water-based colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design - What we stand for|url=http://www.grimms.eu/index.php/en/what-we-stand-for|publisher=Grimm's Spiel und Holz Design|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products from Grimm's are available in many countries worldwide, including the United States, often from independent and boutique toy stores, as well as several sources online, including Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grimm's toys on Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin=Grimm's&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A165793011%2Cp_4%3AGrimm's|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''guang''''' or '''''gong''''' is a particular shape used in [[Chinese art]] for vessels, originally made as [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] in the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BC), and sometimes later in [[Chinese porcelain]].  They are a type of [[ewer]] which was used for pouring [[rice wine]] at ritual [[banquet]]s, and often deposited as [[grave goods]] in high-status burial.  Examples of the shape may be described as ewers, ritual wine vessels, wine pourers and similar terms, though all of these terms are also used of [[Chinese bronzes#Wine vessels|a number of other shapes]], especially the smaller [[tripod]] ''[[Jue (vessel)|jue]]'' and the larger ''[[zun]]''.

The ''guang'' has a single thick foot, and a thick hollow body that represents one or more stylized animals (some have a head at both ends).  Guangs have a vertical handle at one end and a spout at the other, both [[zoomorphic]], and were often highly decorated with [[taotie]]. The handle of the guang is of often in the shape of the neck and head of an animal with stylized horns, and the spout of the vessel is in the form of the head of a creature whose mouth constitutes the end of the spout. The back and animal head at the pouring end usually are a removable lid, lifted off for pouring.

Their main period of use was during the Shang and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties, from around 1700 to 900 [[Common Era|BCE]]; thereafter the shape was sometimes used in a revivalist spirit.  The [[Ritual wine server (guang), Indianapolis Museum of Art, 60.43|Ritual wine server (''guang''), Indianapolis Museum of Art, 60.43]] is a fine example from about 1100 BC.

==Function and use==
The guang bronze ritual vessels of Early China were primarily used to house and serve wine during [[Ancestor Veneration in China|ancestor worship rituals]] in which the wine vapors were to be consumed by the deceased spirits and the actual physical contents to be enjoyed by the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gong (Bronze Work)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324176/gong|work=Britannica Encyclopaedia|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use, for storage and serving, is suggested through the form of the vessel. It is typically supported by one oval-shaped foot (supported more rarely by four legs), while the bronze itself takes the form of several animals and fantastical creatures metamorphosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great Bronze Age of China|year=1980|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York, NY|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each guang also has a neck and head, which serve as the pouring channel for the wine. A lid accompanies the vessel to complete the form. According to Robert Bagley, this lid is the chief idiosyncrasy, or characteristic, of the guang, for it is where the largest relief and decoration often takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagley|first=Robert|title=Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1987|publisher=Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this decor is significant in the meaning behind these works, the animal and fantastic creature ornamentation does not have an exact intended purpose for the bronzes, and is still left to interpretation.

Guang bronze vessels were used not only in life to honor the deceased, but also at times placed with the deceased in their grave. Because of this, the ritual vessels are not only [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] but useful to the living as well. They are both everyday functioning items, but also objects which serve religious and spiritual purposes.

==Décor==
The Guang is distinguishable by its zoomorphic lid and handle, and its one-footed base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawson|first=Jessica|title=Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual|year=1987|publisher=British Museums Publication Ltd.|pages=26–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal figure at the front of the lid is often a tiger or dragon, while the sculpted handle ranges in decoration from [[Legendary creature|fantastic creatures]] such as dragons to real animals such as rams, elephants, and the beaks of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freer and Sackler Galleries|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/explore/china/bronzes/gallery.asp#animalewers|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some guang lids also depict animals, typically birds, at the back of the vessel facing or transitioning into the handle. The animals on the lid and handle are presented [[Sculpture|"in the round"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the vessel is decorated in low- to mid-[[relief]]. This relief may depict the bodies belonging to creatures rendered on the lid or other complete animal figures. It is not uncommon for one animal to transition directly into another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower sections of the guang are also often divided into [[Register (sculpture)|registers]] and quadrants by [[flange]]s.&lt;ref name="Sackler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagley|first=Robert|title=Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1987|publisher=Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-674-80525-9|pages=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flange can be the central divider of a [[taotie]], a mask-like creature motif with curving horns and two dragon-like bodies stretching out to its sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Erdberg|first=Eleanor|title=Ancient Chinese Bronzes: Terminology and Iconology|year=1993|publisher=Fuldaer Verlagsanstalt|location=Fulda, Germany|isbn=3-87747-063-7|pages=42, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other surface embellishments include geometric background shapes such as the squared-spiral, the ''lei-wen''. These were used both to fill in empty space between more representational imagery and sometimes as smaller detail in those images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Argence|first=Rene-Yvon|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd|location=Japan|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
===Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE)===
''See Also:'' [[Shang Dynasty]]

The guang, one of many types of Chinese ritual bronze vessels, is both late to come into the world of bronze vessels, and lasts a very short amount of time. The earliest account of guang vessels comes from late in the Shang dynasty, during the Anyang Period, spanning from c. 1300-1046 BCE. These vessels were distinct from other guang objects in early Chinese history because of their decoration. In the Shang Dynasty, the guang featured ornamentation which had not been fully developed. In a late twelfth century to early eleventh century guang, the decoration is lacking on the bottom register, but more innovative in design in the lid and upper registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asian Art Museum|title=Bronze Vessels of Ancient China in the Avery Brundage Collection|year=1977|publisher=Asian Art Museum|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Qi Guang vessel from approximately the same time period, the decoration has been compartmentalized and unified in style, which utilizes conventional motifs of bird, dragon, and other animal imagery.

===Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 1045-771 BCE)===
''See Also:'' [[Western Zhou]]

The Western Zhou Dynasty is the final period in which guang vessels are known to have been made, due widely to the Ritual Revolution which occurred in the late Western Zhou dynasty, ultimately reducing the number of wine vessels being made. Before this disappearance, the guang saw changes in form, such as the ovular foot being sometimes replaced with four legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Bronze Age of China|year=1980|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York, NY|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration also becomes more refined, yet still using animal and fantastic imagery.

==Casting==
Early Chinese [[bronze]] vessels were cast using the piece-mold process. This process involved the artist forming the mold in pieces from clay, then connecting them to make one overall vessel form. With this method, the decoration on a vessel's surface had to be incised into the clay in reverse and negative. This means that images that would be raised on the surface of the metal would have to become depressions in the clay mold. The void inside the mold is then filled with molten metal, creating the positive. In contrast, the process of [[lost-wax casting]] allows an artisan to create a wax model of the desired object. The molten metal takes the place of the wax when cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art from Ritual. Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently it was necessary in the casting of large vessels to cast the main portion, include it in the construction of another mold, and then cast protrusions—such as the guang's handle—onto that piece.&lt;ref name="Sackler"/&gt;

guang (觥)vessel.

==Inscriptions==
From late Shang to early Zhou dynasty, the number of characters per inscription increased on these bronze vessels. These inscriptions recorded very important events (such as sacrifices), gifts by a king to his officials, praise accorded to ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Ping-hen, Liou. "Bronzes of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties". National Museum of History Republic of China, May 1, 1989.P9,P10&lt;/ref&gt; records for exchange/sale land, and political marriages to make stronger relationships.&lt;ref&gt;陈佩芬."认识古代青铜器".艺术家出版社.1995.P39 - P47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and cultural references==
After the [[Jia (vessel)#Ritual Revolution|"Ritual Revolution"]], some of the wine vessels were no longer in use in Western Zhou dynasty. The Guang vessel were only popular in Late Shang to Early Western Zhou dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Anthony J."Allen's Authentication of Ancient Chinese Bronzes".Walter Hirsh and Associates. December 31, 2001. P25&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Head of a Warrior''' is a recurring [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in art.  The heads vary a great deal across time and artistic style, but all present an intriguing look into both the soldier and the artist of the day.

'''Hermann Vezin''' (March 2, 1829 – June 12, 1910) was an American actor, teacher of [[elocution]] and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Vezin, Hermann|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and educated at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Life and work==

Vezin was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the son of Charles Henri Vezin, a merchant of French heritage, and his wife Emilie (née Kalinsky). His great-great-grandfather Pierre de Vezin was married to the seventeenth-century French actress [[Marie de Rohan|Marie Charlotte de Châteauneuf]]. [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle|Rouget de Lisle]], the composer of the French national anthem, "[[La Marseillaise]]," was one of his distant cousins. After studying law for several years, Vezin graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with an A.B. in 1847 and later a master's degree in 1850.

Despite resistance from his family, Vezin was determined to work as an actor and departed America for the UK shortly after graduation. He made his first appearance at the [[York Theatre Royal]] in St. Leonard's Place, York, England. After playing minor roles in several provincial engagements, he began performing leading characters as Cardinal Richelieu, Sir Edward Mortimer, Claude Melnotte, and Young Norval. He made his London début in 1852 at the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]].  On February 21, 1863, at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, he married the former child actress, English-born Jane Elizabeth Thompson who, appearing as an adult under the name Mrs. Charles Young, had made a reputation as an actress both in Australia and in England. They appeared in many plays with together until her death in 1902. Together they had a son, the silent film actor, Arthur Vezin.
[[Image:Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith - Illustrated London News, November 18, 1876.png|left|thumb|Vezin in the title role of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876)]]
Apart from a brief professional tour of the United States in 1857–58, the majority of Vezin's acting career took place on the English stage.  Though primarily an actor, in 1866 he collaborated with the playwrights [[W. G. Wills]] and [[James Albery]] to write the vaudeville inspired play ''Doctor Davey'' based on the 1842 play ''Le Docteur Robin'' by French writer [[Jules-Martial Regnault de Prémaray|Jules de Prémaray]] in which he also played the title role. The following year he starred as a troubled Scottish poet James Harebell in Wills' ''Man o' Airlie'' (1867) to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Vezin followed up with other successful showings, such as ''The Turn of the Tide'' by [[F. C. Burnand]] (1869), ''Son of the Soil'' (1872); ''As You Like It'' (1875); and [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'', which ran for one hundred and nineteen performances at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] (1876, also a revival in 1884);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} pp. 141–2&lt;/ref&gt; He acted with [[Charles Fechter]], [[Samuel Phelps]], [[Henry Irving]], and in 1878 played Dr. Primrose alongside actress [[Ellen Terry]] in Wills' ''Olivia, Vicar of Wakefield'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation

Sir J. Forbes-Robertson described Vezin in the ''London Post'' as a "bright and dapper little man, who was both "learned and dictatorial on the art of acting." The [[Illustrated London News]] review of Vezin in the title role of ''Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith'' noted that "Mr. Vezin is probably the most intellectual of our actors, and is the very man for creating an original part, such as that of Dan'l Druce" and described one scene as "an acting hit by Mr. Hermann Vezin which literally electrified the house."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', September 16, 1876, p. 275, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s favourite actors.&lt;ref name=Stedman86&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and, besides the aforementioned ''Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith'', he also starred in Gilbert's ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', (1871),&lt;ref name=Stedman86 /&gt; and played Mousta in an 1882 revival of ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' alongside Gilbert himself as Florian (due to an accident incapacitating Kyrle Bellew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;

A benefit matinee was held for Vezin at the Haymarket Theatre on March 19, 1896.  For this, [[George Grossmith]] gave a sketch, and play scenes featured [[Gerald du Maurier]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Cyril Maude]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon.  [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1896 benefit,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt;  Vezin continued to act, appearing in ''The Happy Life'' in 1897&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EED81630E132A25756C0A9649D94669ED7CF "'The Happy Life,' by Louis N.

In his declining years, Vezin appear infrequently on the stage, rather spending most of his time giving lessons to aspiring thespians, including the actors [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[Baliol Holloway]] and [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Benson]] as well as the actress [[Mary Mannering]]. He also dedicated himself to appearances at recitals and play readings. His last stage role was Old Rowley in Tree's production of playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan's]] [[The School for Scandal]] at [[His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen|His Majesty's Theatre]] in Scotland, in April 1909. He had been active on the British stage for nearly sixty years, and had been a resident of London, where he died at his home, 10 Lancaster Place, Strand, on June 12, 1910. His body was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were scattered.

{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}

The '''interactive novel''' is a form of [[interactive fiction|interactive]] [[web fiction]]. In an interactive novel, the reader chooses where to go next in the novel by clicking on a piece of [[hyperlink]]ed text, such as a page number, a character, or a direction. While authors of traditional paper-and-ink [[novel]]s have sometimes tried to give readers the random directionality offered by [[hypertext]]ing, this approach was not completely feasible until the development of [[HTML]]. For a discussion of paper novels that use a branching structure, such as [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] novels, see the Wikipedia entry on [[gamebooks]].

By following hyperlinked phrases within an interactive novel, readers can find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken at a reader's discretion &amp;ndash; to allow the reader a choice in the novel's world.

A typical example of this genre is ''The Interactive Novel: Pick a character, pick a direction'', found on David Benson's "No Dead Trees" website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodeadtrees.com/NDT/novel_main.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119125044/http://www.nodeadtrees.com/NDT/novel_main.html |archivedate=2006-11-19 |title=No Dead Trees, The Interactive Novel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fiction allows readers, who can also become writers, to explore the novel from a list of characters given at the site. The novel is intended to be read randomly, as the reader chooses to follow various directions.

Another example of an interactive novel would be [[Pottermore]], which is [[J. K. Rowling]]'s extended version of the series ''[[Harry Potter]]'', which can be found online. This offers the reader a different experience into the Harry Potter world and enables them to find out further information on the Harry Potter series. The reader can find different ways that they can discover different sections of the novels through browsing and collecting items, which allows the reader to go further through Pottermore.

The genre has prompted some less than respectful responses, including a comment by [[John Updike]], who participated in an early effort at online fiction, that "books haven't really been totally ousted yet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/columns/navigator/981210.htm|title=Cyberprose and Cons|author=Linton Weeks|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=1998-12-10|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics, while conceding the hyped and trendy nature of the genre, have found real value in the immersive if sometimes disorienting nature of interactive fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~amerstu/573/hypehome.html|title=Hype or Text? An Anthology of Reader Responses to Hypertext Fiction &amp; Links to Hypertext Sites|publisher=Washington State University|year=1996|accessdate=2007-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913165951/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~amerstu/573/hypehome.html|archivedate=2006-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many interactive novels on the Web. Some of the older efforts have fallen into disuse, but the ease of creating such fiction, with the lack of the [[barriers to entry]] typical of traditional paper-and-ink [[publishing]], helps to keep the genre alive with new works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linxnet.com/lib/libcyber.html|title=Online Interactive CyberNovels: Serial Novels, CyberNovels and Game Style Stories, All Readable Online|publisher=LinxNet|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wovel==

{{Update section|date=October 2017}}

"Wovel" is [[Underland Press]]'s term for an online interactive "web novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underlandpress.com/whatwovel.cfm |title=Resurrection House |publisher=Underlandpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is almost in the style of a ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' [[gamebook]] in which the reader chooses which way the action will continue.

'''Joanna Bruzdowicz''' (born  May 17, 1943 in [[Warsaw]]) is a Polish composer.

==Life==

Bruzdowicz studied at the Warsaw Music High School, at the State Higher School of Music (composition with [[Kazimierz Sikorski]] and piano with [[Irena Protasiewicz]] and [[Wanda Osakiewicz]]); she earned her M.A. in 1966. She continued her studies in Paris on a scholarship from the French government and became a student of [[Nadia Boulanger]], [[Olivier Messiaen]] and [[Pierre Schaeffer]] (1968–70). She joined the electroacoustic [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]] and wrote her doctoral thesis "Mathematics and Logic in Contemporary Music" at the Sorbonne.

After completing her studies in France, she settled in Belgium with her husband, [[Horst-Jürgen Tittel]], former top advisor to the president of the [[European Commission]]. Together, they created the 36-episode German TV series ''[[Stahlkammer Zürich]]'' for which Bruzdowicz wrote over 15 hours of music. They now live in the South of France. They have three sons: Mark, Jan and [[Jörg Tittel]].

==Artistic range==

As a composer she devotes her attention to opera, symphonic and chamber music, works for children, and music for film and television. She wrote four concerti and numerous chamber pieces, as well as over 25 hours of film music. Her compositions are featured on 12 CDs and over 20 LPs; she has been featured in TV programs produced in Belgium, France, Germany and Poland.

Her output includes several operas which brought to the stage some of the greatest works of European literature (e.g. ''The Penal Colony'', after [[Franz Kafka]], 1972; ''The Women of Troy'' after [[Euripides]], 1973; and ''The Gates of Paradise'', after [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], 1987).

Bruzdowicz has a long-standing creative relationship with French film director [[Agnès Varda]], for whom she composed soundtracks for movies from ''[[Sans Toit Ni Loi]]'' (engl. ''Vagabond'', Golden Lion in Venice, 1985) to ''[[Les Glaneurs et la Glaneuse]]'' (engl. ''The Gleaners and I''), her multiple award-winning documentary.

More recently, her music can be heard in her second collaboration with director [[Yves Angelo]], ''[[Les Ames Grises]]'' (engl. The Grey Souls), the last movie starring French comedian [[Jacques Villeret]].

'''Laura Juliet Kuenssberg''' (born&amp;nbsp;1976) is a British journalist. In July 2015, she was appointed as the political editor of [[BBC News]], the first woman to hold the position, in succession to [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33628087|title=BBC names Laura Kuenssberg as BBC political editor|publisher=BBC News|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/22/laura-kuenssberg-confirmed-as-new-bbc-political-editor|title=Laura Kuenssberg confirmed as the BBC's first female political editor|work=The Guardian|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
She is the daughter of Scottish businessman Nick Kuenssberg, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/k/7239/Nicholas%20%28Nick%29+KUENSSBERG.aspx|title=Nick Kuenssberg|publisher=Debretts|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman-20130304&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/management/business-interview-nick-kuenssberg-1-2819213 |title=Business interview: Nick Kuenssberg |author=Kristy Dorsey |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Sally Kuenssberg, [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/12/99/new_years_honours/584140.stm|title=Sally Kuenssberg, CBE|publisher=BBC Scotland|date=31 December 1999|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuenssberg was born in Italy, while her father was working there for [[Coats Group|Coats Viyella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caplus.co.uk/profiles/kuenssberg_nick.asp|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721041650/http://www.caplus.co.uk/profiles/kuenssberg_nick.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 July 2012|title=Nick Kuenssberg|publisher=caplus.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Glasgow]], with her brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mfwhoswho/individuals/K_mfwwi/nicholas_kuenssberg.html|title=Nick Kuenssberg|publisher=Frost's Scottish Who's Who|accessdate=20 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928152225/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mfwhoswho/individuals/K_mfwwi/nicholas_kuenssberg.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Hutchesons' Grammar School|Laurel Park School]], a private girls' school.&lt;ref name=heraldscotland-20161006&gt;{{cite news|last=Mclellan |first=John |url=http://files.heraldscotland.com/news/14784228.Is_the_art__of_flyting_still_in_rude_health_/ |title=Is the art of flyting still in rude health? |work=The Herald |location=Glasgow|date=6 October 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuenssberg studied history at the [[University of Edinburgh]], followed by a journalism course at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="theweek-20150723"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/64496/laura-kuenssberg-bbc-appoints-first-female-political-editor |title=Laura Kuenssberg: BBC appoints first female political editor |newspaper=The Week |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she worked on an [[NBC News]] political programme.

Her brother David is executive director of finance and resources at [[Brighton and Hove City Council]].&lt;ref name=argus-20160125&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14228488.Meet_the_council_s_new_finance_boss___and_his_famous_sister/|title=Meet the council's new finance boss – and his famous sister |newspaper=The Argus |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister [[Joanna Kuenssberg|Joanna]] is a diplomat and was appointed as the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Mozambique#High Commissioners to Mozambique|British High Commissioner to Mozambique]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/joanna-kuenssberg-o-sullivan|title=British High Commissioner to Mozambique – Joanna Kuenssberg |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After returning to Britain, she worked for local radio and then cable television in Glasgow, before joining [[BBC North East and Cumbria]] in March 2000. Kuenssberg won a regional [[Royal Television Society]] award for her work as home affairs correspondent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=2790&amp;sec_id=547 Royal Television Society – RTS in your area]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020213/http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_%2B_3_pic_det.asp?id=2790&amp;sec_id=547 |date=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced segments for the social affairs editor [[Niall Dickson]]. 

Appointed chief political correspondent for [[BBC News]], Kuenssberg reported for [[BBC One]] bulletins, ''[[Daily Politics]]'' and [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]]. In May 2010, her presence was so ubiquitous in the period between the general election and the formation of a [[coalition government]] under [[David Cameron]], that journalist [[David Aaronovitch]] coined the term "Kuenssbergovision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article7124535.ece|title=New Politics is here. Now let’s have new votes|work=The Times|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Aaronovitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Kuenssberg took up the newly created role of business editor for [[ITV News]], and was replaced at BBC News by [[Norman Smith (journalist)|Norman Smith]] from [[BBC Radio 4]]. She also contributed towards business reporting on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s current affairs strand, ''[[Tonight (TV series)|Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://corporate.itn.co.uk/about-itn/media-centre/press-release/Laura_Kuenssberg.aspx |title=ITV announces Laura Kuenssberg as Business Editor |publisher=ITN.co.uk |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625064345/http://corporate.itn.co.uk/about-itn/media-centre/press-release/Laura_Kuenssberg.aspx |archivedate=25 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2013, she made her debut co-newscasting ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' with [[Alastair Stewart]].

On 12 November 2013, it was announced that she would leave ITV to return to the BBC, as chief correspondent and a presenter of ''[[Newsnight]]'', replacing [[Gavin Esler]] in the latter role. She joined the ''Newsnight'' team in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8354077.stm Is Labour facing Glasgow upset?] BBC News, 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/12/bbc-newsnight-itv-laura-kuenssberg|title=BBC Newsnight recruits ITV's Laura Kuenssberg |work=The Guardian|date=13 November 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013  | first=John| last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC political editor===
In July 2015, she was appointed as the BBC's political editor, the first woman to hold the position.&lt;ref name="dm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/laura-kuenssberg-political-editor|title=Laura Kuenssberg has been appointed the BBC’s new Political Editor|publisher=BBC|website=BBC Media Centre|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Kuenssberg was involved in arranging for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Stephen Doughty]] to publicly announce his resignation as a shadow foreign office minister on ''Daily Politics''. The incident was the subject of an official complaint from [[Seumas Milne]], the Labour Party's director of communications, which was rejected by [[Robbie Gibb]], then the BBC's head of live political programmes.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{cite news|title = BBC justifies decision to allow Stephen Doughty to resign live on Daily Politics|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/08/bbc-justifies-decision-to-allow-stephen-doughty-to-resign-live-on-daily-politics|work = The Guardian|date=8 January 2016|accessdate = 9 January 2016|first = Nicholas|last = Watt|first2 = Mark|last2 = Sweney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a joint press conference with Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] and US President [[Donald Trump]], Kuenssberg recalled a number of controversial statements Trump made on the campaign trail, and asked Trump if he had anything to say to UK viewers "worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?" Trump jokingly responded, "That's your choice of a question? There goes that relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/laura-kuenssberg-theresa-may-donald-trump-free-press-questioning-a7552056.html|title=Donald Trump says 'there goes that relationship' when asked a difficult question in press conference with Theresa May|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Kuenssberg's opinion, there are questions about the government's approach to [[Brexit]]. She wrote in March 2017 of [[First May ministry|Theresa May government's]] negotiations with the [[European Union]]: "There are no guarantees that the prime minister's aims are the right ones for the country. Still less certainty that they can be achieved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuenssberg|first=Laura|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39438982|title=Reading between the lines]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias allegations===
Following the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2016|2016 local elections]], a petition was started on [[38 Degrees]] which accused Kuenssberg of being biased against the Labour Party and its leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], and called for her dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-jeremy-corbyn-petition|title=Campaign to sack BBC's Laura Kuenssberg accused of sexism |work=The Guardian|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was later withdrawn by David Babbs, executive director of 38 Degrees, who cited concern that it had become a "focal point for sexist and hateful abuse made towards Laura Kuenssberg" on other social media websites such as [[Twitter]] although it was acknowledged that this represented "the actions of a small minority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-abuse-38-degrees-bbc |title=Laura Kuenssberg petition taken down over sexist abuse |newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20160511&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-bullies-38-degrees |title=We took down the Laura Kuenssberg petition to show sexist bullies can't win |first=David |last=Babbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 May 2016 |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the [[BBC Trust]] ruled that a report in November 2015 by Kuenssberg broke the broadcaster's impartiality and accuracy guidelines. A viewer had complained about her item, which featured an interview with Jeremy Corbyn on the ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' which was edited to give the incorrect impression that Corbyn disagreed with the use of firearms by police in incidents such as that [[November 2015 Paris attacks|month's terrorist attacks in Paris]]. His purported answer to a question as broadcast in the report was in fact his reply to a more general (unbroadcast) question, not specifically about that terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="martinson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinson|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/18/bbc-trust-says-laura-kuenssberg-report-on-jeremy-corbyn-was-inaccurate-labour|title=BBC Trust says Laura Kuenssberg report on Corbyn was inaccurate|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC Trust said that the inaccuracy was "compounded" when Kuenssberg went on to state that Corbyn's message "couldn't be more different" from that of the prime minister [[Theresa May]], who was about to publish anti-terrorism proposals. The trust said that accuracy was particularly important when dealing "with a critical question at a time of extreme national concern".&lt;ref name="martinson"/&gt;

===Bodyguard===
[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' wrote in July 2017 of being told "informally" that  Kuenssberg had received protection from a bodyguard during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]]. The BBC had believed her safety was under threat because of online abuse considered to be mainly from supporters of Jeremy Corbyn.&lt;ref name="telegraph140717"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/14/laura-kuenssberg-given-bodyguard-general-election-campaign/|title=BBC's Laura Kuenssberg was 'given a bodyguard' during general election campaign|work=The Telegraph|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson140717"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Fiona|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-journalist-laura-kuessberg-given-a-bodyguard-after-abuse-by-online-trolls-during-election-a3588071.html|title=BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg 'given a bodyguard' after abuse by online trolls during election campaign|work=London Evening Standard|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC refused to comment about the story. The Labour politician [[Yvette Cooper]] defended the BBC's political editor: "It’s her job to ask difficult questions. It’s her job to be sceptical about everything we say."

The '''League of the Left-Wing Writers''' ({{zh|t=中國左翼作家聯盟|p=Zhōngguó Zuǒyì Zuòjiā Liánméng}}), commonly abbreviated as the '''Zuolian''' or '''Left League''', was an organization of writers formed in [[Shanghai]], China, on 2 March 1930, at the instigation of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the influence of the celebrated author [[Lu Xun]]. Other prominent members included [[Ding Ling]], [[Hu Feng]], and [[Mei Zhi]].&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2008-03-12/113615131996.shtml | title=张晓风：我的父亲母亲 | trans-title=Zhang Xiaofeng: My father and mother | language=Chinese | last1=Zhang 张 | first1=Xiaofeng 晓风 | website=Sina | date=12 March 2008 | access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the League was to promote [[socialist realism]] in support of the Communist Revolution, and it eventually became very influential in Chinese cultural circles. Lu Xun delivered the opening address to the organizational meeting, but he became disillusioned when it quickly became clear that he would have little influence.&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;Leo Oufan Lee,  "Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution 1927-1949," Ch 9 in {{cite book | last1=Fairbank | first1=John King | last2=Feuerwerker | first2=Albert | last3=Twitchett | first3=Denis Crispin | title= The Cambridge history of China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC&amp;pg=PA428 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, England | year=1986 | ISBN=9780521243384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included leaders of the [[Sun Society]] and the [[Creation Society]], and [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]], who became [[Mao Zedong]]'s favorite literary figure and after 1949 zealously enforced  political orthodoxy. The League articulated theories on the political role of literature that foreshadowed Mao's influential [[Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art]], and engaged in running debates with the "art for art's sake" [[Crescent Moon Society]].{{sfnb|Spence|1981|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwgvjqO5ivUC&amp;pg=PA1977-IA59&amp;dq=goldman+literary+dissent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=40V_VIzsOsv3yQSUx4CYBg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Left%20wing%20league&amp;f=false]}}

Due to the League's prominent political views, it was quickly banned by the [[Kuomintang]] government. On 7 February 1931, the government executed five members of the League: [[Li Weisen]], [[Hu Yepin]], [[Rou Shi]], [[Yin Fu (writer)|Yin Fu]], and [[Feng Keng]]. They are known as the [[Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=Lawrence Wang-Chi |title=Politics and Literature in Shanghai: The Chinese League of Left-Wing Writers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-FRAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-7190-2924-4 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was disbanded voluntarily in 1936. This was mainly in order to encourage authors to unite across political boundaries and face the rapidly increasing threat from Japan.

It was stopped after three issues due to poor sales.

==The Tick New Series==
A bimonthly Tick series which began publication in December 2009, written by [[Benito Cereno (writer)|Benito Cereno]] with art by [[Les McClaine]].
Issues 1-8 of the new series have been released as of 2011.

==The Tick Meets...(100 Series)==
Starting with the epic 100th (collective) issue of the Tick (released summer 2012), a new crossover with a popular indie comic superhero is featured per issue.
Issue #100 found the Tick meeting Invincible [created by Robert Kirkman] and had a certain sidekick suffer a tragic death. 
The next issue #101 (released October 2012) found the Tick meeting Madman [created by Mike Allred] through more eccentric sci-fi plot devices allowing for the crossover. 
In May 2013 an all-new FCBD (Free Comic Book Day) issue with three all new stories (presumably, taking place right before issue 100's events) were given out at comic shops. Then in May 2014 another all-new FCBD issue was given out. Also in 2014, an extremely limited edition NEC Comic-Con issue was released, only 750 issues were produced. In May 2015 a new FCBD issue was released. And again in 2016 another new FCBD issue was unleashed. Most recently, on November 19th 2016, as part of Local Comic Shop Day, a special Tick issue was released. Currently, The Tick issue #102 has yet to be released, it is still set for a presumed TBD 2016/2017 release and will feature yet another heroic (and possibly final) crossover.

==Other comic book appearances of the Tick==
A short Tick adventure appeared in the ''Independent Comic Book Sampler'' 2, released in 1988.

[[The Tick]] appeared in the first issue of ''Tales Too Terrible to Tell'' 1, also published by [[New England Comics]], released Winter 1989-90.

Ben Edlund drew a two-page comic strip for Fox Totally Kids magazine to promote The Tick animated series in the fall of 1995. 

[[The Tick]] made a cameo appearance in ''[[Shi (comics)|Shi]]/[[Cyblade]]'' 1, released September 1995.

[[The Tick]] made a cameo appearance in the daily comic strip [[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]] as Luann's brother, Brad, contemplates several of his favorite super-heroes.

[[The Tick]] is referenced in an issue of [[Deadpool]]. Deadpool leaps from a plane to attack [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and screams a nonsensical phrase. He then jokingly asks the readers if they were expecting him to say Spoon (the Tick's catchphrase).

* all appearances by [[Vivian Kubrick]] are uncredited, since they're only small cameos.

==Quilty's "Dr. Zempf" and Peter Sellers role as Doctor Strangelove==
''Lolita'' has a scene lasting six minutes in which Quilty disguises himself as a German-accented high school psychologist named Dr. Zempf who persuades Humbert to allow Lolita more personal freedom so that she can act in the high school play (which is written by Quilty and produced with some supervision from him). This is modified from a scene in the novel in which there is a similar conversation with a genuine female school psychologist. The film version of this scene was sufficiently memorable that Edward Albee incorporated it into his stage adaptation of ''Lolita''.

Numerous observers have seen similarities between Peter Sellers' performance of Quilty-as-Zempf and his subsequent role in Stanley Kubrick's [[Dr. Strangelove|next film]] as Doctor Strangelove. Stanley Kubrick himself in an interview with [[Michel Ciment]] described both characters as "parodies of movie clichés of Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition |last=Ciment |first=Michel |authorlink= |author2=Gilbert Adair |author3=Robert Bononno  |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0-571-21108-9 |page=156 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting elsewhere on the characters, Ciment writes "Peter Sellers prefigured his creation of Dr Strangelove, particularly in the role of Dr Zempf, the school psychologist whose thick German accent recalls that of the mad professor (note Kubrick's ambiguous feelings towards Germany, his admiration for its culture... his fear of its demonstrations of power...)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition |last=Ciment |first=Michel |authorlink= |author2=Gilbert Adair |author3=Robert Bononno  |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0-571-21108-9 |page=92 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Allen Nelson has said that in this part of his performance, "Sellers twists his conception of Quilty toward that neo-Nazi monster, who will roll out of the cavernous shadows of Dr. Strangelove",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick, inside a film artist's maze |last=Nelson |first=Thomas Allen |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn=0-253-21390-8 |page=80 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; later noting that Zempf "exaggerates Humbert's European pomposity through his psychobabble and German anality." The Kubrick interview has been commented by Geoffrey Cocks, author of a controversial book on the impact of the Holocaust on Kubrick's overall work, who notes that "Dr. Strangelove himself... is the mechanical chimera of modern horror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The wolf at the door: Stanley Kubrick, history, &amp; the Holocaust |last=Cocks |first=Geoffrey |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher= Peter Lang|location= |isbn=0-8204-7115-1 |page=114 |pages=|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other observers of this similarity include Internet film critic Tim Dirks who has also noted that Sellers's smooth German-like accent and the chair-bound pose in this scene are similar to that of Dr. Strangelove.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.filmsite.org/loli.html Lolita (1962)]" A Review by Tim Dirks.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Barbara Wyllie, writing in Julian Connelly's anthology ''The Cambridge Companion to Nabokov'', speaks of "Quilty's visit to the house in Beardsley, masquerading as Dr. Zempf, a German psychologist (a Sellers character that prefigures Dr. Strangelove in Kubrick's film of 1964)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Nabokov (Cambridge Companions to Literature) |last=Connelly |first=Julian |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-521-82957-1 |page=212 |pages=|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast notes for Ed Bishop==
[[Ed Bishop]] had his first film role in ''Lolita'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0084042/|title=Ed Bishop|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; an uncredited appearance as the ambulance attendant who tells Humbert that Charlotte is dead. Bishop also played the shuttle pilot in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', making him one of the few actors to appear in two Kubrick films.

The '''Praetorians Relief''' is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] marble relief dated to {{circa|51–52}} AD and housed in the [[Louvre-Lens]].&lt;ref name="afa"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.afaweb.org/exhibitions/details/documents/HighlightsofRomanArtfromtheLouvre.pdf| title =Highlights of Roman art from the Louvre|publisher =[[American Federation of Arts]]| page=3|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts three soldiers in [[Relief#High relief|high relief]] in the foreground, while two others in the background, accompanied by a standard bearer, are made in [[bas-relief]]. The standard-bearer holds an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila standard]], where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons. The soldiers have been identified as [[Praetorians]] due to the richness of the apparel, particularly the helmets, the ceremonial dress and oval shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Lawrence Keppie | title =The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire| publisher =University of Oklahoma Press | year =1998 | pages =233–234 | isbn =0806130148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are wearing [[calcei]] and not [[caligae]], worn by ordinary soldiers. However, according to [[Boris Rankov]], "the [[Attic helmet|Attic-style helmets]] are almost certainly an artistic convention".&lt;ref name="Rankov"&gt;{{cite book | author =Boris Rankov | title =The Praetorian Guard| publisher =Osprey Publishing | year =1994 | page =20 | isbn =1855323613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankov suggests that "early in their history the Praetorians were still using the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmet]] normal in the [[Roman legion|legions]] of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]".&lt;ref name="Rankov"/&gt;

The relief was previously dated to the early 2nd century AD. The lower half of the left-hand figure, portions of the middle two and the heads of all three foreground figures are modern restorations. In 2006 the relief underwent restoration by N. Imbert and A. Méthivier.&lt;ref name="Ancientrome"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ancientrome.ru/art/artwork/img.htm?id=2537| script-title=ru:Рельеф с преторианцами |publisher =Ancientrome.ru| language=Russian|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">The '''Royal India Society''' was a 20th-century British [[learned society]] concerned with [[India]].

The society was founded in 1910 by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], and others, as the India Society. Sedgwick reports Coomaraswamy's stimulus as follows:

:In 1910 he became involved in a very public controversy, played out in the correspondence columns of The Times and elsewhere, on the status of Indian art. This had started when Sir [[George Birdwood]], while chairing the Indian Section of the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Arts, had announced that there was no “fine art” in India and had somewhat unwisely responded to the suggestion that a particular statue of the Buddha was an example of fine art: “This senseless similitude, in its immemorial fixed pose, is nothing more than an uninspired brazen image. . . . A boiled suet pudding would serve equally well as a symbol of passionless purity and serenity of soul.” This controversy culminated in the foundation of the India Society, later the Royal India Society, to combat the views of the Birdwoods of this world. Coomaraswamy played a major part in this endeavor.

In 1944 the Society was granted permission to become The Royal India Society under the patronage of the Dowager Queen [[Mary of Teck]]. After partition, its name was again changed to the Royal India and Pakistan Society, and then again to the Royal India, Pakistan, and Ceylon Society. In 1966 it merged with the [[East India Association]].

'''Sydney rock engravings''', or '''Sydney rock art''', are a form of [[Australian Aboriginal]] [[rock art]] in the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] around [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that consist of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1999. Bedrock notions and isochrestic choice: evidence for localised stylistic patterning in the engravings of the Sydney region. Archaeology in Oceania 34(3): 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of such engravings are known to exist in the Sydney region, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their sanctity, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by [[Indigenous Australians]]. There are two art environments in Sydney Basin, rock shelters and engraving sites.&lt;ref&gt;Basedow, H. 1914. Aboriginal rock carvings of great antiquity in S.A. J. R. Anthropol. Inst., 44, 195–211. &lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal art in Sydney, more than half of which contain rock art, and around 1,500 caves or shelters which contain cultural deposit. They are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[rock art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but have their own distinctive style which is quite unlike rock art found anywhere else in Australia. Dating to around [[4th millennium BC|5,000]] years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/history-culture/2016/03/top-7-aboriginal-rock-art-sites/ Australia's top 7 Aboriginal rock art sites by Australian Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt; with some possibly as old as [[6th millennium BC|7,000 years]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/23/hidden-in-plain-sight-indigenous-australian-rock-art-on-sydneys-doorstep Hidden in plain sight: Indigenous Australian rock art on Sydney's doorstep] by [[The Guardian]] (Author: Brigid Delaney)&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney rock art is predominantly found in [[Ku-ring-gai Council]], [[Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowdler|first=Sandra|title=Balls Head: the excavation of a Port Jackson rock shelter.

==Origins==
[[File:(1)rock carvings Bondi-4.JPG|thumb|220px|Whale carvings in [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]].]]
The engravings were made by the [[Aboriginal Australians]] who have lived in the [[Sydney]] region from about 30,000 years ago until the present day. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152–153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engravings cannot be dated straightforwardly with contemporary archaeological methods, necessitating the use of indirect dating. The Sydney engravings are of a style known as "simple [[Figurative art|figurative]]", which formulaic archaeology dates to around [[3,000 BC]] and [[4th millennium BC|4,000 BC]], which is contemporaneous to the [[neolithic]] period in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, 'Rock Art of the Dreamtime',  {{ISBN|0-207-18908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so those cannot be more than about 200 years old. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;David, B., J-M. Geneste, F. Petchey, J-J. Delannoy, B. Barker and M. Eccleston. 2013b. ‘How old are Australia’s pictographs? A Review of Rock Art Dating’. Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (1): 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engravings appear to show [[thylacine]]s and other mammals which have been extinct in the Sydney region for many thousands of years, and thus can be presumably that old. In support of this, it is true that rock art elsewhere (e.g. [[Kakadu National Park]]) does show extinct animals, and so must be tens of thousands of years old. However, at the moment there is no hard evidence to support these claims for Sydney rock art.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarik, R. G. 1992. ‘A New Method to Date Petroglyphs’. Archaeometry 34 (2): 279–91. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of creation==
Examination of the grooves shows that they were made in several stages as follows:

* Presumably, a sketched outline was scratched on to the surface of the rock.
* Then a series of holes was drilled along the line, using a pointed stone or shell, which is possible because the [[Sydney Basin]] [[sandstone]] is relatively soft.
* Finally, the holes were joined by rubbing a sharp stone along the line.

This results in a U-shaped groove which is typically about 2 centimetres deep and 2 centimetres wide. It is easily distinguished from natural grooves in the sandstone, which are usually V-shaped, modern grooves made with steel tools, which are usually narrower and deeper, or those made by bulldozers, which usually have a square section.&lt;ref&gt; McDonald, J. 2008a. Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange. Terra Australis 27. ANU EPress, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves were often maintained by "re-grooving" during ceremonies, which complicates attempts at dating them.&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, I. 2006. ‘Archaeology in Oceania: Themes and Issues.’ Archaeology of Oceania: Australia and the Pacific Islands, 1– 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
While their purpose is not known definitively, some educated guesses may be made by analogy with the culture of other indigenous groups who survived into modern times, as follows. Some sites may have been "increase sites", where a ceremony would be held to increase the availability of a food source such as kangaroos or fish. It is thought that most of the sites depicting animals are of this type.

Another group of sites may have been where initiation ceremonies were held, to celebrate and facilitate the transition of a young boy into manhood. In other parts of [[Australia]], we know that an initiation ceremony often involves a ceremonial path from childhood into manhood, and so the lines of steps, or mundoes, may indicate initiation sites. Other sites show "Culture Heroes" or "Ancestral Beings" such as [[Baiame]], who has a striped head-dress and often a striped body, and [[Daramulan]] who has a large club foot and may have been part-emu.

Some sites also show evidence of [[Australian Aboriginal Astronomy|Aboriginal Astronomy]], as the rock's patterns resemble the [[Milky Way]] and this may have been purposed as an astrological guide. It should also be recognised that increase sites, initiation sites, culture-hero sites, and astronomical sites are not necessarily distinct, and one site may fall into any or all of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EmuDreaming.com|title=Aboriginal Astronomy|website=www.emudreaming.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Terrey Hills public.jpg|thumb|220px|Engravings at Terrey Hills in northern Sydney. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an increase ceremony, whilst the well-endowed man may be [[Baiame]].]]
The aboriginal rock engraving sites usually contain images of sacred [[spiritual being]]s, mythical ancestral hero figures, various endemic animals, fish and many footprints. Surrounding the rock engravings, there are art sites, [[burial]] sites, [[cave]]s, marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, [[midden]] sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.1994. ‘Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange.’ PhD, Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Les McLeod, a local indigenous guide in [[Hawkesbury, New South Wales|Hawkesbury]] stated, “A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus”. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The [[Guringai]] people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.” In some small cave on the water’s edge, there are ochre [[hand stencil]]s from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint, a minor). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of the clan know that this cave or ledge is a safe place to dwell in. Rock paintings of a fish just above the water line signaled to others that fish could be found at this area. The majority (97%) of the etched motifs are
outline only. The only systematically infilled engravings are [[culture hero]]es which are usually decorated with a number of pecked lines of dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalheritage.org/sites/identification/ Identifying Aboriginal Sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Shelters with art are characterised by stencil art or [[charcoal]]. Stencil is created by mixing [[ochre]] in the mouth and then into a wet paste, where it is sprayed over the object to be stencilled onto the wall of the shelter. Other forms of artwork include ochre paintings, charcoal drawings and etchings. Rock painting illustration usually feature humans, kangaroos, emus, echidnas, grid patterns, animal tracks, boomerangs, axes, hand stencils, among others. Black is the frequent colour used in Sydney, accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. Followed by white (34.6%), red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). There are also a number of grinding grooves located throughout the general Sydney area.  Burial sites are present throughout the Sydney region, and many have been found over the past years in middens and within shelters. &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1998. Shelter art in the Sydney Basin - a space-time continuum: exploring different influences on stylistic change. In C. Chippindale &amp; P. Taçon (eds) Rock Art: New Directions in Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock engravings in Sydney would usually feature fish, animals, humans, wooden artefacts, and mythological beings. Stone quarries are sites where Aboriginals accumulate types of [[stone]] for the manufacturing of tools, ceremonial and sacred items. The majority of the fine stone flakes and tools recovered in the local area would have been traded from other areas such as the north coast, [[Hunter Valley]], and the [[Nepean River]]. [[Water well|Dug wells]] in the Sydney region were used by the local tribe to sharpen tools and also as a source of fresh [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D., 1956. Rock engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District. Part 1: Flat Rocks Ridge: a Daruk ceremonial ground. Records of the Australian Museum 24(5): 37–58, plates 3–6. [23 November 1956].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motif frequency===
[[File:AboriginalSite0008.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Charcoal (art)|Charcoal drawing]] of kangaroos in [[Heathcote National Park]].]]
A total of 7,804 motifs were studied from the 717 engravings sites, with a salient focus on tracks, followed by a predilection for [[marine animal]]s and land animals, [[anthropomorphic]]
models and cultural items.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, L. 1977. ‘Classification and Terminology in Australian Rock Art’. In (ed) P. J. Ucko Form in Indigenous Rock Art, Prehistory and Material Culture. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, 13:387–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 2,000 rock engraving sites, which are usually located on highly elevated, smooth and flat surfaces. More than half of the engraving sites (55.9%) are located on ridgelines. Hillside locations are the next most frequent (41.2%), while [[valley]] bottoms are comparatively rare (2.8%). The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (rock wells or creeks).&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D. 1959. ‘Rock Engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District (Part 2): Some Important Ritual Groups in the County of Cumberland’.

[[Image:Study For The Distribution Of The Eagle Standards.jpg|thumb|A study for ''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards'', by David]]
'''''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards''''' is an 1810 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] depicting a ceremony arranged by [[Napoleon]] after his assumption of power as emperor. In it he sought to revive the military ethos of the [[Roman empire]]. 

The event took place on December 5, 1804, three days after his coronation. Napoleon distributed "[[French Imperial Eagle|eagles]]" based on the [[aquila (Roman)|Roman aquila]] of the legions of Rome. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various [[Département in France|Departments]] of France, and were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops who would be the backbone of Napoleon's new regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives. In early sketches of the painting David included a winged figure of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, floating over the troops, but Napoleon objected to such an unrealistic feature. He also insisted that his wife [[Josephine Beauharnais|Josephine]] be removed from the composition. He was preparing to divorce her, since she had failed to produce his heir.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T3noLir82usC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=the+distribution+of+the+eagle+standards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4o4bMdSCX9&amp;sig=FaJg7q6D_hj-p2z7iwn9u0mrFxI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE3reWsujbAhWEXsAKHfePCWQ4MhDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20distribution%20of%20the%20eagle%20standards&amp;f=false|title=Jacques-Louis David: New Perspectives|first=Dorothy|last=Johnson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1611492835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final painting depicted the moment when Napoleon blessed the standards being held out towards him. Napoleon has his arm raised in imitation of ancient "[[adlocutio]]" scenes, which depict Classical heroes addressing troops. David's composition was heavily influenced by the friezes on [[Trajan's column]].&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

'''''The Naked Brothers Band''''' is an American musical [[Television comedy|comedy]] television series created by [[Polly Draper]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. It depicts the daily lives of Draper's sons, who lead a fictional world-renowned rock band in [[Manhattan|New York City]]. As a [[mockumentary]], the storyline is an embellishment of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. The show stars [[Nat Wolff]] and [[Alex Wolff]], the lead singer-songwriter, and drummer, respectively. Nat's fictional female admirer and real life friends—including the guitarist who had no prior acquaintance with the family—feature as the other band members, with the siblings' father and Draper's husband as their inept accordion-playing dad, and Draper's niece as the group's babysitter.

The series is a [[spin-off (media)|spinoff]] of Draper's [[The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie|film of the same name]] that was picked up by the network, premiering in January 2007. Draper, star of ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]]'' and her screenwriting debut ''[[The Tic Code]]'',&lt;ref name=hamptonsticcode&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/hamptons-on-edge-1117481543/|title=Hamptons on 'Edge' - Jury likes 'Code'|author=Roman, Monica|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=October 19, 1998|accessdate=August 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308100811/http://variety.com/1998/film/news/hamptons-on-edge-1117481543/|archive-date=2014-03-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the executive producer of the series, and often writer and director. [[Albie Hecht]], former [[Nickelodeon]] chief and creator of the [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] network, is the executive producer, under his Worldwide Biggies tag. Draper's jazz musician husband [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]], known for leading the band on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', serves as the music supervisor and co-executive producer, with Draper's brother, [[Timothy C. Draper|Tim]], as the consulting producer.

The show first aired two episodes in the United States on February 3, 2007 to an audience of roughly 3.7 million viewers. [[Viacom]] announced, it "delivered Nickelodeon's highest-rated premiere in seven years" and instantly became one of the most favorable for children aged 6–11.&lt;ref name=prnewswire1/&gt;&lt;ref name=viacom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prdomain.com/companies/V/Viacom/newsreleases/200811551835.htm|title=Nickelodeon keeps on rocking with season two premiere of the hit Mockumentary series|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=January 14, 2008|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110616195433/http://www.prdomain.com/companies/V/Viacom/newsreleases/200811551835.htm|archivedate=June 16, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter [[Jacques Steinberg]], the series' popularity is equivalent to ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[Cory in the House]]''. Three seasons aired and it concluded abruptly on June 13, 2009 due to the network placing high demands on the family that would disrupt the siblings' schooling.&lt;ref name=THR&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nat-wolff-naked-brothers-band-420803|title=A Former Child Star Dodges Teen Perils, Leaps From Nickelodeon to Tina Fey and Paul Rudd's 'Admission'|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 3, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218210111/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nat-wolff-naked-brothers-band-420803|archive-date=2013-02-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series earned 1 [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] Cable Award; 2 [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild Award]] nominations, winning one WGA; 3 [[Young Artist Awards|Young Artist Award]] nominations; and was nominated for 1 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award (both in the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|United States]] and [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards|United Kingdom]]).

The series' title derived from an incident when the brothers were very young: they arose from the bathtub shouting, "We're the naked brothers band!"&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; Although Nat revised the band's title to The Silver Boulders in preschool, Polly Draper revived it as she felt it would be more suitable for the show.&lt;ref name=timescenterstage/&gt;

Most of Nat's music, which he has been composing at the piano from the time he was 5, emboldens the scripts Draper writes for many of the episodes. She also acknowledges how the show is more "like an adult comedy [than]...a typical kids show" in terms of not using a laugh track.&lt;ref name=editorsguild&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.editorsguild.com/Magazine.cfm?ArticleID=681|title=Posting 'Naked' Picture and Sound Editorial on the Hit Nickelodeon Show|author=Grotticelli, Michael|work=Editors Guild Magazine|date=January–February 2009|accessdate=2009-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314015917/https://www.editorsguild.com/Magazine.cfm?ArticleID=681|archive-date=2012-03-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Albie Hecht was visible in the audience;&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; he bought the film for the network.

They said, 'No, we love your kids.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=risingstars&gt;{{cite news | last= Smith | first= Stacy Jenel | url= http://channels.isp.netscape.com/celebrity/becksmith.jsp?p=bsf_nakedbros_rstar | title= Rising Stars Nat and Alex Wolff: 'Naked Brothers?

Draper mentions in early 2008 during a family interview at the Times Center Stage that, prior to the series' broadcast, she advised the other cast members to not look themselves up online. Draper told them that they should not become preoccupied by the comments written by either the press or their viewers. In addition to prohibiting their boys from searching their names online, Draper and Wolff forbid them from auditioning, and the boys were not allowed to tour until shortly after the premiere of the third season. They are also enrolled in private school in New York City to keep them exposed to the real world.&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt;&lt;ref name=timescenterstage/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Being the [[showrunner]]—or leading [[television producer|executive producer]], Polly Draper led the writers room and employed the cast and crew. She also served as [[head writer]] (another task of the executive producer) by writing most prolifically, editing scripts, and conveying storyline ideas for each episode. In addition to Draper, the other writers for the series were [[Magda Liolis]], and Michael Rubiner and Bob Mittenthal. During the first season, [[Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi]] also penned the script for the two-part episode, TV movie special "[[Battle of the Bands (TV movie)|Battle of the Bands]]", and by the third season, Mittenthal emerged as a senior writer, earning the title of co-executive producer.

Draper and [[Melanie Mayron]], who co-starred together in ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]]'',&lt;ref name=fiftysomething&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20061135,00.html|title=Look Who's ...

During the second season, [[Jonathan Judge]] was added on as a third director. The last episode Mayron directed for that season, and thus the series, featured her as a fan on the radio (by providing the voice over). By the third season, Draper and Judge directed every other TV movie, with Mark Salisbury directing the initial animated episode and Rosario Roveto, Jr. directing the concluding episode.

Draper managed to also keep an eye on her two boys. For example, the cast was filming an episode that featured the band recording a video; Nat, who did not want to make out in the scene due to his crush Rosalina watching, mistakenly smooches her. He then confesses to his mother that he was puzzled as to what the instructions were.&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; The scene being filmed was that of the first season's ninth episode "[[List of The Naked Brothers Band episodes#Season 1: 2007|First Kiss (On the Lips, That is)]]", which was directed by Melanie Mayron.&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0973508/fullcredits#writers|title="The Naked Brothers Band" First Kiss (On the Lips, That Is)|work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=August 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201552/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0973508/fullcredits#writers|archive-date=2007-10-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, during production for the fourth episode of the second season, as the boys play restlessly on a purple sofa, their mother (who was not directing the episode) admonishes them over the loudspeaker by saying, "Both of you, try to smile more."&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Occasionally, family disputes occur on set; for example, in July 2008—after filming for a long period of time on the set—when Draper gives one of the boys' an instruction, one of them replies, "I know, Mom!"&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;

===Casting===
According to ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' author Felicia R. Lee, the siblings act "chatty, guileless, fun-loving," much as they do in their genuine lives. She also notes that, of the show's characters, "no one over 18 has much sense."&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; Draper's role as creator—the developer of the original characters—allowed her to contemplate her boys' fictional [[birth mother]] as deceased; her name is never revealed.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news | last=Steinberg | first=Jacques | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/22/arts/television/22nake.html | title=Famous for Playing Rock Stars | work=The New York Times | date=September 22, 2007 | accessdate=2009-05-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826113232/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/22/arts/television/22nake.html | archive-date=2017-08-26 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yalealumni&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2167/band-of-brothers|title=Band of brothers|author=Mark Blankenship|work=[[Yale Alumni Magazine]]|date=July–August 2008|accessdate=April 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153334/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2167/band-of-brothers|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dvdreview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.li-kids.com/2008/01/06/dvd-review-naked-brothers-s1/|title=DVD Review: The Naked Brothers Band – Season 1|author=Ashtyn|work=LI Kids|date=January 6, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211074833/http://www.li-kids.com/2008/01/06/dvd-review-naked-brothers-s1/|archive-date=2013-12-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the show, the boys' father is infatuated with an estranged lady named Betty.&lt;ref name=dvdreview/&gt; Moreover, although portraying fictional characters, the ensemble cast&amp;mdash;including [[Qaasim Middleton]], as well as real life friends [[David Levi (musician)|David Levi]], [[Thomas Batuello]], and Cooper Pillot&amp;mdash;keep their full names on-screen. Nonetheless, [[Allie DiMeco]] plays Rosalina; the siblings' cousin [[Jesse Draper]] portrays the group's puzzled nanny named Jesse Cook; and the boys' father [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] plays the siblings' father, Sonny, the latter whom Draper notes she wrote similar to that of a child.

The Timmerman Brothers&amp;mdash;a band no longer famous&amp;mdash;consists of three siblings, who in real life are Polly's nephews, Nat and Alex's cousins, and thus Jesse's brothers and cousin. In addition, Jesse's real life father, Polly's brother, and thus Nat and Alex's uncle reoccurs as the school principal. Jesse's sister and cousin have been added as recurring stars during the second season. They play Jesse's sisters named Tessy and Bessy who appear as the dancing girls in Alex's new music video. In addition, Qaasim's real life mother, the actress and singer-songwriter [[Toni Seawright]], as well as his younger brother Kahlil (also an actor and musician) appear as themselves during the second season, while Seawright reprises her role in the third season. Thomas' real life younger brother, John, also reoccurs as himself during the second season.

During a family interview in January 2008 by ''New York Times'' reporter Jacques Steinberg, Nat notes the [[French Bulldog|French bulldog]] E.T., who plays David Levi's dog in the show, belongs to the Draper-Wolff family in real life.&lt;ref name=timescenterstage/&gt;

Craig Cobb is the picture editor for the series; he was also the assistant editor for ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/3146642/Craig_Cobb_Credits#divCredits|title=Craig Cobb Credits|publisher=Hollywood.com|accessdate=2009-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604112818/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/3146642/Craig_Cobb_Credits#divCredits|archive-date=2011-06-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cobb worked with Louis Bertini, the supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] of the series, who had been the editor for ''Sex and The City''.&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.com&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/201216/Louis-Bertini/filmography|title=Louis Bertini – Trailer – Showtimes – Cast – Movies &amp; TV|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021202045/http://movies.nytimes.com/person/201216/Louis-Bertini/filmography|archive-date=2012-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the editing process, Bertini explains that editing the show was not much different from editing ''Sex and the City''; they brought a similar "approach and constriction to the audio elements", although unlike ''Sex in the City'', the show had a "larger cartoon element".&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt; However, Cobb considered the editing to be a challenge because he felt that a certain degree of unscripted "magic on set" existed that required more work. Because most of the children on the series are not actors—in addition to the music that was to be added—the editing process created a situation that was somewhat "messy". Nonetheless, Cobb believed the combination of factors created a "magic" of its own "and it's what makes this show really shine".&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;

When an episode completed filming, Cobb edited on the [[Final Cut Pro]] application, which normally took four days to complete.&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt; Bertini—who spent the same amount of time editing—then converted unnecessary script and added [[sound effect]]s.&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt; Cobb says, "The [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|16:9]] SD workflow was the plan for the 2008 season, but that has changed. We're working in [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3]] SD with the [[ProRes 422|ProRes 422 codec]], so we're cutting in a broadcast-quality format that we'll later output without having to recapture all the footage."&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;

According to Cobb, it is very difficult to coordinate the television's screen-framing:&lt;ref name=editorsguild/&gt;

{{Cquote|''There are many issues to consider. If I were able to cut it 16:9, I would be able to keep an eye on the outside edges of the frame. Since I only cut it in 4:3, I don’t get to see what's going on in the entire frame. Therefore, should an [[High-definition video|HD]] version be required, potentially a lot of adjustments will have to be made in the final edit. Occasionally, we've had to look at the 16:9 footage to reposition a couple of shots and I’ve seen light stands and such that will have to be removed somehow in a 16:9 version of the show. However, everything has been shot in 16:9 HD, so we will never have to stretch any images to fill the 16:9 frame''.}}

Their unreleased soundtrack, titled ''Throwbacks'', for the third season was made available free of a charge on their website as an online download in October 2013. The album artist is Nat and Alex Wolff, and it took four years to develop due to the unannounced cancellation of the series in June 2009.

===Pilot episode===
{{Further information|The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie}}
The pilot episode was originally an independent film shot in mid-2004 depicting Nat and Alex Wolff when they were nine and six years old respectively and premiered as a TV movie special on January 27, 2007. They film a documentary about their world-renowned band, The Silver Boulders, as they fracture due to Nat's song about a girl named Rosalina. At the end, the band reunites as The Naked Brothers Band.

Famous celebrities either acknowledge they are huge fans of the band or have appeared with other supporting roles; in real life, they have either worked or are friends with the Draper-Wolff family. In addition to the noted Thurman, Moore, Lauper, Shalhoub, Hall, and the ensemble cast of ''Thirtysomething'' (the latter including the boys' mother) making cameo appearances, the other special guests were [[Ricki Lake]], [[Ann Curry]], jazz singer [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], [[Cindy Blackman]], [[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]], [[Gretchen Egolf]], [[James Badge Dale]], Barbara eda-Young, and Brent Popolizio.

===Season 1: 2007===
Season one debuted in February 2007 and concluded in June; however, one additional episode and television movie aired in October 2007.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; The first season aired 13 episodes, including a two-part episode and TV movie special titled "[[Battle of the Bands (TV movie)|Battle of the Bands]]" airing on October 6, 2007.

The first season features Nat and his younger brother Alex, who are 11 and 8 years old respectively. David, Thomas, and Cooper are also 11. Qaasim is 10 and Rosalina is 14 respectively. Daniel Raymont plays the role of the music video director, and Tuffy Questall portrays Tuffy, the driver of the band's psychedelic bus. The first season also has guest appearances by radio host [[Matt Pinfield]], rap artist [[Snoop Dogg]], comedian [[George Lopez]], and actor and musician [[Keli Price]].

The first season's premise is that the group is recording their first studio album as well as starring in several music videos to promote it. In the first episode "VMAs", Alex is horrified by his horoscope Jesse reads to him, and the band's music video for their song "Banana Smoothie" wins an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at the end. In later episodes, Nat's initial attempts at stand up comedy fails before receiving advise from George Lopez. Throughout the season, Nat does not like when David and Thomas ridicule his affection for Rosalina. Although neither admits their feelings for each other, it becomes quite obvious that Nat and Rosalina do. As time goes on, Rosalina kisses Nat on the lips in his dressing room.

Moreover, Alex becomes mad and runs away when Jesse dates The Timmerman Brothers. Along the way, Alex becomes friends with an orphan named Juanita at a skatepark. When the boys' father arrives back from his overnight vacation, he starts dating an estranged lady named Betty, who Cooper and Jesse initially hired to clean the mess in the Wolff family's apartment without much success. In addition to a "[[Battle of the Bands (TV movie)|Battle of The Bands]]" between The Naked Brothers Band and The LA Surfers (the latter featuring lead singer Bobby Love, a manipulative con artist who tries to steal Nat's girl friend), the season ends with Nat and his band performing at a charity event they put together for Juanita and her foster family.

===Season 2: 2008===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NBB-Polar Bears.jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|Rosalina (Allie DiMeco) and Nat become a couple in TV movie ''[[Polar Bears (TV movie)|Polar Bears''.]]]] --&gt;
The second season aired 13 episodes and 2 TV specials, ending on June 6, 2008 with a three-part episode, TV movie special.

In the second season, Nat is 12 and Alex is 9. Rosalina is 15, Qaasim is 11 And Thomas, David, and Cooper are 12. Guest stars for the season include [[Print syndication|syndicated]] cartoonist [[Jules Feiffer]], musician [[Joel Madden]], skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]], [[George Lopez]], [[Matt Pinfield]], and musician [[Phil Collins]]. During the first half of the season, Daniel Raymont portrays Wing with Teala Dunn and Emily Richardson returning as Juanita and Patty Scoggins, respectively. When the band goes on tour, the tour driver Tuffy (Tuffy Questall) takes on more of a lead recurring role.

The second season begins with a school masquerade party and prom. In later episodes, Nat, Alex, and Cooper have dates at a local movie theater; during a live talk show, the siblings, alongside Joel Madden and a girl, who is a quite critical news reporter, compose a song together at the piano; and Mr. Wolff's girl friend neglects him after meeting his twin brother who is a successful jazz pianist. In addition, the band starts prepping for their tour with several band rehearsals. Prior to leaving on their tour bus, the band members are conflicted with personal issues. Mr. Wolff is still coping from his break up with Betty, David is upset about leaving his dog, E.T. behind, and Rosalina is worried about the possibility of not saying "good bye" to her father. Nonetheless, all of their concerns work themselves out: George Lopez advises Mr. Wolff to continue his passion for playing the accordion despite his break up, Tuffy ends up allowing David to bring his dog, and Rosalina's father makes it to the stop before the bus leaves.

Following several concert performances (including one at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], as well as a state county fair), the TV movie special "[[Polar Bears (TV movie)|Polar Bears]]" depicts the ending of the band's tour in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where they—along with their babysitter, Jesse—reunite with the siblings' father and the Wolff family's dear friends who are victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. On the ride down there, Jesse accidentally has Alex watch ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and, after viewing it, he becomes very concerned about the polar bears potentially becoming extinct due to [[global warming]]. During their visit, Mr. Wolff's friend's older daughter, as well as Nat, Qaasim, and Rosalina encounter misinterpretations over their romantic interests, and the band ends up donating the money raised from their performance at an elaborate-styled ballroom to a charity supporting [[climate change]].

===Season 3: 2008–09===
The third season began with the television movie "[[Mystery Girl (film)|Mystery Girl]]", which premiered on October 18, 2008. It also aired three other TV movies, one animated TV special, one special webisode, and three other episodes, concluding with "No School's Fools Day" on June 13, 2009.

In this season, Nat, Thomas, David, and Cooper are 13 with Qaasim being 12, while Alex is 10 and Rosalina is 16. The season features an array of celebrities making cameo appearances, including actresses [[Miranda Cosgrove]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]], singer [[Natasha Bedingfield]], and musicians [[David Desrosiers]] and [[Simon Kirke]]. Other celebrity appearances include musicians Tobin Esperance and [[Questlove]], actor and musician [[Leon G. Thomas III|Leon Thomas]], actress [[Victoria Justice]], and talk show host [[Dave Attell]]. Daniel Raymont, Tuffy Questall, Teala Dunn, Catherine Curtin, and Matt Pinfield all return with [[Andrew Keenan-Bolger]] portraying Christophe, the director of the new ''Magical Mystery Girl Movie''.

The new season depicts the band shooting their initial theatrical film called the ''Magical Mystery Girl Movie''. Nat stars as Daniel, Rosalina as herself, Miranda Cosgrove as Daniel's girl friend, Alex as Oliver, Juanita as the girl in Oliver's new music video, with Mr. Wolff and Jesse playing themselves and Principle Schmoke and Tuffy portraying sumo wrestlers in diapers. Christophe is the stubborn director; he is later overthrown and replaced by Cooper, the producer of the movie. Christophe appears again in ''The Premiere'', who pilfers the movie's metal film cassette.

On the other hand, Rosalina temporarily leaves the band to travel on a worldwide cruise. During her trip, the band members read the newspaper and the front cover depicts Rosalina kissing a French man. When Rosalina returns to visit, she and Nat have an internal dispute and Rosalina subsequently quits the band. Because of this, the group must find a new bass player. Cooper calls for a "Naked Idol" contest and the outfit selects Kristina Reyes as their new bassist. However, Nat later makes up with Rosalina and she rejoins the band while retaining Kristina as well. "The Premiere" TV movie ends with them watching the ''Magical Mystery Girl Movie'' in the theaters as well as the band performing Nat's new song "Just a Girl I Know".

==Cast==

===Main cast===
*[[Nat Wolff]] stars as himself, who is the incisive, lead singer-songwriter and keyboardist for the band. He plays guitar, though, for such songs as "Taxi Cab", "I'll Do Anything", "Curious", and "I Feel Alone". Nicknamed "The Girl Magnet," his crush on bandmate Rosalina emboldens his love songs, and she even kissed him on the lips in his dressing room during the first season. In the second season, Nat and Rosalina go to prom together, then on a triple date, and in the final TV movie "[[Polar Bears (film)|Polar Bears]]", the two become a couple. However, by the third season, their relationship becomes strained when Rosalina embarks on a six-month boat cruise around the world.
*[[Alex Wolff]] stars as himself, the dark brown, puffy curly-haired younger brother of Nat's, who portrays the outfit's highly energetic drummer. He switches to keyboards for the following songs he writes and sings: "Changing", "Why", "Jesse", and "All I Needed". Because of his exuberance, he has a number of fake tattoos; Alex also wears socks tied around his ankles, and a red, white and blue [[do-rag]] on his head during the first season. Throughout the series, he has a deep affection for Jesse and considers her to be his girlfriend. He also disapproves of her dating other men, including The Timmerman Brothers.
*[[Thomas Batuello]] stars as himself, playing the group's cellist. In the show, he often coordinates mischievous acts with David. During the first season, Thomas and David claim not to take an interest in girls; they often ridicule Nat because of his feelings for Rosalina too. By the second season's episode "Cleveland", Thomas, nonetheless, becomes envy of Nat for obtaining all of the affection from their female fans'. After Rosalina leaves for a six-month cruise around the world during the third season, Thomas becomes the band's temporary bassist.
*[[Allie DiMeco]] stars as Rosalina, the bassist and Nat's highly noted female interest. Because of her perplexing relationship with Nat, she quits the band twice. First, after becoming involved with a manipulative con artist named Bobby Love&amp;mdash;lead singer for the punk rock group The LA Surfers, she encounters an internal dispute with Nat and subsequently leaves the group. After Bobby pilfers her lyrics sheet and performs their song live at the "Battle of The Bands" competition, however, his true identity is revealed and Rosalina instantly approaches Nat sobbing in his arms while asking for his forgiveness, thus rejoining the outfit during the first season. After Rosalina returns from her long cruise in the third season, she and Nat have an internal dispute about her being depicted in the newspaper kissing a French man and subsequently breaks up with Nat, thereby quitting the band again. Under Cooper's guidance, the outfit develops a nationwide singing competition to replace Rosalina, choosing Kristina as their new bassist. As soon as the reconstructed band settles in, an abrupt Rosalina asks to rejoin and so she becomes their second guitarist.
* [[David Levi (musician)|David Levi]] stars as himself, a blond-haired boy with glasses who plays the band's keyboardist. In addition to his involvement in all of Thomas' pranks, David admires his own dog, E.T.
* [[Qaasim Middleton]] stars as himself, an [[African-American]] child with [[dreadlocks]] who portrays the group's guitarist. In the show, he is known for being quite skillful at flirting with girls and is highly intelligent.
* [[Cooper Pillot]] stars as himself and is the band's manager, dressing in a suit, as well as wearing large sunglasses. In the first and second seasons, Cooper has a crush on a girl named Patty Scoggins.
* [[Jesse Draper]] stars as Jesse Cook, the band's babysitter and tutor who tends to wear mini-skirts and has many tattoos. Because Jesse is not very intelligent, Rosalina and Qaasim grade the band members' school assignments for her. She calls Alex her "little boyfriend," and much to his noted disapproval, Jesse dates the Timmerman Brothers—Donnie, Johnny, and Billy.
* [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] stars as Dad (also known as "Mr. Wolff" or "Sonny"), Nat and Alex's inept accordion-playing widowed father. He embarrasses his sons on many occasions; for example, he sometimes tries to appear in the band's performances by playing the accordion. Sonny has performed at the Hoboken [[Rathskeller]] restaurant, and dates an estranged woman named Betty, but she later breaks up with him for his twin brother Miles.

===Recurring actors===
(In order of appearance):
* Daniel Raymont plays the role of the music video director, appearing and talking quite similar to [[Borat Sagdiyev]] in the first season; Wing during the second season; and Abdul in the third-season episode titled "Valentine Dream Date".
* [[Tim Draper]] portrays Joe Schmoke, the principal of Amigos Elementary, Middle, and High School.
* Billy Draper, Adam Draper, and Coulter Mulligan play the roles of Billy, Donnie, and Johnny Timmerman, all of whom are nonsensical. Together, they formed The Timmerman Brothers, an initially quite successful musical group whose popularity diminished after their voices deepened during puberty.
* [[Teala Dunn]] stars as Juanita, Alex's skateboard buddy and female interest.
* Catherine Curtain portrays Betty, the noted estranged lady who wears a blonde wig. Although initially being hired by Cooper as a maid, she made excuses by explaining how she is technically a "cleaning specialist," and therefore, does not "actually clean"; rather, she "guides others on how they should clean." Betty then dates Sonny and plays the ukulele in their two-member band, The Honey Bunnies. However, the other characters strongly dislike their music. In the second-season episode "[[Uncle Miles (TV episode)|Uncle Miles]]", Betty leaves Sonny for his [[jazz musician]] twin brother Miles before reappearing again in the third-season episode "[[Valentine Dream Date (TV special)|Valentine Dream Date]]".
* Emily Richardson plays Patty Scoggins, Cooper's romantic interest. Initially known as "Ms. Scoggins," she first appears as the manager for The LA Surfers in the first season TV movie "Battle of The Bands".
* Eleanor Draper and Lisa Mulligan portray Tessy and Bessy, Jesse's sisters and the dancing girls in few of the band's music videos during the second season.
* Kristina Reyes stars as herself, first appearing in the third season TV movie "Naked Idol". When she is chosen to fulfill Rosalina's spot as the band's bassist, Nat initially acts disrespectful to her because he is upset about the departure of, and his break up with, Rosalina. However, Nat and Kristina have a talk and a friendship forms between them. During their chat, she explained to Nat how she always dreamed of playing in the band and admired him dearly after hearing his song "Rosalina" broadcast on the radio when she was ten years old. In the TV movie "The Premiere", Rosalina asks to rejoin the band and they decide to keep Kristina as the bassist with Rosalina returning as their second guitarist.

Albie Hecht foreshadowed the success of the series after watching the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; In an article, Hecht told ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter Felicia R. Lee: "They're just real: real brothers, real friends; it's all the stuff kids do when they're hanging out on the playground. The idea that you're watching a documentary is so much fun. Then you put them into that fantasy of being a world-famous rock band, and that's the sauce that makes it work."&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt; Lee also called both the film and television series, "an ebullient mock documentary."&lt;ref name=TVFamily/&gt;

In October 2006, online videos from their Nickelodeon website had been played over 11 million times. Moreover, before the show's debut, "a fan recognized Nat and Alex in a Florida hotel.

They can't believe it.' "&lt;ref name=bostonglobe/&gt;

The family had encountered an incident in the past; they had to delist and change their phone number in [[New York City|Lower Manhattan]] because fans worldwide were calling their apartment relentlessly.&lt;ref name=risingstars/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Draper recalls,&lt;ref name=risingstars/&gt; "Little girls would call and say, 'Helloooo, is [Nat] there? We just love him.' The only thing that's comforting is, they're pretty harmless at that age." According to Nat,&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; "After the show came on, people began to really treat us like huge rock stars. They'd scream on the street, and we'd look behind us to see what they were screaming about, because we didn't realize it was us."

Despite the show's prosperity—in terms of its viewership ratings, as it came close to wrap up filming for the third season, network bosses urged the family to lengthen the season from 13 episodes to 60. Nevertheless, prior agreements had already been made between Draper, her husband and the staff at Nickelodeon that shooting would not interfere with the boys' school schedule. Network executives chose no longer to conform to the family's demands, prompting Draper and Wolff to cancel the series in mid-2009. Of the cancellation, no formal announcement had been made by either the family or network until Nat disclosed the incident to the press in 2013.&lt;ref name=THR/&gt;

'''''Thomas Borrow''''' and '''Ann Borrow''' are two paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].

==Description==
Thomas Borrow was the eldest son to Isaac and Honor Borrow and was born on 3 June 1709. His father who resided at Castlefield, a very large country house, was twice [[Mayor of Derby]]&lt;ref name="ptp"&gt;[http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;DMAG200367&amp;pos=2&amp;action=zoom Thomas Borrow], PictureThePast, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 1730 and 1742.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsoHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22edward+mundy%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=RA1-PA16&amp;ci=441,951,114,16&amp;source=bookclip"&gt;The history and gazetteer of the county of Derby] By Stephen Glover, 1831, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There is a painting of Isaac Borrow extant and the Borrow house is included in a 1725 painting called [[A Prospect of Derby]].

Borrow entered Grays Inn in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/grays-inn-cn/the-register-of-admissions-to-grays-inn-1521-1889-together-with-the-register--yar/page-38-the-register-of-admissions-to-grays-inn-1521-1889-together-with-the-register--yar.shtml Admissions to Grays Inn], accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the year after Bonnie Prince Charlie came to Derby, Borrow was made the [[Town Clerk]] in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/Portrait_of_Thomas_Borrow.htm Portrait of Thomas Borrow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030015438/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/Portrait_of_Thomas_Borrow.htm |date=30 October 2010 }}, Derby.gov.uk, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757 he married Anne Ault of [[Loughborough]] and came into the use of £4,000 and lands and property in [[Litchurch]] and the parish of St Peters.&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=026-d5369&amp;cid=-1#-1|title=Borough Estate and Family Papers - Access to Archives|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Peters parish is now in the centre of Derby. Joseph Wright of Derby painted Borrow and his wife, Anne (or Ann). Both of these paintings are in the collection of [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] as is an anonymous painting of their house called ''Castlefields''. The paintings both date from 1762-3 and are 40 by 50 inches in size.

Borrow died on 6 August 1786. They had one son name Thomas who spelt his surname Borough&lt;ref name="ptp"/&gt; and a daughter Anne Honor who died aged twelve. The parents and daughter are buried in [[St Lawrence's Church, Gotham|St Lawrence Church in Gotham]] where there is a memorial on the south wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southwellchurches.nottingham.ac.uk/gotham/hmonumnt.php Gotham monuments], Southwell Churches, retrieved 28 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, '''UTA Brand Studio''' was unveiled as the brand strategy division of [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA), one of the world’s largest literary and talent agencies. The studio is based in UTA’s Beverly Hills, CA headquarters.

[[Laurence Vincent]] and Michellene DeBonis are UTA Brand Studio co-founders. Vincent’s 20-year career in branding has included roles with [[Siegel + Gale]] and Octagon, Inc., for such clients as Disney, MasterCard, Microsoft, the NFL, PlayStation and Qualcomm. DeBonis also brings 20 years of brand experience including work for Bare Minerals, Panasonic, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Operation Smile and Susan G. Komen. Other UTA Brand Studio team members include Creative Director R. Marcus Bartlett—who joined the team from Futurebrand where he won a Clio Award for his work with American Airlines—and Director of Client Engagement Catherine Davie.

Vincent has written two brand strategy books. In March 2012, ''Brand Real'' was released, focusing on the strategic behavior that drives the success of the world’s leading brands. ''Brand Real'' was recognized by strategy+business magazine as one of the best business books of 2012. In 2001, ''Legendary Brands'' was released, examining the storytelling potential of brands and implications for strategic and creative development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140108005857/en/UTA-Brand-Studio-Launches-First-Ever-Brand-Dependence%E2%84%A2 |title=UTA Brand Studio Launches First-Ever Brand Dependence™ Index as Key Predictor of a Brand’s Influence and Potential |publisher=Business Wire |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brand Attachment Research==
In January 2014, a new quantitative research tool measuring brand attachment was launched by UTA Brand Studio. Brand Dependence™ is described as a tool to measure the personal connection consumers have to a brand and the degree to which they see a brand as being part of who they are. Developed in an exclusive partnership with uSamp and UTA Brand Studio, Brand Dependence™ is built upon the pioneering academic research on brand attachment of Deborah MacInnis, Vice Dean and Professor at [[USC Marshall School of Business]] and C. Whan Park Professor of Marketing at USC Marshall School of Business.

At CES 2014, the UTA Brand Studio announced the inaugural Brand Dependence™ index focusing on technology brands. Social media brands were examined in the second installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Champagne |first=Christine |url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027398/a-new-survey-reveals-which-social-media-brands-people-are-most-attached-to |title=A New Survey Reveals Which Social Media Brands People Are Most Attached To &amp;#124; Co.Create &amp;#124; creativity + culture + commerce |publisher=Fastcocreate.com |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of UTA Brand Studio’s clients include The Elizabeth Taylor Trust, Bare Minerals, Mattel and the Consumer Electronics Association. In 2014, the studio was named a winner of the CLIO Image Awards Shortlist in the Design category on behalf of client The Elizabeth Taylor Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clioimage.com/winners/2014/design/entry.cfm?entryid=801410450 |title=CLIO Image Awards 2014 &amp;#124; Winners : Design - Elizabeth Taylor / |publisher=Clioimage.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the media outlets that have featured Larry Vincent include [[Forbes]], [[Digiday]] and Ragan.com. Vincent has presented to such groups as CES, SXSW, The Conference Board, CMO Collective, and Digital Hollywood, among others. In April 2014, UTA Brand Studio in conjunction with Live Talks LA hosted Twitter co-founder and Jelly CEO Biz Stone in conversation with Vincent about Stone’s new book THINGS A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME: CONF Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livetalksla.org/blog/2014/02/16/april-9-biz-stone-co-founder-twitter/ |title=April 9 — Biz Stone, Co-founder, Twitter &amp;#124; Live Talks Los Angeles |publisher=Livetalksla.org |date=2014-04-09 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''weapons master''', sometimes credited as the '''armorer''', '''weapons specialist''', '''weapons handler''', '''weapons wrangler''', or '''weapons coordinator''', is a [[film crew]] specialist that works with the [[property master]], [[film director|director]], [[actor]]s, [[stunt coordinator]] and [[script supervisor]]. The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any weapon [[Theatrical property|props]] (including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons).

==Duties==
The weapons master is present whenever a scene with a weapon is to be shot. They present the actor with the weapon just prior to the scene, and they take control of the weapon when the scene is done. It is the primary function of the weapons master to ensure that the weapons under their control do not cause harm to the cast, crew or production property. Secondary functions include ensuring that the weapons can achieve the director's goals in terms of appearance and function, and that they meet the continuity requirements for the production. While some weapons masters work exclusively in film production, others are specialists outside of the media profession who are called in because of their familiarity, licensing and qualifications with the weapons in question. Some weapons masters (particularly in lower-budget productions) are also responsible for training the actors.  Prior to the 1980s, weapons were frequently the responsibility of the property master or his assistant, but since then, it has become increasingly common in the industry for the property master to a hire a dedicated weapons master in order to reduce the burden on himself.  However, it is still common for the property master to double as the weapons master, as a cost-saving measure, on productions where [[National Firearms Act]]-regulated firearms (such as [[machine guns]] or [[sawed-off]] [[shotguns]]) are not being used.&lt;ref name="Hart2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Eric|title=The Prop Building Guidebook: For Theatre, Film, and TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TgVSaksNhrkC&amp;pg=PT21|date=11 February 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-08573-4|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concealed or defaced==
* In March 2007 one of Banksy's early pieces, a 25&amp;nbsp;ft-long artwork featuring a collection of blue shapes with the artist's trademark tag, on the side of garages in Albion Road, [[Easton, Bristol]], was mistakenly painted over by graffiti-removal contractors Nordic. They had been asked by Bristol City Council to tackle graffiti adjacent to the Banksy work, but wrongly targeted the piece itself. Within days someone sprayed the words "''Wot no Banksy?''" over the contractors' plain paintwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6444501.stm|title=Banksy work painted over in error|publisher=BBC|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007 Banksy's famous 2002 piece depicting [[John Travolta]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' characters pointing bananas instead of guns, on a wall near Old Street tube station in London, was painted over by London Transport workmen despite having an estimated value of more than £300,000 at the time. Asked to comment on the mural's destruction, a Transport for London spokesman said "Our graffiti removal teams are staffed by professional cleaners not professional art critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6575345.stm|title=Iconic Banksy image painted over|publisher=BBC|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities had previously expressed interest in buying the work, and the gallery owner contacted  Banksy for permission to  [[Conservation-restoration|restore]] the work. Banksy however declined the offer, stating that overwriting and defacement was an inevitable reality of street art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/46984-banksy-house-art-destroyed |title=Bansky house art destroyed |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In April 2009 ''[[One Nation Under CCTV]]'', an April 2008 mural, was removed (painted over) after London's [[Westminster City Council]] had stated in October 2008 that it would remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that Banksy "has no more right to paint graffiti than a child." Robert Davis, chairman of the council planning committee told [[The Times]] newspaper: "If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art."&lt;ref name="SMHOct2008"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/banksy-art-is-graffiti-rules-council/2008/10/24/1224351528852.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Banksy art is graffiti, rules town hall |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ça ira''''' was the [[Belgium|Belgian]] monthly magazine that featured avant-garde art, literature and politics.

==History and profile==
''Ça Ira'' was founded by a [[art group|group]] of young artists, who came out of the smoking war-wrecked world of 1919 with a new élan. The title ''Ça ira'' comes from a song of the French Revolution ([[:fr:Ah! ça ira|article in French]], translated as: "We will win!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Brooker|author2=Sascha Bru|author3=Andrew Thacker|author4=Christian Weikop|title=The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA331|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=19 May 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965958-6|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty editions were published in [[Antwerp]]&lt;ref name=mus&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Mus|editor=Pieter Boulogne|title=Translation and Its Others.
