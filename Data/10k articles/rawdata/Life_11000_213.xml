'''Abbahu''' ('''{{lang-he|אבהו}}''') was a [[Jew]]ish [[Talmud]]ist, known as an ''[[Amoraim|amora]]'', who lived in the [[Land of Israel]], of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of [[Caesarea]] (Ḳisrin).  His [[rabbinic]] education was acquired mainly at [[Tiberias]], in the academy presided over by [[R. Johanan]], with whom his relations were almost those of a son.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yer.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]'' chapter II ''halachah'' 1, page 4b in [[Daniel Bomberg]]'s [[Venice]] edition, ([http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=6 ירושלמי דפוס ויניציאה (בומבירגי), ברכות דף ד טור ב] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228230053/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=6 |date=February 28, 2014 }} ), 12b in current editions ([[s:he:ירושלמי ברכות דף יב ב|ירושלמי ברכות דף יב ב]]); ''[[Gittin]]'' 44b ([[s:he:גיטין מד ב|גיטין מד ב]]), ''[[Bava Batra]]'' 39a ([[s:he:בבא בתרא לט א|בבא בתרא לט א]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the Caesarean Academy.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. [[Shab.]]'' chapter VIII ''halachah'' 1, page 11a in Bomberg's Venice edition ([http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=150 ירושלמי דפוס ויניציאה (בומבירגי), שבת דף יא טור א] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006152939/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=150 |date=October 6, 2014 }}), 54b in current editions ([[s:he:ירושלמי שבת דף נד ב|ירושלמי שבת דף נד ב]]); Yer. ''[[Pesahim]]'' chapter X ''halachah'' 1, page 37c in Bomberg's Venice edition ([http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=203&amp;hilite= ירושלמי דפוס ויניציאה (בומבירגי), פסחים דף לז טור ג] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012152/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=203&amp;hilite= |date=March 5, 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Knowledge of Greek literature==
Abbahu was an authority on weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yer.]] [[Terumot]]'' chapter V, ''halachah'' 3 page 43c in Bomberg's Venice edition ([http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=85 ירושלמי דפוס ויניציאה (בומבירגי), תרומות דף מג טור ג] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071556/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=85 |date=October 6, 2014 }}; ''halachah'' 1 in current editions&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged the study of [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle='Abbahu|volume=1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned Greek himself in order to become useful to his people, then under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[proconsul]]s'', that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] even in prayer (''Yer. [[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'' chapter VII, 21b). In spite of the bitter protest of [[Simon b. Abba]], he also taught his daughters Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. Shab.'' chapter VI, 7d; ''Yer. Sotah'' chapter IX, 24c; ''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]'' 14a&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was said of Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim ([[Ecc.]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-nb||eccl|7:18|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; compare [[Targum Onkelos|Targum]]), "It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all" (''[[Ecc. R.]]'' to 7:18).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Rector in Caesarea==
Being wise, handsome, and wealthy,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bava Metzia]]'' 84a; ''Yer. Bava Metzia'' chapter IV, 9d&lt;/ref&gt; Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hagigah]]'' 14a; ''[[Ketubot]]'' 17a&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, [[Ḥiyya b. Abba]], [[Rabbi Ammi]], and [[Rabbi Assi]], had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. [[Meg.]]'' chapter III, 74a&lt;/ref&gt; is in the main pure Hebrew, and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare ''[[Eruvin (tractate)|Eruvin]]'' 53b).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

After his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, [[R. Abba of Acre]] (Acco), as worthier than himself.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'' 40a&lt;/ref&gt; He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tan.]]'', ''[[Vayeshev|Wa-yesheb]]'', ed. [[Salomon Buber|Buber]], 16&lt;/ref&gt; Later he assumed the office of rector in Caesarea, the former seat of [[Hoshaiah Rabbah]], and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue);&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. [[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]]'' chapter VII, 56a; ''Yer. [[San.]]'' chapter I, 18a; compare [[Josephus]], ''B. J.'' ii. 14, § 5; [[Marcus Jastrow|Jastrow]], ''Dict.'' p.&amp;nbsp;838&lt;/ref&gt; from which some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Caesarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules,&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. [[Demai (tractate)|Demai]]'' chapter II, 23a, ''[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|R.H.]]'' 34a&lt;/ref&gt; one of which—that regulating the sounding of the [[shofar]]—has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish [[casuists]] as "''Takkanat R. Abbahu''" (the Enactment of R. Abbahu).&lt;ref&gt;compare "''[[Maḥzor Vitry]]''", [[Berlin]], 1893, p.&amp;nbsp;355&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. Berakhot'' chapter VIII, 12a; ''Yer. Shab.'' chapter III, 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

While on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many ''[[Halakot]]'' that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. Shabbat'' chapter VIII, 11a; ''Yer. [[Yevamot]]'' chapter I, 2d&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. Berakhot'' chapter VIII, 12a; ''Yer. [[Beitzah]]'' chapter I, 60d&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people.&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. [[Avodah Zarah]]'' chapter I, 39b&lt;/ref&gt; Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community.&lt;ref&gt;''Shabbat'' 134b; ''Yer. Shabbat'' chapter XVII, 16b; ''Yer. [[Mo'ed Katan]]'' chapter I, 80b&lt;/ref&gt; As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some [[Samaritan]] wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, [[Ḥiyya b. Abba]], Rabbi Ammi, and Rabbi Assi, he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, [[Gentiles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yer. Avodah Zarah'' chapter V, 44d; ''[[Hullin]]'' 6a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Abbahu and Ḥiyya b. Abba==
R. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met [[R. Ḥiyya b. Abba]], who was lecturing on intricate ''[[halakic]]'' themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. Ḥiyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. "What," said Abbahu, "is my modesty as compared with that of R. [[Abba of Acre]] (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions." When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, "What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?" (''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'' 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,

{{quote|Let man ever be of the persecuted, and not of the persecutors; for there are none among the birds more persecuted than turtle-doves and pigeons, and the [[Scriptures]] declare them worthy of the [[Altar (Bible)|altar]].|''[[Bava Kamma]]'' 93a&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;}}

R. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a [[haggadist]] and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the [[Christians]] of his day (''Shab.'' 152b; ''[[San.]]'' 39a; ''[[Av. Zarah]]'' 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, "In the [[Olam Haba|next world]] your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the [[Bible]] ([[Isaiah]] 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'" To this R. Abbahu replied, "Had the Bible said 'for joy' [''le-sason''], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' [''be-sason''], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water" (''[[Suk.]]'' 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the [[Jewish schisms|Schismatic]] (''Minaah''), was slowly poisoning him, but [[R. Ammi]] and [[R. Assi]] discovered the crime in time (''Av. Zarah'' 28a).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

Abbahu had two sons, Zeira and Ḥanina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi ([[Wilhelm Bacher|Bacher]], ''Agada der Babylonischen Amoräer''). Abbahu sent Ḥanina to the academy at Tiberias, where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the [[burial]] of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: "Is it because there are no graves in [[Cæsarea]] (compare [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice" (''Yer. Pesahim'' chapter III, 30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, [[R. Jonah]] and [[R. Jose]]. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, "Even the statues of Cæsarea shed tears" (''[[Mo'ed Katan]]'' 25b; ''Yer. Av. Zarah'' chapter III, 42c).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

== Other Abbahus ==
There are several other Abbahus mentioned in the [[Talmud]]im and [[Midrashim]], prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a [[Jews of Babylonia|Babylonian]] halakist, contemporary of [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] and [[Anan (amora)|Anan]] (''[[Eruvin (tractate)|Eruvin]]'' 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him (''[[Naz.]]'' 24b; ''[[Bava Metzia]]'' 14a; 75a).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

== Against the Christians ==
"When does your Messiah come?" a [[Christian]] (''Minaah'') once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: "When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Isaiah]] 60:2]," (''Sanhedrin''  99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: "How could your God in His priestly holiness bury [[Moses]] without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?" (Isaiah 40:12). "Why," said Abbahu, "does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?" (Isaiah 64:15). "Fire is the true element of purification, according to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:23," was his answer (''Sanhedrin''  39a). Another question of the same character: "Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II [[Books of Samuel|Sam.]] 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?" (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: "Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?", ''Sanhedrin''  as above).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

Abbahu made a notable exception with reference to the [[Tosefta]]'s statement that the ''Gilionim'' (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans (''Minnin'') are not to be saved from a conflagration on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]: "the books of those [written by ''Minnin'' for the purpose of debating with Jews] at Abidan may or may not be saved" (''Shab.'' 116a).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:שבת קטז א|שבת קטז א]] and [[Rashi]]'s commentary (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the benediction "''Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto''" (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the "''Shema' Yisrael''," Abbahu says that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of silently tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the ''Shema''), whereas in the Babylonian city of [[Nehardea]], where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice (''Pesahim'' 56a).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:פסחים נו א|פסחים נו א]] and Rashi's commentary (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: "A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'" (Isaiah 44:6; ''[[Ex. R.]]'' 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone:&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt; "God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; if a man says: 'I am God,' he is a liar; if he says: 'I am a son of man,' he will have cause to regret it; and if he says, 'I will go up to heaven,' he has said [''something''] but will not keep his word" (''Yer. [[Ta'anit]]'' chapter II ''halachah'' 1, end, page 65b in Bomberg's Venice edition;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=258&amp;hilite= ירושלמי דפוס ויניציאה (בומבירגי), תעניות דף סה טור ב] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073458/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=258&amp;hilite= |date=March 5, 2016 }} (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; 9a in current editions&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ירושלמי תענית דף ט א|ירושלמי תענית דף ט א]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt;).

Some of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] (''[[Yalḳ.]]'', Gen. 47), on [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (''[[Gen. R.]]'' 25), and on the resurrection (''Shab.'' 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, ''Agada der Pal. Amor.'' ii. 97, 115-118).&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=Abbahu|author=|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=164|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;

'''Abdagases I''' was an [[Indo-Parthian]] king, a nephew of [[Gondophares]] evident from some of his coins, who ruled during the first decades of the 1st century AD. Though he never assumed the title of Gondophares, he was an important successor of his uncle, ruling his Indian conquests.

The bilingual coin illustrated here exhibits the [[kharoshti]] script where it can be read as "''Gudaphara brathaputrasa maharajasa Abadagashasa''." Brathaputra means nephew in [[Prakrit]], the language in the coin. [[Zeus]] is also depicted in the same face.

'''Adjona''', also written '''Adxoña''' or '''Atxoña''' was the [[Guanches|Guanche]] [[mencey]] (king) of the [[Menceyato de Abona]] at the time of the conquest of [[Tenerife]] in the fifteenth century.

Adjona normally lived in [[Vilaflor]], in the territory of Abona, although the historian [[Juan Bethencourt Alfonso]] indicates that mencey residence was located near the modern town of ''El Rio'', [[Arico]].

Adjona signed peace in 1490 with the governor of [[Gran Canaria]], [[Pedro de Vera]], ratifying the agreement with [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] in 1494 shortly after his first landing, attaching his menceyato to the ''bando de paces'' (peace party) during the conquest. After this, Adjona was brought to [[Spain]] by Lugo to be presented to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1 La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496)]&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rest of menceyes. As a mencey of the ''bando de paces'', he returned to Tenerife and integrated into the new society. He died before 1507.

'''Alvin Plantinga's free will defense''' is a [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical argument]] developed by American [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]], the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and published in its final version in his 1977 book ''God, Freedom, and Evil''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument is a defense against the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]] as formulated by philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|issue=210|pages=455–465|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ''The Miracle of Theism,'' though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Miracle of Theism.|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Oxford:|pages=154|quote=Since this defense is formally [that is, logically] possible, and its principle involves no real abandonment of our ordinary view of the opposition between good and evil, we can concede that the problem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another. But whether this offers a real solution of the problem is another question.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mackie's logical argument from evil ==

The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent  (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world
Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|year=1955|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|pages=200–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=H. J.|year=1960|title=God and Evil|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=10|pages=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.

== Plantinga's free will defense ==
Plantinga's [[free will]] defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an ''explicit'' logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's ''implicit'' unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an ''explicit'' contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though [[omnipotent]], could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="Howard-Snyder"&gt;"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift."{{cite journal|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|year=1999|title=Transworld Sanctity and Plantinga's Free Will Defense|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|journal=International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–351|author2=John O’Leary-Hawthorne|access-date=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091750/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meister"&gt;"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil.

In addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in ''God, Freedom, and Evil.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Further details ==
As opposed to a [[theodicy]] (a ''justification'' for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a ''defense'', offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, [[prima facie]] plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it.&lt;ref name="Surin1995p193"&gt;{{harvnb|Surin|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie200"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1955|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Plantinga summarised his defense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1974|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't ''cause'' or ''determine'' them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right ''freely''. To create creatures capable of ''moral good'', therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of [[moral evil]]. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is ''possible'' that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument relies on the following propositions:
# There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize.
# A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world.
Plantinga refers to the first statement as "Leibniz's lapse" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms ''strongly actualize'', a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby ''weakly actualizing'' a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from "transworld depravity".

== Reception ==
According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted.&lt;ref name="Meister134"/&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] says that "it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of [[God and evil]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Howard-Snyder|O'Leary-Hawthorne|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alston]] has said that "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Alston|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Rowe]] has written "granted [[incompatibilism]], there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1979|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arguing about Gods'', [[Graham Oppy]] offers a dissent, acknowledging that "[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" but continuing "I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppy|2006|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.”&lt;ref name="Weisberger 1999 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Weisberger|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the [[problem of evil]] presently revolves around the ''evidential'' problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional objections and responses ==

=== Incompatibilist view of free will === 
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=A diagram. At the top, an orange box labeled "Determinism?" with two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to an orange box labeled "Free will?", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Libertarianism". The box labeled "Free will?" has two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to a light-blue box labeled "Compatibilism", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Hard determinism". The two light-blue boxes labeled "Hard determinism" and "Libertarianism" are surrounded by a grey ellipse labeled "Incompatibilism".|A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will.]]
Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher [[Antony Flew]], have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"/&gt;

Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating "this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transworld depravity ===
Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a ''world segment'', meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, ''transworld depravity'' is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
A person ''P suffers from transworld depravity'' if and only if the following holds: for every world ''W'' such that ''P'' is significantly free in ''W'' and ''P'' does only what is right in ''W'', there is an action ''A'' and a maximal world segment ''S´'' such that
# ''S´'' includes ''A'' 's being morally significant for ''P''
# ''S´'' includes ''P'' 's being free with respect to ''A''
# ''S´'' is included in ''W'' and includes neither ''P'' 's performing ''A'' nor ''P'' 's refraining from performing ''A''
# If ''S´'' were actual, ''P'' would go wrong with respect to ''A''.}}
Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.

Plantinga responds that "What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil"&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48" /&gt; and that it is logically ''possible'' that every person suffers from transworld depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5680">'''Antonio Bosio''' (c. 1575 or 1576&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1629) was an Italian scholar, the first systematic explorer of subterranean Rome (the "[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] of the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]]"), author of ''Roma Sotterranea'' and first [[urban spelunker]].

==Life==
Bosio was born in [[Malta]], and was sent as a boy to the care of his uncle, who was a representative at the [[Holy See]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. He studied literature, philosophy, and jurisprudence, but at the age of eighteen he gave up his legal studies, went to Rome and for the remainder of his lifetime was devoted to [[archaeology|archaeological]] work in the Roman catacombs. He died in Rome in 1629.

==Work==
The accidental discovery in 1578 of an ancient subterranean cemetery on the [[Via Salaria]] had attracted general attention in Rome. Few, however, realized the importance of the discovery, and with the exception of three foreign scholars, [[Alfonso Chacon]],&lt;ref&gt;The Andalusian scholar Chacon (c1540/42&amp;ndash;1599) called Ciacconio in Italy), entered the Dominican order and concentrated in ecclesiastical history and Christian antiquities, producing a Lives of the popes and cardinals of the Holy Roman Church' that was published in Rome, 1601-1602&lt;/ref&gt; the antiquarian Philips van Winghe (1560–1592) from [[Leuven]] &lt;ref&gt;See on Philips van Winghe: Cornelis Schuddeboom, ''Philips van Winghe (1560-1592) en het ontstaan van de christelijke archeologie'', Haren 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean L'Heureux (alias Macarius),&lt;ref&gt;L'Heureux's notes on the catacombs of 1605 remained in manuscript until they were edited and published in the mid-nineteenth century by [[Raffaele Garrucci]]; {{CathEncy|wstitle=Raffaele Garrucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; no one seriously thought of pursuing further investigations. Bosio began the systematic exploration of subterranean Rome and thus became a precursor of the science of [[Christian archaeology]], an inspiration to [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]]. The young explorer realized that early Christian literature such as ''[[wikt:acta|acta]]'' of the martyrs and accounts of the councils would offer clues to the locations of the catacombs; an idea of the vast scope of his reading is in two great folio volumes of his manuscript notes in the [[Vallicelliana]] library at Rome, each of which contains about a thousand pages.

The scholarly labors of Bosio accounted for only half of his time; after he had collected all the data possible relative to the location of a catacomb on one of the great [[Roman road]]s leading from Rome, Bosio would set out for the places indicated, and cover the ground carefully in the hope of discovering a forgotten stairway offering access, or a ''luminarium'' lighting the underground galleries of a cemetery. He had the sense to question the local peasants. He would then descend to the subterranean galleries and commence his explorations. Narrow passages led from one series of galleries to another. Years could pass without any new entrances being discovered.

==Publication==
This life work of Bosio was all but unknown until the publication three years after his death of his ''Roma Sotterranea, opera postuma di Antonio Bosio Romano, antiquario ecclesiastico singolare de' suoi tempi. Compita, disposta, et accresciuta dal M. R. P. Giovanni Severani da S. Severino'' (Rome, 1632), usually referred to as ''Roma Sotterranea''. The folio volume was brought out under the patronage of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]], edited by the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] Severano, under the patronage of Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]]. A Latin translation that appeared in 1651 took liberties with the text. Bosio's ''Roma Sotterranea'' is entirely devoted to a description of the cemeteries with the end of ascertaining all that was possible regarding the history of each cemetery, by what name it was known in antiquity, who its founders were, and what martyrs and illustrious Christians were interred there. Many of his conclusions have in modern times been found to be erroneous, but Bosio's method is acknowledged to have been scientific within the shortcomings of the infant science of archaeology. The engravings that accompanied the volume are of little use to the modern archaeologist.

An unfortunate result of the publication was that with the locations known, the catacombs were scoured for anything that might prove of value on the market; though much information on the condition of the catacombs and their inscriptions and frescoes in the early 17th century was preserved in Bosio's volume, much also was lost. Some of the catacombs Bosio described have since been destroyed by subsequent construction.

This book must have been rated highly by the English physician and philosopher  Sir [[Thomas Browne]], for copies in both Italian and Latin can be found in [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne|his library]].

==Activism and legacy==

Terminal cancer patients Kara Tippetts and Maggie Karner both sent letters to Maynard asking her to reconsider.&lt;ref name=Zurcher&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-29576003|title=A cancer patient's decision to die|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=January 23, 2015|date=October 10, 2014|first=Anthony|last=Zurcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after Maynard's death, a top [[Holy See|Vatican]] official mentioned her decision to die in the context of reiterating the Catholic Church's position on the right-to-die debate, noting that, "Suicide is not a good thing. It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and toward those around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/vatican-official-condemns-brittany-maynard|title=Vatican Official Condemns Terminally Ill Brittany Maynard's Decision to Die|author=Corriston, Michele |date=November 4, 2014|work=People}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Right to Life Committee]] (NRLC) asserted that from its perspective, Maynard's chosen non-profit, [[Compassion &amp; Choices]] had "exploited the illness of Brittany Maynard to promote legalization of doctor prescribed suicide in the states."&lt;ref name=WashPost20141103/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/03/us-usa-assistedsuicide-oregon-idUSKBN0IN22H20141103|title=Condolences pour in for family of Brittany Maynard after suicide|author=COURTNEY SHERWOOD|date=November 3, 2014 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany's mother defended her daughter's decision via a letter released by Compassion &amp; Choices, stating "My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.compassionandchoices.org/2014/11/18/brittany-maynards-mother-responds-to-vatican-other-critics-of-her-daughters-end-of-life-choice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205072829/https://www.compassionandchoices.org/2014/11/18/brittany-maynards-mother-responds-to-vatican-other-critics-of-her-daughters-end-of-life-choice/ |archivedate=2014-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Bronson''' (born '''Charles Dennis Buchinsky'''; {{lang-lt|Karolis Dionyzas Bučinskis}}; November 3, 1921 – August 30, 2003) was an American actor.

He was often cast in the role of a [[police officer]], [[gunfighter]], or [[vigilante]] in revenge-oriented plot lines. He had long-term collaborations with film directors [[Michael Winner]] and [[J. Lee Thompson]], and appeared in fifteen films alongside his second wife, [[Jill Ireland]].

==Early life==
Bronson was born Charles Dennis Buchinsky, the 11th of 15 children, in a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent in [[Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania]], in the coal region of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] north of [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ENC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of early television crime fighters: all regular cast members in American crime and mystery series, 1948-59|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|page=80|isbn=0-7864-2476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

===Acting training (1946–1951)===
After the end of World War II, Bronson worked at many odd jobs until joining a theatrical group in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. He later shared an apartment in [[New York City]] with [[Jack Klugman]] while both were aspiring to play on the stage. In 1950, he married and moved to [[Hollywood]], where he enrolled in acting classes and began to find small roles.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Early film roles (1951–1954)===
Bronson's first film role&amp;nbsp;— an uncredited one&amp;nbsp;— was as a sailor in ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'' in 1951, directed by [[Henry Hathaway]]. Other early screen appearances were in ''[[The Mob (film)|The Mob]]'' (1951); ''[[The People Against O'Hara]]'' (1951), directed by [[John Sturges]]; ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1952 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1952); ''[[Battle Zone (film)|Battle Zone]]'' (1952); ''[[Pat and Mike]]'' (1952), as a boxer and mob enforcer; ''[[Diplomatic Courier]]'' (1952), another for Hathaway; ''[[My Six Convicts]]'' (1952); ''[[The Marrying Kind]]'' (1952); and ''[[Red Skies of Montana]]'' (1952).

In 1952, Bronson boxed in a ring with [[Roy Rogers]] in Rogers' show ''Knockout''. He appeared on an episode of ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' as a boxer in a skit with Skelton playing "Cauliflower McPugg". He appeared with fellow guest star [[Lee Marvin]] in an episode of ''[[Biff Baker, U.S.A.]]'', an espionage series on [[CBS]] starring [[Alan Hale, Jr.]]

He had small roles in ''[[Miss Sadie Thompson]]'' (1953); ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' (1953), directed by [[Andre DeToth]]; ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953); ''[[Torpedo Alley (film)|Torpedo Alley]]'' (1953); and ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'', starring [[Randolph Scott]], directed by DeToth again.

Bronson had a notable support part as an Indian in ''[[Apache (film)|Apache]]'' (1954) for director [[Robert Aldrich]] who then used him again in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' (1954). Bronson then made a strong impact as the main villain in the [[Alan Ladd]] western ''[[Drum Beat]]'' as a murderous [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma|Modoc]] warrior, [[Kintpuash|Captain Jack]] (based on a real person), who relishes wearing the tunics of soldiers he has killed.

He had roles in ''[[Tennessee Champ]]'' (1954) for MGM, and ''[[Crime Wave (1954 film)|Crime Wave]]'' (1954) directed by de Toth.

In 1954, during the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) proceedings, he changed his surname from Buchinsky to Bronson at the suggestion of his agent, who feared that an Eastern European surname might damage his career.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

===As "Charles Bronson" (1955–1958)===
As "Charles Bronson", he could be seen in ''[[Target Zero]]'' (1955), ''[[Big House, U.S.A.]]'' (1955), and ''[[Jubal (film)|Jubal]]'' (1956).

Bronson had the lead role of the episode "The Apache Kid" of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Crime film|crime drama]] ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'', starring [[John Bromfield]]; Bronson was subsequently cast twice in 1959 after the series was renamed ''U.S. Marshal''.&lt;ref name="chuck"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael R.|last=Pitts|title=Charles Bronson: The 95 Films and the 156 Television Appearances|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=1999|page=313|isbn=0-7864-0601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He guest-starred in the short-lived CBS [[situation comedy]], ''[[Hey, Jeannie!]]'' and in three episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'': "And So Died Riabouchinska" (1956), "There Was an Old Woman" (1956), and "The Woman Who Wanted to Live" (1962).

In 1957, Bronson was cast in the Western series ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'' as an outlaw named Danny Arnold in the episode "Young Gun".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=Young Gun|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504075613/http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm#|archive-date=2012-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a support role in [[Sam Fuller]]'s ''[[Run of the Arrow]]'' (1957).

===Leading man (1958–1960)===
Bronson scored the lead in his own [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s detective series ''[[Man with a Camera]]'' (1958–1960), in which he portrayed Mike Kovac, a former combat photographer freelancing in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/man-with-a-camera|title=Man With a Camera|work=TV.com|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was cast in leading man roles in some low budget films, notably, ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' (1958), a biopic of a [[Machine Gun Kelly|real life gangster]] directed by [[Roger Corman]]. He also starred in ''[[Gang War (1958 film)|Gang War]]'' (1958), ''[[When Hell Broke Loose]]'' (1958), and ''[[Showdown at Boot Hill]]'' (1959).

On television, he played Steve Ogrodowski, a naval intelligence officer, in two episodes of the CBS military sitcom/drama, ''[[Hennesey]]'', starring [[Jackie Cooper]], and he played Rogue Donovan, an escaped murderer in ''[[Yancy Derringer]]'' (episode: "Hell and High Water"). Bronson starred alongside [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] in a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode ("[[Two (The Twilight Zone)|Two]]"; 1961). He appeared in five episodes of [[Richard Boone]]'s ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' (1957–63).

Bronson had a support role in an expensive war film, ''[[Never So Few]]'' (1959), directed by John Sturges. Bronson was cast in the 1960 episode "Zigzag" of ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687123|title="Zigzag", next-to-the last episode, December 26, 1960|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was cast as "Dutch Malkin" in the 1960 episode "The Generous Politician" of ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]]''.

===Leading support actor in Hollywood (1960–1968)===
[[File:Charles Bronson 1961.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo, 1961]]
In 1960, he garnered attention in [[John Sturges]]' ''The Magnificent Seven'', in which he was cast as one of seven gunfighters taking up the cause of the defenseless. During filming, Bronson was a loner who kept to himself, according to [[Eli Wallach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanlegends.com/actors/eili%20wallach/index.html Exclusive interview with Eli Wallach]&lt;/ref&gt; He received $50,000 for this role.&lt;ref&gt;"Stagecoach to tombstone: the filmgoers' guide to the great westerns". I.B. Tauris, 2008; {{ISBN|1-84511-571-6}}/{{ISBN|978-1-84511-571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role made him a favorite actor of many in the since disbanded [[Soviet Union]], such as [[Vladimir Vysotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[:ru:Новиков, Владимир Иванович|Владимир Иванович Новиков/V.I.

AIP put Bronson in the romantic lead of ''[[Master of the World (1961 film)|Master of the World]]'' (1961), supporting [[Vincent Price]]. He had a support role in MGM's ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) but a bigger part in ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]'' (1961).

In 1961, Bronson was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his supporting role in an episode entitled "Memory in White" of CBS's ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', hosted by [[Ronald Reagan]]. In 1962, he appeared alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Kid Galahad]]''. In 1963, he co-starred in the [[TV series|series]] ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael R.|last=Pitts|title=Charles Bronson: The 95 Films and the 156 Television Appearances|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=1999|pages=274–77|isbn= 0-7864-0601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturges cast Bronson for another Hollywood production, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963), as [[claustrophobic]] Polish [[prisoner of war]] Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski, nicknamed "The Tunnel King" (coincidentally, Bronson was really claustrophobic because of his childhood work in a mine). The film was a huge hit and Bronson had one of the leads, but he still found himself playing a villain in ''[[4 for Texas]]'' (1963) for Robert Aldrich.

During the 1963–64 television season Bronson portrayed Linc, the stubborn [[wagonmaster]] in the ABC western series, ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]''.

Bronson had the lead in ''[[Guns of Diablo]]'' (1965), a Western. In the 1965–1966 season, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]''. In 1965, Bronson was cast as a demolitions expert in an episode of ABC's ''[[Combat!]]''

He had a relatively minor role in ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965) and was billed fourth in MGM's ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1966), which the popularity of stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor propelled to a big success. He was billed third in ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966).

In 1967, he guest-starred as Ralph Schuyler, an undercover government agent in the episode "The One That Got Away" on ABC's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

That year Aldrich gave Bronson an excellent role in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967), where he played an Army [[death row]] convict conscripted into a suicide mission. It was a massive box office success but Bronson was only the third lead. He seemed unable to make the transition to star of major studio films in Hollywood. In ''[[Villa Rides]]'' (1968) he supported [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Yul Brynner]], playing the real-life [[Rodolfo Fierro]].

===Stardom in Europe (1968–1972)===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Bronson made a serious name for himself in European films. He was making ''Villa Rides'' when approached by the producers of a French film ''[[Adieu l'ami]]'' looking for an American co-star for [[Alain Delon]]. Bronson's agent Paul Kohner later recalled the producer pitched the actor "on the fact that in the American film industry all the money, all the publicity, goes to the pretty boy hero types. In Europe... the public is attracted by character, not face."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;America discovers a 'sacred monster': Bronson looks as if at any moment he's about to hit someone Bronson 'Charlie Bronson really is a guy with a lot of humor and a lot of tenderness, both of which he hides.' By Bill Davidson New York Times 22 Sep 1974: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a big success in Europe. Even more popular was ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968) where Bronson played Harmonica. The director, [[Sergio Leone]], once called him "the greatest actor I ever worked with",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ambrosio|first1=Brian|title=Menacing Face Worth Millions: A Life of Charles Bronson|date=2012|publisher=Lulu|location=Raleigh, NC|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6x7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=leone++%22the+greatest+actor+I+ever+worked+with%22#v=onepage&amp;q=leone%20%20%22the%20greatest%20actor%20I%20ever%20worked%20with%22|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had wanted to cast Bronson for the lead in 1964's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''.

Bronson appeared in a French action film, ''[[Guns for San Sebastian]]'' (1968) alongside [[Anthony Quinn]]. In Britain, he was cast in the lead of ''[[Lola (1969 film)|Lola]]'' (1969), playing a middle-aged man in love with a 16-year-old girl. He then made a buddy comedy with [[Tony Curtis]] in Turkey, ''[[You Can't Win 'Em All]]'' (1970).

Bronson then played the lead in a French thriller, ''[[Rider on the Rain]]'' (1970) which was a big hit in France. It won a Hollywood [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Bronson starred in some French-Italian action films, ''[[Violent City]]'' (1970) and ''[[Cold Sweat (1970 film)|Cold Sweat]]'' (1970), the latter directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. He was in a French thriller, ''[[Someone Behind the Door]]'' (1971) alongside [[Anthony Perkins]], then starred in another directed by Young, the French-Spanish-Italian Western, ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971). ''[[The Valachi Papers]]'' (1972) was a third with Young; Bronson played [[Joseph Valachi]].
  
That year, this overseas fame earned him a special Golden Globe [[Henrietta Award]] for "World Film Favorite - Male" together with [[Sean Connery]].

===Return to the U.S. (1972–1974)===
In 1972 Bronson began a string of successful action films for [[United Artists]], beginning with ''[[Chato's Land]]'' (1972), although he had done several films for UA before this in the 1960s (''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', etc.).

''Chato's Land'' was the first film Bronson made with director [[Michael Winner]]. Winner was reunited with Bronson in ''[[The Mechanic (1972 film)|The Mechanic]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Stone Killer]]'' (1973). Bronson worked with Sturges on ''[[Chino (1973 film)|Chino]]'' (1973), then did ''[[Mr. Majestyk]]'' (1974) with [[Richard Fleischer]] based on a book by [[Elmore Leonard]].

One film UA brought into the domestic mainstream was ''[[Violent City]]'', an Italian-made film originally released overseas in 1970, but not issued in the U.S. until 1974 under the title ''[[The Family (1970 film)|The Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael R.|last=Pitts|title=Charles Bronson: The 95 Films and the 156 Television Appearances|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=1999|pages=53–54|isbn=0-7864-0601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronson's most famous role came when he was age 52, in ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', the most popular film with director [[Michael Winner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1440296/Charles-Bronson.html|title=Charles Bronson|date=2003-09-01|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played Paul Kersey, a successful New York [[architect]] who  turns into a crime-fighting [[vigilante]] after his wife is murdered and his daughter sexually assaulted.

Bronson starred in two films directed by [[Tom Gries]]: ''[[Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout]]'' (1975), and ''[[Breakheart Pass (film)|Breakheart Pass]]'' (1975), a Western adapted from a novel by [[Alistair Maclean]], which was a box office disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;Movies: Yesterday's heroism--Could it cure today's ailing western?

He earned good reviews. Bronson reached his pinnacle in box-office drawing power in 1975, when he was ranked 4th, behind only [[Robert Redford]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[Al Pacino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Filmgoers' guide to the great crime movies|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2006|page=xx|isbn=1-84511-219-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronson did a Western comedy for UA, ''[[From Noon till Three]]'' (1976) but it was not well received. At Warner Bros he made ''[[St. Ives (1976 film)|St. Ives]]'' (1976), his first film with director [[J. Lee Thompson]]. He played [[Dan Shomron]] in ''[[Raid on Entebbe (film)|Raid on Entebbe]]'' (1977), then was reunited with Thompson in ''[[The White Buffalo]]'' (1977), produced by Dino de Laurentiis for UA. UA also released ''[[Telefon (film)|Telefon]]'' (1977), directed by [[Don Siegel]].

Bronson went on to make two films for ITC, ''[[Love and Bullets (1979 film)|Love and Bullets]]'' (1979) and ''[[Borderline (1980 film)|Borderline]]'' (1980). He was reunited with Thompson on ''[[Caboblanco]]'' (1980), and played [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]] in ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981), opposite [[Lee Marvin]].

===Cannon Films era (1982–1989)===
In the years between 1976 and 1994, Bronson commanded high salaries to star in numerous films made by smaller production companies, most notably [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], for whom some of his last films were made.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Bronson was paid $1.5 million by Cannon to star in ''[[Death Wish II]]'' (1982), directed by Michael Winner."&lt;ref name="death"&gt;THE REINCARNATION OF A 'DEATH WISH' Trombetta, Jim. ''Los Angeles Times'' 13 July 1981: g1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, architect Paul Kersey (Bronson) moves to Los Angeles with his daughter. After she is murdered at the hands of several gang members, Kersey is once again forced to become a vigilante. The film was a big success at the box office.

Cannon Films promptly hired Bronson for ''[[10 to Midnight]]'' (1983). The movie marks the fourth collaboration between Bronson and director  [[J. Lee Thompson]], where Bronson played a cop chasing a serial killer. The supporting cast that includes [[Lisa Eilbacher]], [[Andrew Stevens]], [[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]], [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]], and [[Wilford Brimley]].

ITC Entertainment hired Thompson and Bronson for ''[[The Evil That Men Do (film)|The Evil That Men Do]]'' (1984), co-starring [[Theresa Saldana]], and [[Joseph Maher]]. The film was adapted by David Lee Henry and John Crowther from the novel of the same name by R. Lance Hill. Bronson plays a former assassin, who comes out of retirement to avenge the death of his journalist friend.

Then Cannon reunited Bronson and Winner for ''[[Death Wish 3]]'' (1985). It is the last to be directed by [[Michael Winner]]. Kersey returns to battle with New York street [[Punk subculture|punk]] gangs while receiving tacit support from a local NYPD lieutenant ([[Ed Lauter]]).

Bronson did ''[[Murphy's Law (film)|Murphy's Law]]'' (1986) for Cannon with Thompson. It co-stars [[Carrie Snodgress]], and [[Kathleen Wilhoite]]. Jack Murphy (Bronson), a hardened, antisocial [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective, frequently escapes the harsh reality that his ex-wife (Tompkins) has become a stripper and his career is going nowhere by drinking. His world is turned upside down, however, when he is framed by ex-convict Joan Freeman (Snodgress) for putting her in prison earlier in his career.

Bronson had a slight change of pace with a [[television film]], ''[[Act of Vengeance]]'' (1986) playing real-life union worker [[Joseph Yablonski]] (Bronson) directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]]. The movie is based on the book, ''Act of Vengeance'' by Trevor Armbrister, a fact-based story about the corruption that occurred during the [[United Mine Workers]]' presidential elections in 1969. It premiered on April 21, 1986.

More typical of this period were four Cannon action films: ''[[Assassination (1987 film)|Assassination]]'' (1987) directed by Peter Hunt, and three with Thompson: ''[[Death Wish 4: The Crackdown]]'' (1988), ''[[Messenger of Death]]'' (1989) and ''[[Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects]]'' (1989).

===Final years===
Bronson's first non action film in a long time was ''[[The Indian Runner]]'' (1991), directed by [[Sean Penn]]. He followed this with some TV movies, ''[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]'' and ''[[The Sea Wolf (1993 film)|The Sea Wolf]]'' (1993).

Bronson's last starring role in a theatrically released film was 1994's ''[[Death Wish V: The Face of Death]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|314}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final films were the TV movies ''[[Family of Cops]]'' (1995), ''[[Breach of Faith: A Family of Cops 2]]'' (1997) and ''[[Family of Cops 3]]'' (1999).

== Missed roles ==
[[Ingmar Bergman]] wanted to make a film with Bronson but the actor turned him down. "Everything is weakness and sickness with Bergman," he said.&lt;ref&gt;"The Man: Charles Bronson: An Enduring Belief in the American Superhero", By Joel Kotkin. ''The Washington Post'', 3 June 1977: B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was considered for the role of [[Snake Plissken]] in ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), but director [[John Carpenter]] thought he was too tough looking and too old for the part, and decided to cast [[Kurt Russell]] instead.

Bronson auditioned for the role of [[Superman]] for the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 film adaptation]], but producer [[Ilya Salkind]] turned him down for being too earthy and decided to cast [[Christopher Reeve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-look-its-christopher-reeve-vol-11-no-1/ |title=Look!

His first marriage was to Harriet Tendler, whom he met when both were fledgling actors in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2011/01/wamg-interview-harriett-bronson-first-wife-of-charles-bronson-and-author-of-charlie-and-me/|title=WAMG Interview: Harriett Bronson, first wife of Charles Bronson and author of CHARLIE AND ME - We Are Movie Geeks|date=2011-01-19|work=We Are Movie Geeks|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children before divorcing in 1965. She wrote in her memoir that she "was an 18-year-old virgin when she met the 26-year-old Charlie Buchinsky at a Philadelphia acting school in 1947. Two years later, with the grudging consent of her father, a successful, [[Jews|Jewish]] dairy farmer, Tendler wed Buchinsky, a Catholic and a former coal miner. Tendler supported them both while she and Charlie pursued their acting dreams. On their first date, he had four cents in his pocket&amp;nbsp;— and went on, now as Charles Bronson, to become one of the highest paid actors in the country." {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Bronson was married to English actress [[Jill Ireland]] from October 5, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bronson Documentary, Biography Channel.&lt;/ref&gt; until her death in 1990. He had met her in 1962, when she was married to [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor [[David McCallum]]. At the time, Bronson (who shared the screen with McCallum in ''The Great Escape'') reportedly told him, "I'm going to marry your wife". The Bronsons lived in a grand Bel Air mansion in [[Los Angeles]] with seven children: two by his previous marriage, three by hers (one of whom was adopted) and two of their own (another one of whom was adopted). After they married, she often played his leading lady, and they starred in fourteen films together.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

To maintain a close family, they would load up everyone and take them to wherever filming was taking place, so that they could all be together. They spent time in a colonial farmhouse on {{convert|260|acre|km2}} in [[West Windsor, Vermont]],&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-08-31-bronson-dies_x.htm|title=Action film star Charles Bronson dead at 81|accessdate=2008-12-19|work=USA Today|date=2003-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Ireland raised horses and provided training for their daughter Zuleika so that she could perform at the higher levels of horse showing. The Vermont farm, "Zuleika Farm", was named for the only natural child between them. During the late 1980s through the mid-1990s Bronson regularly spent winter holidays vacationing with his family in [[Snowmass, Colorado]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On May 18, 1990, aged 54, after a long battle with [[breast cancer]], Jill Ireland died of the disease at their home in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/19/obituaries/jill-ireland-actress-54-is-dead-wrote-of-her-fight-with-cancer.html|title=Jill Ireland, Actress, 54, Is Dead; Wrote of Her Fight With Cancer|last=Yarrow|first=Andrew L.|date=1990-05-19|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, Bronson was married for a third time to Kim Weeks, a former employee of Dove Audio who had helped record Ireland in the production of her audiobooks. The couple were married for five years until Bronson's death in 2003.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Death===
Bronson's health deteriorated in his later years, and he retired from acting after undergoing hip-replacement surgery in August 1998. Bronson died at age 81 on August 30, 2003, at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Although [[pneumonia]] and/or [[Alzheimer's disease]] have been cited as his cause of death, neither appears on his death certificate, which cites "[[respiratory failure]]", "metastatic [[lung cancer]]", with, secondarily, "chronic obstructive [[pulmonary disease]]" and "[[congestive cardiomyopathy]]" as the causes of death.&lt;ref name="deathcertificate"&gt;[http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/bronson,%20charles_dc.pdf Death Certificate for Charles Bronson], autopsyfiles.org; accessed November 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred at Brownsville Cemetery in [[West Windsor, Vermont]].&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

{{For|information about chromosomes in biology|chromosome}}
In [[genetic algorithm]]s, a '''chromosome''' (also sometimes called a '''genotype''') is a set of parameters which define a proposed solution to the problem that the genetic algorithm is trying to solve. The set of all solutions is known as the ''population''.&lt;ref name=ga-description&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to genetic algorithms: IV. Genetic Algorithm|url=http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/ga-basic-description.php|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chromosome is often represented as a binary [[string (computer science)|string]], although a wide variety of other [[data structure]]s are also used.

==Chromosome design==
The design of the chromosome and its parameters is by necessity specific to the problem to be solved. Traditionally, chromosomes are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, however other encodings are also possible;&lt;ref name=ga-tutorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Darrell|title=A genetic algorithm tutorial|journal=Statistics and Computing|date=June 1994|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1007/BF00175354}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; almost any representation which allows the solution to be represented as a finite-length string can be used.&lt;ref name=what-are-gas&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Genetic Algorithms?|url=http://www.optiwater.com/optiga/ga.html|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a suitable representation of the problem domain for a chromosome is an important consideration, as a good representation will make the search easier by limiting the search space; similarly, a poorer representation will allow a larger search space.&lt;ref name=ga-notes&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic algorithms|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/cs9414/notes/ml/05ga/05ga.html|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] [[genetic operator|operator]] and [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] operator employed by the genetic algorithm must also take into account the chromosome's design.

===Example 1: binary representation===
Suppose the problem is to find the integer value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 255 that provides the maximal result for &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;. The possible solutions for this problem are the integers from 0 to 255, which can all be represented as 8-digit binary strings. Thus, we might use an 8-digit binary string as our chromosome. If a given chromosome in the population represents the value 155, its chromosome would be &lt;code&gt;10011011&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that this is not the type of problem that is normally solved by a genetic algorithm, since it can be trivially solved using numeric methods; it is only used to serve as a simple example.

===Example 2: string representation===
A more realistic problem we might wish to solve is the [[travelling salesman problem]]. In this problem, we seek an ordered list of cities that results in the shortest trip for the salesman to travel. Suppose there are six cities, which we'll call A, B, C, D, E, and F. A good design for our chromosome might be the ordered list we want to try. An example chromosome we might encounter in the population might be &lt;code&gt;DFABEC&lt;/code&gt;.

==Selection, crossover and mutation==
{{see also|Selection (genetic algorithm)|Crossover (genetic algorithm)|Mutation (genetic algorithm)}}
In each generation of the genetic algorithm, two parent chromosomes are selected based on their fitness values; these chromosomes are used by the mutation and crossover operators to produce two offspring chromosomes for the new population.&lt;ref name=what-are-gas /&gt;

[[File:Quakingfallcolors.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Many organisms, including [[aspen tree]]s, reproduce by cloning]]
'''Cloning''' is the process of producing [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals of an [[organism]] either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through [[asexual reproduction]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]). Beyond [[biology]], the term refers to the production of multiple copies of [[digital media]] or [[software]].

The term '''clone''', invented by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:κλών#Ancient Greek|κλών]] ''klōn'', "twig", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term '''lusus''' was traditionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.|year=1868|title=Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congress held at Paris in August 1867; together with an Historical Introduction and Commentary by Alphonse de Candolle, Translated from the French|publisher=L.

Weddell}}{{rp|21, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a "long o" instead of a "short o".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Natural cloning==
Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years. It is the reproduction method used by [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[bacteria]], and is also the way that [[Clonal colony|clonal colonies]] reproduce themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=23 July 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226063158/http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these organisms include [[Vaccinium corymbosum|blueberry plants]], [[Hazel|hazel trees]], [[Pando (tree)|the Pando trees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeWoody, J. |author2=Rowe, C.A. |author3=Hipkins, V.D. |author4=Mock, K.E. |date=2008 |title= "Pando" Lives: Molecular Genetic Evidence of a Giant Aspen Clone in Central Utah |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=493–497 |doi=10.3398/1527-0904-68.4.493|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol68/iss4/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NALDC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/27665/PDF | title=Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clonal dynamics in western North American aspen (Populus tremuloides) | publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd | date=2008 | accessdate=2013-12-05 | authors=Mock, K.E., Rowe, C.A., Hooten, M.B., Dewoody, J., Hipkins, V.D. | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''[[Myrica]]''s, and the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum.]]

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] – inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection – selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

===Cloning unicellular organisms===
[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).&lt;ref name="CloningRings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===
{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called "research cloning" or "therapeutic cloning." The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called "reproductive cloning"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.&lt;ref name="Halim"&gt;{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.&lt;ref name=Halim /&gt; The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.&lt;ref name="Plus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.&lt;ref name="Latham"&gt;{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title=Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119–132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122210/http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==
{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]
{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sagers, Larry A. (2 March 2009) [http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf Proliferate favorite trees by grafting, cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301102536/http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf |date=1 March 2014 }} Utah Stae University, Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102001108| title = Multidisciplinary perspectives on banana (''Musa'' spp.) domestication| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108| url = http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130704133315/http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2013-07-04| issue = 28| pages = 11311–11318| year = 2011| last1 = Perrier| first1 = X.| last2 = De Langhe| first2 = E.| last3 = Donohue| first3 = M.| last4 = Lentfer| first4 = C.| last5 = Vrydaghs| first5 = L.| last6 = Bakry| first6 = F.| last7 = Carreel| first7 = F.| last8 = Hippolyte| first8 = I.| last9 = Horry| first9 = J. -P.| last10 = Jenny| first10 = C.| last11 = Lebot| first11 = V.| last12 = Risterucci| first12 = A. -M.| last13 = Tomekpe| first13 = K.| last14 = Doutrelepont| first14 = H.| last15 = Ball| first15 = T.| last16 = Manwaring| first16 = J.| last17 = De Maret| first17 = P.| last18 = Denham| first18 = T.| pmid = 21730145| pmc = 3136277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,&lt;ref&gt;Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20&lt;/ref&gt; fish (for example the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin&gt;Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html Birds Do It. Bees Do It. Dragons Don’t Need To] New York Times, Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Komodo dragon]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin/&gt; and [[whiptail lizard|lizards]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== First steps ====
[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Robertis|first1=EM|title=Spemann's organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos|journal=Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology|date=April 2006|volume=7|issue=4|pages=296–302|pmid=16482093|pmc=2464568|doi=10.1038/nrm1855}}.  See [http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v7/n4/box/nrm1855_BX1.html Box 1: Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.&lt;ref name=HumanGenomeInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], a [[Finn-Dorset]] [[domestic sheep|ewe]], was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell.

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurdon J | journal=Dev. Biol. | date= Apr 1962 | volume=4| issue=2 | pages=256–73 | title=Adult frogs derived from the nuclei of single somatic cells | pmid= 13903027 | doi=10.1016/0012-1606(62)90043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean "first vertebrate"?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.&lt;ref name="Wakayama" /&gt;

Dolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.&lt;ref name=BBCname&gt;BBC. 22 February 2008.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18523539 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | pmc=2323472 | date=July 2007 | journal=Mcgill J Med | pages=112–20 | last1 = Kfoury | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

There are a variety of [[bioethics|ethical]] positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially [[human cloning]]. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; and to stave off the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[woolly mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.  In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16068581 |title=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth.&lt;ref name=rure&gt;[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ "Когда вернутся мамонты"] ("When the Mammoths Return"), February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: [[ruminant]]s rely on a [[symbiosis]] with specific [[microbiota]] in their stomachs for digestion.&lt;ref name=rure/&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of New South Wales]] announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct [[gastric-brooding frog]] would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Resurrecting the Extinct Frog with a Stomach for a Womb|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-15|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/15/resurrecting-the-extinct-frog-with-a-stomach-for-a-womb/|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many such "De-extinction" projects are described in the [[Long Now Foundation]]'s Revive and Restore Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://longnow.org/revive/ | title=Long Now Foundation, Revive and Restore Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifespan===
After an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals.&lt;ref name="Wakayama"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Cell Stem Cell | date = 7 March 2013  | volume=12 |issue=3 | pages=293–7 | title=Successful serial recloning in the mouse over multiple generations | authors=Wakayama S1, Kohda T, Obokata H, Tokoro M, Li C, Terashita Y, Mizutani E, Nguyen VT, Kishigami S, Ishino F, Wakayama T | pmid = 23472871 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gen25"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130307122958.htm|title=Generations of Cloned Mice With Normal Lifespans Created: 25th Generation and Counting|publisher=Science Daily|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Epigenetics Revolution|last=Carey|first=Nessa|publisher=Icon Books Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=978-184831-347-7|location=London, UK|pages=149–150|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly the sheep was created from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland. Because of this, she aged quicker than other naturally born animals because she was started from already aging cells. She died prematurely at six years old, not only from her age but from respiratory issues and severe arthritis. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}{{dubious|date=August 2018}}

A detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.&lt;ref name="BBCname" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

Discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' to depict Adam with five identical hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIME Magazine – U.S. Edition –  Vol. 142 No. 19|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105153733/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|archivedate=5 November 2017|date=8 November 1993|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Today The Sheep…|journal=Newsweek|date=9 March 1997|url=http://www.newsweek.com/today-sheep-170570|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of [[science fiction]] works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is [[Bokanovsky's Process]] which features in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous; "Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited"; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called "exogenesis", and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term "cloning" in 1963.&lt;ref name="stableford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples ("[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]", 1977) and then — in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' — shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire.&lt;ref name="muir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476604541|pages=258–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction films such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' have featured scenes of human [[foetus]]es being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mumford|first1=James|title=Ethics at the Beginning of Life: A Phenomenological Critique|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199673964|page=108|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCnmRCDGJ0cC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's ''Sleeper'', the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humber|first1=James M.|last2=Almeder|first2=Robert|title=Human Cloning|date=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781592592050|page=10|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vNGUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' story "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", a duplicate version of the [[Tenth Doctor]] spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.&lt;ref name="smithka"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Courtland|last2=Smithka|first2=Paula|title=Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside|date=2010|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812697254|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ShPnLHcKqUwC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=What's Continuity without Persistence?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her beloved 14-year old Coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017, [[Barbra Streisand]] announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now "waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha's] brown eyes and her seriousness." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/streisand-dog-clone-1.4555800?cmp=rss|title=Twice as nice: Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved dog and has 2 new pups|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.

===Cloning and identity===
Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically [[human cloning]], to raise the controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|volume=28|issue=2|pages=6–13|doi=10.2307/3527566|pmid=9589288|journal=The Hastings Center Report|url=http://kie.georgetown.edu/nrcbl/documents/hcr/v28/h28n2p06.pdf|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |title=Yvonne A. De La Cruz '&amp;#39;Science Fiction Storytelling and Identity: Seeing the Human Through Android Eyes'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Number]]'' is a 2002 play by [[English people|English]] [[playwright]] [[Caryl Churchill]] which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially [[nature and nurture]]. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. ''A Number'' was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[HBO Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = Uma Thurman, Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson star in two plays for BBC Two| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-06-19| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/stage.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a Japanese television series named "Bunshin" was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Bunshin |url =http://doramaworld.blogspot.com/2012/06/review-of-bunshin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 television series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/|title=Orphan Black (TV Series 2013– )|author=foreverbounds|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the book ''[[The Double (Saramago novel)|The Double]]'' by Nobel Prize winner [[José Saramago]] explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Banville |title='The Double': The Tears of a Clone|work=The New York Times |date=2004-10-10|accessdate=14 January 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/10BANV01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning as resurrection===
Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 [[Ira Levin]] novel ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and its [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978 film adaptation]], [[Josef Mengele]] uses cloning to create copies of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/|title=The Boys from Brazil (1978)|author=Christian Lee Pyle (CLPyle)|date=12 October 1978|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', which spawned a [[Jurassic Park|series of ''Jurassic Park'' feature films]], a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of [[dinosaur]]s by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from [[fossil]]s. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Daniel|title=Cloning|date=2002|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761328025|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TpBEOaHhb4oC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for warfare===
The use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In ''Doctor Who'', an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called [[Sontaran]]s was introduced in the 1973 serial "[[The Time Warrior]]". Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a "probic vent", a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Doctor Who FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Most Famous Time Lord in the Universe|date=2013|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480342958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QcEXAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT119&amp;pg=PT119|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), when the Doctor's DNA is used to create a female warrior called [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Jason|last2=Mustachio|first2=Camille D. G.|title=The Language of Doctor Who: From Shakespeare to Alien Tongues|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442234819|page=219|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ImuYAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), which depict a [[Space warfare in fiction|space war]] waged by a massive army of heavily armoured [[clone trooper]]s that leads to the foundation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Cloned soldiers are "manufactured" on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character [[Boba Fett]] originated as a clone of [[Jango Fett]], a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Paul F.|title=The Star Wars Heresies: Interpreting the Themes, Symbols and Philosophies of Episodes I, II and III|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786471812|pages=167–171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf4CAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=The Clones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)|author=compel_bast|date=15 August 2008|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for exploitation===
A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. The 2005 [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|2010 film adaption]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/|title=Never Let Me Go (2010)|author=espenshade55|date=11 February 2011|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are set in an [[alternate history]] in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/|title=The Island (2005)|date=22 July 2005|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/|title=Moon (2009)|author=larry-411|date=17 July 2009|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the futuristic novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' and subsequent [[Cloud Atlas (film)|film]], one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial "wombtank," destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands  created for manual and [[emotional labor]]; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html|title=Technology News – 2017 Innovations and Future Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clonycavan Man''' is the name given to a well-preserved [[Iron Age]] [[bog body]] found in Clonycavan, [[Ballivor]], [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in March 2003.

Only his head and [[torso]] are preserved. He was found in a modern [[peat]] harvesting machine, which was possibly responsible for the severing of his lower body.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4589638.stm|title=Iron Age 'bog bodies' unveiled|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 January 2006|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a squashed nose and crooked teeth. Pores are visible on the nose, and he had a thin beard.

Clonycavan Man has formed part of an exhibit in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] - and featured in the exhibition "Kingship and Sacrifice", 2006-2007.

It has been suggested that Clonycavan Man had once been a king and was ritually sacrificed.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Clonycavan reconstruction.jpg|thumb|150px|Facial reconstruction of the Clonycavan man, his hairstyle visible.]]

Clonycavan Man is believed to have been murdered, based on an examination of the evidence found on his body by the [[Garda Technical Bureau]] (Irish Police Forensic Division). His skull was split open by a sharp implement. There is a deep wound on the top of his head, and parts of his brain have been found in this wound. There is also a large laceration across the bridge of his nose leading under his right eye. This is believed to be the blow that killed him.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; Both injuries seem to have been caused by the same sharp implement, most likely an axe. His death is believed to be that of a ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] has placed his death to between 392 BCE and 201 BCE,&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0117_060117_bog_photo.html|title=Iron Age 'Bog Man' Used Imported Hair Gel|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=January 17, 2006|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Iron Age]] of [[western Europe]], making his remains around 2,300 years old.

Scientific study of his hair has shed light on Clonycavan Man's diet leading up to his death. His diet was rich in vegetables and proteins, which indicates that he may have been killed during the warmer summer months of the year.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kings&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ghosts-murdered-kings.html|title=Ghosts of Murdered Kings - Transcript|publisher=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clonycavan Man was also fairly young at the time of his death; he is believed to have been in his early twenties.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt; Such sacrifices were performed due to the possible belief that the current king of a certain region was responsible for poor harvests or other attributes, and a sacrifice such as this would please the goddess of fertility.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; A hill that was likely used for kingship ceremonies was near the bog where Clonycavan Man was found; it may have been where he was initiated as a king.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt;

== Hair ==
The most distinguishing feature of the man was his hairstyle, which was raised upon his head with the help of a "[[hair gel]]"&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; of plant oil and pine resin, imported from south-western [[France]] or Northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3304_bog.html|title=The Perfect Corpse" Transcript|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=February 7, 2006|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; Remnants of a hair tie was also found on the corpse.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; This may attest to trade between Ireland and southern Europe in the fourth and third centuries BCE, before Roman influence was brought to bear on the Celts of [[Iberia]]. This could also suggest that he was wealthy, as few others would have been able to buy imported cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/09/bog-bodies/bog-bodies-text|title=Tales From the Bog|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=September 2007|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hairstyle was possibly a way to make the man appear taller, as examination of his remains suggests that he was only five feet two inches tall (157.48 cm).&lt;ref name=kings/&gt;

{{Wikiversity|Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale}}

{{psychology sidebar}}

The '''Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale''', or C-SSRS, is a suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale created by researchers at Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh and New York University to evaluate suicide risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|url=http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors." Questions are phrased for use in an interview format, but the C-SSRS may be completed as a self-report measure if necessary. The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of an individual's intent to complete suicide.  An individual exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suicide Checklist Spots People at Highest Risk|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011-11-09/Suicide-checklist-spots-people-at-highest-risk/51135944/1|accessdate=9 November 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale: Initial Validity and Internal Consistency Findings From Three Multisite Studies With Adolescents and Adults|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=180115|accessdate=9 November 2011|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10111704|pmid=22193671|pmc=3893686|volume=168|author=Posner K, Brown GK, Stanley B, Brent DA, Yershova KV, Oquendo MA, Currier GW, Melvin GA, Greenhill L, Shen S, Mann JJ|pages=1266–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients are asked about "general non-specific thoughts of wanting to end one’s life/complete suicide" and if they have had "...thoughts of suicide and have thought of at least one method during the assessment period." They are asked if they have "active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself...[and] any intent to act on such thoughts." &lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu/scales_practice_cssrs.html|title=Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are asked how frequently they have these thoughts, how long the thoughts last and whether the thoughts can be controlled. They are asked about deterrent factors, and for the reasons for thinking of suicide. They are asked about "Actual Attempt[s]", which is a "potentially self-injurious act completed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. "If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt".They are also asked about Aborted Attempt[s], Interrupted Attempt[s] and Preparatory Behavior[s]."&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt;

The "Lifetime/Recent version allows practitioners to gather lifetime history of suicidality as well as any recent suicidal ideation and/or behavior."&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt; The "Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses suicidality since the patient’s last visit."&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt; The "Screener version of the C-SSRS is a truncated form of the Full Version" designed for "first responders, in ER settings and crisis call centers, for non-mental health users like teachers or clergy or in situations where frequent monitoring is required." &lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt; The "Risk Assessment Page provides a checklist for protective and risk factors for suicidality." &lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt;

The C-SSRS has been found to be [[reliability (research methods)|reliable]] and [[test validity|valid]] in the identification of suicide risk in several research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mundt|first1=JC|last2=Greist|first2=JH|last3=Gelenberg|first3=AJ|last4=Katzelnick|first4=DJ|last5=Jefferson|first5=JW|last6=Modell|first6=JG|title=Feasibility and validation of a computer-automated Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale using interactive voice response technology.|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|date=December 2010|volume=44|issue=16|pages=1224–8|pmid=20553851|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mundt|first1=JC|last2=Greist|first2=JH|last3=Jefferson|first3=JW|last4=Federico|first4=M|last5=Mann|first5=JJ|last6=Posner|first6=K|title=Prediction of suicidal behavior in clinical research by lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior ascertained by the electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=September 2013|volume=74|issue=9|pages=887–93|pmid=24107762|doi=10.4088/jcp.13m08398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=K|last2=Brown|first2=GK|last3=Stanley|first3=B|last4=Brent|first4=DA|last5=Yershova|first5=KV|last6=Oquendo|first6=MA|last7=Currier|first7=GW|last8=Melvin|first8=GA|last9=Greenhill|first9=L|last10=Shen|first10=S|last11=Mann|first11=JJ|title=The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale: initial validity and internal consistency findings from three multisite studies with adolescents and adults.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=December 2011|volume=168|issue=12|pages=1266–77|pmid=22193671|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10111704|pmc=3893686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and interpretation==
The Screener contains 6 "yes" or "no" questions in which respondents are asked to indicate whether they have experienced several thoughts or feelings relating to suicide over the past month and behaviors over their lifetime and past 3 months. Each question addresses a different component of the respondent's suicide ideation severity and behavior.
*Question 1: wish to be dead
*Question 2: non-specific suicidal thoughts
*Questions 3-5: more specific suicidal thoughts and intent to act
*Question 6: suicidal behavior over the respondent’s lifetime and past 3 months
*If the respondent answers "yes" to Question 2, he/she is instructed to answer Questions 3-5. If the respondent answers "no" to Question 2, he/she may skip to Question 6.

An answer of "yes" to any of the six questions may indicate a need for referral to a trained mental health professional and an answer of "yes" to questions 4, 5 or 6 indicate high-risk.

The yard, which extends west and north of the School Book Depository, includes the Interlocking Tower and a small office or shed.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;{{rp|23–25}}

;Contributing structures
*Reflecting pools and colonnades, Dealey Plaza along Houston St. — Two reflecting pools extend along Houston St. within the plaza with each extending from Main St. to the edges of the plaza. Both pools are rectangular on their ends near Main and oval-shaped at their ends along the edges. Curved concrete colonnades with pylons at the ends run along the west of each reflecting pool. Concrete planters holding oak trees are placed between the pools and the colonnades. East from the planter box on the north side of Main St. is a tall, graduated obelisk. Immediately west of the obelisk is a bronze bas relief marker mounted on red granite illustrating President Kennedy's visit to Dallas.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;{{rp|6,9}}

The Elm St. pergola, located adjacent to the Grassy Knoll, has a historical marker honoring [[John Neely Bryan]], Dallas' founder. The Commerce St. pergola has a marker describing the pioneer Cockrell family. Cedar fencing in the vicinity of both pergolas originally separated Dealey Plaza from surrounding properties, but these are best preserved at the Bryan pergola where the fencing was restored in 1988.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;{{rp|7,8}}
*Triple Underpass, west edge of Dealey Plaza at convergence of Elm, Main, and Commerce streets — This unpainted concrete railroad overpass was constructed by the [[Works Progress Administration]] along with the other original amenities of Dealey Plaza.

*Dealey Statue, 101 S. Houston St. — The Dealey Statue, featuring the likeness of the plaza's namesake [[George Bannerman Dealey|George Dealey]], is located on the south side of the Main St. entrance to the plaza along Houston St. The bronze statue replaced an obelisk in 1949 that was originally paired with the existing obelisk across Main St. to the north. The statue was sculpted in 1948 by [[Felix de Weldon]] and is mounted atop a tall red granite plinth. Behind the statue is a red granite slab with four bronze bas relief tablets consistent in appearance to the Kennedy marker behind the north obelisk. The tablets describe Dealey's professional and community accomplishments.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

==History==
[[File:Dealey Plaza (1969).jpg|thumb|left|Dealey Plaza in 1969. The [[Texas School Book Depository]] can be seen in the background.]]
Dealey Plaza was built on land donated by early Dallas philanthropist and businesswoman  [[Sarah Horton Cockrell]]. It was the location of the first home built in Dallas, which also became the first courthouse and post office, the first store, and the first fraternal lodge. It is sometimes called the "birthplace of Dallas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fetzer|first1=James H.|title=Murder in Dealey Plaza: What We Know that We Didn't Know Then about the Death of JFK|date=2013|publisher=Open Court|isbn=0812698657|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xGNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaza was completed in 1940 as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =12 WPA Projects that Still Exist | work =How Stuff Works | publisher =Publications International, Ltd. | url =http://people.howstuffworks.com/12-wpa-projects-that-still-exist.htm | accessdate =2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the west edge of downtown Dallas where three streets converge ([[Main Street, Dallas|Main Street]], Elm Street, and Commerce Street) to pass under a [[railroad]] bridge known locally as the "triple underpass."

The plaza is named for [[George Dealey|George Bannerman Dealey]] (1859&amp;ndash;1946), a civic leader and early publisher of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', who had campaigned for the area's revitalization. Monuments outlining the plaza honor previous prominent Dallas residents and predate [[President John F. Kennedy]]'s visit by many years. The monument honoring President Kennedy, in the form of a [[cenotaph]], is one block away.

==John F. Kennedy assassination==

{{Main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}
Dealey Plaza is bounded on the south, east, and north sides by 100+ foot (30+&amp;nbsp;m) tall buildings. One of those buildings is the former [[Texas School Book Depository]] building, from which, both the [[Warren Commission]] and the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] concluded, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] fired a [[Lee Oswald rifle|rifle]] that killed President Kennedy. There is also a grassy knoll on the northwest side of the plaza. At the plaza's west perimeter is a triple underpass beneath a railroad bridge, under which the motorcade raced after the shots were fired.
[[File:Dealeyplazaplaque.jpg|thumb|National Historic Landmark plaque at Dealey Plaza.]]

Today, the plaza is typically visited daily by tourists. [[The Sixth Floor Museum]] now occupies the top two floors of the seven-story former Book Depository. Since 1989, more than six million people have visited the museum.

The [[National Park Service]] designated Dealey Plaza a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 1993, roughly encompassing the area between Pacific Avenue, Market and Jackson Streets and the former railroad tracks. Therefore, nothing of significance has been torn down or rebuilt in the immediate area. (A small plaque commemorating the assassination is located in the plaza.)

Visitors to Dealey Plaza today will see street lights and street signs that were in use in 1963, though some have been moved to different locations and others removed entirely. Buildings immediately surrounding the plaza have not been changed since 1963, presenting a stark contrast to the ultra-modern Dallas skyline that rises behind it.

Over more than half-a-century, Elm Street has been resurfaced several times; street lane stripes have been relocated; sidewalk lamp posts have been moved and added; trees, bushes and hedges have grown; and some traffic sign locations have been changed, relocated or removed. In late 2003, the city of Dallas approved construction project plans to restore Dealey Plaza to its exact appearance on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dallasnews.com Dallas Morning News]'' — 27 January 2004.

Retrieved 25 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the restoration, which spent $700,000 for repair work and plumbing along Houston Streets, was completed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20130307-dallas-dealey-plaza-restoration-nears-completion.ece|title=Dallas’ Dealey Plaza restoration nears completion|author=|date=7 March 2013|website=dallasnews.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grassy knoll==
{{redirect|Grassy knoll||Grassy Knoll (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Grassy Knoll 2003.jpg|thumb|left|The Grassy Knoll and Bryan pergola on the north side of Elm Street]]
The '''grassy knoll''' is a small, sloping hill inside the plaza that became well known following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. The knoll was above Kennedy and to his right (west and north) during the assassination on November 22, 1963.

This north grassy knoll is adjacent by the former [[Texas School Book Depository]] building along the Elm Street abutment side street to the northeast, Elm Street, and a sidewalk to the south, a parking lot to the north and east and a railroad bridge atop the triple underpass convergence of Commerce, Main and Elm streets to the west.

[[File:JFK Wooden Fence.jpg|thumb|right|The wooden picket fence atop the grassy knoll, and the Triple Underpass with the highway sign, which at the time of the assassination read "Fort Worth Turnpike Keep Right", as similarly seen in the [[Zapruder film]]. The knoll is where many conspiracy theorists believe another gunman stood.]]
Located near the north grassy knoll on November 22, 1963, there were several witnesses, three large traffic signposts, four sidewalk lamp posts, the [[John Neely Bryan]] north [[pergola]] concrete structure including its two enclosed shelters, a tool shed, one 3.3 foot (1&amp;nbsp;m) high concrete wall connected to each of the pergola shelters; ten tall, wide, low-hanging live oak trees; a five-foot (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) tall, wooden, cornered, stockade fenceline measured at approximately 169 feet (53.6&amp;nbsp;m) long; six street curb sewer openings, their sewer manholes and their interconnecting large pipes; and several 2 to 6 foot (0.6&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1.8&amp;nbsp;m) tall bushes, trees and hedges.

The term "grassy knoll" were first used to describe this area by reporter [[Albert Merriman Smith]] of [[United Press International|UPI]], who was riding in the press "pool car" following the motorcade and had use of the car's radio-telephone. In his second dispatch from the car just 25 minutes after the shooting, he said, "Some of the Secret Service agents thought the gunfire was from an automatic weapon fired to the right rear of the president's car, probably from a grassy knoll to which police rushed." These words were then repeated on national television by [[CBS News]] anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in his second CBS bulletin on the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Pages documenting this are held by Gary Mack, Curator of [[The Sixth Floor Museum]] at Dealey Plaza. [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/gk_name.htm The Man Who Named the Grassy Knoll] at the museum's website, page found 2012-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the 104 Dealey Plaza earwitness reports published by the Commission and elsewhere, 56 recorded testimony that they remembered hearing at least one shot fired from either the Depository or near the Houston/Elm Street intersection. 35 witnesses recorded testimony of at least one shot fired from either the grassy knoll or the triple underpass. Eight stated that they heard shots being fired from elsewhere, and five testified that the shots were fired from two different directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/shots.htm Dealey Plaza Ear witnesses]. Two members of the Willis family who testified for the Commission reported in interviews with Nigel Turner for ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'' that their testimony included witness reports of shots fired from the grassy knoll, but that these reports were omitted from the Commission's publication. However, it did include their reports of shots from the Depository building. They also reported that the fatal shot came from behind them.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the persistent debate, answered and unanswered questions, and [[Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination]] as well as the possible related role of the grassy knoll, the term "grassy knoll" has come to also be a modern slang expression indicating suspicion, conspiracy, or a cover-up.

The term '''dubiofossil''' is a [[portmanteau word]] used in geology and paleontology for a problematic structure that looks like a fossil, but whose biologic origin is uncertain. (From Latin ''dubius'', + fossil). It has been mainly used for remains found in rocks dating from the early history of the Earth (Precambrian rocks), but is also applicable in other settings such as problematic microbe-like forms in meteorites.

Although ultimately such structures are either biogenic (i.e., [[fossil]]) or abiogenic (i.e., [[pseudofossil]]), the information available at the time of study is insufficient to make an unambiguous determination. They belong to the dubiofossil category temporarily, awaiting additional evidence that will allow them to be removed from this category and attributed to the fossils or the pseudofossils. For example, see [[ALH84001]].

Physical and chemical processes can produce structures that look indistinguishable from some that are formed by biologic activity, presenting a hurdle in their interpretation.

Living systems are capable of metabolism, reproduction, mutation, and propagation of the mutations. Lines of evidence for biogenicity, called [[biosignature]]s, come in various forms and appear at various scales, ranging from the atomic to the planetary dimension.

Molecule-building, cell division, colony formation, respiration, excretion, active motility are amongst the biologic processes that effect changes in the environment and can leave distinctive morphologic features or signature chemical by-products in the geologic record.

These attributes are susceptible to be modified or obliterated over geologic time, making it more difficult to recognize them in the rocks. The case for biogenicity is most robust when multiple lines of evidence converge.

''[[CBS Sports]]''. [[CBS]]. Retrieved January 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional boxer]]. He held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[light middleweight]] title from 2014 to 2018 (promoted to [[WBA (Super)|Super champion]] in 2016), and the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] light middleweight title from 2015 to 2018. As of April 2018, he is ranked as the world's third best active light middleweight by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine, [[BoxRec]], and [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]].

Lara is widely regarded as one of the most technically skilled fighters in boxing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles-frontpage/20195-the-underappreciated-boxing-brilliance-of-erislandy-lara|title=The Underappreciated Boxing Brilliance of Erislandy Lara|author=Kelsey McCarson|work=The Sweet Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captain of the Cuban national [[amateur boxing|amateur]] team, winning a gold medal in the [[welterweight]] division at the [[2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2005 World Championships]] as well as three consecutive Cuban national championships from 2005 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/fighters/lara-erislandy/ |title=Erislandy Lara |work=goldenboypromotions.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707095505/http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/fighters/lara-erislandy/ |archivedate=2015-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur career==
In 2003 and 2004, Lara lost four times against two-time world champion [[Lorenzo Aragon]].

In 2005 after Aragon stepped down, Lara bested his countryman [[Yudel Johnson|Yudel Jhonson Cedeno]] repeatedly and was sent to the world championships.  There he avenged an earlier loss to Russian [[Andrey Balanov]], beat American [[Boyd Melson]], upset top favorite and Olympic champion [[Bakhtiyar Artayev]] (31–22), and won Gold against [[Magomed Nurutdinov]] (BLR).

Lara has lost twice to another Kazakh, [[Bakhyt Sarsekbayev]]. In their only meeting, Lara beat American world champion [[Demetrius Andrade]] 9–4.

==Defection from Cuba==
Erislandy Lara was considered a favorite to win the gold medal at the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]]. However, in 2007, Lara and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]] defected from Cuba during the [[Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]. Some weeks later, he was caught by Brazilian authorities and returned to Cuba where he was banned from practicing boxing indefinitely.

In 2008, Lara attempted a second defection, this time on a speed boat to Mexico. Lara was successful and made his way to [[Hamburg, Germany]], where he joined former Olympic champions [[Odlanier Solis]], [[Yan Barthelemy]], and [[Yuriorkis Gamboa]] in the Arena Box-Promotion stable.

==Professional career==

===Early fights===
On January 1, 2009, Erislandy Lara made his ESPN debut and scored a first-round [[Knockout|TKO]] against Rodrigo Aguiar. Lara's following fight came on February 20, 2009, against Keith Gross. Lara dropped Gross with a left hand, but Gross beat the count on wobbly legs. Lara continued unleashing combinations to the head and body. A left uppercut finished the fight within round one. On May 2, 2009, on the Pacquiao vs. Hatton undercard, Lara faced Chris Gray. Lara won the fight via unanimous decision. On May 22, 2009, Lara faced aging Edwin Vazquez. Lara finished the fight with good combinations, prompting the referee to stop the fight in round four. On that same night, fellow Cuban boxer [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]] made his pro debut, which he also won via referee stoppage in the third round. After beating Edwin Vazquez, Lara went on to win nine straight fights punctuated by four consecutive first-round knockout victories.

=== Career from 2011–2012 ===

==== Lara vs. Molina, Williams ====
On March 25, 2011, at [[Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas|The Cosmopolitan]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Lara fought [[Carlos Molina (Mexican boxer)|Carlos Molina]] to a ten-round majority draw. Lara started by frequently targeting Molina's body with the left uppercut when Molina would attempt to close the distance. Early on Molina seemed to predict and nullify much of Lara's attempted one-two combinations. Although Lara had trouble connecting his signature straight left hand initially, he found the distance by the middle rounds, began to mix in short hooks to the head, and blocked most of Molina's constant body work. Molina, on the other hand, was rarely able to find Lara's head throughout the entire fight. Relying on looping punches, Molina stayed close and took advantage of the clinches to land to the body. Visibly fatigued, Molina developed a cut under his left eye near the beginning of the ninth round as Lara landed a hard, clean straight left hand and pushed the pace. Molina's higher output and pressure were favored by one judge while Lara's cleaner, sharper output and defense went largely unnoticed by ringside commentators. The final scorecards read: 95–95, 95–95, and 97–93 in favor of Molina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-carlos-molina-ends-majority-draw--37429 |title=Erislandy Lara, Carlos Molina Ends in a Majority Draw - Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/compubox-punch-stats-molina-edge-over-lara--37444|title=CompuBox Punch Stats: Molina Has The Edge Over Lara|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara fought former [[WBO]] welterweight champion [[Paul Williams (boxer)|Paul Williams]] on July 9, 2011, in [[Atlantic City]] where he lost a majority decision. Judges Don Givens (116–114) and Hilton Whitaker II (115–114) both favored Williams, while Al Bennett scored it even at 114–114.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=6571236 |title=Paul Williams looks to rebound from knockout in bout against Erislandy Lara - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most boxing analysts and fans believed that Lara clearly won the fight and had been unfairly judged. Lara was able to land hard, clean left hands throughout the fight while maintaining superb defense. Williams appeared hurt in the later rounds but did, however, keep up a high output of punches despite their relative ineffectiveness. [[CompuBox]] recorded Lara landing 49 percent of his power punches compared to 21 percent by Williams. Lara also landed seven more jabs and 17 more power punches than Williams, despite the near two-fold activity by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.boxingscene.com/forums/view.php?pg=williams-lara-compubox |title=Paul Williams vs. Erislandy Lara - CompuBox Stats |website=Boxingscene.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] suspended all three judges, and Lara received his first loss as a professional fighter in a highly controversial fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6767425/paul-williams-erislandy-lara-judges-suspended-new-jersey-state-athletic-control-board |title=Paul Williams-Erislandy Lara judges suspended by New Jersey State Athletic Control Board |website=Espn.go.com |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/boxing/an-incompetent-decision-hbo-announcers-enraged-by-refuse-to-accept-boxing-result/ |title=Williams-Lara Result Upsets HBO Broadcasters |publisher=SportsGrid |date=2011-07-10 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lara vs. Hearns, Martirosyan ====
On April 20, 2012, Lara made his comeback to the ring after nine months to fight [[Ronald Hearns]] for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] light middleweight semi-final eliminator spot at the [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] casino resort in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-ronald-hearns-battle-on-february-11th--47533|title=Erislandy Lara-Ronald Hearns To Battle on February 11th?|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-discusses-bout-with-ronald-hearns--47739|title=Erislandy Lara Discusses The Bout With Ronald Hearns|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight, which was scheduled to go ten rounds, simply lasted one minute and 34 seconds as Lara delivered an impressive TKO in the first round. Referee Keith Hughes decided to stop the fight after Lara had sent Hearns to the canvas once with a clean left hook that required count and immediately after delivered two fast combinations (one of which also required count) that seemed to be enough to overwhelm Hearns who seconds before the stop by the referee appeared to be defenseless upon Lara's final combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/laras-lightning-ko-steals-taylors-main-event-thunder--52017|title=Lara's Lightning KO Steals Taylor's Main Event Thunder|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2012, at the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Resort]] in Las Vegas, Lara faced [[Vanes Martirosyan]], who was undeafeted at the time and known for his amateur wins over [[Andre Berto]], [[Austin Trout]], and [[Timothy Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/vanes-signed-contract-three-weeks-ago-waits-on-lara--56241|title=Vanes Signed Contract Three Weeks Ago, Waits on Lara|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/schaefer-lara-signs-face-vanes-on-november-10th--56244|title=Schaefer: Lara Signs To Face Vanes on November 10th|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara connected on 42 percent of his power punches (40/95) while Martirosyan landed 16 percent of his (27/167) and only 6 jabs throughout the entire fight, according to CompuBox.

The referee ordered the judges to score the final 26 seconds of the bout, which resulted in a technical draw (87–84 in favor of Lara, 86–85 in favor of Martirosyan, and 86–86). Dave Moretti was responsible for the tied scorecard and judged the ninth round as 10–10, disagreeing with the other two judges who scored the final 26 seconds as 10–9 for Lara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/11/10/3629784/martirosyan-vs-lara-results-headbutt-draw-hbo-boxing |title=Martirosyan vs Lara results: Headbutt results in technical draw after nine rounds |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date= |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/ariza-puzzled-with-judge-who-scored-erislandy-lara--59227|title=Ariza Puzzled With Judge Who Scored For Erislandy Lara|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WBA light middleweight champion ===

==== Lara vs. Angulo, Trout ====
On June 8, 2013, at the [[Home Depot Center]] in [[Carson, California]], Lara received the first two knockdowns of his professional career en route to earning a TKO victory over Mexico's [[Alfredo Angulo]] along with the [[interim championship|interim]] [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] light middleweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/angulo-vs-lara-co-headline-maidana-lopez-card--63848|title=Angulo vs. Lara To Co-Headline Maidana-Lopez Card|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angulo's left hook was vicious as he rushed in, guarded and low. Lara, in return, was able to utilize zigzag formations and vary the speed of his movement to bait Angulo's aggression. However, Lara struggled with the aggression of Angulo at times and was put on the canvas in rounds 4 and 9 courtesy of Angulo’s vaunted left hook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96dGTSQREWc |title=Erislandy Lara vs Alfredo Angulo - Film Study |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-05-10 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara landed 56 percent of his power punches while Angulo landed 31 percent of his, according to CompuBox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compuboxonline.com/compubox-stats-lara-ko-10-angulo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309085501/http://compuboxonline.com/compubox-stats-lara-ko-10-angulo/ |archivedate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was stopped in round ten when Angulo refused to continue after a straight left hand by Lara caused swelling around his right eye. Angulo's injury was later revealed to be a broken orbital bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/6/9/4410702/angulo-vs-lara-results-erislandy-lara-gets-off-canvas-twice-stops|title=Angulo vs Lara results: Erislandy Lara gets off canvas twice, stops Angulo in 10th round|author=Scott Christ|work=Bad Left Hook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2013, Lara fought [[Austin Trout]] at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lara-vs-trout-regular-wba-title-stake--70830|title=Lara vs. Trout To Have "Regular" WBA Title at Stake|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the favorite to win, Trout had recently beaten [[Miguel Cotto]]. Lara, however, put on a dominant performance as he immediately nullified Trout’s offense using deft footwork and clean punching. In outclassing Trout, Lara scored a knockdown in round eleven via straight left hand. Trout was hurt for the remainder of the round as Lara pressed the action. Lara cruised to the unanimous decision (117–111, 117–111, and 118–109) and retained his interim WBA light middleweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/182397-erislandy-lara-drops-dominates-austin-trout-to-unanimous-decision|title=Erislandy Lara drops, dominates Austin Trout to unanimous decision|author=ringtv|date=8 December 2013|work=Ring TV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114127/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/182397-erislandy-lara-drops-dominates-austin-trout-to-unanimous-decision|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lara vs. Álvarez====
Lara fought [[Saúl Álvarez]] on July 12, 2014, at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight title was not on the line as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight, and both fighters weighed in at precisely 155 pounds. Álvarez rehydrated to 171 pounds while Lara came into the ring at 166 pounds. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, Álvarez came out on top with the two judges scoring 115–113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117–111 in favor of Álvarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2127892-canelo-affirms-superstar-status-with-split-decision-win-over-erislandy-lara |title=Canelo Affirms superstar status with split decision over Erislandy Lara - Bleacher Report |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=2014-07-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from Álvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. Álvarez managed to land 88 power punches (73 to the body) while Lara landed 53 power punches all to the head. Lara's clean punching along with his defense and movement were weighed against Álvarez's effective aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/347705-alvarez-beats-lara-but-the-debate-on-who-really-won-continues |title=Alvarez beats Lara but the debate on who ‘really’ won continues - Ring TV |website=Ringtv.craveonline.com |date=2014-07-13 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Álvarez was later able to hammer away to the body when he had Lara on the ropes but never adjusted to Lara's one-two combinations. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in this combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped in the middle rounds. Álvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqlazGcaP8U|title=Erislandy Lara vs Canelo - Lara Film Study|date=6 October 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the decision remains controversial, any talk of a rematch in the future was dismissed by [[Oscar De La Hoya]] who went on to say, "No one wants a rematch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/jul/13/oscar-de-la-hoya-wont-explore-canelo-alvarez-remat/ |title=Oscar De La Hoya Wont Explore Canelo Alvarez Rematch - Las Vegas Sun |publisher=lasvegassun.com |date=2014-07-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fight resulted in Lara's second professional loss.

====Lara vs. Smith====
On December 12, 2014, at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Lara showcased his ability to move in range to punch and then swiftly escape without taking damage against [[Ishe Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lara-smith-play-december-12-san-antonio--83644|title=Lara-Smith in Play For December 12 in San Antonio|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara consistently landed the straight left hand after “blinding” or “occupying” Smith’s guard with the lead hand. Lara would move in a forward direction towards Smith and escape in a linear direction, oftentimes sidestepping, while landing the one-two combination. This lateral movement was enhanced by Lara’s wide boxing stance, which also enhanced Lara’s punching power. Lara was frequently able to turn Smith into additional punches by stepping around Smith’s lead foot, thus enabling Lara to set traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7t8D2geXic|title=★ Erislandy Lara vs Ishe Smith - Film Study  ★|date=6 February 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara dominated the fight and successfully defended his WBA (Regular) light middleweight title by unanimous decision with the scorecards reading: 119–109, 119–109, and 117–111.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2298657-erislandy-lara-vs-ishe-smith-winner-scorecard-and-analysis|title=Erislandy Lara vs. Ishe Smith: Winner, Scorecard and Analysis|author=Joseph Zucker|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WBA and IBO light middleweight champion ===

==== Lara vs. Rodríguez, Zaveck ====
On June 12, 2015, Lara defended his WBA (Regular) light middleweight title and won the vacant [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] light middleweight title against [[Delvin Rodríguez]] at the [[UIC Pavilion]] in [[Chicago]]. In a technical exhibition, Lara's exquisite timing and fast hands allowed him to out land Rodríguez 233 to 63 in total punches and connect on 62 percent of his power punches. Lara was able to score a knockdown in round six via straight left hand. In a virtual shutout, Lara earned a unanimous decision with all three judges agreeing 120–107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/13069163/erislandy-lara-earns-unanimous-decision-win-delvin-rodriguez-keep-junior-middleweight-title|title=Erislandy Lara earns unanimous-decision win over Delvin Rodriguez to keep junior middleweight title|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2015, Lara defended his WBA and IBO light middleweight titles against [[Jan Zaveck]] in Hialeah, Florida. On a wetted canvas due to prior heavy rain, Lara began by walking down Zaveck who was relying on wide punches. Lara continued to stay in the pocket and countered Zaveck, halting his aggression. At the end of round two, Zaveck was hurt after Lara split his jab with a clean left hand. Lara landed a straight left hand at the start of round three followed by a series of combinations punctuating with an uppercut at which point Zaveck put his hand out, turned away, and refused to continue. Zaveck appeared to be in quite a lot of pain after the fight, which was stopped 41 seconds into round three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/14226952/erislandy-lara-beats-jan-zaveck-defend-wba-super-welterweight-title |title=Erislandy Lara beats Jan Zaveck to defend junior middleweight title |website=Espn.go.com |date=2015-11-26 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2015/11/25/9803052/pbc-on-espn-results-erislandy-lara-dominates-stops-jan-zaveck-in-3 |title=PBC on ESPN results: Erislandy Lara dominates, stops Jan Zaveck in 3 |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date= |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lara vs. Martirosyan II====
It was announced that Lara would be defending his titles in a rematch from 2012 with [[Vanes Martirosyan]], which ended in a draw. The fight was to take place as part of a triple header also including the Charlo twins and [[Austin Trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sho.com/sports/fights/961/lara-vs-martirosyan|title=LARA VS. MARTIROSYAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight took place on May 21, 2016 in Las Vegas. On fight night, Lara unofficially weighed 160.5 pounds while Martirosyan came in at 170 pounds. Martirosyan spent much of the fight attempting to impose his strength and body work on Lara. As a result, Martirosyan inadvertently landed multiple low blows until he was deducted a point in the eleventh round. The bout was also plagued by head clashes much like during their previous encounter. In the early rounds both men stayed in perfect range, each relying on their own reflexes and quick transitions from defense to offense. Lara found openings for his sharp punches. As the fight progressed, he was more mobile and dictated the pace, outmaneuvering Martirosyan while managing to land flashy 1-2-1 combinations. After seizing ring generalship, [[Paulie Malignaggi]] noted Lara's "fluid footwork" and a resemblance to [[Pernell Whitaker]] as he often ducked low and displayed tricky pivot moves to evade Martirosyan's punches by inches. Lara landed 63 jabs and 60% of his power punches to Martirosyan's 16 jabs and 23% power punch connect rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2016/5/22/11735124/lara-vs-martirosyan-ii-results-erislandy-lara-wins-decision-to-retain |title=Lara vs Martirosyan II results: Erislandy Lara wins decision to retain WBA title |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date=2016-05-22 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight averaged 491,000 viewers and peaked at 545,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2016/05/lara-martirosyan-averages-491k-viewers-showtime/|title=Lara-Martirosyan 2 averages 491K viewers on Showtime » Boxing News|date=2016-05-25|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lara vs. Foreman ====
Early reports on November 30, 2016, stated that there were talks of Lara to defend his WBA and IBO titles against former WBA light middleweight champion [[Yuri Foreman]] (34-2, 10 KOs). Lara's team was also in talks with [[Luis Collazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ringtv.com/475457-erislandy-lara-yuri-foreman-close-deal-jan-fight/|title=ERISLANDY LARA AND YURI FOREMAN CLOSE TO DEAL FOR JAN.

The fight was held at the Hialeah Park Racing and Casino in Miami, Florida, in front of a largely Cuban crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ringnews24.com/2016/12/14/erislandy-lara-defend-yuri-foreman/|title=Erislandy Lara to defend against Yuri Foreman|date=2016-12-14|website=Ring News 24|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreman was knocked down in round three. Upon closer inspection, the fall could easily have been ruled a slip. Lara won the fight after delivering a knockout in the fourth round via left uppercut. Although Foreman beat the count, he was on unsteady legs after multiple attempts to get back up. The referee promptly waved off the bout. In the post-fight interview, Lara expressed his desire to finally face off with unified middleweight titlist [[Gennady Golovkin]] and rematch [[lineal championship|lineal]] middleweight titlist [[Canelo Álvarez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringtv.com/480465-erislandy-lara-stops-yuri-foreman-four-rounds/|title=Erislandy Lara stops Yuri Foreman in four rounds - The Ring|date=2017-01-14|newspaper=The Ring|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/wba-champ-lara-targets-ggg-canelo-389711|title=WBA champ Lara targets GGG and Canelo • Boxing News|date=2017-01-14|newspaper=Boxing News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight averaged 547,000 viewers on Spike TV and peaked at 707,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-yuri-foreman-card-generates-547000-viewers--112835|title=Erislandy Lara-Yuri Foreman Card Generates 547,000 Viewers|last=|first=|date=January 20, 2017|website=Boxing Scene|publisher=|access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lara vs. Gausha ====
It was confirmed on August 24, 2017, by Ringtv that Lara would fight former Olympian [[Terrell Gausha]] (20-0, 9 KOs) as part of a super welterweight triple header on October 14, 2017, at the Barclays Center in New York City. Other fights on the card would include [[Jermell Charlo]]'s mandatory title defence against top prospect [[Erickson Lubin]] and [[Jarrett Hurd]] defending his IBF title against former champion [[Austin Trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/505587-jermell-charlo-erickson-lubin-lara-gausha-title-tilts-agreed/|title=Jermell Charlo-Erickson Lubin tops 154-pound title tripleheader on Oct. 14 - The Ring|date=2017-08-24|work=The Ring|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of 7,643, Lara knocked down Gausha en-route to a 12-round unanimous decision to retain his world titles. Lara used his accurate jab and left hand putting on a clinic winning with the scorecards 116-111 and 117-110 twice in his favour. Lara connected with a left hook followed by a left straight, which floored Gausha in the fourth round. Lara landed 121 of 528 punches (23%), while Gausha connected with 77 of 329 (23%), which appeared to do little damage. Lara praised his opponent in the post-fight interview, "We want to give a lot of credit to Gausha. He's an Olympian. I take the rhythm of the boxing match, and that's when I take over. He's fighting with the best in the division. He's not a stupid fighter, but he knew who he was facing today." Lara earned $700,000 for the fight and Gausha had a $250,000 purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-drops-decisions-terrell-gausha-results--121447|title=Erislandy Lara Drops, Decisions Terrell Gausha in a Snoozer - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/21027024/junior-middleweight-world-titleholder-erislandy-lara-defeats-terrell-gausha|title=Lara keeps belt in lackluster win over Gausha|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fight, which was the main event of a triple header, averaged 399,000 viewers and peaked at 476,000 viewers on Showtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/showtime-viewership-went-down-during-lara-gausha-main-event--121529|title=Showtime Viewership Went Down During Lara-Gausha Main Event - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lara vs. Hurd ====
[[Demetrius Andrade]] vacated his WBA 'Regular' title on October 22, 2017 after making his debut at middleweight. The WBA, in their efforts to reduce the amount of titles in each weight division, promoted Interim titleholder [[Brian Castaño]] (14-0, 10 KOs) to 'Regular' champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=21-40007487-4|title=WBA promote Castano to Regular champion|last=|first=|date=2017-10-30|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, the WBA ordered the fight between Lara and Castaño.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/10/29/16568872/wba-to-order-erislandy-lara-vs-brian-castano+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|title=WBA to order Erislandy Lara vs. Brian Castano|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2018 it was confirmed that a deal was being put in place for a unification fight between Lara and [[List of IBF world champions#Junior middleweight|IBF light middleweight]] champion [[Jarrett Hurd]] (21-0, 15 KO) for April 2018 with Showtime televising the bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/erislandy-lara-vs-jarrett-hurd-deal-getting-very-close-april--124106|title=Erislandy Lara vs. Jarrett Hurd Deal Getting Very Close For April|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, the fight was confirmed to take place on April 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2018/01/25/news/spectacular-showtime-pbc-unveil-sensational-six-months-featuring-many-world-title-fights|title=Spectacular! - Showtime / PBC unveil sensational six months featuring mass of world title fights|last=RINGSIDE|work=WBN - World Boxing News|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/broner-figueroa-stevenson-jack-lara-hurd-set-showtime--124600|title=Broner-Figueroa, Stevenson-Jack, Lara-Hurd Set For Showtime|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported Lara would receive a purse of $1 million and Hurd would receive a $500,000 purse. Lara weighed 153.5 pounds and Hurd came in slightly lighter at 153 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2018/04/purses-lara-1-million-hurd-500k/|title=Purses: Lara $1 million, Hurd $500K » Boxing News|date=2018-04-06|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurd won a 12 round split decision over Lara in what was a potential fight of a year candidate to become a unified light middleweight champion. With the fight in the balance, Hurd knocked Lara down with a short left hook in round 12 with a minute remaining. Lara was hurt from the knockdown, but was able to get up and still throw some nice shots. Hurd dominated the final round. Two judges scored the fight 114-113 for Hurd and the third judge had the same score for Lara, meaning the knockdown was the deciding factor in the fight. A lot of rounds where close with Lara using effective counter punching and combinations, whereas Hurd used his size to stalk Lara and land power shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/jarrett-hurd-vs-erislandy-lara-official-scorecards-photo--126988|title=Jarrett Hurd vs. Erislandy Lara - Official Scorecards - Photo|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara's right eye began to swell from round 7 and was eventually cut at the start of round 12. Lara started the fight the better boxer of the two, due to Hurd not putting as much pressure on Lara until the later rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/jarrett-hurd-drops-decisions-erislandy-lara-unify-results--126978|title=Jarrett Hurd Drops, Decisions Erislandy Lara To Unify Titles|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, Hurd became seventh unified world title holder in light middleweight history, joining Hall of Famers [[Terry Norris]], [[Félix Trinidad]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]] and [[Winky Wright]], as well as [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] and [[Canelo Álvarez]].

Despite the knockdown, Lara thought he had a good enough lead to win the fight. Had Lara not been knocked down, the fight would have finished a majority draw with both boxers keeping their respective belts. In regards to the decision, Lara said, "Besides the last round, I thought I was winning this fight easily. That's not to decide the fight. One punch in a fight doesn't determine the fight. One hundred percent I want the rematch. The problem was the cut on the eye. I couldn't see in the last round." After the fight, Hurd said, "It was a tough one, but I went out there and did exactly what I said I was going to do -- fight all 12 rounds and get the victory. I didn't feel like that [12th-round knockdown for the win]. I feel like I was in control the whole fight, applying the pressure." According to CompuBox statistics, Hurd landed 217 of 824 punches thrown (26%) and Lara landed 176 of his 572 thrown (31%). Hurd outlanded Lara 106-71 in the final four rounds, with 96 being power shots compared to Lara's 58 power punches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/23072088/jarrett-hurd-defeats-erislandy-lara-split-decision-junior-middleweight-unification-bout|title=Hurd's split decision win over Lara unifies titles|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/final-round-drama-lifts-jarrett-hurd-past-erislandy-lara-in-match-of-the-year-candidate/|title=Final-round drama lifts Jarrett Hurd past Erislandy Lara in match of the year candidate|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight, televised on Showtime, averaged 490,000 viewers and peaked at 521,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/hurd-lara-drew-higher-ratings-showtime-joshua-parker--127050|title=Hurd-Lara Drew Higher Ratings for Showtime Than Joshua-Parker|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the WBA ordered a direct rematch between Lara and Hurd, the latter rejected the idea stating he wanted to move on to bigger fights to become undisputed light middleweight champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/jarrett-hurd-vs-erislandy-lara-rematch-ordered--127540|title=Jarrett Hurd vs. Erislandy Lara Rematch Ordered|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later career ===
In October 2018, at the WBC annual convention in Kiev, it was announced that Jermell Charlo would be allowed to make another voluntary defence and Lara was ordered to fight [[Julian Williams (boxer)|Julian Williams]] (25-1-1, 15 KOs, 1 NC) in a final eliminator. At the time, Williams was already IBF's #1 ranked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lara-williams-eliminator-become-charlos-wbc-mandatory--132404|title=Lara-Williams Eliminator to Become Charlo's WBC Mandatory|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, according to [[Brian Castaño]]'s manager Sebastian Contursis, a deal was being worked out to have Castaño fight Lara. A date in January 2019 was being discussed. In order for Castaño to defend his WBA 'Regular' belt against Lara, the WBA granted him a special permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/brian-castano-vs-erislandy-lara-showdown-eyed-january--133271|title=Brian Castano vs. Erislandy Lara Showdown Eyed For January|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Not to be confused with [[Eutychius (disambiguation)|Eutychius]] or the early Christian theologian [[Eutyches]].''
__NOTOC__
'''Eutychus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|t|ᵻ|k|ə|s}} was a young man (or a youth) of [[Alexandria Troas|Troas]] tended to by [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]]. Eutychus fell asleep due to the long nature of the discourse Paul was giving and fell from a windowsill out of the three-story building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20:7-12&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 20:7-12 - King James Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul then embraced him, insisting that he was not dead, and they carried him back upstairs alive; those gathered then had a meal and a long talk which lasted until dawn. This is related in the [[New Testament]] book of the [[Acts 20|Acts of the Apostles]] 20:7-12.

Though some (e.g. [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], [[F. F. Bruce]]), do not believe that Eutychus died, Wayne Jackson observes the following facts: 1) the author [[St. Luke|Luke]], a physician (Col. 4:14), plainly states that Eutychus was "taken up dead" ({{lang-gr|ἤρθη νεκρός}}, ''erthe nekros''); 2) after Paul embraces Eutychus, he says, "Trouble not yourselves, for his life is in him" ({{lang-gr|ἡ γὰρ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστιν}}, ''he gar psuche autou en auto estin''), not "still in him" as the [[Weymouth New Testament|Weymouth translation]] erroneously interprets; 3) Eutychus was then "brought alive" by which the others were "not a little comforted," which words would make no sense if Eutychus had not died; and 4) Luke was fully capable of describing someone as only being "supposedly dead" ({{lang-gr|νομισαντες αυτον τεθναναι}}), as he did of Paul in {{bibleverse||Acts|14:19|NKJV}}, but he did not do so here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/808-the-case-of-eutychus|title=The Case of Eutychus|author=|date=|website=Christian Courier|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eutychus' complete recovery from a three-story fall, regardless of the initial result, and Paul's attendance at the scene of the accident, appears to be the impact of the narrative. 

The name ''Eutychus'' means "fortunate".

'''George Rodgers''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (January 1829 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1870) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Details==
Rodgers was about 29 years old, and a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Regiment]] (later The [[Highland Light Infantry]]), [[British Army]] during the [[Indian Mutiny]] when the following deed took place on 16 June 1858 at [[Marar]], [[Gwalior]] for which he was awarded the VC:
{{quote|For daring conduct at Marar, Gwalior, on the 16th of June, 1858, in attacking by himself a party of seven Rebels, one of whom he killed. This was remarked as a valuable service, the party of Rebels being well armed and strongly posted in the line of advance of a detachment of the 71st Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22324|page=4033|date=11 November 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rodgers returned to Glasgow and died in a domestic accident. He visited his sister in order to get an alcoholic drink but was refused and told to lie down in her flat. Some time later Rodgers got up and found a bottle of [[sulphuric acid]] and thinking it was alcohol, drank it, causing his death. He was buried in a common grave in Glasgow's [[Southern Necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/HeritageTrails/SouthernNecropolis/southernnecropolisheritagetrail25to28.htm Glasgow Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of The Royal Highland Fusiliers, [[Glasgow]], Scotland.

The '''Grouches''' are a race of creatures in ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

==Background==
Grouches are an eccentric race of pessimistic, argumentative, and unhygienic furry creatures who prefer to live wherever [[Waste|trash]] can be found: [[Waste container|trash cans]], city dumps, even the occasional landfill (although, some Grouches live in crummy houses, broken cars, and some live in "yucky beautiful houses"). Grouches are a distinct species from the Sesame Street Monsters (including the [[List_of_Muppets#Whatnots|Anything Monsters]]).

Being as grouchy and miserable as they possibly can be is any Grouch's main mission in life. They also feel that they have to make everyone else feel the same way. Even though that makes them happy, however, a Grouch will never admit to being happy no matter what the circumstances.

Grouches like anything dirty or dingy or dusty, anything ragged or rotten or rusty or trashy. They will only buy non-functioning or malfunctioning appliances, they normally keep elephants, worms, pigs, goats, and donkeys as pets, dine on appalling cuisine (ice cream sundaes with pickles and sardines are a popular Grouch dish, as are mashed bananas with beef gravy and ice cubes), sing out-of-tune, play radios at the highest volume, and bathe in mud as they all love not being clean, and they get their fur styled -- or rather, disarrayed -- at "ugly parlors" instead of beauty parlors. Grouches also like to use phrases such as "scram", "get lost", "go away", "beat it", and "buzz off." A Grouch will never miss an opportunity to make a snarky remark.

As seen in the 1985 film ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird|Follow That Bird]]'', a handful of human beings have embraced the Grouch way of life, proving themselves to be as hostile, surly, and filthy as any furry Grouch. Two such human Grouches were seen working at the Don't Drop Inn, a small [[googie]]-style Grouch [[diner]] with exaggerated [[greasy spoon]] service (inspired by [[Mel's Drive-In]]) whose patrons included both furry Grouches and disagreeable humans who might or might not themselves have been human Grouches. 

Even though [[Oscar the Grouch]] and his girlfriend [[Grundgetta]] are the most well-known Grouches, over the years a very large number of Grouches have been introduced.

Most of the Grouches live in Grouchland USA (inspired by [[Brooklyn]], New York) as seen in the film ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]''. Though the Grouches there had to put up with having their stuff taken by a man named Huxley, Oscar the Grouch later convinced the inhabitants that even though Grouches hate working together, they had to cooperate just this once in order to take a stand against Huxley.

'''Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] (4 April 1900&amp;nbsp;– 1 March 1942) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, including service in both world wars. At the helm of [[HMAS Stuart (D00)|HMAS ''Stuart'']] in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and [[flotilla]] commander. He then transferred to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] as captain of the light cruiser [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']], and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the [[Battle of Sunda Strait]] in early 1942.

Born in [[Benalla]], Victoria, Waller entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the [[Royal Navy]] in the closing stages of World War&amp;nbsp;I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to several British and Australian warships. He gained his first seagoing command in 1937, as captain of the destroyer [[HMS Brazen (H80)|HMS ''Brazen'']]. In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS ''Stuart'' and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]". In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].

Waller was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]], and twice [[mentioned in despatches]], for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS ''Perth'' in October 1941, taking part in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the [[Victoria Cross]] for his performance as ''Perth'''s captain. The submarine [[HMAS Waller (SSG 75)|HMAS ''Waller'']] is named in his honour.

==Early life and World War I==
Born on 4 April 1900 in [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Hector MacDonald Laws Waller was the son of William Frederick Waller, a grocer, and his wife Helen Waller (née Duncan).&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"&gt;{{cite web|author=Goldrick, J.

In February 1919, Waller was assigned to the light cruiser [[HMAS Melbourne (1912)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']], and two months later returned to Australia.&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt; He transferred to the light cruiser [[HMAS Sydney (1912)|HMAS ''Sydney]] as an acting [[sub-lieutenant]] in September; his rank was made substantive the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1919)| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1919.pdf|page=33|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1920)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1920.pdf|page=22|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1920 he was again posted aboard ''Melbourne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 January 1921)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-January-1921.pdf|page=30|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in March 1921, he underwent further training in Britain before returning to join the staff of the RANC. Waller married Nancy Bowes, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]'s daughter, on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1923 in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]]; the couple had two sons, Michael and John. In April 1924, he was posted to the light cruiser [[HMAS Adelaide (1918)|HMAS ''Adelaide'']]. Later that year, he began training as a signals officer in England; his classmates included [[Louis Mountbatten|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. Waller finished at the top of the advanced course and, in May 1926, took charge of the Signals and Wireless-Telegraphy School at [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|Flinders Naval Depot]] in [[Western Port|Westernport]], Victoria.&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2"/&gt; From 1928 to 1930, he served with the RN as a signals officer aboard the destroyer [[HMS Broke (1914)|HMS ''Broke'']].&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in March 1929.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2"/&gt;

By this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work. In July 1930, he was posted aboard the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s (RAN) flagship, the heavy cruiser [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']], as squadron signals officer.&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2"/&gt; He continued to perform this role upon transferring to ''Australia''{{'}}s sister ship, [[HMAS Canberra (D33)|HMAS ''Canberra'']], in May 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1931)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1931.pdf|page=35|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1932, he was assigned to the Navy Office in [[Melbourne]], returning to ''Canberra'' as squadron signals officer in August 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 April 1932)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-April-1932.pdf|page=14|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1933)| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1933.pdf|page=37|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[commander]] in June 1934 and the following month became executive officer of the RANC. Departing the college in July 1936, he returned to England and spent six months working in the British Naval Intelligence Division. A stint as executive officer of the repair ship HMS ''Resource'' followed.&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 4"&gt;Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937, Waller was given his first command at sea, the RN destroyer [[HMS Brazen (H80)|HMS ''Brazen'']].&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (January 1938)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-January-1938.pdf|page=52|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ship handling was criticised early on, but was soon reported by his superiors as having "improved greatly".&lt;ref name="Lewis 4"/&gt; Stationed in the Mediterranean, ''Brazen'' monitored progress of the [[Spanish Civil War]], a duty that included protecting [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|British merchant vessels]] and rescuing the crews of sinking ships.&lt;ref name="Dennis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens (2001), ''The Royal Australian Navy: A History'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1939, Waller had returned to Australia to become Director of Signals and Communications at the Navy Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (July 1939)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-July-1939.pdf|pages=7, 18, 45|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===HMAS ''Stuart'' in the Mediterranean===
[[File:HMAS Stuart (AWM P01593-002).jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|HMAS ''Stuart'', pictured in 1938, came under Waller's command when World War II began.|alt=Three-quarter front view of destroyer with twin funnels and two forward gun turrets, at sea]]

At the [[Military history of Australia in World War II|outbreak of World War II]], Waller was appointed captain of [[HMAS Stuart (D-00/100)|HMAS ''Stuart'']], taking charge of a group of four other obsolete ex-RN destroyers—[[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMA Ships ''Vampire'']], [[HMAS Vendetta (D69)|''Vendetta'']], [[HMAS Voyager (D31)|''Voyager'']], and [[HMAS Waterhen (D22)|''Waterhen'']]—that the Germans later nicknamed the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]".&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2004), ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were en route to [[Singapore]] for training when the British and Australian governments agreed that they should be assigned to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] as the 19th Destroyer Division, under Waller's control.&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII"&gt;Stevens (1996), ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at [[Malta]] in late December, Waller made a positive initial impression on senior RN commanders; this was soon borne out by his actions during the salvage of the ''Trocas'', a disabled tanker. In May 1940, he was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which included the vessels of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla" plus four modern British destroyers, and a month later was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]].&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII"/&gt;

Following Italy's entry into the war on 10&amp;nbsp;June 1940, Waller was involved in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21&amp;nbsp;June, ''Stuart'' shelled the Italian-held town of [[Bardia]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 9"&gt;Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]].&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt; Waller's ships carried out bombardments on [[Fort Capuzzo]] on 17&amp;nbsp;August and an Italian seaplane base in the [[Gulf of Bomba]] one week later.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141213095728/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070340--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 206–207].&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for "courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements"—in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields.&lt;ref name="Lewis 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34943|date=10 September 1940|page=5469|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he transferred to HMAS ''Vampire'' while ''Stuart'' went in for refit.&lt;ref name="Lewis 10"&gt;Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies began to [[Operation Compass|counterattack Italian forces]] in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]], gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. In his role as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller took charge of naval support for the [[Battle of Bardia|attack on Bardia]], which fell to the Allies on 5&amp;nbsp;January 1941.&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII 70-75"&gt;Stevens (1996), ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'', pp. 70–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill 292"&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141213110436/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070342--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', p. 292].&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he handed over command of the Inshore Squadron and transferred back aboard ''Stuart''.&lt;ref name="Gill 292"/&gt;

''Stuart'' and other ships of Waller's 10th Destroyer Flotilla supported the [[Battle of Tobruk (1941)|assaults on Tobruk]] in January 1941 and [[Benghazi#World War II|Benghazi]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2004), ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In March, ''Stuart'' escorted Allied troop transports to Greece as part of [[Operation Lustre]], narrowly avoiding falling victim to [[Axis powers|Axis]] dive-bomber attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141213102938/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070343--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 304–306].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] at the end of the month, Waller's ships were credited with sinking two Italian destroyers.&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII 70-75"/&gt; From May to July, the 10th Destroyer Flotilla made 139 ferry runs during the [[Siege of Tobruk]], carrying supplies to the town's garrison and evacuating the wounded.&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII 70-75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141213093731/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070346--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 390–395].&lt;/ref&gt; Waller was [[mentioned in despatches]] twice during 1941: in July for his army cooperation role with the Inshore Squadron off the Libyan coast, and in November for his service during the Greek campaign.&lt;ref name="Eldridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35231|date=25 July 1941|page=4370|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35342|date=7 November 1941|page=6495|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942, he was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO for "bravery and enterprise in the Battle of Cape Matapan".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35443|date=30 January 1942|page=553|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waller earned the personal admiration of Admiral Cunningham, who described him as "one of the finest types of Australian naval officers&amp;nbsp;... greatly loved and admired by everyone".&lt;ref&gt;Stevens (2001), ''The Royal Australian Navy: A History'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of a visit to [[Alexandria]] by Australian Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]]&lt;!--in February 1941--&gt;, Cunningham escorted him to ''Stuart'' and declared: "And now you are going to meet one of the greatest captains who ever sailed the seas—his name is Waller".&lt;ref name="RAN in WWII 70-75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sons of the Sea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navyhistory.org.au/sons-of-the-sea/|title= Sons of the Sea&amp;nbsp;– 1947 RAN College Entry|publisher= [[Naval Historical Society of Australia]]|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Ray Parkin, who began writing while a prisoner of war, "Andrew Cunningham and Hector Waller were cast in the same mould: men would follow them, suffer, and be glad about it.

Departing the Mediterranean, Waller returned to Australia in August 1941 for service in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141213093731/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070346--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', p. 391].&lt;/ref&gt; On 24&amp;nbsp;October, he took command of the light cruiser [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']], berthed in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perth'' had also lately returned from action in the Mediterranean, where she had participated in the Greek, [[Battle of Crete|Cretan]], and [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|Syrian campaign]]s, and been damaged on two occasions by German bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2004), ''No Pleasure Cruise'', pp. 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Waller was reportedly "tired" and "quite a sick man" at this time, but nonetheless prepared ''Perth'' for action quickly.&lt;ref name="ABC2011"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=1 August 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2011/s3282526.htm|title=A Measure of Courage|work=Australian Story|accessdate=12 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106130804/http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2011/s3282526.htm|archive-date=6 January 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942, the ship was assigned to [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDA) to help defend the [[Dutch East Indies]].

The ABDA Striking Force that ''Perth'' had joined was crushed by an overwhelming [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese force]] at the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] on 27&amp;nbsp;February. Low on ammunition, Waller made the decision to withdraw, accompanied by the cruiser [[USS Houston (CA-30)|USS ''Houston'']] under the command of Captain [[Albert H. Rooks]]. Waller's action contravened the orders of his Dutch superior, Admiral [[Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich|Conrad Helfrich]], to "continue action whatever the cost, and till the bitter end", but the Australian was convinced that further engagement would mean pointless sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131220064801/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070350--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 615–616].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following night, 28&amp;nbsp;February, ''Perth'' and ''Houston'' were attempting to break through the [[Sunda Strait]] to Australia when they encountered a Japanese invasion fleet escorted by four [[cruiser]]s and twelve [[destroyer]]s.&lt;ref name="Lewis 18"&gt;Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens (2001), ''The Royal Australian Navy: A History'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; As senior officer, Waller was in the lead with ''Perth'', and gave the order to fire upon making contact with the enemy ships just after 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131220064801/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070350--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 619–620].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of Sunda Strait|ensuing battle]], the Allied cruisers sank four Japanese transports and a minesweeper before they themselves were sunk, shortly after midnight on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1942.&lt;ref name="Stanley2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt; Having fought to the last of its ammunition, ''Perth'' was struck by two torpedoes, losing over 350 of its complement of 680 as it keeled over.&lt;ref name="Lewis 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/fiftyaustralians/48.asp|work= Fifty Australians|title=Fighting Hec Waller|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to witnesses, Waller was last seen standing on the bridge after he had given the order to abandon ship, "looking down at the silent turrets".&lt;ref name="Stanley2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131220064801/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070350--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 620–622].&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially listed as missing, presumed killed, and was survived by his wife and sons. Admiral Cunningham described Waller's loss as "a heavy deprivation for the young Navy of Australia", and Rear Admiral [[James Goldrick]] subsequently called him "the outstanding officer of his generation".&lt;ref name="Goldrick2002"/&gt;

'''Hernán Márquez Beltrán''' (born September 4, 1988), commonly known by his nickname "'''[[Mike Tyson|Tyson]]'''" '''Márquez''', is a Mexican [[professional boxer]]. He held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[flyweight]] title from 2011 to 2012, and has challenged once for the WBA [[interim championship|interim]] [[super flyweight]] title in 2010. Márquez is known for his trilogy of fights against [[Luis Concepción]], whom he defeated twice in 2011 and lost to in 2015.

==Professional career==
{{Update|section|date=April 2017}}
Nicknamed "[[Mike Tyson|Tyson]]" due to his aggressive style, Márquez is a hard-hitting southpaw.

Márquez began his professional career on October 21, 2005, with a unanimous decision win over Noe Acosta. On July 25, 2009, he also won the WBC USNBC title with a unanimous decision win against Juan Escuer. Márquez won his following two fights before losing to [[Richie Mepranum]] by a 10-round unanimous decision. In his next fight, he moved up to the super flyweight division in order to challenge [[Nonito Donaire]] for the interim WBA super flyweight title. He lost the bout by 8th round knock out.

=== WBA flyweight champion ===

After scoring two consecutive wins, he returned to the Flyweight division and faced WBA world champion [[Luis Concepción]].  Márquez defeated Concepción by 11th round technical knock out to claim the title and become world champion at the age of 22.  In an action filled bout, Márquez rose from a first round knock down to drop the champion later in that same round. He also knocked Concepción down in the third and tenth round before stopping him in the eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingscene.com/hernan-marquez-stops-luis-concepcion-fight-year--37724&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first defense, he defeated [[Edrin Dapudong]] by third-round knockout.

In his second WBA World Flyweight Title defense he fought Luis Concepcion for the second time in 2011. He stopped Concepcion in round 1 after scoring three knockdowns.

Márquez participated in an [[International Boxing Federation]] title eliminator on June 14, 2014, but was dominated and knocked out in eleven rounds by [[McJoe Arroyo]]. He was knocked down by the Puerto Rican boxer in the first, fourth, eighth and last rounds.

'''High throughput cell biology''' is the use of automation equipment with classical [[cell biology]] techniques to address biological questions that are  otherwise unattainable using conventional methods. It may incorporate techniques from [[optics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] or [[image analysis]] to permit rapid, highly parallel research into how cells function, interact with each other and how [[pathogen]]s exploit them in disease.

High-throughput biology serves as one facet of what has also been called "[[omics]] research" - the interface between large scale biology ([[genome]], [[proteome]], [[transcriptome]]), technology and researchers. High throughput cell biology has a definite focus on the cell, and methods accessing the cell such as imaging, gene expression [[microarrays]], or [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide screening]]. The basic idea is to take methods normally performed on their own and do a very large number of them without impacting their quality.

High throughput research can be defined as the automation of experiments such that large scale repetition becomes feasible. This is important because many of the questions faced by life science researchers now involve large numbers. For example, the Human Genome contains at least 21,000 genes,&lt;ref name="urlHow Many Genes Are There?"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/faq/genenumber.shtml | title = How Many Genes Are There? | date = 2008-09-19 | work = Human Genome Project Information | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which can potentially contribute to cell function, or disease. To be able to capture an idea of how these genes interact with one another, which genes are involved in and where they are, methods that encompass from the cell to the genome are of interest.

== Use of robotics ==
Classical [[High throughput screening]] robotics are now being tied closer to cell biology, principally using technologies such as [[High-content screening]]. High throughput cell biology dictates methods that can take routine cell biology from low scale research to the speed and scale necessary to investigate complex systems, achieve high sample size, or efficiently screen through a collection.

It has a greater emphasis on function rather than discovery, and will have its most significant impact in exploring biology as we progress toward models of the cell as a system rather than isolated pathways.

== Use of microscopy and cytometry ==

High-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital [[microscopy]] and flow [[cytometry]], in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data.
"High-content" or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated [[microscopes]], and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases.This means that a lot of HCS instruments are ([[fluorescence]]) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments.

== Development of technology ==

The technology can be defined as being at the same development point as the first automated [[DNA sequencer]]s in the early 1990s. Automated [[DNA sequencing]] was a [[disruptive technology]] when it became practical and -even if early devices had shortcomings- it enabled genome scale sequencing projects and created the field of bioinformatics. The impact of a similarly disruptive and powerful technology on molecular cell biology and translational research is hard to predict but what is clear is that it will cause a profound change in the way cell biologists research and medicines are discovered.

The '''Human Flame''' is a [[comic book]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He is mostly known as enemy of [[Martian Manhunter]]

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #274 (December 1959), and was created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa.

The character was not used again for 48 years, before reappearing to play an important role in ''[[Final Crisis]]''. The writer, [[Grant Morrison]], explained why he picked such an obscure character:

{{cquote|With The Human Flame, I wanted a Martian Manhunter villain, and I couldn't find a really good one. Then, looking through the old ''[[Showcase Presents]]'' books, I discovered this stupid guy called Mike, who declared himself to be The Human Flame. And he wore a homemade costume with six nipples that shot flames. So I just thought this is a great way to start this book because the idea is that Libra gives all the villains a very simple choice, he says, 'Follow me and I'll give you your heart's desire.' And that's it. And some of the villains naturally say, 'Prove it.' So the Human Flame is one of the first to fall in with Libra and he says, 'If you can get revenge on my old enemy, who has had me stuck in jail for the last five years, I'll follow you anywhere.' I needed a small-scale dumb guy, who could make very big waves and open the book with a shock moment and The Human Flame fit the bill.&lt;ref name=cbr&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16005 ALL STAR GRANT MORRISON I: Final Crisis], [[Comic Book Resources]], April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human Flame is the featured character in the six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'', written by [[Lilah Sturges]], with art by [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020910-Behind-Sturges2.html Behind the Page - Matthew Sturges, 2], [[Newsarama]], February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020911-Sattler-Aftermath.html Ian Sattler on the Final Crisis: Aftermath Titles], [[Newsarama]], February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020916-Sturges-Run.html The Most Powerful? Matt Sturges on The Human Flame and Run!], [[Newsarama]], February 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
'''Michael Miller''', the Human Flame, was a minor villain who, early in his career, was captured by the [[Martian Manhunter]] and incarcerated, He was the first actual supervillain the Manhunter faced.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Detective Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #274 (December 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; After this one off appearance, he was not seen in publication for nearly fifty years. In 2008's ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #21, he was seen robbing a bank, leading to a reluctant confrontation with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] and [[Hawkgirl]]. It was stated in this issue that in the context of the [[DC Universe]], eight years had passed since his arrest in ''Detective'' #274.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justice League|''Justice League of America'']] (vol. 2) #21 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Crisis===
{{main|Final Crisis}}
He enlisted with [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. As a reward for joining him, Libra promised him power and his heart's desire: "revenge against the Martian Manhunter."

Following the events of ''[[Salvation Run]],'' the Martian Manhunter was released from his imprisonment on Cygnus 4019 by Libra at the behest of the Human Flame. Preaching about granting the Society's wildest dreams, Libra stabs the Manhunter with his flaming staff while the Human Flame looks on, his wish having been the first granted by Libra. He films the murder to post on the internet later. While dying, Martian Manhunter telepathically attacked the super villains present with visions of their deaths by their arch-rivals with [[Vandal Savage]] imagining being killed by Manhunter himself. However, the Human Flame is ignored and cowers from the side.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #1 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Flame is given a new upgraded suit by Libra. The helmet Libra shoves onto Human Flame's head emits the [[Anti-Life Equation]] turning Human Flame into a mindless drone known as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]]. Libra even used the Human Flame amongst other Justifiers to persuade [[Lex Luthor]] to swear an allegiance to [[Darkseid]] or be turned into a Justifier.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #3 (September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Flame was among the Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control that were fighting the [[Female Furies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the limited series ''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'', it is revealed that the Human Flame had a wife and child, but was divorced. The Human Flame tries to hide while pursued by the Kyrgyzstani Mafia for stealing a cache of money, the villains that Libra enslaved during the Final Crisis, and the Justice League members [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #1 (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, his costume is badly damaged during a fight with the mob, and the Human Flame seeks out [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], hoping to purchase one of the latter's signature flamethrower guns. Heat Wave refuses, denouncing him as "pathetic", and gives him a harsh beating. Wounded and unable to afford health care, the Human Flame turns to [[General Immortus]] who turns him over to [[Professor Milo]]. Milo fixes his injuries, and adds cybernetic parts, adding strength and invulnerability, and implanted flamethrowers in his chest, mouth and arms. However, to ensure the Human Flame's loyalty, Immortus has his flamethrowers rigged to cause intense pain whenever he uses them, and orders him to kill Immortus' foe, N-Emy (whom General Immortus blamed for stealing something from him).&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #2 (June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Flame later attempts some freelance jobs, stealing from a bank with the help of [[Seductress (comics)|Seductress]] (one of the augmented henchmen and lover of Immortus himself) and swaying her to his side. However, he's quickly discovered and charged with treason by Milo and Immortus, who try to shut down his powers with a remote control. With Seductress rushing again to his aid, the Human Flame is able to escape destroying the remote but injuring himself in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #3 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Human Flame discovers that his new cyborg body has uncanny recuperative abilities that fix the broken jaw suffered during his escape. He fights his former allies successfully, killing them all until Immortus shuts down his powers with a secondary, wireless remote. The Human Flame then regains his powers by sheer will (even the augmented powers), badly burning Immortus. He then tortures Professor Milo to get further augmentations to put him on par with the Justice League and everyone else wanting vengeance against him. Milo sends him to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to get himself infused with atomic energy in a new experimental process. There, Human Flame and Seductress are attacked by a ''Hyper-Griffin'',&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #4 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; thus alerting S.T.A.R.'s security (actually one lone scientist) who agrees to give Human Flame the energy infusion to dispatch the Hyper-Griffin. However, the energy infusion is temporary unless Human Flame can reach a nearby nuclear power plant and bathe in its energies, even though he risks death and a deadly [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]. Despite the risks, he leaves Seductress behind and dupes John Stewart into dunking him in the main reactor. As a result, the nuclear plant is engulfed in a fiery explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #5 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the magnitude of the explosion, so powerful that the assembled heroes barely manage to contain it with their maximum efforts, Flame emerges as a fiery, radioactive being, in a molten approximation of a human body, able to increase his mass and density. Calling himself the ''Inhuman Flame'', he rampages through the city until he increases his mass to such a degree that he becomes basically immobile. Realizing that the Flame, in his quest for power, hadn't even taken into account the idea of becoming "smaller," Firestorm, Red Tornado, and John Stewart take him to outer space, tethered to heat-dispersing rod to sap his thermic-based powers. As a final revenge, and to add insult to injury, Stewart creates a cell-phone construct and takes a photo of the captive Human Flame, stressing the similarities to Martian Manhunter's fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #6 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
When he first appears, Human Flame has no powers, but wears a costume with twelve flame throwing nozzles on the chest.

As a part of the ''Run'' series, he is shown being turned into a [[cyborg]] with an enhanced physique, partial body armor and a series of flame-spewing nozzles implanted in his chest, belly, face, mouth and hands. He further enhances his body by an experimental radioactive infusion process: as a result he gains a [[metahuman]] body composed of molten material, able to increase his mass and density at will and radiate high temperature radiations. In this new form he's shown to be unable, whether due to a physical limitation or simply because he is incapable of thinking that way, to reduce his increased mass, becoming in a short while a behemoth so heavy and dense that he loses the ability to move.

Throughout his attempt to escape the heroes hunting him, he was represented as an incompetent crook who gets lucky because nobody expects anything of him, allowing him to evade capture as they cannot predict his methods, although his fixation on acquiring more power and anger at his own view of life's mistreatment of him eventually allow the heroes to catch up with him.

'''James Paul Moody''' (21 August 1887 – 15 April 1912) was the Sixth Officer of the {{RMS|Titanic}} and the only junior officer of the ship to die in the disaster.

Born in England, he received a prestigious education and served the [[White Star Line]] aboard the luxurious [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']].

When ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg, he was on watch on the bridge alongside First Officer [[William McMaster Murdoch]] when the ship hit an iceberg. He helped thereafter loading the lifeboats. Despite repeated invitations of his colleagues, he refused to board a boat and died in the sinking.

==Early life==
James Paul Moody was born in [[Scarborough, England]] on 21 August 1887, the youngest of four children born to solicitor John Henry Moody and his wife Evelyn Louis Lammin. Moody's grandfather and namesake, John James Paul Moody, had been a prominent local figure. Moody attended the Rosebery House School before joining [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']] as a cadet in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Paul Moody|url=http://www.scarboroughcivicsociety.org.uk/James-Paul-Moody.php|website=www.scarboroughcivicsociety.org.uk|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two years in the ship, 1902-1903, counted as one years' sea time towards his Board of Trade Second Mate's Certification.

== Career ==
In 1904 he joined the William Thomas Line's ''Boadicea'' as an apprentice, and endured an horrific, storm-troubled voyage to New York, in which one of his fellow apprentices was driven to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = All the Horrors Seem to Happen at Night|url = http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/all-the-horrors-seem-to-happen-at-night.html|website = Encyclopedia Titanica|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Inger|last = Sheil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attaining his Second Mate's Certification, Moody went into steam and sailed in cargo and early oil-tankers, eventually attaining his First Mate's Certificate. After very briefly attending the King Edward VII Nautical School in 1910, a nautical "cram" school preparing officers for their Board of Trade examinations, he successfully obtained his Ordinary Master's Certification, and in August 1911 joined the White Star Line's [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|''Oceanic'']] as her Sixth Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Paul Anthony|title=The British Isles a Trivia gazetteer|date=2012|publisher=Summersdale Publishers|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-85765-827-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1912 he received word that he was to be assigned to {{RMS|Titanic}} as her Sixth Officer. Moody was somewhat reluctant to accept the assignment as he had hoped to spend a summer on the Atlantic aboard the ''Oceanic'', after having endured a harsh winter, and was also hoping to take leave. His request for leave was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Titanic Valour: The Life of Fifth Officer Harold Lowe|last = Sheil|first = Inger|publisher = The History Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780752477701|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RMS ''Titanic''==
Along with the other junior officers, Moody received a message in March 1912 ordering him to report to White Star's [[Liverpool]] offices on 26 March. From there he travelled to board ''Titanic'' at the [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] yard in [[Belfast]]. ''Titanic'' then sailed for [[Southampton]] to take on passengers. Moody's service as Sixth Officer earned him about $37 a month, although he was allowed his own cabin as compensation for his small salary.

On ''Titanic''{{'}}s sailing day, 10 April, Moody assisted, among other things, in aiding Fifth Officer [[Harold Lowe]] in lowering two of the starboard lifeboats to satisfy the Board of Trade that ''Titanic'' met safety standards. He was also in charge of closing the last gangway, and most likely saved the lives of six crewmen who arrived too late to board by turning them away. Once the ship had put to sea, Moody stood the 4–5 &lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; watch and both 8–12 watches, which meant that he was on watch with [[Chief mate|First Officer]] [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] and Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall]] when the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg at 11:40 &lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; on 14 April. After spotting the iceberg, lookout [[Frederick Fleet]] rang the warning bell three times and phoned the bridge. It was Moody who answered the call, asking, "What do you see?" Fleet replied, "Iceberg, right ahead!".&lt;ref name=":SN:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Titanic owners wanted money to return body of Scarborough hero James Moody|url=https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/titanic-owners-wanted-money-to-return-body-of-scarborough-hero-james-moody-1-7226729|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=The Scarborough News|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing evacuation, Moody helped in the loading of Lifeboats No. 9, 12, 13, 14, and 16. While loading No. 14, Fifth Officer Lowe remarked that an officer should man the lifeboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Titanic letter praises heroic man|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4508741.stm|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=3 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the lower-ranked Moody would traditionally have been given this task, he deferred to Lowe. It was a decision that would seal his fate. Moody went to the starboard side and gave Murdoch a hand until the water had come on the deck. Moody was last seen by the ship's lamp trimmer, Samuel Hemming, on top of the officers' quarters trying to launch Collapsible A, an emergency lifeboat, just a few minutes before the final sinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq07Hemming01.php Testimony of Samuel Hemming] at Titanic inquiry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Lightoller also said; "Mr. Moody must have been standing quite close to me at the same time. He was on top of the quarters clearing away the collapsible boat on the starboard side, whilst Mr. Murdoch was working at the falls. If that is so, we were all practically in the water together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq12Lightoller09.php Testimony of Charles Herbert Lightoller]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moody was 24 at the time of his death. His body was never recovered. He was the only junior officer on the Titanic to die in the sinking.&lt;ref name=":SN:" /&gt;

A monument in Woodland Cemetery, Scarborough, commemorates Moody's sacrifice on the ''Titanic'' with the Biblical quote, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." (see {{bibleverse||John|15:13}})

He is also commemorated by a Blue Heritage Plaque at 17 Granville Road Scarborough, the house where he was born&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = James Paul Moody blue plaque in Scarborough|url = http://www.blueplaqueplaces.co.uk/james-paul-moody-blue-plaque-in-scarborough-10390|website = www.blueplaqueplaces.co.uk|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Good|last = Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a commemorative plaque in St Martin's Church in Scarborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penfold|first1=Phil|title=God's house of wonders on Scarborough's south Cliff|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/god-s-house-of-wonders-on-scarborough-s-south-cliff-1-8215085|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also commemorated by a brass altar set presented by his aunt, Hannah Mountain, to the church of [[St Augustine of Hippo Grimsby|St Augustine of Hippo]] in Grimsby.

'''John FitzAlan (D' Arundel), 1st Baron Arundel''' (c. 1348 &amp;ndash; 16 December 1379) was a [[Lord Marshal of England|Lord Marshal]] or [[Marshal of England]].

== Lineage ==

He was born in [[Etchingham]], [[Sussex]], [[England]] to [[Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel]] and his second wife [[Eleanor of Lancaster]] (Eleanor Plantagenet). His brother was [[Thomas Arundel]], Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was [[Joan Fitzalan]], Countess of Hereford.

== High office ==

[[File:betchworth.castle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Betchworth Castle]]

John was appointed [[Lord Marshal of England]] by [[Richard II of England]] in 1377, and summoned to the [[House of Lords]] on 4 August 1377, by writ directed ''Johanni de Arundell''. He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.

On 26 July 1379&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleuk.net/castle_lists_south/187/betchworth.html Betchworth Castle Betchworth Park Golf Course Brockham Leatherhead Mole Valley Surrey England English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/LOC/13790726.html Betchworth Castle Licence to Crenellate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he was given licence to [[crenellate]] (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as [[Betchworth Castle]].

== Naval victory ==

Being in command of a naval expedition in aid to the [[Duke of Brittany]], he defeated the French fleet off the coast of [[Cornwall]].

== Death at sea ==

Commanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the [[Duke of Brittany]], Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men "took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped"&lt;ref name="Walsingham"&gt;Thomas Walsingham, "Chronica Maiora"&lt;/ref&gt; those they found inside. Further to this Sir John "allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people".&lt;ref name="Walsingham" /&gt; When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. [[Thomas Walsingham]] reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.&lt;ref name="Walsingham" /&gt;

According to [[Thomas Walsingham]]'s story, FitzAlan's men profaned a convent at or near [[Southampton]], and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near [[Scariff]] according to some authorities, but at [[Cape Clear Island]] according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. [[Froissart]]'s account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham's, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.

== Burial ==

He was buried in [[Lewes]], Sussex.

He was also an ancestor of the poet, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].

== Marriage and children ==

On 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married [[Eleanor Maltravers, 2nd Baroness Maltravers|Eleanor Maltravers]] (Mautravers) (1345 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1404/1406), daughter of [[John Maltravers]] and Gwenthin. They had at least five children (some references list more):

'''Livia Medullina Camilla''' (fl. 1st century) was the second fiancee of the future Emperor [[Claudius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Date of the Inscription of Claudius on the Arch of Ticinum |first=Meriwether |last=Stuart |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=40 |issue=3 |date=July 1936 |pages=314-322 |publisher=[[Archaeological Institute of America]] |doi=10.2307/498692 |jstor=498692}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of [[M.

She was betrothed to Claudius sometime after his first engagement to his relative [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]] was broken by [[Augustus]] in 8 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levick |first=Barbara |author-link=Barbara Levick |title=Tiberius the Politician |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=47CCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=13 July 2003 |page=38 |isbn=9781134603794}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the disgrace of Aemilia's parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kershaw |first=Stephen P. |title=A Brief History of the Roman Empire |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ET2eBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85 |publisher=[[Hachette UK]] |date=20 June 2013 |page=85 |isbn=9781780330495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius probably pushed for the new betrothal in order to reward his friend with a connection to the imperial family. The betrothal of Medullina and Claudius is confirmed outside the written records by an extant inscription erected by Medullina's [[pedagogue]]. The dedication is to "Medullina Camilli f. Ti Claudi Neronis Germanici sponsa (Medullina, daughter of Camillus, betrothed of Ti. Claudius Nero Germanicus)."

[[Suetonius]] in ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' states that Medullina unexpectedly fell [[Illness|ill]] and died on the day of her wedding to Claudius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mudd |first=Mary |title=I, Livia: The Counterfeit Criminal. the Story of a Much Maligned Woman |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=seI0lCAa9w0C&amp;pg=PA338 |publisher=[[Trafford Publishing]] |year=2005 |page=338 |isbn=9781412046060}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in 9 or 10 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tiberius Claudius Drusus († AD 20), Son of Claudius and Urgulanilla |first=David L. |last=Vagi |journal=American Journal of Numismatics |volume=22 |year=2010 |pages=81-92 |publisher=[[American Numismatic Society]] |jstor=43580457 |url=http://numismatics.org/store/ajn22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medullina's brother Scribonianus was the instigator of the first major [[coup d'etat]] attempt of Claudius' reign, while governor of [[Dalmatia]] in 42 AD.

==In literature==

{{in popular culture|date=November 2018}}
*Livia Medullina is referred to in [[Robert Graves]]' novel [[I, Claudius]] as Medullina Camilla; she is depicted as an early love of Claudius who is able to look past his infirmities.  Against [[Livia Drusilla]]'s wishes Claudius is permitted to marry Camilla by [[Germanicus]] and [[Augustus]], but is robbed of happiness on the day of their engagement as she is assassinated for an unrelated vendetta against Camilla's uncle.

'''Louis Marie Jacques Amalric, comte de Narbonne-Lara''' (17, 23 or 24 August 1755 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1813) was a [[French people|French]] [[nobleman]], [[soldier]] and [[diplomat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=whBIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA27|year=1836|page=27|chapter=Narbonne-Lara|title=Dictionnaire historique|volume=15|author=Feller, François-Xavier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
He was born at [[Colorno]], in the [[Duchy of Parma]]. His mother was [[Françoise de Chalus]] ([[Baptism|bap.]] [[Château de Châlus-Chabrol]], [[Châlus]], [[Haute-Vienne]], 24 February 1734 - Paris, 7 July 1821, daughter of Gabriel de Châlus, seigneur de Sansac,&lt;ref&gt;Chateau of Sansac, in [[Beaulieu-sur-Sonnette]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Claire Gérault de Solages), one of the [[ladies-in-waiting]] of [[Louise Élisabeth of France|Elizabeth, Duchess of Parma]] and [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]-Major of [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France]].&lt;br&gt; 
Her husband was a nobleman of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Jean François, 1er duc de Narbonne-Lara [[Grandee#Spain|Grandee of Spain 1st Class]], [[Lieutenant General]] of the [[French Army|Army]], Commander in Name of the King of the [[Diocese]]s of [[Castres]], [[Albi]] and [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], 1st [[Gentleman]] of the House of H.R.H. the [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] ([[Aubiac, Lot-et-Garonne]], 27 December 1718 - 12 August 1806), son of François de Narbonne-Lara, seigneur d' Aubiac, and second wife Olympie Angélique de Goth. They married 10 July 1749, and had an older son Philippe, the 2e duc de Narbonne-Lara, without issue,.&lt;ref&gt;"the son of Very High and Very Powerful Lord, ''Monseigneur'' Jean François, comte de Narbonne-Lara, [[Grandee#Spain|Grandee of Spain 1st Class]], [[Lieutenant General]] of the [[French Army|Army]], Commander in Name of the King of the [[Diocese]]s of [[Castres]], [[Albi]] and [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], 1st [[Gentleman]] of the House of H.R.H. the [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]; and his wife the Very High and Very Powerful Lady ''Madame'' Françoise de Châlus", duchesse de Narbonne-Lara, [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]-Major of ''Madame'' [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Marie Adélaide of France]] (daughter of [[Louis XV]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
However, it is alleged that [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] himself was the real father. The coevals attribute the count's paternity to the King of France Louis XV for, according to documents of the Military Archive, the comte Jean François de Narbonne-Lara had been wounded 8 years earlier in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1747) becoming from that moment on unable of having any offspring.  The [[baptism]] of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara is another indication of that paternity.&lt;ref&gt;"On 25 of August of 1755, received the baptism at the Chapel of the King, from the Very High and Very Powerful Lord, ''Monseigneur'' [[Charles-Antoine de La Roche-Aymon]], [[Archbishop of Narbonne|Archbishop-Primate of Narbonne]], [[President]] of the [[French States-General|States-Generals]] of the [[Province]] of [[Languedoc]], [[Commander#Military and chivalric orders|Commander]] of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]]. The [[wikt:godfather|Godfather]] was the Most High and Most powerful [[Louis XVI of France|Prince Louis Auguste of France, Duke of Berry]], and the [[wikt:godmother|Godmother]] the Most High and Most Powerful Princess ''Madame'' [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Marie Adélaïde of France]]."&lt;/ref&gt; His wife became thus the King's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], and not only his name was also Louis but also his countemporaries always remarked about the similarities between Louis and the King.

He was brought up at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] with the Princesses of France. His education was princely, inclined mostly towards the [[Classical studies]] and a rigid military formation; he frequented the main [[Court (royal)|Courts]] of [[Europe]], where he was able to familiarize with the foreign languages ([[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]]), which also contributed to his diplomatic formation.

He was made [[Colonel]] of the [[French Army|Army]] at the age of twenty-five.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Marie Adélaïde (sometimes Adélaïde Marie) de Montholon ([[Mâcon]], 11 or 16 October 1767 - 1848), [[Lady]] of ''Madame'' [[Princess Victoire of France|Victoire of France]], daughter of Louis XV, on 16 April 1782 at Paris, France, with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p8717.htm thePeerage.com]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Nicolas de Montholon (son of Pierre de Montholon and Marguerite Baron, married on 11 June 1711) and Marguerite Fournier de la Chapelle (daughter of Charles Fournier de la Chapelle and Marie Louise Dureau). Their daughters were:
* Louise Amable Rion Françoise de Narbonne-Lara ([[Nice]], 25 May 1786 - [[Lisbon]], 28 March 1849), [[Dame (title)|Dame]] of Honour of Her Majesty Queen [[Mary II of Portugal|Mary II]] (with right to the Grandeess of Spain for being representative of her paternal uncle the 2e duc de Narbonne-Lara), who married at [[Agen]] on 17 February 1806 the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent [[Hermano José Braamcamp de Almeida Castelo-Branco, 1st Count of Sobral|Hermano José Braamcamp de Almeida Castelo-Branco, 5th Lord, 2nd Baron, 1st Viscount and 1st Count of Sobral]] (16 September 1775 - Lisbon, 2 February 1846), and had two daughters
* Marie Adélaïde Charlotte de Narbonne-Lara ([[Belleville (commune)|Belleville]], 11 May 1790 - [[Champgrenon]], 31 May 1856), who married at Agen on 7 March 1808 [[Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau]] (Mâcon, 9 November 1781 - [[Château de Rambuteau]], 11 April 1869), and had two daughters

Out of wedlock he had by Jeanne Pitrot-Verteil one son:
* Louis Jean Amalric de Narbonne-Lara, born in [[Paris]], unmarried and without issue

And by [[Louise Contat|Louise-Françoise Contat]] (16 June 1760 - 9 March 1813), [[actress]] with the [[Comédie-Française]], one daughter:
* Louise Amalrique Bathilde Isidore Contat de Narbonne-Lara ([[Saint Pierre de Chaillot]], Paris, 21 September 1788 - ?), who married in Paris on 2 December 1811 Dutch Jan Frederik Abbema, born in [[Amsterdam]] on 13 June 1773, and had one son:
** Émile, vicomte d' Abbéma, who had an only daughter by his wife Henriette Anne d' Astoin:
*** Louise Abbéma ([[Étampes]], 30 October 1853 - Paris, 4 August 1927), unmarried and without issue&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneall.net/F/per_page.php?id=15939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
He is found in 1785 as a Colonel of the Army and Honorary [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of Princess ''Madame'' Marie Adélaïde of France. In 1786 he was the [[Commander]] of an [[Infantry]] [[Regiment]], and remained in that post until the evenings of the [[French Revolution]].

==French Revolution==
His [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas soon made him be one of the first inscribed in the Club de Valois, where the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] presided. He was afterwards appointed Commander of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] in [[Franche-Comté]]. His friendship with [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] brought him an appointment to command a special guard, composed of the most disciplined soldiers of the National Guard of [[Paris]].

The comte de Narbonne-Lara always maintained his fidelity towards the King; a true idealist, he hoped for a [[Constitutional Monarchy]].

He became [[maréchal de camp]] in 1791, and, through the influence of [[Madame de Staël]], was appointed [[List of Defense Ministers of France|Minister of War]] of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. In this office he tried at all cost to impose his constitutional project, helped by the [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Bishop of Autun]], [[Baumetz]] and [[Isaac René Guy le Chapelier|Chapelier]]. But he showed incapacity in this post, and gave in his resignation. Despite his efforts, he did not carry his point, for in March 1792 the King, moved by intrigues and by the intransigence of those who surrounded him, thought right to dismiss him from that Ministry. His resignation was the result of his disagreements with the [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants]] on the question of foreign war. Narbonne-Lara and his friends hoped to bring on the war with Austria, by which they hoped to restore the prestige of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Modern History, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924070596832/cu31924070596832_djvu.txt Volume VIII: The French Revolution, Cambridge, 1904 (full text)]&lt;/ref&gt; Narbonne-Lara made an alliance with the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], but their schemes were defeated. After his resignation, he joined the Army of the North and, in May 1792, he was elevated to [[Lieutenant General]] of the Army. After less than six months from his dismissal, the French Monarchy was agonizing, the French Republic was proclaimed and the Royal Family was incarcerated. Later, Narbonne actually incurred suspicion as a Feuillant. The comte de Narbonne-Lara also had on him a prison warrant. Due to this, and also to questions about his policy at the war office, he managed to seek refuge at the [[Embassy]] of [[Sweden]], emigrated after [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], and later evaded to [[London]] and from there to Germany, having visited [[Kingdom of Great Britain|England]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]. During the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], his friends Talleyrand and [[Joseph Fouché|Fouché]] managed to remove his name from the list of the wanted, and returned to France in 1801, where he was retired with the patent of [[Divisional General]].

==In Napoleon's service==
In 1809 [[Napoleon]] remembered him and called him into his service. Brilliant, cultivated and perfectly aware of the uses of the Ancien Régime, ''persona grata'' with the main Courts of Europe, skilled diplomat and military, he was the ideal person to be at his side. As such, he was reintegrated and re-entered the [[French Army|Army]] with his former post of Lieutenant General and appointed [[Governor]] of [[Győr|Raab]], with the command of the whole part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] occupied by the [[Grande Armée|imperial troops]]. After signed the peace with Hungary, he was appointed [[Divisional General]] Commander of the 4th Military Division in [[Trieste]]. In that same year of 1809 he was sent to [[Vienna]] to arrange the marriage of the Emperor with [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise]]. In 1810 he was subsequently appointed [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] at [[Munich]], next to King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]], whom he knew very well before the Revolution, and in 1811 ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to Napoleon. He was created an Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] and [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of Saint Hubert (Bavarian)|Order of Saint Hubert]].

In 1812 he went on diplomatic mission to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]; this mission had the purpose of ascertaining King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] towards his attitude in case [[First French Empire|France]] went to war with [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. In returning to Paris, de Narbonne-Lara advised Napoleon not to invade Russia, but his advice was not followed; and so he reassumed his place in the Imperial Army on the Russian border. When he arrived there, he was sent by Napoleon to the city of [[Wilna]], where the [[Emperor of Russia|Tsar]] was; the comte de Narbonne-Lara was the bearer of an ultimatum, to which [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] categorically refused.

The tragic outcome of the [[French Invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]] did not minimize the action of the [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] of the Imperial Army. Among them, he was outstanding for his military uprightness and exemplary behaviour; in the whirl of the retreat, he appeared dauntless and serene, his presence imposed confidence and respect to the demoralized troops. Mounted on his horse beside the carriage of the defeated Napoleon, he was the personification of the dignity and honour of the ''Ancien Régime''.

In 1813 he was appointed and sent as French [[Ambassador]] at Vienna, where he was engaged in an unequal diplomatic duel with [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] during the fateful months that witnessed the defection of Austria from the cause of Napoleon to that of the Allies, to confirm the alliance between France and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], objective he was not able to fulfill; the Empire had its days cut short. In that same year he was appointed Governor of the stronghold of [[Torgau]] ([[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]), one of the main strategic points for the defense of the Empire. On 17 November 1813, after reviewing the troops on horse, he died of [[typhus]].&lt;ref&gt;This garrison suffered an outbreak of [[typhus]], and of the 26,000 men that constituted it, 17,000 died of the epidemic.&lt;/ref&gt; His aide-de-camp, [[Captain (land)|Captain]] comte de Rohan-Chabot, brought his heart back to France, and afterwards the name of the comte de Narbonne-Lara was inscribed on the east side of the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">The '''management by wandering around''' ('''MBWA'''), also '''management by walking around''',&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;
   "What is management by walking around (MBWA)",
   BusinessDictionary.com, 2010, webpage:   [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management-by-walking-around-MBWA.html BD-def-MBWA].
&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a style of business [[management]] which involves managers wandering around, in an unstructured manner, through the workplace(s), at random, to check with employees, equipment, or on the status of ongoing work.&lt;ref name=BD/&gt; The emphasis is on the word ''wandering'' as an unplanned movement within a workplace, rather than a plan where employees expect a visit from managers at more systematic, pre-approved or scheduled times. 

The expected benefit is that a manager, by [[random sampling]] of events or employee discussions, is more likely to facilitate improvements to the morale, sense of organizational purpose, productivity and [[total quality management]] of the organization, as compared to remaining in a specific office area and waiting for employees, or the delivery of status [[report]]s, to arrive there, as events warrant in the workplace.

==Similarities==

"Management by wandering around" very similar to the Japanese [[gemba|gemba walk]] method developed at [[Toyota]].

== History ==
The origin of the term has been traced to executives at the company [[Hewlett-Packard]] for management practices in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;  This was most particularly attributed to John Blocker, division manager at HP's New Jersey Division in Rockaway. Those of us working there though... really knew what he was doing... he was walking around the facility... BUMMING CIGARETTES.  Still... it was an excellent way to keep your finger on the pulse of the activity, morale, etc., in the division and the "style" spread throughout the company over time.
   ''Leadership Elements: A Guide to Building Trust'',
   Mike Mears, 2009, 364 pages, p.51, Google Books link:
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=zTDElD68jT0C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Management+By+Wandering+Around%22&amp;hl=en BooksG-TOC-51].
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general concept of managers making spontaneous visits to employees in the workplace has been a common practice in some other companies as well. Also, the management consultants [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman]] had used the term in their 1982 book ''[[In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
   ''In Search of Excellence'', [[Tom Peters]] and
   [[Robert H. Waterman]], 1982, 2004 (360 pages), p.289, web:
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=knzNIfmU2F0C&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=Management+By+Wandering+Around%22&amp;hl=en BooksG-FOC-289].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Historian [[Stephen B. Oates]] asserts&lt;ref&gt;
   With Malice Toward None: The Life of Abraham Lincoln'',
   Stephen B. Oates, 1977, 544 pages:
&lt;/ref&gt; that Abraham Lincoln invented the management style by informally inspecting the Union Army troops in the early part of the [[American Civil War]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4511">'''Paul Otieno Imbaya''' (1973 – 25 December 2007), better known for his stage name '''Mighty King Kong''', was a [[reggae]] musician from [[Kenya]]. He was born in Ugenya, [[Siaya District]].

As a young child he suffered a severe [[polio]] and was disabled from the waist down. He went to Ambira Primary School, but dropped out at Standard Six following the death of his father. He moved to [[Kisumu]] city where he became a [[Street children|street kid]] and [[beggar]].&lt;ref name="nationfm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaudio.com/96-4NATION/feature8.html |title=Rags to Records - The reggae musician who started off as a street beggar in Kisumu |last=Karuoya |first=Njoki |date=2000 |website=[[Nation FM]] |access-date=20 June 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510170051/http://www.nationaudio.com/96-4NATION/feature8.html |archive-date=10 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 he moved to [[Nairobi]]. With the assistance of DJ Stone, a local [[deejay]] whom he had met in Kisumu, he was able to perform at Nairobi clubs on weekly basis.&lt;ref name="nationfm"/&gt;

Few years later he moved to [[Mombasa]] and performed with bands like Them Mushrooms and Pressmen. Later on, he moved to [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]] to perform with the popular Simba Ngoma band. In Kampala he earned enough money to records his first album. He went back to Nairobi where his album, titled ''Ladies Choice'', was produced by Maurice Oyando of the Next Level studios.&lt;ref name="nationfm"/&gt; It was released in June 1999. His second album, ''Cinderella'' was released in 2001, again by Next Level studios.

His third album, ''Return of the King'', was released in 2004. However, Mighty King Kong publicly blamed its contract of being exploitative.&lt;ref name="bounce"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=60&amp;newsid=100876 |title=Mighty King Kong now poised to bounce back |last=Orido |first=Fred |date=23 June 2007 |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/mags/pulse/articles.php?articleid=1143965210&amp;date=23/2/2007 |title=Gone with the lyrics |last=Nyanga |first=Caroline |date=22 February 2007 |newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]] |access-date=20 June 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229205412/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/mags/pulse/articles.php?articleid=1143965210&amp;date=23%2F2%2F2007 |archive-date=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he released a compilation album "The Best of King Kong".&lt;ref name=bounce/&gt;

Outside Kenya, he performed in [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/19mar06/magazine/magazine6.html |title=From grass to grace |date=19 March 2006 |newspaper=[[Kenya Times]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, he was a die-hard supporter of Raila Odinga's ODM political movement which had promised to nominate him to the next parliament to represent the disabled persons of Kenya. He was seen dressed in orange colours as a sign of firm commitment to the party in his last days.

==Death==
He died on Christmas Day, 2007 at the age of 34, after being poisoned (as attributed in the local newspapers). He was transported to Kenyatta National Hospital in [[Nairobi]], where he died as he was being treated. He was survived by his widow, Jackline Ouma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=113372 |title=Curtain falls on singer Mighty King Kong |last=Orido |first=Fred |date=26 December 2007 |newspaper=Daily Nation}} {{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eastandard.net/news/?id=1143979516&amp;cid=159 |title='Mighty' King Kong passes on |last=Adero |first=Brian |date=26 December 2007 |newspaper=The Standard |access-date=20 June 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229205422/http://eastandard.net/news/?id=1143979516&amp;cid=159 |archive-date=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual for making necropants is described as follows:&lt;ref name="stave"/&gt;
{{quote|If you want to make your own necropants (literally; ''nábrók''), you have to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death.

After he has been buried, you must dig up his body and flay the skin of the corpse in one piece from the waist down. As soon as you step into the pants, they will stick to your own skin. A coin must be stolen from a poor widow and placed in the scrotum along with the [[Icelandic magical staves|magical sign]], ''nábrókarstafur'', written on a piece of paper. Consequently, the coin will draw money into the scrotum so that it will never be empty, as long as the original coin is not removed. To ensure salvation, the owner has to convince someone else to take ownership of the pants and step into each leg as soon as he gets out of it. The necropants will thus keep the money-gathering nature for generations.

'''Peter''', also '''Peter II of Courtenay''' ({{lang-fr|Pierre de Courtenay}}; died 1219), was emperor of the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] from 1216 to 1217.

==Biography==
Peter II was a son of [[Peter I of Courtenay]] (died 1183), the youngest son of [[Louis VI of France]] and his second wife, [[Adélaide de Maurienne]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=293–294}} His mother was Elisabeth de Courtenay, daughter of [[Renaud de Courtenay]] (died 1194) and Hawise du Donjon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Commire, Anne|encyclopedia=Women in World History: A biographical encyclopedia |chapter= Elizabeth of Courtenay (d. 1205)|year=1999|publisher=Yorkin Publications, Gale Group|location=Waterford, CT |ISBN=0787640808 |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591302742.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter first married [[Agnes I, Countess of Nevers|Agnes I]], via whom he obtained the three counties of [[Count of Nevers|Nevers]], [[County of Auxerre|Auxerre]], and [[Tonnerre, Yonne|Tonnerre]].{{sfn|Bouchard|1987|p=349}} He took for his second wife [[Yolanda of Flanders]] (died 1219),{{sfn|Bouchard|1987|p=349}} a sister of [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin]] and [[Henry of Flanders]], who were afterwards the first and second emperors of the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Peter accompanied his cousin, King [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]], on the [[third Crusade|crusade of 1190]] and fought (alongside his brother Robert) in the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in 1209 and 1211, when he took part in the siege of [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]]. He was present at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=294}}

When his brother-in-law, the emperor [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], died without sons in 1216, Peter was chosen as his successor, and with a small army he left his residence of [[château de Druyes]] in [[France]] to take possession of his throne. He was consecrated emperor at the [[Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls]] in [[Rome]] by [[Pope Honorius III]] on 9 April, 1217. He then borrowed some ships from the Venetians, promising in return to conquer [[Durrës|Durazzo]] for them, but he failed in this enterprise, and sought to make his way to Constantinople by land. On the journey he was seized by the [[Despotate of Epirus|despot of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], and, after an imprisonment of two years, died, probably by foul means. Peter thus never governed his empire, which, however, was ruled for a time by his wife, Yolanda, who had succeeded in reaching Constantinople. Two of his sons, [[Robert of Courtenay|Robert]] and [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin]], reigned in turn as emperors of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=294}}

==Family==
By his first wife [[Agnes I, Countess of Nevers]] he had one child, [[Matilda I, Countess of Nevers]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

By his second wife [[Yolanda of Flanders]],{{sfn|Bouchard|1987|p=342}} he had 10 children:
* [[Philip II, Marquis of Namur|Philip]] (died 1226), Marquis of Namur, who declined the offer of the crown of the Latin Empire
* [[Robert of Courtenay]] (died 1228), emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople 
* [[Henry II, Marquis of Namur|Henry]] (died 1229), Marquis of Namur
* [[Baldwin II of Constantinople]] (died 1273), emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople 
* [[Margaret, Marchioness of Namur|Margaret]], Marchioness of Namur, who married first [[Raoul I of Lusignan|Raoul d'Issoudun]] and then Henry count of Vianden
* [[Elizabeth of Courtenay]] who married Walter count of Bar and then Eudes sire of Montagu
* [[Yolanda de Courtenay]], who married [[Andrew II of Hungary]]
* Eleanor, who married [[Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre]]
* [[Marie de Courtenay]], who married [[Theodore I Lascaris]] of the [[Empire of Nicaea]]
* Agnes, who married [[Geoffrey II Villehardouin]], [[Principality of Achaea|Prince of Achaea]]

He had an illegitimate son:
* Geoffrey, marquis of Lavaur (died 1229).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Pieter Hintjens''' (3 December 1962&amp;nbsp;– 4 October 2016) was a Belgian [[software developer]], author, and past president of the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] (FFII), an association that fights against [[software patent]]s. In 2007, he was nominated one of the "50 most influential people in [[Intellectual property|IP]]" by Managing Intellectual Property magazine.

==Biography==
Hintjens was born in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1962 and grew up in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Hintjens' Wiki |url=http://hintjens.com/pieter-hintjens:cv:personal-details |title=Pieter Hintjens |accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.digistan.org/member:pieter-hintjens|title=Pieter Hintjens - members.digistan.org|website=members.digistan.org|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintjens served as CEO and chief software designer for iMatix, a firm that produced [[free software]] applications, such as the [[ZeroMQ]] high performance message [[Library (computing)|library]], the [[OpenAMQ]] AMQP [[messaging]] service, Libero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imatix-legacy.github.io/libero/lrintr.htm|title=Introduction to Libero|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GSL code generator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/imatix/gsl|title=GSL/4.1 - a Universal Code Generator|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Xitami]] web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imatix-legacy.github.io/|title=Welcome to iMatix|website=imatix-legacy.github.io|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in [[open standard]]s development, being the author of the original [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP), a founder of the [[Digital Standards Organization]], and the editor of the [[RestMS]] web messaging protocol.&lt;ref name="restms"&gt;RestMS.org, [http://www.restms.org/spec:2 RestMS - a RESTful Messaging Service]&lt;/ref&gt; RestMS is developed using a ''peer-to-peer, share-alike, branch and merge'' model (COSS) developed by Hintjens and others for the Digital Standards Organization in 2008.&lt;ref name="coss"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Digistan |url=http://www.digistan.org/spec:1 |title=Consensus-Oriented Specification System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was CEO of [[Wikidot]] Inc., one of the fastest growing [[wikifarm]]s, until February 2010.

In 2010 Hintjens was diagnosed with [[Cholangiocarcinoma|bile duct cancer]], which was successfully surgically removed.&lt;ref name="Five Years, Five Wishes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hintjens.com/blog:109 | title=Five Years, Five Wishes | date=2015-12-10 | accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2016, it returned and he was diagnosed with terminal [[cholangiocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name="A Protocol For Dying"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hintjens.com/blog:115 | title=A Protocol For Dying | date=2016-04-21 | accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hintjens underwent [[voluntary euthanasia]] on 4 October 2016.&lt;ref name="The last tweet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/hintjens/status/783254242052206592 | title=I'm choosing euthanasia etd 1pm. I have no last words. | date=2016-10-04 | accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ZeroMQ ==
While in his position as iMatix CEO, Hintjens founded the [[ZeroMQ]] software project together with Martin Sustrik. ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications.

In November 2013, Hintjens announced [[EdgeNet]], a project building upon ZeroMQ for mesh networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/edgenet/x/5209896|title=edgenet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EdgeNet aims to build a secure, [[Anonymity on the Internet|anonymous]] [[peer-to-peer]] alternative to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultureandempire.com/edgenet.html|title=Culture &amp; Empire · GitBook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hintjens also authored several ZeroMQ projects, such as CZMQ, zproto, and Malamute.

==Views==
In October 2007, Hintjens warned that after [[mortgage]]s and [[consumer debt]], [[patent]]s were a third [[economic bubble]] waiting to damage the global economy, writing: "House prices fall and bad debt shakes the financial markets across the US and Europe. Bankers look nervously at their portfolios of consumer debt and mortgages. But some analysts say that it's patents, not houses or loans, that will tip the global financial market into crisis".&lt;ref name="crisis"&gt;Digital Majority, [http://www.digitalmajority.org/forum/t-21772/will-the-patent-system-trigger-financial-collapse-in-2008 "Will the patent system trigger financial collapse in 2008?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintjens was also owner and principal author of ''The Devil's [[Wiki]]'', which defines a ''patent'' as "A medieval economic tool by which politicians attempt to stimulate trade and wealth by banning innovation and competition in crucial areas of technology".&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Devil's Wiki |url=http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:patent |title=Patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pinch-induced behavioral inhibition''' ('''PIBI'''), also called '''dorsal immobility''', '''transport immobility''' or '''clipnosis''', is a partially inert state which results from a gentle squeeze of the skin behind the [[neck]].  It is mostly observed among [[Felidae]] and allows a female cat to easily carry her kitten with her jaws. It can be used to effectively restrain most cats in a domestic or veterinary context. The phenomenon also occurs in other animals, such as [[squirrel]]s and [[mice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-one-myth-about-cats-thats-actually-true-1469745000 ''The one myth about cats that's actually true''] by Robbie Gonzalez.

'''''Rockin' on Heaven's Door''''' ({{ko-hhrm|뜨거운 안녕||Ddeugeoun Annyeong}}; lit. "Passionate Goodbye") is a 2013 [[South Korea]]n film directed by Nam Taek-soo, starring [[F.T. Island]] lead vocalist [[Lee Hong-ki]] as an [[Korean pop idol|idol star]] who learns to cope with his past and rediscovers music during community work at a hospice for terminally ill patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=FTIsland Lee Hong-ki to make big screen debut|url=http://www.tenasia.com/ftisland-lee-hong-ki-to-make-big-screen-debut/|work=TenAsia|accessdate=2014-04-06|date=30 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084611/http://www.tenasia.com/ftisland-lee-hong-ki-to-make-big-screen-debut/|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=Not all is grim when the reaper pays a visit|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2972026|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2014-04-04|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Chung-ui is a famous [[K-pop|Korean pop]] star with a temper. After he beats up a man at a night club, he is sentenced to do [[community service]] at a [[hospice]] for [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] patients. The reluctant young man first hates his chores and dislikes the people around him, but as he gets to know their stories, he becomes attached to them. The hospice struggles with funding, leading to a possible close-down, so the hospice in-house band, The Phoenix Band decides to apply to a talent show on television. For this, they need an original song, so they ask Chung-ui to help them. The singer refuses at first, then tries to use the opportunity to reduce his sentence days. He ends up seriously changing his mind about music, his behavior and grows to accept his mother's death, while helping the patients achieve their dreams. Even after the death of the band members, he continues to revive The Phoenix Band each time, assisting new patients.

[[File:Plateau van zeevruchten.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Seafood includes any form of food taken from the sea.]]
'''Seafood''' is any form of [[Marine life|sea life]] regarded as [[food]] by humans. Seafood prominently includes [[Fish as food|fish]] and [[shellfish]].
Shellfish include various species of [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. Historically, [[sea mammal]]s such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some [[Edible seaweed|seaweeds]] and [[microalgae]], are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the [[:Category:Sea vegetables|category of sea vegetables]]). In [[North America]], although not generally in the [[United Kingdom]], the term "seafood" is extended to [[fresh water]] organisms eaten by humans, so all edible [[aquatic life]] may be referred to as seafood. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.

The harvesting of [[Wild fisheries|wild seafood]] is usually known as [[fishing]] or [[hunting]], and the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as [[aquaculture]], or [[fish farming]] in the case of fish. Seafood is often distinguished from [[meat]], although it is still animal and is excluded in a strict vegetarian diet. Seafood is an important source of [[protein]] in many [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] around the world, especially in coastal areas.

Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as [[fish food]] to farm other fish or rear farm animals. Some seafoods ([[kelp]]) are used as food for other plants ([[fertilizer]]). In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption. Products, such as [[oil]] and [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina tablets]] are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is fed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).

During this period, most people lived a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at [[Lepenski Vir]], they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.

The ancient [[river]] [[Nile]] was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icsf.net/jsp/publication/samudra/pdf/english/issue_28/art01.pdf |title= Fisheries history: Gift of the Nile |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110185510/http://www.icsf.net/jsp/publication/samudra/pdf/english/issue_28/art01.pdf |archivedate= 10 November 2006 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egyptians]] had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in [[tomb]] scenes, drawings, and [[papyrus]] documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.

Fishing scenes are rarely represented in [[ancient Greek]] culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However, [[Oppian|Oppian of Corycus]], a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the ''Halieulica'' or ''Halieutika'', composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood ([[squid]], [[octopus]], and [[shellfish]]) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. [[Sardine]]s and [[Anchovy|anchovies]] were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of [[Akraiphia]], on [[Lake Copais]], provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was ''skaren'' (probably [[parrotfish]]) whereas [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] was three times as expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Dalby, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; Common salt water fish were [[yellowfin tuna]], [[red mullet]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[swordfish]] or [[sturgeon]], a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its [[eel]]s, celebrated by the hero of ''[[The Acharnians]]''. Other fresh water fish were [[esox|pike-fish]], [[carp]] and the less appreciated [[catfish]].

Pictorial evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fishing comes from [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.agropolis.fr/english/pages/expos/aliments/poissons/images/mosaique.htm Image of fishing illustrated in a Roman mosaic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033618/http://museum.agropolis.fr/english/pages/expos/aliments/poissons/images/mosaique.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; At a certain time the [[goatfish]] was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place ''in garo'', in the [[Garum|sauce]]. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why ''mullus'' in the feast of [[Trimalchio]] (see ''the [[Satyricon]]'') could be shown as a characteristic of the ''[[parvenu]]'', who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.

In [[medieval]] times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. [[Kipper]]s made from herring caught in the [[North Sea]] could be found in markets as far away as [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamson (2002), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. [[Stockfish]], cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s including [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[scallop]]s were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater [[crayfish]] were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson (2004), pp. 45–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of [[Fish hatchery|hatcheries]] and improved techniques of [[fish farming]] and [[aquaculture]]. Better understanding of the [[shellfish poisoning|hazards]] of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.

The smaller forage fish feed on plankton, and can accumulate toxins to a degree. The larger predator fish feed on the forage fish, and accumulate toxins to a much higher degree than the forage fish.

Important seafood bivalves include [[oyster]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s. Most of these are [[filter feeder]]s which bury themselves in sediment on the [[seabed]] where they are safe from [[predation]]. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some, such as scallops, can [[nekton|swim]]. Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal communities.

Examples are [[octopus]], [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]]. They are eaten in many cultures. Depending on the species, the arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways. Octopus must be boiled properly to rid it of slime, smell, and residual ink. Squid are popular in Japan.

| valign= top | [[Jellyfish]] are soft and gelatinous, with a body shaped like an umbrella or bell which pulsates for locomotion. They have long, trailing tentacles with stings for capturing prey. They are found free-swimming in the [[water column]] in all oceans, and are occasionally found in freshwater. Jellyfish must be dried within hours to prevent spoiling. In Japan they are regarded as a delicacy. Traditional processing methods are carried out by a jellyfish master. This involve a 20 to 40 day multi-phase procedure which starts with removing the gonads and [[mucous membrane]]s. The umbrella and oral arms are then treated with a mixture of [[table salt]] and [[alum]], and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp and crunchy texture. Only [[scyphozoan]] jellyfish belonging to the order [[Rhizostomeae]] are harvested for food; about 12 of the approximately 85 species. Most of the harvest takes place in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1011879821323 | last1 = Omori | first1 = M. | last2 = Nakano | first2 = E. | name-list-format =vanc | author-name-separator= | date = 2001 | title = Jellyfish fisheries in southeast Asia | url = | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 451 | issue = | pages = 19–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hsieh | first1 = Yun-Hwa P | last2 = Leong | first2 = F-M | last3 = Rudloe | first3 = J | date = 2001 | title = Jellyfish as food | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1011875720415 | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 451 | issue = 1–3| pages = 11–17 | doi = 10.1023/A:1011875720415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Jian-rong | last2 = Hsieh | first2 = Yun-Hwa P | date = 2004 | title = Traditional Chinese food technology and cuisine | url = http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/13/2/147.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Asia Pacific J Clin Nutr | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 147–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish is a highly [[Decomposition|perishable]] product. The ''fishy'' smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of [[amino acid]]s into [[Polyamine|biogenic amines]] and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Narain and Nunes, M.L. Marine Animal and Plant Products. ''In:'' Handbook of Meat, Poultry and Seafood Quality, L.M.L. Nollet and T. Boylston, eds. Blackwell Publishing 2007, p 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Live [[food fish]] are often transported in tanks at high expense for an [[live food fish trade|international market]] that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2005039280&amp;IA=WO2005039280&amp;DISPLAY=DESC WIPO]&lt;/ref&gt; While some seafood [[restaurant]]s keep live fish in [[aquarium|aquaria]] for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in [[Hong Kong]], for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 [[tonne]]s in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400&amp;nbsp;million, according to the World Resources Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=645 The World Resources Institute, The live reef fish trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207183454/http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=645 |date=7 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[cool chain]] has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the [[Shelf life|validity date]] printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a [[time temperature indicator]] on certain fresh chilled seafood products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2003/ucm147270.htm |title=La Rosa Logistics Inc 14-Jan-03 |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh fish is a highly perishable food product, so it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are [[Fish fillet|filleted]] and displayed for sale on a bed of [[crushed ice]] or [[refrigeration|refrigerated]]. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated [[Refrigerator car|train]] and [[Refrigerator truck|truck]] [[transportation]] has made fresh fish more widely available inland.

Long term [[Food preservation|preservation]] of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are [[Stockfish|drying]] and [[salting (food)|salting]]. [[Desiccation]] (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as [[cod]]. Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like [[herring]] and [[mackerel]]. Fish such as [[salmon]], [[tuna]], and [[herring]] are cooked and [[canning|canned]]. Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g. [[sardine]]s) are only [[decapitation|decapitated]] and gutted prior to canning.

==Consumption==
Seafood is consumed all over the world; it provides the world's prime source of high-quality [[protein]]: 14–16% of the animal protein consumed worldwide; over one billion people rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/3_foodconsumption/en/index5.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tidwell | first1 = James H. | last2 = Allan | first2 = Geoff L. | date = 2001 | title = Fish as food: aquaculture's contribution Ecological and economic impacts and contributions of fish farming and capture fisheries | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 11| pages = 958–963 | doi = 10.1093/embo-reports/kve236 | pmc=1084135 | pmid=11713181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish is among the most common [[food allergy|food allergens]].

[[Iceland]], [[Japan]], and [[Portugal]] are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Aquamedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] recommends that at least two portions of seafood should be consumed each week, one of which should be oil-rich. There are over 100 different types of seafood available around the coast of the UK.

Oil-rich fish such as [[mackerel]] or [[herring]] are rich in long chain [[Omega-3]] oils. These oils are found in every cell of the human body, and are required for human biological functions such as brain functionality.

Whitefish such as haddock and cod are very low in fat and calories which, combined with oily fish rich in [[Omega-3]] such as [[mackerel]], [[sardine]]s, fresh [[tuna]], [[salmon]] and [[trout]], can help to protect against [[coronary heart disease]], as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.

[[Shellfish]] are particularly rich in [[zinc]], which is essential for healthy skin and muscles as well as fertility. [[Casanova]] reputedly ate 50 [[oyster]]s a day.&lt;ref&gt;Slovenko R (2001) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jpsych29&amp;div=12&amp;id=&amp;page= "Aphrodisiacs-Then and Now"] ''Journal of Psychiatry and Law'', '''29''': 103f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMurray P and Ingber S (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJHU67VwJ9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Consider+the+Oyster:+A+Shucker%27s+Field+Guide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5JUGULXOHfGZiQft6-myCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Consider%20the%20Oyster%3A%20A%20Shucker%27s%20Field%20Guide&amp;f=false ''Consider the Oyster: A Shucker's Field Guide''] Page 15, Pan Australia. {{ISBN|9780312377366}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texture and taste==
Over 33,000 [[species]] of fish and many more marine invertebrate species have been described.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]: [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php October 2017 update.] Retrieved 30 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Bromophenols, which are produced by marine algae, gives marine animals an odor and taste that is absent from freshwater fish and invertebrates. Also, a chemical substance called dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that is found in red and green algae is transferred to animals in the marine food chain. When broken down, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced, and is often released during food preparation when fresh fish and shellfish are heated. In small quantities it creates a spesific smell one associates with the ocean, but which in larger quantities gives the impression of rotten seaweed and old fish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-science-of-seaweeds The Science of Seaweeds | American Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt; Another molecule known as [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|TMAO]] occurs in fishes and give them a distinct smell. It also exists in freshwater species, but becomes more numerous in the cells of an animal the deeper it lives, so that fish from the deeper parts of the ocean has a stronger taste than species who lives in shallow water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean BBC - Earth - What does it take to live at the bottom of the ocean?]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans.

==Health benefits==
Fish can form part of a nutritious diet and is a good source of vitamins and minerals; [[oily fish]] is rich in [[omega-3 fatty acid]], which may benefit heart health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NHS Choices |title=Fish and shellfish |date=19 December 2015 |url=https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/fish-shellfish.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health hazards==
{{See also|Health hazards of eating fish|Mercury in fish}}

[[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have a natural tendency to concentrate [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in their bodies, often in the form of [[methylmercury]], a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the [[food chain]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]], [[albacore tuna]], and [[tilefish]] contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the [[food chain]] amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called [[biomagnification]]. The first occurrence of widespread [[mercury poisoning]] in humans occurred this way in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]], now called [[Minamata disease]].

[[Shellfish]] are among the more common [[food allergy|food allergens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Common Food Allergens | url = http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/index.html | publisher = [[Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network]] | accessdate = 24 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613040928/http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/index.html | archivedate = 13 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A common misconception is a cross-reactivity between seafood and iodinated [[radiocontrast]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boehm | first1 = I | date = 2008 | title = Seafood allergy and radiocontrast media: Are physicians propagating a myth? | url = | journal = Am J Med | volume = 121 | issue = 8| pages = E19–E19 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.03.035 | pmid=18691465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mislabelling==
{{main|Seafood mislabelling}}

A 2013 study by [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] found that one third of seafood sampled from the United States was incorrectly labelled. [[Lutjanidae|Snapper]] and [[tuna]] were particularly susceptible to mislabelling, and seafood substitution was the most common type of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceana.org/en/news-media/publications/reports/oceana-study-reveals-seafood-fraud-nationwide Oceana Study Reveals Seafood Fraud Nationwide] [[Oceana (non-profit group)|''Oceana'']], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These practices can harm both the consumers' wallet and pose health risks. Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting, where practices such as overglazing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. The detection of water retention agents helps identify the fraud and its origin.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Sustainability==
{{See also|Overfishing|Sustainable seafood|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Research into population trends of various species of seafood is pointing to a global collapse of seafood species by 2048. Such a collapse would occur due to pollution and overfishing, threatening oceanic ecosystems, according to some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/11/03/world_seafood_supply_could_run_out_by_2048_researchers_warn/ World Seafood Supply Could Run Out by 2048 Researchers Warn] boston.com.

A major international scientific study released in November 2006 in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than 10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6108414.stm 'Only 50 years left' for sea fish]", BBC News. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, [[Boris Worm]] of [[Dalhousie University]], the author of the November 2006 study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', co-authored an update on the state of the world's fisheries with one of the original study's critics, [[Ray Hilborn]] of the [[University of Washington]] at Seattle. The new study found that through good fisheries management techniques even depleted fish stocks can be revived and made commercially viable again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/science/earth/31fish.html Study Finds Hope in Saving Saltwater Fish] ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FAO]] State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2004 report estimates that in 2003, of the main fish stocks or groups of resources for which assessment information is available, "approximately one-quarter were [[overexploited]], depleted or recovering from depletion (16%, 7% and 1% respectively) and needed rebuilding."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/007/y5600e/y5600e05.htm@ The Status of the Fishing Fleet]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," ''The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture: 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Fisheries Institute]], a trade advocacy group representing the United States seafood industry, disagree. They claim that currently observed declines in fish population are due to natural fluctuations and that enhanced technologies will eventually alleviate whatever impact humanity is having on oceanic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15532333/ Seafood Could Collapse by 2050, Experts Warn], msnbc.com.

A '''seed''' is an [[Plant embryogenesis|embryonic]] [[plant]] enclosed in a protective outer covering 
. The formation of the seed is part of the process of [[reproduction]] in seed plants, the [[spermatophytes]], including the [[gymnosperm]] and [[angiosperm]] plants.

Seeds are the product of the ripened [[ovule]], after [[fertilization]] by [[pollen]] and some growth within the mother plant.  The [[embryo]] is developed from the [[zygote]] and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.

Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es and [[marchantiophyta|liverworts]], which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.  Seed plants now dominate biological [[Ecological niche|niches]] on land, from [[forest]]s to [[grassland]]s both in hot and cold [[climates]].

The term "seed" also has a general meaning that antedates the above—anything that can be [[Sowing|sown]], e.g. "seed" [[potato]]es, "seeds" of [[maize|corn]] or [[sunflower seed|sunflower "seeds"]]. In the case of [[sunflower]] and corn "seeds", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or [[husk]], whereas the potato is a [[tuber]].

Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry [[fruit]]s. Plants producing berries are called baccate. [[Sunflower]] seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called [[stone fruits]] (such as the [[peach]]) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. [[Nut (fruit)|Nuts]] are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an [[indehiscent]] seed, such as an [[acorn]] or [[hazelnut]].

== Seed production ==

Seeds are produced in several related groups of plants, and their manner of production distinguishes the [[angiosperm]]s ("enclosed seeds") from the [[gymnosperm]]s ("naked seeds").  Angiosperm seeds are produced in a hard or fleshy structure called a [[fruit]] that encloses the seeds for protection in order to secure healthy growth. Some fruits have layers of both hard and fleshy material.  In gymnosperms, no special structure develops to enclose the seeds, which begin their development "naked" on the bracts of cones. However, the seeds do become covered by the [[Conifer cone|cone]] scales as they develop in some species of [[conifer]].

Seed production in natural plant populations varies widely from year to year in response to weather variables, insects and diseases, and internal cycles within the plants themselves.  Over a 20-year period, for example, forests composed of [[loblolly pine]] and [[shortleaf pine]] produced from 0 to nearly 5 million sound pine seeds per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cain M.D., Shelton M.G. | year = 2001 | title = Twenty years of natural loblolly and shortleaf pine seed production on the Crossett Experimental Forest in southeastern Arkansas | url = | journal = Southern Journal of Applied Forestry | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 40–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over this period, there were six bumper, five poor, and nine good seed crops, when evaluated for production of adequate [[seedling]]s for natural forest reproduction.

[[Angiosperm]] (flowering plants) seeds consist of three genetically distinct constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue derived from the maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with [[double fertilization]], which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary [[endosperm]] and the zygote.  Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue.  This tissue becomes the food the young plant will consume until the roots have developed after [[germination]].

=== Ovule ===
{{Main|Ovule}}
[[File:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg|thumb|300px|Plant ovules: Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule (inside ovary) on right]]

After fertilization the [[ovules]] develop into the seeds. The ovule consists of a number of components:
* The '''funicle''' (''funiculus, funiculi'') or seed stalk which attaches the ovule to the [[placentation|placenta]] and hence ovary or fruit wall, at the '''pericarp'''.
* The '''nucellus''', the remnant of the  [[megasporangium]] and main region of the ovule where the megagametophyte develops.
* The '''micropyle''', a small pore or opening in the apex of the integument of the ovule where the pollen tube usually enters during the process of fertilization.
* The '''chalaza''', the base of the ovule opposite the micropyle, where integument and nucellus are joined together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter One |author1=Galili G |author2=Kigel J |title=Seed development and germination |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-8247-9229-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the ovules as they develop often affects the final shape of the seeds.  Plants generally produce ovules of four shapes: the most common shape is called '''anatropous''', with a curved shape. '''Orthotropous''' ovules are straight with all the parts of the ovule lined up in a long row producing an uncurved seed. '''Campylotropous''' ovules have a curved megagametophyte often giving the seed a tight "C" shape. The last ovule shape is called '''amphitropous''', where the ovule is partly inverted and turned back 90 degrees on its stalk (the funicle or '''funiculus''').

In the majority of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is transversely oriented in regards to the long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Peter H., Ray Franklin Evert, and Helena Curtis. 1981. ''Biology of plants''. New York, N.Y.: Worth Publishers. page 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Embryo ===
[[File:Ginkgo embryo and gametophyte.jpg|thumb|The inside of a ''[[Ginkgo]]'' seed, showing a well-developed embryo, nutritive tissue ([[megagametophyte]]), and a bit of the surrounding seed coat]]

The main components of the embryo are:
* The '''cotyledons''', the seed leaves, attached to the embryonic axis. There may be one ([[Monocotyledons]]), or two ([[Dicotyledons]]). The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic dicotyledons, in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and leathery. In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. Dicotyledons have the point of attachment opposite one another on the axis.
* The '''epicotyl''', the  embryonic axis above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s).
* The '''plumule''', the tip of the epicotyl, and has a feathery appearance due to the presence of young leaf primordia at the apex, and will become the shoot upon germination.
* The '''hypocotyl''', the embryonic axis below the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s), connecting the epicotyl and the radicle, being the stem-root transition zone.
* The '''radicle''', the basal tip of the hypocotyl, grows into the primary root.

Monocotyledonous plants have two additional structures in the form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a '''coleoptile''' that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a '''coleorhiza''' that connects to the primary root and [[adventitious]] roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.

=== {{anchor|Seed coat}}Seed coat ===

The maturing ovule undergoes marked changes in the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganisation but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the '''tegmen''' and the outer forms the '''testa'''.  (The seed coats of some mononocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a [[Fruit anatomy#Anatomy of simple fruits|pericarp]].) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] from one species to the next. The funiculus abscises (detaches at fixed point – abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the '''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]'''. Anatropous ovules have a portion of the funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or '''raphe''', just above the hilum. In bitegmic ovules (e.g. ''Gossypium'' described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and is referred to as the colourless layer. By contrast the outer epidermis becomes [[tannin|tanniferous]]. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers. (Kozlowski 1972)

As the cells enlarge, and starch is deposited in the outer layers of the pigmented zone below the outer epidermis, this zone begins to lignify, while the cells of the outer epidermis enlarge radially and their walls thicken, with nucleus and cytoplasm compressed into the outer layer. these cells which are broader on their inner surface are called '''palisade''' cells. In the inner epidermis the cells also enlarge radially with plate like thickening of the walls. The mature inner integument has a palisade layer, a pigmented zone with 15-20 layers, while the innermost layer is known as the fringe layer. (Kozlowski 1972)

=== Gymnosperms ===
{{disputed|what=section|date=October 2016}}

In gymnosperms, which do not form ovaries, the ovules and hence the seeds are exposed. This is the basis for their nomenclature – naked seeded plants. Two sperm cells transferred from the pollen do not develop the seed by double fertilization, but one sperm nucleus unites with the egg nucleus and the other sperm is not used.

== Shape and appearance ==

A large number of terms are used to describe seed shapes, many of which are largely self-explanatory such as ''Bean-shaped'' (reniform) – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends on either side of the hilum, ''Square'' or ''Oblong'' – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, ''Triangular'' – three sided, broadest below middle, ''Elliptic'' or ''Ovate'' or ''Obovate'' – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or obovate, broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/peakey/key/The%20Pea%20Key/Media/Html/165_seed_shape.html|title=Seed shape|work=anbg.gov.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226052530/https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/peakey/key/The%20Pea%20Key/Media/Html/165_seed_shape.html|archivedate=2014-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other less obvious terms include '''discoid''' (resembling a disc or plate, having both thickness and parallel faces and with a rounded margin), '''ellipsoid''', '''globose''' ([[spherical]]), or '''subglobose''' (Inflated, but less than spherical), '''lenticular''', '''oblong''', '''ovoid''', '''reniform''' and '''sectoroid'''. '''Striate''' seeds are striped with parallel, longitudinal lines or ridges. The commonest colours are brown and black, other colours are infrequent. The surface varies from highly polished to considerably roughened. The surface may have a variety of appendages (see Seed coat). A seed coat with the consistency of [[Cork (material)|cork]] is referred to as '''suberose'''. Other terms include '''crustaceous''' (hard, thin or brittle).

== Structure ==
[[File:Avocado seed diagram-en.svg|thumb|The parts of an [[avocado]] seed (a [[dicot]]), showing the seed coat and [[embryo]]]]
[[File:Budowa nasienia-dwuliscienne.png|thumb|upright|Diagram of the internal structure of a [[dicot]] seed and embryo: (a) seed coat, (b) [[endosperm]], (c) [[cotyledon]], (d) [[hypocotyl]]]]

A typical seed includes two basic parts:
# an [[embryo]];
# a seed coat.

In addition, the '''[[endosperm]]''' forms a supply of nutrients for the embryo in most monocotyledons and the endospermic dicotyledons.

=== Seed types ===

Seeds have been considered to occur in many structurally different types (Martin 1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.seedbiology.de/evolution2.asp |title=The Seed Biology Place |publisher=Gerhard Leubner Lab, Royal Holloway, University of London |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100016/http://www.seedbiology.de/evolution2.asp |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are based on a number of criteria, of which the dominant one is the embryo-to-seed size ratio. This reflects the degree to which the developing cotyledons absorb the nutrients of the endosperm, and thus obliterate it.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Six types occur amongst the monocotyledons, ten in the dicotyledons, and two in the gymnosperms (linear and spatulate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGJL_Ys6wlQC|title=Carol C. Baskin, Jerry M. Baskin. Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination. Elsevier, 2001|isbn= 0-12-080263-5 |page=27|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is based on three characteristics: embryo morphology, amount of endosperm and the position of the embryo relative to the endosperm.

[[File:Monocot dicot seed.svg|thumb|Diagram of a generalized dicot seed (1) versus a generalized monocot seed (2). A. Seed Coat B. Cotyledon C. Hilum D. Plumule E. Radicle F. Endosperm]]

=== Embryo ===
In endospermic seeds, there are two distinct regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The [[embryo]] is the fertilised ovule, an immature [[plant]] from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one [[cotyledon]] or seed leaf in [[monocotyledon]]s, two cotyledons in almost all [[dicotyledon]]s and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of [[cereal|grains]] (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a '''[[scutellum (botany)|scutellum]]'''. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.

=== Nutrient storage ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seed layers.jpg|thumb|Layers within an endospermic maize seed]] --&gt;
Within the seed, there usually is a store of [[nutrient]]s for the [[seedling]] that will grow from the embryo.  The form of the stored nutrition varies depending on the kind of plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the [[endosperm]], which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via [[double fertilization]]. It is usually [[triploid]], and is rich in [[Vegetable oil|oil]] or [[starch]], and [[protein]]. In gymnosperms, such as [[Pinophyta|conifers]], the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a [[haploid]] tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the [[aleurone]] layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous aleurone grains.

Originally, by analogy with the animal [[ovum]], the outer nucellus layer ([[perisperm]]) was referred to as [[albumen]], and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with [[starch]], as for instance [[cereal grains]], or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as "fleshy" or "cartilaginous" with thicker soft cells such as [[coconut]], but may also be oily as in ''[[Ricinus]]'' (castor oil), ''[[Croton (plant)|Croton]]'' and [[Poppy]]. The endosperm is called "horny" when the cell walls are thicker such as [[Date palm|date]] and [[Coffee bean|coffee]], or "ruminated"  if mottled, as in [[nutmeg]], [[Palm (plant)|palms]] and [[Annonaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waAMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th ed. (1888) vol. 4, |page=155|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most monocotyledons (such as [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[Arecaceae|palms]]) and some ('''endospermic''' or '''albuminous''') dicotyledons (such as [[castor bean]]s) the embryo is embedded in the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon [[germination]]. In the '''non-endospermic''' dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as '''exalbuminous''' seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the [[legumes]] (such as [[bean]]s and [[pea]]s), trees such as the [[oak]] and [[walnut]], vegetables such as [[Squash (vegetable)|squash]] and [[radish]], and [[sunflower]]s. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley &amp; Black (1978) Physiology and Biochemistry of Seeds in Relation to Germination, pag.11&lt;/ref&gt; All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.

=== Seed coat ===
The seed coat develops from the maternal tissue, the [[integument]]s, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. [[peanut]]) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in [[honey locust]] and [[coconut]]), or fleshy as in the [[sarcotesta]] of [[pomegranate]]. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either '''bitegmic''' or '''unitegmic'''. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of [[lignified]] [[sclereids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=23&amp;id=8&amp;search=seed|title=Sinauer Associates, Inc., Publishers|author=|date=|website=5e.plantphys.net|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140122033254/http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=23&amp;id=8&amp;search=seed|archivedate=22 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer integument has a number of layers, generally between four and eight organised into three layers: (a) outer epidermis, (b) outer pigmented zone of two to five layers containing [[tannin]] and starch, and (c) inner epidermis.  The '''endotegmen''' is derived from the inner epidermis of the inner integument, the '''exotegmen''' from the outer surface of the inner integument. The '''endotesta''' is derived from the inner epidermis of the outer integument, and the outer layer of the testa from the outer surface of the outer integument is referred to as the '''exotesta'''. If the exotesta is also the mechanical layer, this is called an exotestal seed, but if the mechanical layer is the endotegmen, then the seed is endotestal. The exotesta may consist of one or more rows of cells that are elongated and pallisade like (e.g. [[Fabaceae]]), hence 'palisade exotesta'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=PO:0006048|title=plant_anatomy Term "seed coat epidermis" (PO:0006048)|work=gramene.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203143705/http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=PO:0006048|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511801709&amp;cid=CBO9780511801709A059|title=6 – Seed and fruit – University Publishing Online – Paula J. Rudall. Anatomy of Flowering Plants: An Introduction to Structure and Development. Third edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2007|isbn=978-0-521-69245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an '''[[aril]]''', a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle ([[ovule|funiculus]]), (as in [[Taxus|yew]] and [[nutmeg]]) or an oily appendage, an '''[[elaiosome]]''' (as in ''[[Corydalis]]''), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs are the source of the textile crop [[cotton]]. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, '''caruncles''' (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument in the vicinity of the micropyle), spines, or tubercles.

A scar also may remain on the seed coat, called the '''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]''', where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.

=== Size and seed set ===
[[File:Seed variety.jpg|thumb|A collection of various vegetable and herb seeds]]
Seeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram; they are often embryonic seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids and a few other groups of plants are [[myco-heterotrophy|mycoheterotrophs]] which depend on [[mycorrhizal fungi]] for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling.  Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend the first few years of their lives deriving energy from the fungi and do not produce green leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Welby R. 1993. ''Orchids of Minnesota''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; At over 20&amp;nbsp;kg, the largest seed is the ''[[coco de mer]]''.  Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so fall blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth.  Herbaceous perennials and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/1027t86224633171/|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=194|issue=2|pages=149–156|author=Igor Kosinki|title=Long-term variability in seed size and seedling establishment of ''Maianthemum bifolium''|doi=10.1007/s11258-007-9281-1|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shannon DA |author2=Isaac L |author3=Brockman FE |title=Assessment of hedgerow species for seed size, stand establishment and seedling height |journal=Agroforestry Systems |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=95–110 |date=February 1996 |doi=10.1007/BF02345331 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n537375121383705/?p=6bf47ea68f7f4a8fba3999fcf9da716e&amp;pi=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
Seeds serve several functions for the plants that produce them.  Key among these functions are nourishment of the [[embryo]], [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] to a new location, and [[dormancy]] during unfavorable conditions.  Seeds fundamentally are means of reproduction, and most seeds are the product of [[sexual reproduction]] which produces a remixing of genetic material and [[phenotype]] variability on which [[natural selection]] acts.

=== Embryo nourishment ===
Seeds protect and nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, because of the larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.

=== Dispersal ===
{{Main|Seed dispersal}}
Unlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also [[vegetative reproduction]]). A seed must somehow "arrive" at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]], which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques.  When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Samuel B., and Arlene E. Luchsinger. 1979. ''Plant systematics. McGraw-Hill series in organismic biology''. New York: McGraw-Hill.  Page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Some seeds (e.g., [[pine]]) have a wing that aids in wind dispersal.

==== By water (hydrochory) ====
* Some plants, such as ''[[Mucuna]]'' and ''[[Dioclea (plant)|Dioclea]]'', produce buoyant seeds termed sea-beans or drift seeds because they float in rivers to the oceans and wash up on beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seabean.com/|title=www.seabean.com – Sea-Beans and Drift Seeds|work=seabean.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711180958/http://www.seabean.com/|archivedate=2006-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== By animals (zoochory) ====
* Seeds ([[burr (fruit)|burrs]]) with barbs or hooks (e.g. [[acaena]], [[burdock]], [[Rumex|dock]]) which attach to animal fur or feathers, and then drop off later.
* Seeds with a fleshy covering (e.g. [[apple]], [[cherry]], [[juniper]]) are eaten by animals ([[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]) which then disperse these seeds in their [[faeces|droppings]].
* Seeds ([[nut (fruit)|nuts]]) are attractive long-term storable food resources for animals (e.g. [[acorn]]s, [[hazel]]nut, [[walnut]]); the seeds are stored some distance from the parent plant, and some escape being eaten if the animal forgets them.

'''[[Myrmecochory]]''' is the dispersal of seeds by [[ant]]s. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called [[elaiosome]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marinelli J | year = 1999 | title = Ants&amp;nbsp;– The astonishing intimacy between ants &amp; plants | url = http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/wildlife/1999sp_ants.html | journal = Plants &amp; Gardens News | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060818062717/http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/wildlife/1999sp_ants.html | archivedate = 2006-08-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[bloodroot]], [[trillium]]s, [[acacia]]s, and many species of [[Proteaceae]]).  Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them.  The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten.  The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1993"&gt;Ricklefs, Robert E.

Freeman). {{ISBN|0-7167-2409-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This dispersal relationship is an example of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food.  As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other.  In [[South Africa]], the [[Argentine ant]] (''Linepithema humile'') has [[invasive species|invaded]] and displaced native species of ants.  Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of ''[[Mimetes cucullatus]]'' or eat the elaiosomes.  In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of ''Mimetes'' seedlings have dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bond, W. J. |author2=P.

=== Dormancy ===
{{Main|Seed dormancy}}

Seed dormancy has two main functions: the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, [[herbivory]]) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant ([[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet-hedging]]).&lt;ref&gt;Eira MTS, Caldas LS (2000) Seed dormancy and germination as concurrent processes. Rev Bras Fisiol Vegetal 12:85–104&lt;/ref&gt; Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vleeshouwers L.M., Bouwmeester H.J., Karssen C.M. | year = 1995 | title = Redefining seed dormancy: an attempt to integrate physiology and ecology | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1031–1037 | doi=10.2307/2261184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.

Seed dormancy is not the same as seed persistence in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson K, Ceriani RM, Bakker JP, Bekker RM | year = 2003 | title = Are seed dormancy and persistence in soil related? | url = | journal = | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 97–100 | doi=10.1079/ssr2003128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, seed dormancy is divided into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and combinational dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baskin J.M., Baskin C.C. | year = 2004 | title = A classification system for seed dormancy | url = | journal = Seed Science Research | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1079/ssr2003150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo, including:
* '''Physical dormancy''' or '''hard seed coats''' occurs when seeds are [[Permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted in response to environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include [[Anacardiaceae]], [[Cannaceae]], [[Convulvulaceae]], [[Fabaceae]] and [[Malvaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Baskin JM, Baskin CC, Li X (2000) Taxonomy, anatomy and evolution of physical dormancy in seeds. Plant Species Biology 15:139-152&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chemical dormancy''' considers species that lack physiological dormancy, but where a chemical prevents germination. This chemical can be leached out of the seed by rainwater or snow melt or be deactivated somehow.&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, C.C. and Baskin, J.M. (1998) Seeds: Ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination.San Diego, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Leaching of chemical inhibitors from the seed by rain water is often cited as an important cause of dormancy release in seeds of desert plants, but little evidence exists to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Gutterman, Y. (1993) Seed germination in desert plants. Springer Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, including:
* In '''morphological dormancy''', germination is prevented due to morphological characteristics of the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before germination can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are [[Apiaceae]], [[Cycadaceae]], [[Liliaceae]], [[Magnoliaceae]] and [[Ranunculaceae]].&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998"&gt;Baskin, C.C. and Baskin, J.M. (1998) Seeds: Ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination.San Diego, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baskin, J.M 2004"&gt;Baskin, J.M. and Baskin, C.C. (2004) A classification system for seed dormancy. Seed Science Research 14:1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Morphophysiological dormancy''' includes seeds with underdeveloped embryos, and also have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds, therefore, require a dormancy-breaking treatments, as well as a period of time to develop fully grown embryos. Plant families where morphophysiological dormancy occurs include [[Apiaceae]], [[Aquifoliaceae]], [[Liliaceae]], [[Magnoliaceae]], [[Papaveraceae]] and [[Ranunculaceae]].&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998" /&gt; Some plants with morphophysiological dormancy, such as ''[[Asarum]]'' or ''[[Trillium]]'' species, have multiple types of dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth, while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. The terms "double dormancy" and "two-year seeds" are used for species whose seeds need two years to complete germination or at least two winters and one summer. Dormancy of the radicle (seedling root) is broken during the first winter after dispersal while dormancy of the shoot bud is broken during the second winter.&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998" /&gt;
* '''Physiological dormancy''' means the embryo, due to physiological causes, cannot generate enough power to break through the seed coat, endosperm or other covering structures. Dormancy is typically broken at cool wet, warm wet or warm dry conditions. [[Abscisic acid]] is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds, and its production can be affected by light.
** '''Drying''', in some plants, including a number of grasses and those from seasonally arid regions, is needed before they will germinate. The seeds are released, but need to have a lower moisture content before germination can begin. If the seeds remain moist after dispersal, germination can be delayed for many months or even years. Many herbaceous plants from temperate climate zones have physiological dormancy that disappears with drying of the seeds. Other species will germinate after dispersal only under very narrow temperature ranges, but as the seeds dry, they are able to germinate over a wider temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;International Workshop on Seeds, and G. Nicolas. 2003. ''The biology of seeds recent research advances : proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Seeds, Salamanca, Spain 2002''. Wallingford, Oxon, UK: CABI Pub. Page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In seeds with '''combinational dormancy''', the seed or fruit coat is impermeable to water and the embryo has physiological dormancy. Depending on the species, physical dormancy can be broken before or after physiological dormancy is broken.&lt;ref name="Baskin, J.M 2004" /&gt;
* '''Secondary dormancy'''* is caused by conditions after the seed has been dispersed and occurs in some seeds when nondormant seed is exposed to conditions that are not favorable to germination, very often high temperatures. The mechanisms of secondary dormancy are not yet fully understood, but might involve the loss of sensitivity in receptors in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, J. Derek, and Michael Black. 1994. ''Seeds physiology of development and germination. The language of science''. New York: Plenum Press. page 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of seed dormancy do not involve seed dormancy, strictly speaking, as lack of germination is prevented by the environment, not by characteristics of the seed itself (see [[Germination]]):
* '''Photodormancy''' or light sensitivity affects germination of some seeds. These photoblastic seeds need a period of darkness or light to germinate.  In species with thin seed coats, [[light]] may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil.
* '''Thermodormancy''' is seed sensitivity to heat or cold. Some seeds, including cocklebur and amaranth, germinate only at high temperatures (30&amp;nbsp;°C or 86&amp;nbsp;°F); many plants that have seeds that germinate in early to midsummer have thermodormancy, so germinate only when the soil temperature is warm. Other seeds need cool soils to germinate, while others, such as celery, are inhibited when soil temperatures are too warm.  Often, thermodormancy requirements disappear as the seed ages or dries.

Not all seeds undergo a period of dormancy.  Seeds of some [[mangrove]]s are viviparous; they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls. Many garden plant seeds will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough; though their wild ancestors may have had dormancy, these cultivated plants lack it.  After many generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners, dormancy has been selected out.

For [[annual plant|annuals]], seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patten D.T. | year = 1978 | title = Productivity and production efficiency of an Upper Sonoran Desert ephemeral community | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 65 | issue = 8| pages = 891–895 | doi = 10.2307/2442185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persistence and seed banks ===
{{further|Seed dormancy}}

== Germination ==
{{Main|Seedling|Germination}}
[[File:Sunflower seedlings.jpg|thumb|Germinating [[sunflower]] seedlings]]

Seed germination is a process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth and the emergence of the radicle or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.&lt;ref name="the_encyclopedia_of_seeds"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Black | first1 = Michael H. | last2 = Halmer | first2 = Peter | title = The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses | year = 2006 | publisher = CABI | location = Wallingford, UK  | isbn = 978-0-85199-723-0 | pages = 224  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three fundamental conditions must exist before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.

Seed viability is the ability of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live for a long time before germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.

'''Seed vigor''' is a measure of the quality of seed, and involves the viability of the seed, the germination percentage, germination rate and the strength of the seedlings produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.osu.edu/~seedsci/svvt01.html Seed Vigor and Vigor Tests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912050649/http://extension.osu.edu/~seedsci/svvt01.html |date=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''germination percentage''' is simply the proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The '''germination rate''' is the length of time it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by germination percentage plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;International Seed Testing Association. 1973. ISSN 0251-0952. Pages 120-21.''Seed science and technology''. Wageningen?: International Seed Testing Association.&lt;/ref&gt; It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.

Environmental conditions affecting seed germination include; water, oxygen, temperature and light.

Three distinct phases of seed germination occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and [[radicle]] emergence.

In order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate [[germination]]. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.

=== Repair of DNA damage ===
During seed [[dormancy]], often associated with unpredictable and stressful environments, [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]] accumulates as the seeds age.&lt;ref name=Cheah&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheah KS |author2=Osborne DJ |title=DNA lesions occur with loss of viability in embryos of ageing rye seed |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5654 |pages=593–9 |date=April 1978  |pmid=19213149 |doi= 10.1038/272593a0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koppen&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koppen G |author2=Verschaeve L |title=The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay: a way to study DNA repair in radicle cells of germinating ''Vicia faba'' |journal=Folia Biol.

=== Inducing germination ===
A number of different strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break [[seed dormancy]].

'''Scarification''' allows water and gases to penetrate into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the hard seed coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking in hot water or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer.  Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable.  Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from [[digestion]], while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along with a bit of fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant.  [[Microorganism]]s are often effective in breaking down hard seed coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.

'''[[Stratification (botany)|Stratification]]''', also called moist-chilling, breaks down physiological dormancy, and involves the addition of moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way to stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which are a part of the natural environment.

'''Leaching''' or the soaking in water removes chemical inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. [[Rain]] and melting [[snow]] naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, can result in oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.

Other methods used to assist in the germination of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Hudson Thomas, and Dale E. Kester. 1983. ''Plant propagation principles and practices''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-681007-1}}. Pages 175-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/276/5316/1248|title=Trace Gas Emissions and Smoke-Induced Seed Germination|author=Jon E.

=== Sterile seeds ===
Seeds may be sterile for few reasons: they may have been irradiated, unpollinated, cells lived past expectancy, or bred for the purpose.

=== Evolution and origin of seeds ===
The origin of seed plants is a problem that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle [[Devonian]]. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed ''Runcaria heinzelinii'' in the [[Givetian]] of [[Belgium]] is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.

The first "true" seeds are described from the upper Devonian, which is probably the theater of their true first evolutionary radiation. With this radiation came an [[evolution of seed size]], shape, dispersal and eventually the radiation of gymnosperms and angiosperms and [[monocotyledon]]s and [[dicotyledon]]s. The seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.

=== Edible seeds ===
{{further|List of edible seeds}}

Many seeds are edible and the majority of human calories comes from seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sabelli, P.A.|author2=Larkins, B.A.|year=2009|title=The Development of Endosperm in Grasses|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=14–26|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/1/14|doi=10.1104/pp.108.129437|pmid=19126691|pmc=2613697|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094215/http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/1/14|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from [[cereal]]s, [[legume]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Seeds also provide most [[cooking oil]]s, many [[beverage]]s and [[spice]]s and some important [[food additive]]s.  In different seeds the [[Embryo#Embryos of plants and animals|seed embryo]] or the [[endosperm]] dominates and provides most of the [[nutrient]]s. The storage [[protein]]s of the embryo and endosperm differ in their [[amino acid]] content and physical properties.  For example, the [[gluten]] of wheat, important in providing the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] property to bread [[dough]] is strictly an endosperm protein.

Seeds are used to propagate many crops such as cereals, legumes, [[forestry|forest trees]], [[turfgrass]]es, and [[pasture]] grasses. Particularly in developing countries, a major constraint faced is the inadequacy of the marketing channels to get the seed to poor farmers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mumby [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V4450E/V4450E00.htm Seed Marketing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909154533/http://www.fao.org/docrep/v4450e/V4450E00.htm |date=2009-09-09 }}, FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the use of farmer-retained seed remains quite common.

Seeds are also eaten by animals ([[seed predation]]), and are also fed to [[livestock]] or provided as [[birdseed]].

=== Poison and food safety ===
While some seeds are edible, others are harmful, poisonous or deadly.&lt;ref&gt;Chia Joo Suan, "[http://kuali.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/7/5/kuali/14689925&amp;sec=Kuali Seeds of Doubt: Food Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429185024/http://kuali.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F7%2F5%2Fkuali%2F14689925&amp;sec=Kuali |date=2008-04-29 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants and seeds often contain [[chemical compounds]] to discourage [[herbivores]] and [[seed predation|seed predators]].  In some cases, these compounds simply taste bad (such as in [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]), but other compounds are toxic or break down into toxic compounds within the [[digestive system]].

The seeds of many legumes, including the common bean (''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]''), contain proteins called [[lectins]] which can cause gastric distress if the beans are eaten without [[cooking]].  The common bean and many others, including the [[soybean]], also contain [[trypsin inhibitors]] which interfere with the action of the digestive enzyme [[trypsin]].

=== Other uses ===
[[Cotton]] [[fiber]] grows attached to [[Gossypium|cotton plant]] seeds. Other seed fibers are from [[kapok tree|kapok]] and [[milkweed]].

Many important nonfood oils are extracted from seeds. [[Linseed oil]] is used in paints. Oil from [[jojoba]] and [[crambe]] are similar to [[whale oil]].

Seeds are the source of some medicines including [[castor oil]], [[tea tree oil]] and the quack cancer drug [[Amygdalin|Laetrile]].

Many seeds have been used as [[bead]]s in necklaces and rosaries including [[Job's tears]], [[Chinaberry]], [[Abrus precatorius|rosary pea]], and [[castor bean]]. However, the latter three are also poisonous.

Other seed uses include:
* Seeds once used as weights for [[Weighing scale|balances]].
* Seeds used as toys by children, such as for the game [[Conkers]].
* Resin from ''[[Clusia]] rosea'' seeds used to caulk boats.

== In religion ==
The [[Book of Genesis]] in the Old Testament begins with an explanation of how all plant forms began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And [[God]] said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Version]], Genesis 1:12,13, 1611.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Quran]] speaks of seed germination thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is [[Allah]] Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?&lt;ref&gt;Quran, Translation: Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Al-An'aam 95:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10199">A '''spiritual bypass''' or '''spiritual bypassing''' is a "tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks".{{sfn|Fossella|Welwood|2011}} The term was introduced in the early 1980s by [[John Welwood]], a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist.{{sfn|Fossella|Welwood|2011}}{{sfn|Welwood|2000}}{{sfn|Masís|2002}} Spiritual bypass can be addressed with various forms of [[psychotherapy]], including [[Focusing (psychotherapy)|focusing]] and [[motivational interviewing]].{{sfn|Welwood|2000}}{{sfn|Clarke|Giordano|Cashwell|Lewis|2013}}

{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2016}}
Some [[neo-Advaita]] teachers, such as [[Jeff Foster (spiritual teacher)|Jeff Foster]]{{sfn|Foster|2011}} and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]],{{sfn|Cohen|2015}} have admitted that their own insight or "awakening" did not put an end to being a human being with personal, and even egoistical, feelings, aspirations and fears. Although he did not use the term "spiritual bypass", Cohen admitted that his "misguided efforts to create breakthroughs" caused "much harm" to some of his students.{{sfn|Cohen|2015}}

Spiritual bypass is defined as the use of one’s spirituality, spiritual beliefs, spiritual practices, and spiritual life to avoid experiencing the emotional pain of working through psychological issues (Welwood, 2000). This trap entails actively seeking spiritual highs as a means to avoid processing underlying psychological pain (B. H. Whitfield, 1995). One way to address the issue of spiritual bypass in counseling is to use the techniques, interventions, and processes of motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a counseling framework used to encourage positive behavior change in clients (Miller, 1983).}}

Then, although we may be practicing diligently, our spiritual practice can be used in the service of denial and defense. And when spiritual practice is used to bypass our real-life human issues, it becomes compartmentalized in a separate zone of our life, and remains unintegrated with our overall functioning. [...] In my psychotherapy practice I often work with dharma students who have engaged in spiritual practice for decades. I respect how their practice has been beneficial for them. Yet despite the sincerity as practitioners, their practice is not fully penetrating their life. They seek out psychological work because they remain wounded and not fully developed on the emotional/relational/personal level, and they may be acting out their wounding in harmful ways.}}

While thoughts, feelings, and fantasies may be made more available for scrutiny, non-judgmental attentiveness to their emergence while ignoring their meaning may not be enough (Rubin 1996). [...] Consciously or unconsciously, Western meditation practitioners may use their meditation practice to avoid facing developmental tasks or old psychic wounds that would be better dealt with in psychotherapy. Quite a few meditation teachers convey the message that enlightenment or seeing through the false self gets to the root of human suffering, and thereby eradicates personal emotional difficulties. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Enlightenment is seeing through the illusion of self, but is not necessarily a way to heal a wounded self. [...] Enlightenment experiences may be temporarily healing, but if old wounds are still operating, the practitioner will be unable to integrate those experiences into his or her daily life and may be using spirituality to avoid dealing with those very wounds (Kornfield 1993a; 1993b). [...] Welwood coined the equally well-known phrase of 'spiritual bypassing', or 'the tendency to try to avoid or prematurely transcend basic human needs, feelings and developmental tasks' (Welwood 2000:64).}}

The core element of such a path would be an awareness practice such as meditation, which helps connect us with all three principles. Along with that, a method of psychological inquiry is extremely helpful for addressing the unconscious patterns and emotion complexes.}}

'''Sue Rodriguez''' (August 2, 1950 – February 12, 1994) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[right to die]] activist.  In August 1991, she was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease) and was given two to five years to live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/diagnosed-with-a-killer-disease Sue Rodriguez at CBC Archives page]&lt;/ref&gt;  She ultimately made the decision to [[Suicide|end her life]] and she sought the assistance of a doctor to that end.  However, none would help her; under section 241(b) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|nation's Criminal Code]], anyone who "...aids or abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/canada-proposed-assisted-suicide-law-excludes-tourists Canada's proposed assisted-dying law to preclude suicide tourism ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://yourlaws.ca/criminal-code-canada/241-suicide 241 - Suicide | Criminal Code of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodriguez sought a legal exception in her home province, [[British Columbia]], but was denied.

The [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] (BCCLA) filed a [[lawsuit]], ''[[Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG)]]'', that challenged section 241(b) as contrary to sections [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|7]], [[Section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|12]], and [[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp349-e.htm The Rodriguez Case: A Review of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision on Assisted Suicide]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[videotape]]d address to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] on November 24, 1992, Rodriguez famously asked, “If I cannot give consent to my own death, whose body is this? Who owns my life?”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/26/world/canadian-woman-urges-legal-suicide-aid.html Canadian Woman Urges Legal Suicide Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/life/who-owns-my-life-sue-rodriguez-changed-how-we-think 'Who owns my life?': Sue Rodriguez changed how we think]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 1993, her case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].  On September 30 of that year, it decided against her 5-4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1054/index.do Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) - SCC Cases (Lexum)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 1994, with the assistance of an anonymous doctor, Sue Rodriguez took her own life by ingesting a liquid mixture of [[morphine]] and [[secobarbital]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/world/woman-who-lost-a-right-to-die-case-in-canada-commits-suicide.html Woman Who Lost a Right-to-Die Case in Canada Commits Suicide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20111115/281608122232134 PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News]&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctor's intervention was arranged by [[Member of parliament#Canada|MP]] [[Svend Robinson]], who was regarded as one of Rodriguez's most prominent supporters. Robinson was present at her death.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Gilmour, "Death, Dying and Decision-Making about End of Life Care" in Jocelyn Downie et al (eds), ''Canadian Health Law and Policy'' (Canada: LexisNexis, 2007), page 471&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by her request, her ex-husband Henry and their son Cole were not.  An investigation was undertaken, but no charges were laid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20140209/282153584171588 PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News]&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson (who presently lives in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]) has vowed to never reveal the anonymous doctor's identity.

Almost 23 years later, on June 7, 2016, physician-assisted suicide became legal in Canada as the result of a similar Supreme Court case, ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]''.  The Court unanimously struck down parts of section 241(b) and section 14 of the Criminal Code which the justices ruled unjustifiably infringed on section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/18/482599089/canada-legalizes-physician-assisted-dying Canada Legalizes Physician-Assisted Dying]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) - SCC Cases (Lexum)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and diagnosis ==
Sue Rodriguez was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] and grew up in the [[Toronto]], suburb of [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]].  She lived in [[California]] for a time before returning to Canada.  Her first marriage to Henry Rodriguez ended after less than eight years, and she had a son.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/bibliographic_entity%7Cvideo_work%7C2442894 ''Who Owns My Life?: The Sue Rodriguez Story'' video]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
The 1996 book ''[[Timely Death]]'' was inspired by the Sue Rodriguez story, and the 1998 [[film]] ''[[At the End of the Day: The Sue Rodriguez Story]]'', which stars [[Wendy Crewson]] as Sue Rodriguez, dramatizes her story.

== Legacy ==
On June 17, 2016, medically assisted dying became legal in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36566214 Canada's parliament passes assisted suicide bill]&lt;/ref&gt;  An emotional Svend Robinson, who now lives in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], told the press: “Today’s ruling is a victory for compassion, for justice and for humanity.  And I pay tribute to the memory of Sue Rodriguez, who with courage, passion and dignity blazed the trail that led to this historic day. She would have been thrilled".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/health/svend+robinson+tears+memories+rodriguez+rush+back/10794380/story.html For Svend Robinson, tears as memories of Sue Rodriguez rush back]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tokophobia''' is a significant fear of [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=Wax2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wax|first1=JR|last2=Cartin|first2=A|last3=Pinette|first3=MG|last4=Blackstone|first4=J|title=Patient choice cesarean: an evidence-based review.|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|date=August 2004|volume=59|issue=8|pages=601–16|pmid=15277895}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common reason why some women request an [[elective cesarean section]].&lt;ref name=Wax2004/&gt; The fear often includes fear of injury to the baby, [[genital tract]], or death.&lt;ref name=Wax2004/&gt; Treatment may occur via [[counselling]].&lt;ref name=Wax2004/&gt;

It is a type of [[specific phobia]]. In 2000, an article published in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' described the fear of childbirth as a [[psychological disorder]] that has received little attention and may be overlooked.&lt;ref name=BJP2000&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/176/1/83|title=Tokophobia: an unreasoning dread of childbirth|first1=Kristina|last1=Hofberg|first2=I.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Phobia]] of [[childbirth]], as with any phobia, can manifest through a number of symptoms including [[nightmares]], difficulty in concentrating on work or family activities, [[panic attacks]] and [[psychosomatic]] complaints. Often the fear of childbirth motivates a request for an [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|elective caesarean section]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrod|first1=Debbie|title=Rebuilding confidence in women's abilities in birth|journal=British Journal of Midwifery|date=December 2011|volume=19|issue=12|page=830|doi=10.12968/bjom.2011.19.12.830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of labor pain is strongly associated with the fear of [[pain]] in general; a previous complicated childbirth, or inadequate [[pain relief]], may cause the phobia to develop. A fear of [[pregnancy]] itself can result in an avoidance of pregnancy or even, as [[birth control]] methods are never 100% effective, an avoidance of sexual intercourse or asking for [[hysterectomy]].

Tokophobia is a distressing psychological disorder which may be overlooked by medical professionals; as well as [[specific phobia]] and [[anxiety disorders]], tokophobia may be associated with [[Clinical depression|depression]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilpern|first1=Kate|title=Hard labour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/may/28/familyandrelationships.health|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=13 December 2015|date=28 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of tokophobia and close liaison with [[Obstetrics|obstetricians]] or other medical specialists can help to reduce its severity and ensure efficient treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roland-Price|first1=Anna|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Zara|editor1-last=Karoshi|editor1-first=Mahantesh|editor2-last=Newbold|editor2-first=Sandra|editor3-last=B-Lynch|editor3-first=Christopher|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Keith|editor4-first=Louis G.|title=A Textbook of Preconceptional Medicine and Management|date=2012|publisher=Sapiens Publishing Ltd|location=UK|isbn=978-0-9552282-4-7|pages=281–288|url=https://www.glowm.com/pdf/section4_chapter21.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2015|format=PDF|chapter=Management of tocophobic women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|kkDbRj4IgE0|"Fear of Childbirth, Lecture by Astrid Osbourne, Consultant Midwife"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Reasons for tokophobia may be complex. Women may fear for the infant's life, fear the unknown and the uncertainty of the labour and birth process. Women may lack trust in obstetric services or fear being left alone in labour.

===Primary===
Primary tokophobia is the fear and deep-seated dread of childbirth in women who have never experienced birth. It may pre-date [[pregnancy]] and can start in [[adolescence]] or begin in pregnancy. This may relate back to their own mother's experience or be triggered by exposure to childbirth without adequate explanation at a young age. It may also be experienced by women who have been sexually abused or raped; childbirth could trigger flashbacks in women who are traumatised.

===Secondary===
Secondary tokophobia occurs in women who have experienced childbirth. The previous experience of birth may have been traumatic, or women may have experienced other upsetting events.

==Terminology==
The term tokophobia was introduced in the medical literature in 2000.&lt;ref name=BJP2000/&gt; The word is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tokos'', meaning childbirth and ''phobos'', meaning fear.&lt;ref name=BJP2000/&gt;

It is also known as "maleusiophobia" (though this is certainly a variant of "maieusiophobia", from the Greek "maieusis", literally meaning "delivery of a woman in childbirth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=maieusis|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=maieusis&amp;la=greek#Perseus:text:1999.04.0058:entry=mai/eusis-contents|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but referring generally to midwifery), "parturiphobia" (from Latin ''[[wikt:parturio|parturire]]'', meaning "to be pregnant", and "lockiophobia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=David|title=Making Babies: The Science of Pregnancy|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0674006534|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tornado''' was a [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] [[bucking bull]]. He is also a [[Bull Riding Hall of Fame]] inductee. He bucked on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) circuit and went to the [[National Finals Rodeo]] (NFR) at least four times. He was voted Bucking Bull of the NFR four times consecutively from 1962 to 1965. Owned by rodeo champion [[Jim Shoulders]], Tornado was named the "meanest bull alive" at the NFR four times. Tornado is best known for his matchup with ProRodeo Hall of Fame [[bull rider]], [[Warren G. Brown|Freckles Brown]], which is most often referred to as "The Ride." It was Brown who, in 1967, broke Tornado's undefeated streak of 220 buckoffs in six years. Tornado, Brown, and Shoulders all have been recorded in ''The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'' maintained online by the [[Oklahoma Historical Society]].

== Background ==
Tornado was born in 1957 in Texas. The [[cowboy]] bull rider and [[stock contractor]] Jim Shoulders, of [[Henryetta, Oklahoma]], owned and managed the bull; Shoulders actually maintained several quality bucking stock, which included the other "weather" bulls Cyclone, Hurricane, and Twister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoulders, Jim (b. 1928)|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.sr.049|website=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; According to Frank Boggs, an Oklahoman sports writer and columnist, Shoulders bought Tornado in South Texas when the bull was three years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Boggs {{!}} Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame {{!}} ZoomInfo.com|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Frank-Boggs/158289657|website=ZoomInfo|accessdate=25 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restingplace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oklahoma City museum is final resting place for animal rodeo greats|url=http://newsok.com/article/5454628|website=NewsOK.com|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornado was a Brahma-Hereford crossbred bull, known as a [[Braford]] that generally weighed 1,850 pounds.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado  {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=TO007&amp;l=t|website=www.okhistory.org|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as red with a white face.&lt;ref name="waymarking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado - Oklahoma City, OK - Animal Memorials on Waymarking.com|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMATWH_TORNADO_Oklahoma_City_OK|website=www.waymarking.com|accessdate=25 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornado first started bucking in [[Mesquite, Texas]], in 1960.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;  

== Career ==
From Tornado's first rodeo in Mesquite, Texas, in 1960 through to the NFR in December 1967, he was undefeated, bucking off the toughest cowboys. There was a sign outside his pen at Shoulder's ranch in Henryetta: "Warning: Enter at Your Own Risk." Shoulders declared that outside of the arena Tornado was tame, and he "often walked up to Tornado in the pasture to pet him or feed him grass". However, in the arena, "Tornado transformed into a holy terror".&lt;ref name="theride"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories of the Ages {{!}} Freckles Brown: The Ride|url=http://ndepth.newsok.com/freckles-brown-the-ride|website=ndepth.newsok.com|accessdate=26 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornado qualified for the NFR every year from 1962 through 1966 and perhaps more. For those four years, he was the top-ranked bull on the bucking-stock list. For the first 220 attempts to ride him for a qualified ride, he remained undefeated.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; In addition to typical bucking abilities such as jumping, kicking, and spinning, Tornado also possessed something labeled "clown-and-barrel fighting ability." His name came from his ability to quickly alter the direction of his spin. However, he used just enough energy as he needed to buck off the level of rider on him. Another hall of fame bull, [[Red Rock (bull)|Red Rock]] was known for using this strategy, and he was undefeated for his entire PRCA career of 309 attempts.&lt;ref name="waymarking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt;

Tornado was sometimes referred to as "unrideable" by the cowboys. He was finally defeated in a famous ride with Brown. Cowboy songwriter and singer [[Red Steagall]] captured "The Ride" in his song&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt; "The Ballad of Freckles Brown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado {{!}} Real Time Pain Relief|url=https://rtpr.com/10-most-feared-and-respected-bulls-professional-bull-riding/tornado|website=rtpr.com|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornado (and Brown) are now documented in the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture maintained online by the Oklahoma Historical Society.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

{{quotebox|"His reputation had not been gained smelling flowers. He was rodeo’s orneriest critter, a massive assembly of muscles and guts and powerful old bones."&lt;br&gt;— rodeo journalist Frank Boggs&lt;ref name="western"/&gt;}}
For four of his trips to the NFR, Tornado was voted the Bucking Bull of the NFR and named "The Meanest Bull Alive."&lt;ref name="western"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evolution of the National Finals Rodeo|url=http://www.westernhorseandgun.com/article/the-evolution-of-the-national-finals-rodeo/|website=Western Horse &amp; Gun|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodeo photographer Ferrell Butler, explained "If you didn’t get out of there, he’d camp onto you something fierce. Then he’d go wipe out the barrel."&lt;ref name="western" /&gt; Jim Shoulders’ wife Sharon said she did not consider him vicious; she believed that he “sized up” his riders, having noticed that he bucked harder with top riders than he did for locals.&lt;ref name="restingplace"/&gt;

Halfway through his bucking career, in 1965, Shoulders put Tornado up for a $500 prize to anyone who could ride him at the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|101 Wild West Ranch Rodeo]]. The offer was open to anyone, not just bull riders, as long as they were of legal age. No one won the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=101 Wild West Rodeo History - 1965|url=http://101wildwestrodeo.com/history/1965.htm|website=101wildwestrodeo.com|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the NFR in 1967 in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull rider [[Myrtis Dightman]] tried to ride Tornado but failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race in Rodeo: Cowboys Reflect on how Far the Cowboy Sport has Come|url=http://wranglernetwork.com/news/race-in-rodeo-cowboys-reflect-on-how-far-the-cowboy-sport-has-come/|website=Wrangler Network|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After "The Ride," with [[Freckles Brown]], Tornado was ridden four more times, once by Brown, and also by three other riders. The second time Brown rode him was in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; 

=== The Ride ===
On December 1, 1967, at the NFR in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, approximately 9,000 fans gathered in the [[Oklahoma State Fair Arena]] to watch 47-year-old Freckles Brown, the 1962 PRCA World Champion Bull Rider, attempt to ride Tornado. Brown had been studying the bull’s performance at many rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freckles' Legend Built On Tornado|url=http://newsok.com/article/2179969|website=NewsOK.com|accessdate=26 February 2017|date=22 March 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his odds of success were considered to be slim: he was older than the typical cowboy and had had surgery on his neck.&lt;ref name="western" /&gt;

The two were loaded into chute #2.  After they were introduced, there was a great silence in the arena. Then Tornado exploded out of the gate, a moment seen in one of two iconic photographs of the event, taken by Ferrell Butler. Brown recounted the ride in detail, noting that he had a few seconds in the middle of the ride where he was concerned, but toward the end was confident that he would make it to the eight-second qualifying buzzer.&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt; Later, Brown said "the crowd was so loud that he couldn't hear the whistle. However, he knew when the clowns moved in that he had successfully ridden the bull."&lt;ref name="legends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chamber honors Henryetta legends {{!}} Henryetta Free-Lance|url=https://www.henryettafree-lance.com/articles/2016/05/25/chamber-honors-henryetta-legends|website=www.henryettafree-lance.com|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chute they had used was later exhibited in the office of the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=legends/&gt;

Tornado was 11 years old by this time, yet he was still considered the most challenging bull. "Tornado had such a reputation that most cowboys were thrown before they even got on him," says former state senator and Oklahoma Congressman [[Clem McSpadden]], general manager of the NFR that year. "But the bull was at a point in its career where it was fit to be ridden. Freckles got on him, bore down and ended up riding him pretty easy".&lt;ref name="sitting"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stratton|first1=W.K.|title=Sitting Atop a Tornado|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1987/05/25/115434/sitting-atop-a-tornado-in-1967-at-46-freckles-brown-rode-the-unridable-bull|website=SI.com|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Radio icon [[Paul Harvey]] regaled a national audience for several minutes with details of Freckles Brown's historic ride on the fearsome Tornado. The publicity did wonders for the professional rodeo circuit." Butler noticed that before "The Ride", there would be modest crowds on the weekends, saying "we couldn't get enough people in an arena to start a cussin' fight", but afterwards, he saw crowd size increase noticeably.&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt;

== Retirement and death ==
Tornado was retired after the end of the 1968 rodeo season,&lt;ref name="prorodeo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado - Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|url=http://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/inductees/by-category/livestock/tornado/|website=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Shoulders' J Lazy S Ranch in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Shoulders stated that "He enjoyed his prestigious position at the ranch and made it a point to attract attention when strangers were around by bellowing and throwing dirt – almost as though he wanted all to know he was still a champion". Tornado died in spring 1972.&lt;ref name="theride" /&gt;

Shoulders died in 2007, but his wife Sharon loves to reminisce about him and Tornado, for example the cookies her two youngest daughters hand-fed Tornado while Jim was out touring. She claims Tornado was "docile and gentle" in the pasture, and still and relaxed in the chute until it was go time. "He'd just stand there; he'd look out between the chute boards, almost like he was sizing up what he was going to do".&lt;ref name="restingplace"/&gt;

Tornado is buried on the grounds of the [[National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, near the graves of two notable bucking horses.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Apparently 18 acres at the museum are set aside for burial memorials of notable rodeo animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Final Resting Place for Rodeo Bulls &amp; Good Horses|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-final-resting-place-of-rodeo-bulls-and-good-horses|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=25 February 2017|language=en|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there have only been four animals buried there: Tornado, two notable bucking horses ([[Midnight (horse)|Midnight]] and [[Five Minutes Til Midnight]]), and the museum's Longhorn mascot, Abilene. Tornado's spot has a huge memorial plague with a dedication.&lt;ref name="restingplace" /&gt; It appears on the Waymarking website.&lt;ref name="waymarking"/&gt;

A '''torture murder''' is a murder where death was preceded by the [[torture]] of the victim. In many legal jurisdictions, a murder involving "exceptional brutality or cruelty" will attract a harsher sentence.

==Frequency==

Notable individual incidents and successfully prosecuted cases are listed below but torture murder is much more common than this list may suggest. [[Lynching in the United States]]—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by [[human trophy collecting]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan |date=September 27, 2016 |title= U.S. owes black people reparations for a history of ‘racial terrorism,’ says U.N. panel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/27/u-s-owes-black-people-reparations-for-a-history-of-racial-terrorism-says-u-n-panel/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date=May 1, 2017|quote="Lynching was a form of racial terrorism that has contributed to a legacy of racial inequality that the United States must address. Thousands of people of African descent were killed in violent public acts of racial control and domination and the perpetrators were never held accountable." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Equal Justice Initiative]]|title=Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror|year=2017|location=Montgomery, Alabama|url=https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|page=14|edition=3rd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510151602/https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|archive-date=2018-05-10|quote=Public spectacle lynchings were those in which large crowds of white people, often numbering in the thousands, gathered to witness pre-planned, heinous killings that featured prolonged torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and/or burning of the victim. Many were carnival-like events, with vendors selling food, printers producing postcards featuring photographs of the lynching and corpse, and the victim’s body parts collected as souvenirs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, since industrial acid became available in quantity during the 19th century, [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]] have become a globally widespread method of murder.

In the 21st century, many of the [[Killing of captives by ISIL|murders]] of foreigners in and citizens of [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] committed by members of the terrorist organization [[Daesh]] were preceded by torture.  Film footage of the [[persecution of Muslims in Myanmar]] documents the aftermath and testimony of torture murder by government forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Myanmar's Killing Fields |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/ |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[PBS]] |date=2018-05-08 |season=36 |transcript=transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/transcript/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence has demonstrated torture murder associated with many other [[massacre]]s, [[war crime]]s, and [[genocide]]s, both contemporary and historical.

==Punishment==

[[Murder#Country-specific_murder_law|Murder laws worldwide]] vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions. In the laws of [[Murder (Italian law)|Italy]], [[Murder in German law|Germany]], [[Murder (Norwegian law)|Norway]], and many parts of the [[Murder (United States law)|United States]], there are two or more "degrees" of murder, with wording such as: "''...inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim's death''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAW|Penal Law § 235.20 PEN Part 3 Title H]&lt;/ref&gt; typically used to rule that the highest degree should apply. In other jurisdictions, it may be that even if there was just one crime of murder, the sentencing practices and guidelines are such that the [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstance]] of any torture will nevertheless allow for a harsher than normal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentencing - Mandatory life sentences in Murder cases|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_-_mandatory_life_sentences_in_murder_cases/#an08|website=CPS|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the offence involved gratuitous cruelty|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/section_21a.html|website=Sentencing Bench Book|publisher=Judicial Commission of New South Wales|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}}}
''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' is one of the most famous [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref name="Bakker"/&gt; It has been frequently represented in film and on television, in literature, on the Internet and in all kinds of games.

==General impact==
''Tyrannosaurus rex'' is unique among dinosaurs in its place in modern culture; paleontologist [[Robert Bakker]] has called it "the most popular dinosaur among people of all ages, all cultures, and all nationalities".&lt;ref name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bakker |first= Robert|authorlink= Robert Bakker |editor= Fiffer S |title= Tyrannosaurus Sue|year= 2000|publisher=W. H. Freeman &amp; Company|location= New York|isbn= 0-7167-4017-6 |pages=xi–xiv |chapter= Prologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, it was embraced by the public. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], the President of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], billed it the greatest hunter to have ever walked the earth. He stated in 1905,&lt;ref name ="Horner93"&gt;John "Jack" Horner and Don "Dino" Lessem, ''The Complete T. Rex'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pages 58–62&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I propose to make this animal the type of the new genus, ''Tyrannosaurus'', in reference to its size, which far exceeds that of any carnivorous land animal hitherto described...This animal is in fact the ne plus ultra of the evolution of the large carnivorous dinosaurs: in brief it is entitled to the royal and high sounding group name which I have applied to it.}}

''Tyrannosaurus'' gained widespread public attention on December 30, 1905, when the ''[[New York Times]]'' hailed ''T. rex'' as "the most formidable fighting animal of which there is any record whatever," the "king of all kings in the domain of animal life," "the absolute warlord of the earth," and a "royal [[man-eater]] of the jungle."&lt;ref&gt;"Mining for Mammoths in the Badlands: How Tyrannosaurus Rex Was Dug Out of His 8,000,000 Year old Tomb," ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 3, 1905, page SM1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was dubbed the "prize fighter of antiquity" and the "Last of the Great Reptiles and the King of Them All."&lt;ref&gt;"The Prize Fighter of Antiquity Discovered and Restored," ''The New York Times'' December 30, 1906, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, [[Charles R. Knight]] painted a mural incorporating ''Tyrannosaurus'' facing a ''[[Triceratops]]'' in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesrknight.com/Alexander_Sherman.htm "Charles Knight: Prehistoric Visions of a Beloved Muralist"] 2002 Field Museum, In the Field article by Alexander Sherman&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the two dinosaurs as enemies in popular thought;&lt;ref name="Bakker1986"/&gt; paleontologist [[Phil Currie]] cites this mural as one of his inspirations to study dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Horner93"/&gt; Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''Triceratops'', "No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting that those two massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the very last days of the very last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs."&lt;ref name="Bakker1986"&gt;Bakker, R.T. 1986. ''The Dinosaur Heresies''. New York: Kensington Publishing, p. 240. On that page, Bakker has his own ''T. rex''/''Triceratops'' fight.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tyrannosaurus rex'' has played a major role in many films, starting in 1918 with ''[[The Ghost of Slumber Mountain]]'', written and directed by [[stop motion]] special effects pioneer [[Willis O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6WhWhWDc48|title=T. REX - A Dinosaur in Hollywood (2005)|first=|last=TYRANNOSAURUS REX|date=July 26, 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ghost of Slumber Mountain'' is also, and most likely, the first film showing ''Tyrannosaurus'' facing ''[[Triceratops]]''. The king of the tyrant lizards came back in 1925 with the classic [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s novel ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. ''Tyrannosaurus'' fossils weren't so famous at the time of the publication of the novel (1912), and the only main villain dinosaur on the book was ''[[Allosaurus]]'', with no appearance of ''Tyrannosaurus'', but [[The Lost World (1925 film)|this 1925 film]] featured ''Tyrannosaurus'' anyway, for a more dramatic and spectacular effect.&lt;ref&gt;''T. rex'' didn't actually feature in the book but O'Brien made sure there was a role for him in the film, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6WhWhWDc48 ''T. rex: A Dinosaur in Hollywood''] (2005 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stop motion animator Willis O'Brien, who had worked on ''The Ghost of Slumber Mountain'' and ''The Lost World'', was again responsible of special effects in the 1933 monster movie ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]'', which featured a climactic battle between the giant ape and a ''Tyrannosaurus''. The ''Tyrannosaurus'' model was made using a cast based on an early painting by Charles R. Knight. O'Brien stated that the battle between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' was one of the most technically difficult scenes in the film to animate. Many early films depicted ''Tyrannosaurus'' with an upright posture based on the current thinking of the time. Most of these films inaccurately portrayed the dinosaur with three prominent fingers on each hand like ''[[Allosaurus]]'' (though ''Tyrannosaurus'' had a third, vestigial finger, it wouldn't have been noticeable at first glance);&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/10/17/tyrannosaurus-dinosaur.html?category=dinosaurs&amp;guid=20071017093030&amp;dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000 ''T. rex''{{'s}} Missing 3rd Finger Found] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019033757/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/10/17/tyrannosaurus-dinosaur.html?category=dinosaurs&amp;guid=20071017093030&amp;dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000 |date=October 19, 2007 }}," ''Discovery News'' October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] is reported to have informed dinosaur hunter [[Barnum Brown]] that "it looked better that way," and the creature was depicted as such in Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. Since that time, ''T. rex'' has appeared in a great number of "monster" films and educational documentaries.&lt;ref name ="Horner93"/&gt; One of the first appearances which portrayed a proper posture and anatomy of ''Tyrannosaurus'' is the 1984 short ''[[Prehistoric Beast]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlaXIRTjNfo|title=Phil Tippett's Prehistoric Beast|first=|last=PhilsAttic|date=April 14, 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; fully conceived and made by [[Phil Tippett]] by means of his so-called [[go motion]] technique.

One of the most iconic depictions of ''Tyrannosaurus'' in film was in 1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', where dinosaurs including ''T. rex'' are brought back to life using blood from fossilized mosquitoes. In the film, the dinosaur breaks free of its [[theme park]] enclosure, and proceeds to roam the park after attacking the visitors and killing one (a lawyer). In the film's finale, the ''Tyrannosaurus'' indirectly saves the main characters by killing the ''Velociraptors'', who had been hunting them through the visitor center. The popularity of ''T. rex'' has long had a reciprocal effect on dinosaur science; the popularity of ''Jurassic Park'' factored into the discovery of the dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Scipionyx]]''; fossils of this genus had lain in storage in a basement in Italy until the film's release attracted attention from the fossil owner.&lt;ref name="Poling"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Poling| first = Jeff| title = Skippy the dinosaur| publisher = Journal of Dinosaur Paleontology| year = 1998| url = http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/misc/scipionyx.html| accessdate = March 1, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204133310/http://dinosauria.com/jdp/misc/scipionyx.html| archivedate = February 4, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two ''Tyrannosaurus'' appeared again as primary antagonists in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park|The Lost World]]'', the sequel to ''Jurassic Park''. In ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', it appeared briefly in a confrontation against the main antagonist, ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', only to be killed by it. In a twist, the same ''Tyrannosaurus'' from the original 1993 film appears as the climactic protagonist in ''[[Jurassic World]]'' (2015), making an entrance by smashing through a ''Spinosaurus'' skeleton. Against the odds, it defeats the "Indominus Rex," with the assistance of a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', dubbed "Blue," and a ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. This specific ''Tyrannosaurus'' reappears in ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]''.

''Tyrannosaurus'' is one of the three dinosaur types whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at [[Toho]], to create the Japanese monster [[Godzilla]]; the other two dinosaurs were ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]''.

Among other appearances, ''Tyrannosaurus'' has made major appearances in many other films, including ''[[Dinosaurus!]]'' (1960), ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966), ''[[The Last Dinosaur]]'' (1977), ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988), ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]'' (1993), ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin]]'' (1997), ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006), ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' (2007), ''[[Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'' (2015). The [[IMAX]] 3D film ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'' (1998) featured a ''Tyrannosaurus'' in various time travel sequences, as well as its discoverer, [[Barnum Brown]]

Some [[Anime|Japanese animated films]] have a ''Tyrannosaurus'' as a main protagonist (''[[You Are Umasou]]'', 2010), as the main villain (''[[Daikyouryu no Jidai]]'', ''The Age of the Great Dinosaurs'', 1979), as a minor antagonist (''[[Magic Tree House (film)|Magic Tree House]]'', 2011), or as a neutral character (''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur]]'', 1980, as well as its [[Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006|2006 remake]]).

==Television appearances==
''Tyrannosaurus'' has starred in several television series, including children's programs, both in those intended as fiction, and, more recently, documentaries.

In ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'', [[Barney &amp; Friends#Dinosaurs|Barney]] is a stylized ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. In the Australian children's show ''[[The Wiggles]]'', the character "Dorothy the Dinosaur" is a stylized adaptation of a ''Tyrannosaurus''. Some ''Tyrannosaurus'' characters appear in ''[[Dinosaur Train]]'', most prominently Buddy.

''Tyrannosaurus'' was one of several dinosaurs featured in the 1974 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' adventure ''[[Invasion of the Dinosaurs]]'', starring [[Jon Pertwee]]. A sleeping juvenile is also seen on the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]] ark in "[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]". A Time travelled ''Tyrannosaurus'' seen on London in "[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]".

In 1985 the 1984 ''[[Prehistoric Beast]]'' short was served to [[Robert Guenette]] to direct a full length TV documentary titled ''[[Dinosaur!]]'', for which Phil Tippett made new ''Tyrannosaurus'' go motion sequences (chasing ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'') in addition to those he made for ''Prehistoric Beast'' (where ''Tyrannosaurus'' was chasing ''[[Monoclonius]]'').

In the 1985 cartoon ''[[Transformers]]'' the popular [[Autobot]], [[Grimlock]], transformed into a mechanical ''Tyrannosaurus'' and in later incarnations a "[[Megaraptor]]." In the sequel series, ''[[Beast Wars]]'', [[Megatron (Beast Era)|Megatron]], the leader of the [[Predacon]]s, turned into a techno-organic ''Tyrannosaurus''.

In the cartoon ''[[The Terrible Thunderlizards]]'', '[[Mr. T]]' plays a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' called Mr. T-rex. General Galapagos, the boss of the Thunderlizards, is also a ''Tyrannosaurus''.

The T-rex plays recurring supporting roles in ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'' (Roy Hess, [[Earl Sinclair]]'s friend and the Sinclairs' neighbor), ''[[Dinosaucers]]'' (Genghis Rex, who is the leader of the Evil Tyrannos), ''[[Extreme Dinosaurs]]'' (T-Bone, the leader of the heroic group of the same namesake) as well as the anime television series ''[[Dinozaurs]]'' (as "Dino Tyranno" and his short-lived evil counterpart "Drago Tyran").

In ''Land of the Lost'' a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' played the villain in both [[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|the 1974 series]] (as "Grumpy") and [[Land of the Lost (1991 TV series)|the 1991 version]] (as "Scarface", who had a scar covering his right eye).

In the ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' episode "Washington B.C." Dr Animo brings back a ''Tyrannosaurus'' with its skeleton.

In ''[[Dino-Riders]]'', the main villain Lord Krulos uses a ''Tyrannosaurus'' as his mount.

In the Japanese TV series ''[[Dinosaur War Izenborg]]'', a ''Tyrannosaurus'' named Ururu (renamed "Tyranis" in the US re-edit ''Attack of the Super Monsters'') served as the main villain for the first half of the series.

A ''Tyrannosaurus'' named Tyrannor was the main antagonist of ''[[Dink the Little Dinosaur]]''.

Documentaries and quasi-documentaries featuring ''Tyrannosaurus'' have included ''[[Dinosaur!]]'', ''[[Dinosaur Planet (TV series)|Dinosaur Planet]]'', ''[[Prehistoric Park]]'', ''[[T. Rex: New Science, New Beast]]'', ''[[The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'', ''[[Sea Monsters - A Walking with Dinosaurs Trilogy]]'', ''[[Valley of the T-Rex]]'', ''Dinosaurs Decoded'', ''Bizarre Dinosaurs'', ''[[Animal Armageddon]]'', ''[[Jurassic Fight Club]]'', ''Dinolab'', ''[[List of Horizon episodes#Series 40: 2003-2004|T-rex: Warrior or Wimp?]]'', ''T. Rex: A Dinosaur in Hollywood'', ''[[Dinosaur Revolution]]'', and ''[[Planet Dinosaur]]'', in which it only appears as a skeleton image.

[[Chomper]] from ''[[The Land Before Time (series)|The Land Before Time]]'' series, as well as [[List of villains in The Land Before Time#Red Claw|Red Claw]] from the [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|TV series]], and ''[[Sharptooth (The Land Before Time)|Sharptooth]]'' from the original film are all tyrannosaurs.

''Tyrannosaurus''-themed mecha have appeared in the [[Super Sentai]] series since ''[[Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger]]'' in Shogozyu Tyrannosaurus, V-Rex of ''[[Mirai Sentai Timeranger]]'', Bakuryu Tyranno of ''[[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]]'', Gozyu Rex of ''[[Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger]]'', and recently Gabutyra of ''[[Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger]]''. They also appear in their respective Power Rangers adaptations in Season One of ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Time Force]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Dino Thunder]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Super Megaforce]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers Dino Charge]]''.

A [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animated]] ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' named Tina Rex is a bully in Gumball's school in the 2011–present animated series on [[Cartoon Network]], ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]''.

==Literature==

In literature, a dominant representation of ''Tyrannosaurus'' since 1990 has been that of Michael Crichton's, as seen in the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Lost World (Michael Crichton)|The Lost World]]'' (homage title to the 1912 [[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|novel]] by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], about scientists discovering a South American plateau where dinosaurs still exist). Its skeleton was also used to illustrate the covers of these books.

A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was the protagonist of the children's book ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (book)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]'' (later adapted into a feature-length [[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|film of the same name]]). ''Tyrannosaurus'' has also been featured in the novel ''[[List of Primeval books and novelisations|Primeval: Extinction Event]]'', by [[Dan Abnett]].

==Other appearances==

[[File:DPAG 2008 Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a ''Tyrannosaurus'' on a German postage stamp.]]
''Tyrannosaurus'' has appeared in many media and is perhaps one of the most widely used dinosaurs. Various incarnations of, and creatures based on ''T. rex'' have appeared in video games, and several game series have featured ''Tyrannosaurus'' a centerpiece. These include ''[[3D Monster Maze]]'', the ''[[Dino Crisis]]''/''[[Dino Stalker]]'' line, various [[Jurassic Park video games|''Jurassic Park'' tie-in games]], the [[Turok (video game series)|''Turok'' game series]], ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', the ''[[Zoo Tycoon franchise|Zoo Tycoon]]'' series, the survival game ''[[Ark: Survival Evolved]]'', the simulation games ''[[Saurian]]'' and ''The Isle'', and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.
[[File:Trex.mending.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Full size animatronic ''Tyrannosaurus'' being assembled in [[Combe Martin]] Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, [[North Devon]], United Kingdom.]]
Numerous models and children's toys depicting ''Tyrannosaurus'' have been produced, particularly in promotion of the ''[[Jurassic Park (franchise)|Jurassic Park]]'' films. The [[Carnegie collection|Carnegie Museum Dinosaur Collection]] toy line released two versions of the dinosaur, with the second brought in line with more modern scientific understanding. [[Sinclair Oil]] ads from the 1950s frequently featured ''T. rex'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027113257/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/houstontyrannosaurus.html|title=Dino Land Travels Database Houston Museum: Tyrannosaurus|date=October 27, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and products from radio-controlled [[helicopter]] models to a rifle cartridge (the .577 T-Rex) have been named after the dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trextuning.com/index.php|title=Türkiye'nin Gündemi Burada - Trextuning - Gündemle ilgili en son gelişmeleri web sitemizde okumak için Trextuning.com!|website=Türkiye'nin Gündemi Burada - Trextuning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In music, the popular 1970s [[glam rock]] band [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] took their name from the famous dinosaur.

In the ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' comics, fantasy sequences often featured ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. In one story arc, in which Calvin writes a school paper on the ''T. rex'' predator/scavenger debate, he argues that ''T. rex'' was a predator because "They're so much cooler that way." ''T. rex'' is also featured as the protagonist in the long-running [[webcomic]] ''[[Dinosaur Comics]]'' by [[Ryan North]]. Various ''T. rex'' have featured in stories published in the British comic ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]''.

[[Ursula Dubosarsky]]'s picture book, simply called ''Rex'' and illustrated by David Mackintosh, concerns a pet lizard who assumes the proportions of a ''T. rex'' in the imagination of a series of children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/757858.Rex  Retrieved 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pokémon X and Y]]'', there is an evolution family consisting of [[Tyrunt|Tyrunt and Tyrantrum]] both of which are based on ''Tyrannosaurus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelittlenerd.com/pokemon-tyrunt-tyrantrum/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231194101/http://www.thelittlenerd.com/pokemon-tyrunt-tyrantrum/ |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Velma Louise Gaines Hamock''' (May 25, 1910 – October 3, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] funeral home owner in [[Paducah, Kentucky]]. In 1949 she inherited the business, at one time the only African-American owned funeral home in the city, after the death of her husband A. Z. Hamock. She is noted for having kept the mummy of [[Speedy Atkins]], which her husband had preserved in 1928, for more than 40 more years before burial in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1332945.html] "Man to be buried in '91," ''Washington Post'', 16 July 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"66-tear-old corpse to be laid to rest in Paducah," ''Lexington Herald-Leader'', 26 June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TV show to feature Paducah corpse," ''Lexington Herald-Leader'', 4 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15830994.html "Black man who died 66 years ago is finally buried"], ''Jet'', 29 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 people attended the 1994 funeral and burial of Atkins in Maplelawn Cemetery in Paducah.&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4241651.html "Embalmed 'Speedy' Is Laid to Rest - Finally"], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 6 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; As had her husband, Velma Hamock kept Atkins' preserved body in a closet when it was not displayed to tourists.&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times"/&gt; She died in October 2000.

As a missionary bishop, Msgr. Rouchouze resided in [[Valparaíso, Chile]] and in Honolulu; he was responsible for the evangelization efforts of the Picpus Fathers in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and eastern Pacific. His motto was ''Per aspera in astera'' (from hardship to the stars).

Prior to his episcopal ministry, Pope Gregory XVI, on November 27, 1825, created the [[Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands]].  Father [[Alexis Bachelot]] was subsequently appointed its first prefect on December 3, 1825.
