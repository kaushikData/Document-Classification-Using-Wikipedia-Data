The '''Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001''' was an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] to abolish the previous practice in which a debtor’s goods are priced ([[poinding]]) in preparation for the enforced sale of the debtor’s possessions ([[warrant sale]]). The legislation was introduced in 1999 as a [[member's bill]] by [[Tommy Sheridan]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/S1_Bills/Abolition%20of%20Poindings%20and%20Warrant%20Sales%20Bill/b3s2.pdf |title=Text of the Stage 2 Bill |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sole member of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] in the Parliament.

The original draft of the bill proposed that it would have immediate effect, but this was subsequently amended to delay implementation of the bill until 2002, so that alternative means of debt recovery could be devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1058426.stm|title=MSPs abolish warrant sales|date=6 December 2000|accessdate=24 November 2016|publisher=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Executive]] eventually proposed the Debt Arrangement and Attachment Bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1973831.stm|title=Ministers unveil debt proposals |work=BBC News|date=8 May 2002|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Debt Arrangement and Attachment Bill Act 2002 and repealed the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act.

The Debt Arrangement and Attachment Act was criticised by Sheridan for introducing "a new form of warrant sales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/msps-attack-new-debt-recovery-law-1-950593|title=MSPs attack new debt recovery law |work=The Scotsman|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accelerated depreciation''' refers to any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or [[tax]] purposes, [[depreciation|depreciates]] a [[fixed asset]] in such a way that the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset’s life.  For financial accounting purposes, accelerated depreciation is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation  [[expense]] will more accurately represent how much of an asset’s usefulness is being used up each year.  For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation provides a way of deferring [[corporate income taxes]] by reducing [[taxable income]] in current years, in exchange for increased taxable income in future years.  This is a valuable tax incentive that encourages businesses to purchase new assets.   

For [[financial reporting]] purposes, the two most popular methods of accelerated depreciation are the '''double declining balance''' method and the [[Rule of 78s|'''sum-of-the-years’ digits''']] method.{{fact|date=December 2012}}  For tax purposes, the allowable methods of accelerated depreciation depend on the tax law that the taxpayer is subject to.  In the United States, the two currently allowable depreciation methods for tax purposes are both accelerated depreciation methods (ACRS and [[MACRS]]).

==Background==
Companies in many countries pay taxes on [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s: [[revenue]]s minus [[expense]]s. There are various types of expenses, including salaries paid to workers, cost of inputs, and [[amortization]] and [[depreciation]]. Profits for tax purposes will, in most countries, differ from [[accounting profit]]s or [[earnings]].

Under both [[financial accounting]] and [[tax accounting]], companies are not allowed to claim the entire cost of a [[capital asset]] (any asset which can be used for many years) as an expense immediately. They must [[amortize]] the cost of the asset over some period, usually an approximation of the useful life of the asset.  The depreciation basis is the cost incurred by the company in acquiring the asset.  The useful life of the asset is determined by looking at Section 168(e)(3) of the United States Tax Code, and is known as the class life of the property.  An example would be that a railroad track has a useful life of 7 years.  This is not the end of the analysis however, because then it becomes necessary to look at the applicable recovery period of the property.  The applicable recovery period determines the number of years over which the property should be depreciated.  Section 168(e)(1) provides a table for determining the applicable recovery period.  Following our 7 year railroad track, the table states that property with a useful life of more than 4 years but less than 10 years will be treated as 5 year property.  Finally, it is important to determine the applicable convention for depreciation.  Section 168(d)(4) of the U.S. Tax Code gives three different types: half year convention, the mid-month convention, and the midquarter convention.  Conventions determine how much of the depreciation deduction the taxpayer may take the first year.  This prevents taxpayers from claiming a full year's deduction when the asset has only been in service for part of the year.    



Governments generally provide opportunities to defer taxes where there are specific policy reasons to encourage an industry. For example, accelerated depreciation is used in some countries to encourage investment in [[renewable energy]].  Further, governments have increased accelerated depreciation methods in time of economic stress (in particular, the US government passed laws after 9-11 to further accelerate depreciation on capital assets).

==Example== 

As a simple example, a company buys a [[Electrical generator|generator]] that costs $1,000 that is expected to last for 10 years. Under the most simple form of depreciation, the company might allocate $100 of the cost of the generator to its expenses every year, until the $1000 capital expense has been "used up." Under accelerated depreciation, the company may be allowed to allocate $200 of the cost of the generator for five years.

If the company has $200 in profits per year (before consideration of the cost of the generator or any effects of [[debt]] or other factors), and the tax rate is 20%:

a) Normal depreciation: the company claims $100 in depreciation every year and has a [[tax profit]] of $100; it must pay tax of $20 on the $100 gain. Over ten years, $200 in taxes are paid.

b) Accelerated depreciation: the company claims $200 in depreciation for the first five years, and nothing for the last five years. For the first five years, it has no taxable profit and pays no gains tax. For the last five years, the company has a gain of $200, and pays $40 per year in tax, for a total of $200.

To compare these two (simplified) cases, the company pays $200 in taxes in both instances. In the second case, it has deferred taxes to a much later period. The deferral of taxes to a later period is favorable according to the [[time value of money]] principle.

(This example has been simplified for a basic demonstration of how accelerated depreciation works.  It does not factor in an accurate class life, recovery period or account for convention.)

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Aquatic Warbler''' is a multilateral environmental [[memorandum of understanding]] concluded in 2003 under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. This MoU provides the basis for governments, NGO’s and scientists to work together to save the [[aquatic warbler]], Europe’s rarest songbird. The MoU covers 22 range states (Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom). As of August 2012, 16 range states have signed the MoU as well as two cooperating organizations.

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:Minsk Meeting 29-30 April 2003.jpg|thumb|250px|Minsk Meeting 29–30 April 2003]]
A meeting of the range states of the aquatic warbler was held in [[Minsk]], Belarus, from 29 to 30 April 2003, to negotiate and adopt a MoU and action plan for the conservation of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Minsk Declaration: http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/pdf/AW_Declaration_Final_30_04_03_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was co-organized by the CMS Secretariat in cooperation with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection of Belarus, [[BirdLife International]], [[The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)]] and APB-BirdLife Belarus. Representatives from 12 range states were present and the MoU was adopted and entered into effect on 30 April 2003.

Signatories to the Aquatic Warbler MoU: 
* Belarus (30 April 2003)
* Bulgaria (30 April 2003)
* Germany (30 April 2003)
* Hungary (30 April 2003)
* Latvia (30 April 2003)
* Lithuania (30 April 2003)
* Senegal (30 April 2003)
* Spain (30 April 2003)
* United Kingdom (30 April 2003)
* Ukraine (21 May 2003)
* Poland (13 July 2004)
* Belgium (24 November 2005)
* France (14 May 2010)
* Mali (14 May 2010)
* Luxembourg (19 July 2010)
* Switzerland (22 November 2011)

In addition, two organizations signed the MoU:
* CMS Secretariat (30 April 2003)
* BirldLife International (30 April 2003)

== Aim of MoU ==
The MoU aims to safeguard the [[aquatic warbler]] ''(Acrocephalus paludicola)'' a small migratory waterbird that is estimated to have declined sharply at a rate equivalent to 40 per cent in the last 10 years. It reflects the common concern over this dramatic decline and calls for cooperation among national authorities to promote the conservation of the species.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU protects the population of aquatic warblers in all range states. The aquatic warbler is the rarest and the only internationally threatened [[passerine]] bird found in mainland Europe. Apart from a very small remnant population in Western Siberia, its breeding grounds are completely confined to Europe. As of May 2010, its global population of only 10,200-13,800 males is confined to less than 40 sites in only six countries, with four sites supporting over 80% of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/meetings/2nd%20Mtg/Press_Release_AW2.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;  The main threat the aquatic warbler is facing is the loss of habitat due to the decline of traditional, [[extensive agriculture]] and overgrowing of the species’ habitat with reeds and bushes or trees.

== Fundamental components ==
[[File:Map of Signatories to the Aquatic Warbler Memorandum of Understanding.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of signatories to the Aquatic Warbler MoU, as of 15 August 2012]]
All signatories decide to work closely together to improve the conservation status of the aquatic warbler throughout its breeding, migrating and wintering range. To that end they will, individually or collectively:&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Aquatic Warbler Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/pdf/AW_MoU_E_with_Amending_protocol_May_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide strict protection for the aquatic warbler and identify and conserve the wetland habitats essential for its survival
# Subject to the availability of resources, implement in their respective countries the provisions of the Action Plan annexed to the MoU as a basis for conserving all populations of the species
# Assess the implementation of the MoU, including the Action Plan, at regular meetings to be attended by representatives of each signatory and persons or organizations technically qualified in the conservation of the species
# Facilitate the expeditious exchange of scientific, technical and legal information needed to coordinate conservation measures, and cooperate with recognized scientists of international organizations and other range states in order to facilitate their work conducted in relation to the Action Plan
# Provide the CMS Secretariat at least every two years a report on implementation of the MoU in each of the representative countries

The MoU took effect following the fifth signature (30 April 2003) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all to the other signatories.

== Meetings ==
[[File:Second Meeting of Signatories to the Aquatic Warbler Memorandum of Understanding, Biebrza National Park, Poland, 13-15 May 2010.jpg|thumb|380px|Second Meeting of signatories to the Aquatic Warbler MoU, [[Biebrza National Park]], Poland, 13–15 May 2010]]
Meetings of signatories are organized regularly to review the conservation status of the aquatic warbler and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. National reports from the signatories and an overview report prepared by the secretariat are also submitted.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Lower Oder Valley National Park|Nationalpark Unteres Odertal]], [[Criewen]], Germany, 25–27 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Report First Meeting of Signatories: http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/meetings/rpt1/aw1_rpt_anx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting the geographical scope of the MoU was expanded to include Mauritania and Morocco, since these countries seem to be important stop-over sites for the aquatic warbler. Furthermore, the signatories endorsed working further with competent authorities of three countries originally identified as range states – France, the Netherlands and the Russian Federation. The signatories represented at the meeting were Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Senegal, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. France and the Russian Federation, as range states, were also present as well as BirdLife International.

'''The Second Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Biebrza National Park|Biebrza National Park, Poland]], 13–15 May 2010. At the meeting France and Mali added their signatures and became signatories to the MoU. France is especially important, because the entire world population passes through France once or twice a year, when the birds depend on intact refueling stations. Furthermore, the signatories decided to extend the geographical coverage of the MoU to include an additional seven new countries in Europe and Africa (Luxembourg, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal, Slovakia and Switzerland), bringing the range state total to 22. Finally, a new International Species Action Plan for the Aquatic Warbler, prepared by CMS’s partner BirdLife International on behalf of the [[European Union]], was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;International Species Action Plan for the Aquatic Warbler: http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/meetings/2nd%20Mtg/docs/Doc_10_Revised_Int_SAP_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This plan helps to protect the species throughout its range and its breeding populations expand to other sites that had been lost in the past. In addition to giving a detailed account of distribution, biology and conservation status of the bird species, it envisages concrete actions to be taken by the countries. Future project implementation priorities were also discussed, and high among these is the continued search for confirmed wintering sites in sub-[[Sahel]]ian Africa.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. Funding for coordination services for the MoU for 2010-2012 has been secured from the government of Switzerland and the [[RSPB]] (BirdLife International’s partner organization in the UK), with coordination provided by BirdLife through the RSPB and the Belarus BirdLife partner BSPB.

== Action Plan ==
A detailed Action Plan is annexed to the MoU.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan: http://www.cms.int/species/aquatic_warbler/pdf/AW_Action_Plan_Final_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It summarizes the distribution, biology and conservation status of the species, and describes precise actions to be taken by relevant countries. The main objective of the Action Plan is to maintain the aquatic warbler throughout its range and, in medium to long term, promote the expansion of the breeding population to other suitable areas. Actions to be taken by the signatories can be summarized in four categories:
* Legislative measures to ensure the species’ conservation
* Species and habitat protection
* Monitoring and research
* Establishment of a public awareness strategy

In 2007, a BirdLife International team discovered a key site within the aquatic warbler’s wintering grounds in West Africa, which was completely unknown until then. The [[Djoudj National Park]] in northwest Senegal and its surroundings are believed to hold up to a third of the world population.

The Polish BirdLife partner led a major project from 2005-2011, funded largely by the European Union’s [[The LIFE Programme|LIFE Nature programme]], to restore 42,000&amp;nbsp;ha of the aquatic warbler’s [[peatland]] habitat in Poland and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;EU LIFE Programme project: LIFE05 NAT/PL/000101 ([http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&amp;n_proj_id=2926#AD Conserving Acrocephalus paludicola in Poland and Germany])&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s main objective is to establish the population of aquatic warbler in key areas of its range and aims to improve and increase the habitats at the most important sites of the species in Biebrza, Poland and to prevent the extinction of the genetically distinct remnant population in Pomerania, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Video on the project: http://lifevideos.eu/videos/?id=LIFE05_NAT_PL_000101_01_EN_SPECI.mp4&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to raise awareness of authorities, key stakeholders and the local public of the conservation needs of the species and its specific habitat requirements. The project wanted to create 1,500&amp;nbsp;ha of new potential habitat in Pomerania and Biebrza and implement restoration actions on another 1,500&amp;nbsp;ha with the aim of obtaining an increase of 15 per cent in the species population. Measures to be implemented include hydrological management, removal of shrubs and overgrowth from wet meadows and mires and initiation of extensive grazing and considerate mowing of aquatic warbler habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Project Report: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showFile&amp;rep=file&amp;fil=LIFE05_NAT_PL_000101_LAYMAN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The project ended in November 2011 and a report with the major achievements was published. These achievements were:
* Obtained knowledge on the exact habitat requirements by monitoring nine project sites
* Introduction of new management technology, such as a prototype mowing machine
* Active conservation work, such as mowing and introducing extensive grazing by a small herd of Polish [[Konik|Konik horses]] 
* Arranging for financial support, such as attractive packages made available to Polish farmers; under these schemes the farmers are paid to resume extensive management on areas they had previously given up
* Making land available for conservation work
* Ensuring ongoing management in the long term

At the beginning of 2012 some disturbing news about the aquatic warbler population was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquaticwarbler.net/news/2012_07_Lithuania_meeting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201155100/http://www.aquaticwarbler.net/news/2012_07_Lithuania_meeting.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the population was severely affected by the breeding sites in Europe rapidly overgrowing with reeds and the wintering grounds in Africa affected by droughts, therefore causing an unprecedented crash. The latest monitoring results, conducted by The BirdLife International Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team (AWCT), showed decrease of approximately 1/3 in each of the countries where the species breed (Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine). One exception was the sustainably managed areas in the Biebrza National Park in Poland where the population remained stable.

'''Attacks on parachutists''', as defined by the [[law of war]], is when [[Pilot (aircraft)|pilots]], [[aircrew]]s, and [[passenger]]s are attacked while descending by [[parachute]] from disabled [[aircraft]] during [[war]]time. This practice is considered by most militaries around the world to be inhumane, barbaric, and unchivalrous, that it is unnecessary killing (the attacked personnel would eventually become [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] if [[Parachuting|parachuted]] over enemy territory), and that it is contrary to fair play. Attacking parachutists from aircraft in distress is a [[war crime]] under the [[Protocol I]] addition to the [[Geneva Conventions|1949 Geneva Conventions]]. Firing on [[airborne forces]] who are descending by parachute is not prohibited.&lt;ref name=PARACHUTING&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/470 |title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
After [[World War I]], a series of meetings were held at [[The Hague]] in 1922–1923. Based on the testimony of First World War pilots, a commission of jurists attempted to codify this practice with the Hague Rules of Air Warfare. Article 20 prescribed that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When an aircraft has been disabled, the occupants when endeavoring to escape by means of parachute must not be attacked in the course of their descent.&lt;ref name="AIR FORCE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawofwar.org/hague_rules_of_air_warfare.htm |title=The Hague Rules of Air Warfare}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Hague Rules of Air Warfare never came into force. There was no legal prohibition of targeting parachuting enemy airmen before or during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Laws of War: Volume 1: The Customs and Laws of War with Regards to Combatants and Captives |author=Alexander Gillespie |page=56 |date=September 6, 2011 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, as a result of widespread practices and abuses committed during the Second World War, the newly modified and updated versions of the Geneva Conventions came into force providing greater protections to protected persons, but there was still no explicit prohibition on the shooting of parachuting enemy combatants. However, despite this, military manuals around the world issued prohibitions on attacking enemy personnel parachuting from aircraft in distress. Paragraph 30 of the [[United States Army]]'s [[United States Army Field Manuals|Field Manual]] published by the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], on July 18, 1956 (last modified on July 15, 1976), under the title "The Law of Land Warfare", states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
30. Persons Descending by Parachute
The law of war does not prohibit firing upon [[Paratrooper|paratroops]] or other persons who are or appear to be bound upon hostile missions while such persons are descending by parachute. Persons other than those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute from disabled aircraft may not be fired upon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsc.army.mil/gc/files/fm27-10.pdf FM 27-10 The Law of Land Warfare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310112314/http://www.afsc.army.mil/gc/files/fm27-10.pdf |date=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1977, this practice was finally codified in Protocol I in addition to the 1949 Geneva Conventions:&lt;ref name=PARACHUTING /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Article 42 – Occupants of aircraft
:1. No person parachuting from an aircraft in distress shall be made the object of attack during his descent.

:2. Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party, a person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack, unless it is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act.

:3. Airborne troops are not protected by this Article.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First World War==
Targeting parachutists became an issue during the First World War when [[fighter pilot]]s targeted manned enemy [[observation balloons]]. After shooting down a balloon, most pilots refrained from firing at the [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|balloon observers]] as they escaped by parachute, because they felt it was inhumane and unchivalrous. The extension of this courtesy to enemy pilots began towards the end of the First World War when parachutes were provided for pilots of [[fixed-wing aircraft]], but it was again widely perceived that once aircrew were forced to bail out of a damaged aircraft, presuming they did not offer any further resistance, they were considered to have been honorably defeated in battle and should not be "finished off".

By July 1918, [[Luftstreitkräfte|German]] and [[Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops|Austro-Hungarian Air Force]] parachute escapes had become routine. The Heinecke chutes that German and Austro-Hungarian pilots received were not perfect and sometimes failed to operate safely. Some were destroyed by fire before they could open, and occasionally pilots faced the peril of being shot at by Allied fighters. British [[flying ace]] [[James Ira Thomas Jones|James Ira T. Jones]] had no compunction in doing this. "My habit of attacking [[List of terms used for Germans#Hun|Huns]] dangling from parachutes led to many arguments in the mess," he said. "Some officers of the Eton and Sandhurst type, thought it 'unsportsmanlike'. Never having been to a public school, I was unhampered by such considerations of 'form'. I just pointed out that there was a bloody war on, and that I intended to avenge my pals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Aces of the RAF in the Battle of Britain |date=March 2008 |page=102 |author=Philip Kaplan |publisher=[[Overlook Hardcover]] |isbn=1-84415-587-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

===War in Europe===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2006-0123, Adolf Galland.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] [[Adolf Galland]] strongly rejected the idea of shooting enemy airmen in their parachutes, even if over their own territory, as he felt it was equal to murder.]]

At the beginning of World War II, there was a strong sense of chivalry between the British [[RAF]] and German [[Luftwaffe]] pilots. They regarded themselves as "knights of the air" and shooting parachuting enemy aircrew was contrary to their code of honour. The question of shooting an enemy pilot parachuting over his own territory aroused bitter debate on both sides. On August 31, 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]], RAF [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]] dined with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] at [[Chequers]]. After dinner, they discussed the morality of shooting parachuting Luftwaffe pilots. Dowding suggested that German pilots were perfectly entitled to shoot RAF pilots parachuting over Britain as they were still potential [[combatants]] (i.e., piloting new aircraft to conduct another military mission) while RAF pilots should refrain from firing at German pilots as they were [[Hors de combat|out of combat]] and would eventually become prisoners of war once they landed on British soil. Churchill was appalled by this suggestion, arguing that shooting a parachuting pilot "was like drowning a sailor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winston S. Churchill, Vol. 6: Finest Hour, 1939–1941 |author=Martin Gilbert |page=766 |date=September 1983 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |isbn=0-395-34402-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/LondonGazette/37719.pdf The London Gazeete, number 158-160]&lt;/ref&gt; On the German side, Luftwaffe commander-in-chief [[Hermann Göring]] asked Luftwaffe [[fighter ace]] [[Adolf Galland]] about what he thought about shooting enemy pilots while in their parachutes, even over their own territory. Galland replied that, "I should regard it as murder, Herr Reichsmarschall. I should do everything in my power to disobey such an order". Goering—who had been a fighter ace himself during World War I—said, "That is just the reply I had expected from you, Galland".&lt;ref&gt;Galland 2005, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such sentiments, there were a number of incidents where the shooting of parachuting enemy aviators occurred. On September 1, 1939, in the Modlin area, during the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], pilots of the [[Pursuit Brigade|Polish Pursuit Brigade]] encountered a group of 40 German bombers escorted by 20 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] fighters. During combat, Lt. [[Aleksander Gabszewicz]] was forced to bail out of his aircraft. While in his parachute, Gabszewicz was strafed by a Bf 110. Second Lt. Tadeusz Sawicz, flying nearby, attacked the German plane and another Polish pilot, Wladyslaw Kiedrzynski, spiraled around the defenseless Gabszewicz until he reached the ground. On September 2, Sec. Lt. Jan Dzwonek, along with eight other Polish pilots, attacked a couple of German fighters approaching their direction. In the battle, Dzwonek's plane was shot down and he was forced to bail out. Hanging in his parachute, he was attacked twice by a Bf 110. Apparently, the Luftwaffe pilot was so busy attacking the defenseless Dzwonek that Corporal Jan Malinowski, flying an obsolete [[PZL P.7|P.7 fighter]], downed the German plane. Dzwonek later recounted the story:

{{quote|I was hanging in the chute at about 2000 meters altitude when I noticed tracers passing near to me. They missed, but this pirate of the Third Reich did not give up and attacked me again. This second time the wave of bullets also spared me. Shells passed to the left and right of my body. The German didn't get a third chance to kill me because my friend Jan Malinowski from 162nd Escadrille (flew on P.7a!) successfully attacked the German. On the first attack he set the right engine of the Bf 110 on fire, and on the second pass killed the pilot. The aircraft fell, crashing in pieces.

During my landing I damaged my backbone. I was transported to the hospital in Pabianice, where I heard someone say I had no chance to see next sunrise. I did go into a coma for 20 hours. When I awakened, the doctor told me, that in the same hospital was a Bf 110 pilot – the one I downed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elknet.pl/acestory/dzwon/dzwon.htm |title=Jan Dzwonek – Within an Ace of Death. |access-date=2013-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811191843/http://www.elknet.pl/acestory/dzwon/dzwon.htm |archive-date=2014-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Battle of Britain, [[Non-British personnel in the RAF during the Battle of Britain|Polish and Czech pilots serving in the RAF]] sometimes shot at Luftwaffe pilots parachuting over Britain. Many Germans charged that this was regular practice by the Poles and the Czechs, but there was little hard evidence of it. The leading historian of the Polish Air Force, Adam Zamoyski, conceded that "it is true that some pilots still finished off parachuting Germans by flying directly over them; the [[slipstream]] would cause the parachute to [[Malfunction (parachuting)|cannon]] and the man would fall into the ground like a stone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=194 |title=Fighter Boys: The Battle of Britain, 1940 |author=Patrick Bishop |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=July 27, 2004 |isbn=0-14-200466-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1942, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) arrived in Britain and carried out air raids over German-occupied Europe. There are verified accounts of German fighter pilots stopping their attacks to allow bomber crews to parachute from mortally stricken bombers. Nevertheless, the air war was bloody business and the objective of both sides was to wipe out the other. Some USAAF fighter pilots claimed they received unwritten orders from their officers to shoot enemy airmen parachuting over their own territory as they would rejoin their own units upon landing and fly in the air again to kill more Americans. Virgil Meroney of the [[487th Fighter Squadron]] never shot a German pilot in his parachute, although on the other hand, he understood the mean realities of warfare and had no problem about killing an enemy aviator, regardless of whether or not he was helpless.

On March 8, 1944, Meroney and his Blue Flight were at the rear of [[352d Fighter Group]] as it reached the end of its escort leg. The group turned to leave as they crossed the Dutch border into Germany near [[Meppen]]. "Three Me 109s came out of the sun with a lot of speed and made a 90-degree attack on the rear bombers, breaking away in rolls," Meroney recalled. "I called them in and went after the lead two as they stayed together, the third having broken in a different direction." Meroney drove his [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] along with his squadron to attack the Germans who were trying to shoot down the USAAF [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] [[heavy bombers]] and fired at the German planes. When the German pilot realized that his Bf 109 was badly in flames, he jumped out of his plane and pulled out his parachute. Amazingly, Meroney and his squadron didn't fire at the German pilot who was parachuting safely back to earth. This might have been because he and his flight were low on fuel and there was no knowing if there were other enemy aircraft in the area. Indeed, that more pilots and aircrew were not shot in their parachutes was probably due at least in part to the nature of aerial combat. The fights were a confusing whirl and a pilot who concentrated too long and hard on killing a man in a parachute could easily fall prey himself and end up, ironically, in the position of being shot up while in his parachute. Not molesting enemy pilots in their parachutes was a practical matter as well as a chivalrous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Group: The 352nd "Blue-Nosed Bastards" in World War II |date=October 1, 2012 |pages=125–126 |author=Jay A. Stout |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 1943, a B-17 bomber piloted by 2nd Lt. Charles 'Charlie' Brown, after a successful bombing run on the German city of [[Bremen]], [[Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler incident|was attacked by dozens of German fighters]]. Brown's bomber was seriously damaged, most of his crewmen were wounded, and his [[tail gunner]] was killed. Luftwaffe pilot and ace Franz Stigler then approached the crippled bomber. He was able to see the injured and incapacitated crew. To the American pilot's surprise, Stigler did not open fire on the crippled bomber. Remembering the words of one of his commanding officers from the [[Jagdgeschwader 27]], [[Gustav Rödel]], during his time fighting in North Africa, "You are fighter pilots first, last, always. If I ever hear of any of you shooting at someone in a parachute, I'll shoot you myself." Stigler later commented, "To me, it was just like they were in a parachute. I saw them and I couldn't shoot them down." Twice, Stigler tried to get Brown to land his plane at a German airfield and surrender, or divert to nearby neutral Sweden, where he and his crew would receive medical treatment but be interned and sit out the remainder of the war. Brown refused and flew on. Stigler then flew near Brown's plane, escorting it until they reached the [[North Sea]] and departed with a salute.

Still, both German and American pilots did shoot enemy airmen in their parachutes, albeit infrequently. Richard "Bud" Peterson, a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] pilot with the [[357th Fighter Group]] based out of [[Leiston]], agreed that "normally, ''nobody'', including the Germans, would be shooting anybody in a parachute. It just wasn't done. I mean, there's no challenge with shooting a guy in a parachute, for God's sake." However, on one mission he saw an Bf 109 systematically firing at American B-17 bomber crews as they descended in their parachutes. After Peterson forced the offending German pilot to bail out, he killed him as he was descending. He recalled that some of his unit were nervous that this would invite a retaliatory response from the Luftwaffe. "But they had to be there to know what I was seeing," Peterson said. "Those guys were helpless, the bomber crews going down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Group: The 352nd "Blue-Nosed Bastards" in World War II |date=June 2004 |pages=126–127 |author=Jay A. Stout |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8LVlYJ5eJU|title=WWII Brutality Richard 'Bud' Peterson P-51 Ace Interview|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several German sources (examples below) claim that American pilots frequently practised shooting at parachutes, especially closer to the end of the war when Germany had more planes than pilots:
* {{quote|Gefr. Hans Thran bailed out successfully but, according to ground witnesses, was shot in his parachute by a P-47 pilot while only sixty feet above the ground. German pilots had a fear of being killed while hanging helpless in their parachutes, and every such report was investigated and carefully documented. These incidents were especially common during the summer and autumn of 1944.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hofmann gave this advice to his pilots: If you ever have to bail out, remember that the Americans are known to shoot us in our parachutes. Therefore, free-fall to about 200 meters; only that way can you be sure of survival. I have seen one of my best friends torn to bits by enemy cannon fire while still hanging in his chute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=JG26: Top Guns of the Luftwaffe|pages=249|author=Donald Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* {{quote|Shooting jet pilots in their parachutes was justified by some as a necessary evil. It was believed that these pilots were a special elite and that training them to fly such aircraft was a protracted and expensive effort. This logic held that killing such men whenever possible could help shorten the war. For their part, many German pilots were so concerned about being attacked in their parachutes that they waited until they were at low altitude before pulling their ripcords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Group: The 352nd "Blue-Nosed Bastards" in World War II |date=October 1, 2012 |page=128 |author=Jay A. Stout |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* {{quote|On 4 April, Sinner led seven other Me 262s off from Rechlin. Emerging from the clouds shortly after take-off, the flight was bounced by P-51 fighters of the 339th Fighter Group, USAAF. In the ensuing combat "Rudi" Sinner's aircraft was hit. With his face and hands badly burned, he bailed out at low level. His parachute deployed at the last moment, but did not completely fill, and he was hanging by just the left strap when he hit the ground heavily in a ploughed field and dragged into a barbed wire fence. He reported that the P-51s then strafed him, but he feigned death and, as the P-51s departed, made his way to the safety of a deep furrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luftwaffe.cz/sinner.html|title=Rudolf Sinner}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*{{quote|With a little course correction, he is in my crosshairs and I fire: the Mustang shows a white trail and makes a turn downwards. But at the same time, the pilot in the other Mustang has me in his crosshairs and fires. I notice that my bird has become uncontrollable, jettison the canopy, unbuckle and get out. To my horror. I notice that we are really, very low – will my chute open in time? I immediately pull my ripcord – the chute opens – I am just over some woods, see a Mustang flying towards me, it shoots at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have arrived in the tops of some trees and finally hang suspended between the branches. I turn the buckle on my harness, leave my chute in the trees and climb down using some branches. Already the first people arrive at the scene. They have seen the dogfight and have also seen that the Mustang fired at me in my chute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mission 376: Battle Over the Reich 28 May 1944|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaen Kwock Lee was a B-17 waist gunner with the 483rd Bomb Group, a [[15th Air Force]] unit, when his aircraft was shot down by German [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262s]] on March 22, 1945. He recalled that he and his crew bailed out in their parachutes and while descending back to earth, they were attacked by German Me 262s:

{{quote|Three fighters came after me. The first one missed and the second also missed. When the third one came by I was too low for him to shoot at me. When I hit the ground a burst of machine gun was fired at me. I hit the dirt fast. Then German soldiers came and drove me on a motorcycle to a building. On the way we passed a row of dead American airmen, about twelve of them covered with blood soaked parachutes. I knew they were shot dead on the way down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Group: The 352nd "Blue-Nosed Bastards" in World War II |date=October 1, 2012 |page=127 |author=Jay A. Stout |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While some American aviators shot enemy airmen in parachutes, the vast majority of USAAF fighter pilots detested the practice as they could not reconcile themselves to the notion of killing helpless enemy airmen. They insisted that they were trying to destroy aircraft rather than pilots. If an enemy airman perished with his aircraft, it was simply the brutal nature of war. But shooting him while he was in his parachute was quite another matter that few of them could stomach, even if he stood a good chance of flying in the air again. USAAF pilot Stanley Miles shared his experience on May 13, 1944, when the 352nd encountered a massive formation of enemy fighters. After getting involved in a [[dogfight]] with one of the German planes for a while, Miles shot down the plane, which caused the German pilot to bail out in his parachute. "I had my gun camera running," he recalled, "so I got some good shots of the tracers hitting the plane and the pilot jumping out. My wing-man was still with me, so I eased around, came back and got some nice film footage of the German pilot in his chute." Miles considered shooting the enemy pilot as he drifted helplessly back to earth. It was a topic that he and his squadron units had considered in earnest. "One school of thought was that if you didn't shoot the guy, he'd land and be right back up fighting you the next day. I couldn't do it, however, and just took the film footage of him." Most American pilots used [[gun cameras]] to ensure they had adequate proof of their victories. Robert O' Nan of the 487th Fighter Squadron did this on April 10, 1944, after forcing an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] pilot to abandon his aircraft: "I followed the plane down where it crashed, exploded, and burned up, in the middle of a plowed field. I took pictures of this. I also got pictures of the pilot dangling in his chute." None of them were considering shooting German pilots hanging in their parachutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighter Group: The 352nd "Blue-Nosed Bastards" in World War II |date=October 1, 2012 |pages=128–129 |author=Jay A.

[[General of the Army (United States)|U.S. General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] in Europe, felt compelled to specifically forbid the practice. In the directive issued to [[Major general (United States)|U.S. Major General]] [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]], commander of the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe]], and British Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder]] (or [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Harris]] according to ''D-Day Bombers: The Veterans' Story: RAF Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force Support to the Normandy Invasion 1944'' by Stephen Darlow) on June 2, 1944, in a preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], he wrote:

{{quote|During current and future intensive air operations, Allied airmen are required by their duty to fly and fight continuously over enemy and occupied territories of Europe. The enemy who is fearful of these attacks because of their devastating effect of his transport and the morale of his troops, is endeavouring to prevent them by propaganda designed to prove to the peoples of Europe that Allied airmen are wilfully shooting up harmless civilians in the course of their fighter sweeps and tactical bombing attacks. It is essential to remember that much of the air fighting will take place over the heads of friendly people, who have endured the savagery of the Germans for years. Humanity and the principles for which we fight demand from our pilots scrupulous care to avoid any but military targets. The Air Forces of the United Nations are privileged to be the spearhead of the forces fighting for freedom and the herald to the oppressed peoples of Europe of our approach. Be careful that nothing is done to betray this trust or to prejudice our good name in the eyes of our friends still dominated by Nazi tyranny. I request that those instructions be brought to the attention of every member of aircrews fighting over Europe. I would add that similar considerations apply to '''enemy airmen compelled to escape by parachute. Such personnel are not legitimate military targets, and may not be deliberately attacked.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=D-Day Bombers: The Veterans' Story: RAF Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force Support to the Normandy Invasion 1944 |date=June 2004 |page=271 |author=Stephen Darlow |publisher=Grub Street the Basement}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were episodes of shooting parachuting aircrew in the Mediterranean theater: on October 2, 1942, Captain Livio Ceccotti of the [[Regia Aeronautica]] was engaged by five Allied fighters, reportedly [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], and after a dogfight in which two Spitfires were reportedly downed by him he was hit and forced to bail out from his [[Macchi C.202]] fighter; as he was descending, he was reportedly strafed and killed by the surviving three fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beretta|first1=Davide|title=Batterie semoventi, alzo zero : quelli di El Alamein|date=1997|publisher=Mursia|location=Milano|isbn=8842521795|page=190}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific War===
The Japanese gained a bad reputation among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the [[Pacific War]] for shooting enemy airmen dangling in their parachutes. This was because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable and to them, bailed-out enemy pilots were considered to have surrendered. The first confirmed case was over the Chinese city of [[Nanking]] on September 19, 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when a Chinese pilot of the Boeing 281 (export version of the [[Boeing P-26 Peashooter|P-26]]) bailed out in his parachute after being targeted by [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJNAS]] aircraft. Hanging in his parachute, he was killed after being shot by Japanese pilots. Pilots from both the IJNAS and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|IJAAS]] did this routinely throughout the war.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} As a result, Chinese and Russian volunteer pilots delayed opening their parachutes to avoid being strafed. Even after a safe parachute descent, the Japanese would still go after them. In July 1938, one Russian volunteer, Valentin Dudonov, bailed out in his parachute and landed on a sand bank in Lake Poyang after a collision with an IJNAS [[Mitsubishi A5M|A5M]] aircraft. Another A5M aircraft came and strafed him on the sand bank. Dudonov had to jump and hide under water in the lake to avoid being attacked.

On December 23, 1941, 12 [[P-40]] pilots of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG) [[Flying Tigers]] intercepted 54 Japanese bombers escorted by 20 pursuit planes, who were [[Bombing of Rangoon (1941–1942)|bombing the city of Rangoon]] in [[Burma]]. During the battle, the AVG downed only five Japanese bombers with the loss of two P-40 pilots. P-40 pilot Paul J. Greene's plane was badly damaged which forced him to bail out in his parachute. He was strafed by Japanese fighters while descending to earth but managed to survive. "You want to see my 'chute," he told [[Daily Express]] [[war correspondent]] O.D. Gallagher. "It's got more holes in it than the nose of a watering-can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William D. Pawley: The Extraordinary Life of the Adventurer, Entrepreneur, and Diplomat Who Cofounded the Flying Tigers |date=March 2012 |page=101 |author=Anthony R. Carrozza |publisher=Potomac Books Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 1942, the AVG attacked Japanese bombers and fighters who resumed carrying out bombing raids on Rangoon. The AVG shot down 21, suffering only a single loss of a pilot named [[Bert Christman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan at War: An Encyclopedia |date=January 8, 2013 |page=43 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dogfight, Christman's plane was damaged and he was forced to bail out. While parachuting over the [[rice paddies]] south of Rangoon, he was killed after being attacked by three IJAAS [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Col. C.L. Chennault and Flying Tigers |year=2007 |page=142 |author=BEN SHE.YI MING |publisher=Intercontinental Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Christman was buried the next day at the church of Edward The Martyr in Rangoon. Christman's remains were returned to his birthplace of [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], after the war, where he was buried on February 4, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warbirdforum.com/scorchy3.htm|title=Remembering Bert Christman (part 3)|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, as part of the Japanese [[Battle of Midway|Midway operation]], the Japanese [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|attacked the Aleutian islands]], off the south coast of [[Alaska]].  Tadayoshi Koga, a 19-year-old flight [[petty officer first class]], was launched from the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō|Japanese aircraft carrier ''Ryūjō'']] as part of the June 4 raid. Koga was part of a three-plane section. His [[Wingman|wingmen]] were Chief Petty Officer Makoto Endo and Petty Officer Tsuguo Shikada. Koga and his comrades attacked Dutch Harbor, shooting down an American [[PBY Catalina|PBY-5A Catalina flying boat]] piloted by Bud Mitchell and [[strafing]] its survivors in the water. Three successive attacks killed the PBY's crew. [[Akutan Zero|Koga was then killed when his damaged aircraft crash-landed]] on the island of [[Akutan Island|Akutan]].

During the [[Malayan Campaign]] in 1942, Japanese pilots often shot British, Commonwealth, and Dutch airmen hanging in their parachutes. Australian pilot Herb Plenty witnessed a Dutch [[Brewster Aeronautical Corporation|Brewster]] aircraft being shot down by Japanese fighters and the pilot bailed out in his parachute on January 17, 1942, near Bilton Island, some miles of [[Singapore]]. He also said that while most Japanese fighters were heading back to their own bases, two of them, however, came back and shot the parachuting Dutch pilot:

{{quote|But two Japanese pilots, in a parting gesture of hate, dived towards the descending parachute and poured long bursts of gunfire at the Brewster pilot swinging helplessly in the canopy rigging. A concerted and immediate growl of rage rose from most of us, conveying our feelings that the Japanese pilots had just perpetrated an act amounting to unfair tactics, treachery, and an outrageous course of conduct. Previously, among British and German pilots, an unwritten code of honour — chivalry, if you like — assumed that pilots descending by parachute should not be shot at by opposing aircraft. The Japanese served notice that they held no such gentlemanly opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buffaloes Over Singapore: RAF, RAAF, RNZAF and Dutch Brewster Fighters in Action Over Malaya and the East Indies 1941–1942 |year=2003 |page=139 |author=Brian Cull |publisher=[[Grub Street Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On March 31, 1943, a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of USAAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] bombers sent to destroy a bridge at [[Pyinmana]], Burma, were attacked by Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighters. One B-24 aircraft was shot down and its occupants, including 2nd Lt [[Owen J. Baggett]], bailed out. While the downed B-24 crew members were descending, they were machine gunned by Japanese fighters. Two of the crewmen were killed and Baggett was wounded in the arm. He then played dead in his harness, hoping the Japanese would leave him alone. One Japanese plane, however, circled and approached very close to Baggett to make sure he was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Owen Baggett, 85: friend of many, good drummer, one heck of a WWII tale |url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/obituaries/owen-baggett-85-friend-of-many-good-drummer-one |website=ABIL |accessdate=2015-11-04 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baggett raised his [[M1911 pistol]] and fired four shots into the cockpit, hitting the pilot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Owen John Baggett's Obituary on|url = http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanantonio/obituary.aspx?n=owen-john-baggett&amp;pid=88867663|website = Express-News|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zero stalled and crashed.

On September 15, 1943, seven B-24s of the [[308th Armament Systems Group|308's]] 373rd Squadron based at [[Yangkai Airfield]] were dispatched to attack a [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] cement plant in [[Haiphong]], a major port on the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], that had just been turned over to the Japanese{{snd}} though not without resistance{{snd}} from [[Governor-General of French Indochina]], [[Jean Decoux]]. Two B-24s, however, broke down while attempting to take off from Yangkai Airfield so the five remaining planes continued the mission. When the five B-24s reached Haiphong, they were attacked by Japanese fighters. One plane went down, forcing the other planes to abandon the mission as they were continuously attacked. Two more planes went down and forced the aircrews to bail out. The Japanese pilots then went after one of the B-24 plane's parachutists and fired at them while they were descending to the ground, killing three and wounding three others. The other two B-24 planes escaped severe damage and returned to Yangkai Airfield (one plane, however, crashed at the airfield, killing the entire crew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-in-cbi.com/308th_web/msn_19p1.htm|title=The Tragedy of Mission 19|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-in-cbi.com/308th_web/msn_19p2.htm|title=The Tragedy of Mission 19, p 2|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-in-cbi.com/308th_web/msn_19p3.htm|title=The Tragedy of Mission 19, p 3|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-in-cbi.com/308th_web/msn_19p4.htm|title=The Tragedy of Mission 19, p 4|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-in-cbi.com/308th_web/msn_19p5.htm|title=The Tragedy of Mission 19, p 5|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1945, an American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber was flying with a dozen other aircraft after bombing Tachiaral Air Base in southwestern Japan, beginning the return flight to [[Guam]]. Kinzou Kasuya, a 19-year-old Japanese pilot flying one of the Japanese fighters in pursuit of the Americans, rammed his aircraft into the fuselage of the B-29, destroying both planes. No one knows for certain how many Americans were in the B-29 as its crew had been hastily assembled on Guam. Villagers in Japan who witnessed the collision in the air saw about a dozen parachutes blossom. One of the Americans died when the cords of his parachute were severed by another Japanese plane. A second was alive when he reached the ground. He shot all but his last bullet at the villagers coming toward him, then used the last on himself. The other nine B-29 airmen who were captured by the Japanese after landing were subjected to [[vivisection]] at the [[Kyushu University|Kyushu Imperial University]]. Professor [[Ishiyama Fukujirō]] and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early-June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vspa.com/k9/war-crimes.htm|title = K-9 MWD: VSPA.com K-9: Japanese War Crimes.|publisher = |accessdate = 21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel responsible for the deaths of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the [[Yokohama War Crimes Trials]] following World War II. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Takai and Sakaida (2001), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syrian Civil War==
In September 2015, Russia [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|conducted military operations]] within Syria in support of the Syrian government, bombing areas held by rebel groups, including the [[Syrian Turkmen Brigades]], which operate close to the [[Syria–Turkey border]]. On November 24, 2015, a [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown|Russian Su-24 attack jet was shot down]] by a Turkish F-16C, and the two pilots [[Ejection seat|ejected]] within Syrian territory controlled by Turkmen rebels. A commander of the Syrian Turkmen Brigades told [[Reuters]] that his forces opened fire on a pilot parachuting from the downed aircraft while attempting to land in non-rebel territory, and the group uploaded an image of rebel soldiers holding flaps of a [[NPP Zvezda K-36]] ejection seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-34907863|title = Turkey 'shoot down warplane on Syria border'|publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34913173|title = Turkey downing of Russia jet 'stab in the back' – Putin|publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian RIA later reported after retrieval that one of the pilots was killed by gunfire.

The '''Bank of Canada Act''' is a statute that sets out the governance structure and powers of the Bank of Canada, which was created in 1934 as Canada's central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bank-of-canada-act/|title=Bank of Canada Act|first=Ian M.|last=Drummond|date=|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1934, Canada had no central bank and fragmented control of the banking system.

The [[Canadian Bankers Association]] took the role of regulating the bank system since 1891 and the [[Bank of Montreal]] was the government's banker.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

It was initially a private bank and became a [[government-owned corporation]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/about/who-we-are/history/|title=The Bank's History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendments to the act allowed the Bank of Canada to divide the capital of the bank into one hundred thousand shares of a value of fifty dollars each, which were issued to the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] to be held on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/act_loi_boc_bdc.pdf |title= BANK OF CANADA ACT | publisher = Bank of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank of Canada is given considerable independence in the conduct of its business through provisions in the Act which set out its powers as permissive ("may") rather than instructive ("shall"), and through a provision that makes it extremely difficult to remove its governor during his or her seven-year term.

The Act requires all [[banknotes of the Canadian dollar]] to be approved by the Minister of Finance for "form and material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-2/FullText.html|title=Bank of Canada Act|publisher=Department of Justice|date=19 June 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- section 25, clause 4 --&gt;

The '''Centre for European Policy''' (German: ''cep | Centrum für Europäische Politik'' &lt;ref name="cep | Centrum für Europäische Politik"&gt;[http://www.cep.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;) (cep) is a [[Germany|German]] [[think tank]] whose task it is to evaluate the [[European Union|European Union’s]] draft laws and legislation on the basis of [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] free market criteria. Established in 2006 under the umbrella of the [[Stiftung Ordnungspolitik]] foundation, the cep is based in [[Freiburg]].&lt;ref name="cep in brief"&gt;[http://www.cep.eu/en/cep/brief.html].&lt;/ref&gt; It is headed by [[:de:Lüder Gerken|Lüder Gerken]], chairman of the executive board of the Stiftung Ordnungspolitik and the Friedrich-August-von-Hayek Foundation. Members of the board of trustees include [[Roman Herzog]], [[Leszek Balcerowicz]], [[Frits Bolkestein]], [[Udo Di Fabio]], [[Jürgen Stark]], Holger Steltzner and [[Hans Tietmeyer]].&lt;ref name="Board of Trustees"&gt;[http://www.cep.eu/en/cep/organisational-chart.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

cep works at the interface between science, politics and the public, and its aim is to consolidate, at [[European Union|EU]] level, policy which orients itself towards freedom and a free market economy while reducing regulation and red-tape to a minimum. As a centre of expertise, cep builds a bridge between EU politics and public awareness of EU politics in Germany. Through dialogue with academics, political decision-makers, the media and the public, cep develops strategies and concepts for the economic policy of the EU, monitors the EU’s most current political projects in a constructive and independent manner, and creates transparency and awareness for European policy and its impact on Germany.

cep endeavours to inform the public about developments at EU level and the impact of EU policy, at the same time proposing concrete options for action. In addition, cep produces expert reports and analyses and advises politicians from all parties on EU economic policies. The academic foundation of the work are ordoliberal free market principles.

The foundation strives to maintain and further develop the ordoliberal tradition of the [[Freiburg School|Freiburg School of Economics]]. This school of thought was founded by [[Walter Eucken]], substantially refined by [[Friedrich August von Hayek]] and put into political practice by [[Ludwig Erhard]], the Minister for Economic Affairs who helped ignite the economic miracle in post-war Germany.

The foundation drafts realizable policy options and advocates public discussion of ordoliberal concepts and ideas. To this end, it regularly organises lectures and panel discussion with well-known politicians, scientists and economists such as Angela Merkel, Günter Oettinger, Wolfgang Schäuble, Jürgen Stark and Jens Weidmann.&lt;ref name="Events"&gt;[http://www.cep.eu/en/events.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The payment of '''commission''' as [[remuneration]] for services rendered or products sold is a common way to reward [[sales|sales people]]. Payments often are calculated on the basis of a [[percentage]] of the goods sold, a way for firms to solve the [[principal–agent problem]] by attempting to realign employees' interests with those of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McConnell |first1=Campbell R. |last2=Brue |first2=Stanley L. |year=2008 |title=Economics |edition=17th |location=New York, NY |publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin |isbn=978-0-07-329392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales personnel are thus paid, in part or entirely, on the basis of products or services successfully sold rather than being paid by the hour, by attempted sales, or by any other measure. 

Although many types of commission systems exist, a common form is known as [[on-target earnings]] in which commission rates are based on the achievement of specific targets that have been agreed upon between management and the salesperson. Commissions are intended to create a strong incentive for employees to invest maximum effort into their work. 

One of the most common means of attempting to align principal and agent interests is to design a contract with incentives that track agent performance. The principal-agent theory provides an explanation for the dissimilarities across the marketing firms in the types of compensation plans used by them, such as fixed salary, straight commission or a combination of
both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madhani |first=P. M. |year=2009 |title=Sales Employees Compensation: An Optimal Balance Between Fixed and Variable Pay |journal=[[Compensation &amp; Benefits Review]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a firm embracing a commission structure may not involve employees, but may solely establish themselves using independent contractors. An example in the US could be a [[real estate agent]].

A commission is not offered at most entities that receive donations or gifts. This is likely against the will of most donors. However, it is commonly argued that this would increase the motivation and efficiency of those requesting donations.

Industries, where a commission is commonly paid include [[car dealership|car sales]], property sales, [[insurance broker|insurance broking]], and many other sales jobs. In the United States, a [[real estate broker]] who successfully sells property might collect a commission of 6% of the sale price, but one who makes no sales will collect no compensation whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=15 April 2016|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|title=Commissions of 6 percent for home sales once were the norm. That's changing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/commissions-of-6-percent-for-home-sales-are-the-norm-but-that-is-changing/2016/04/13/91bb758c-fb55-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|first=Michele|last=Lerner}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal implications==

In 2011, [[California]] Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law AB 1396 amending the California Labor Code requiring all employers who pay commissions to enter into written contracts with their employees regarding how commissions will be earned, computed and paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buchalter.com/bt/images/stories/Client_Alerts/l&amp;e%20law%202012.pdf |title=Labor &amp; Employment Law: Looking Forward to 2012 |publisher=Buchalter Nemer |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law, effective on 1 January 2013, further states that commission excludes "short-term productivity bonuses such as those paid to retail clerks" and "bonus and profit-sharing plans, unless there has been an offer by the employer to pay a fixed percentage of sales or profits as compensation for work to be performed."{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==UK==

In the [[financial services]] industry in the UK, rules set out in the Retail Distribution Review of December 31, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/about/what/rdr/index.shtml|title=Retail Distribution Review|date=February 17, 2009|access-date=January 13, 2015|publisher=[[Financial Services Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; mean that an [[Independent Financial Adviser]] can not take commission in the management of their client's wealth. As set out by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/firm-guides/guide-financial-advisers/rdr-adviser-charging|title=Retail Distribution Review: Adviser Charging|date=September 12, 2014|access-date=January 13, 2015|publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; advisers must now agree an upfront charging structure in advance to a client before advice is given.

For customers who do not want to pay a separate upfront fee, there is an option to have payment of the charges deducted from the investment held by the product provider. These new measures have been applauded by many, particularly in the financial services industry. This has led to changes in the direct to consumer, non-advised sector, with some companies now charging upfront fees to customers for financial products rather than taking commission on policies and investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bestpricefs.co.uk/life-insurance/compare-life-insurance|title=Compare Life Insurance: Commission-Free versus Commission-Based|date=May 12, 2014|access-date=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4080">The '''Conscience Fund''' is one of three gift funds maintained by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and is used for voluntary contributions from people who have stolen from or defrauded the [[United States Government]].&lt;ref name="Conscience Fund"&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Conscience Fund' at New High | pages = A20 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date = March 18, 1987 | first = Warren | last = Weaver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund was created in 1811 and received US$5 during its first year and over US$5.7million during its first 175 years.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal |title=American Notes GUILT |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 30, 1987 |volume=129 |pages=27 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963866,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund's name comes from a letter sent with a US$1500 check for previously misappropriated funds saying, "Suppose we call this a contribution to the conscience fund and get it announced in the newspapers, and perhaps we will get some more".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Conscience Fund: Many Thousands Contributed&amp;mdash;Some Peculiar Cases | pages = 3 |work=The New York Times | date = August 5, 1884 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1884/08/05/archives/the-conscience-fund-many-thousands-contributedsome-peculiar-cases.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donations given to the Conscience Fund vary in size and reason. A 9&amp;nbsp;[[Cent (United States coin)|cent]] donation was made by a person from [[Massachusetts]] who had reused a 3&amp;nbsp;cent [[postage stamp]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; while a person from [[Jersey City]] sent US$40,000 in several installments for US$8,000 he had previously taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pays Government Fourfold | pages = 6 | work=The New York Times | date = July 6, 1908 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1908/06/13/archives/pays-government-fourfold-conscience-bothered-man-who-took-8000-from.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another donor sent handmade quilts in an effort to settle her tax bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Guilt-Stricken Pay Up to IRS 'Conscience Fund' Gets Cash, Quilts | pages = 1A | publisher = ''The Cincinnati Post'' | date = January 26, 1996 | first=Rick | last = Van Sant }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most gifts to the Conscience Fund are from anonymous donors.&lt;ref name="Conscience Fund"/&gt; Others are forwarded by clergy who have received [[Deathbed conversion|deathbed confessions]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;  The sincerity of some donors' repentance can be uncertain, as demonstrated by a received letter reading,
"Dear Internal Revenue Service, I have not been able to sleep at night because I cheated on last year's income tax. Enclosed find a cashier's check for $1,000. If I still can't sleep, I'll send you the balance."&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;

Due to the fund's association with ill-gotten monies, some people object to having the funds they return associated with the fund.  An example of this is when [[POTUS|then-President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and his [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] volunteered to reduce their pay in 1932 and instructed the Treasury to place the returned salary in the General Fund instead of the Conscience Fund.&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{cite news | title = Hoover Pay Cut Goes Into General Fund; $15,000 Not for the "Conscience Fund" | pages = 1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date = July 26, 1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donations to the Conscience Fund are not [[tax deductible]], although gifts to the U.S. Treasury through the U.S. Fund are.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news | last = Philipps | first = Dave | title = Would you tip the IRS? | publisher = [[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | date = April 10, 2005 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20050410/ai_n13592128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

The Conscience Fund was the subject of a 2017 episode of the [[Futility Closet Podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.futilitycloset.com/2017/02/27/podcast-episode-143-conscience-fund/|title=Futility Closet 143: The Conscience Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:copyzero.png|thumb|150px|Symbol of copyzero]]

'''Copyzero''' is a mechanism of protection of works by means of a qualified [[digital signature]] and a time mark. This mechanism lies in converting the work into digital format and appending the digital signature (which characterizes the author of the work) and a time mark (which indicates the existence of the work since given time) to the file.

In the Italian legal system, the digital signature has the same probative value as a certificate of SIAE (''Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori'', Italian society of authors and publishers) but a cost much smaller (0,36 [[Euro]], cost of one time mark, rather than corresponding 110 euro for renewal of the certificate every 5 years).

The duration of a time mark is 4 years: in order to extend the period of validity it is sufficient to append a new time mark to the marked file before the old time mark expires. However, the expired mark can be rightfully used in a court ruling up to 10 years from the date it was appended.

The instruments used by Copyzero are the device of a qualified digital signature (a smart card obtainable at certification authorities like e.g. the Chamber of Commerce) and the corresponding reader (for sale at computer stores).

A '''death march''' is a forced [[Marching|march]] of [[prisoners of war]] or other captives or deportees in which individuals are left to die along the way.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/death%20march&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished in this way from simple prisoner transport via foot march. Death marches usually feature harsh physical labor and abuse, neglect of prisoner injury and illness, deliberate [[starvation]] and [[dehydration]], humiliation and [[torture]], and execution of those unable to keep up the marching pace. The march may end at a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] or [[internment camp]], or it may continue until all the prisoners are dead (a form of "execution by labor", as seen in the [[Armenian genocide]] among other examples).

The signing of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War|url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1a13044f3bbb5b8ec12563fb0066f226/523ba38706c71588c12563cd0042c407|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=24 April 2014|authorlink=International Committee of the Red Cross|location=Geneva|date=12 August 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared death marches a form of [[war crime]].

* The [[Armenian Genocide]] resulted in the death of up to 1,500,000 people from 1915–1918. Under the cover of [[World War I]], the [[Young Turks]] sought to cleanse [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] of its Armenian population.

=== During World War II===

During WWII, death marches of POWs occurred in both [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-Occupied Europe]] and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. Death marches of [[Jews]]  were common in the later stages of [[The Holocaust]] as the Allies closed in on concentration camps in occupied Europe.

* During [[Operation Barbarossa]], particularly during 1941–42 when large numbers of Soviet prisoners were captured, death marches were among the forms of [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war]]. Considered to be a German war crime.
* After the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, many [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|German prisoners of war]] were left to die on march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= {{harvid|Beevor|1998}}|last=Beevor |first=Antony |title=[[Stalingrad (book)|Stalingrad]] |year=1998 |publisher=Viking |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-103240-5|chapter=25 ''The Sword of Stalingrad''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial captivity near Stalingrad they were sent on a "death march across the frozen steppe" to labor camps elsewhere in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Griess |first=Thomas E. |title=The Second World War: Europe and the Mediterranean (The West Point Military History Series) |year=2002 |publisher=West Point Military Series; First Printing edition |isbn=978-0757001604 | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted death marches of Allied POWs, including the infamous [[Bataan Death March]] (1942) and the [[Sandakan Death Marches]] (1945). The former forcibly transferred 60-80,000 POWs to Balanga, resulting in the deaths of 2,500–10,000 Filipinos and 100–650 Americans, the latter causing the deaths of 2,345 Australians and British, of which only 6 survived. Both the Bataan and Sandakan death marches were judged as war crimes. 
* The term "[[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]]" was used in the context of the [[World War II]] history by victims and then by historians to refer to the forcible movement between fall 1944 and April 1945 by [[Nazi Germany]] of thousands of prisoners, from [[Nazi concentration camps]] near the advancing war fronts to camps inside Germany.  One infamous death march occurred in January 1945, as the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced on occupied Poland. Nine days before the Soviets arrived at the death camp at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] marched nearly 60,000 prisoners out of the camp towards [[Wodzisław Śląski]] (German: [[Loslau]]), 35 miles away, where they were put on freight trains to other camps. Approximately 15,000 prisoners died on the way.&lt;ref name=USHMM&gt;{{cite web |title=Death marches |website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/dmarch.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825104559/http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/dmarch.htm |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Gilbert |date=May 1993 |title=Atlas of the Holocaust |edition=Revised and Updated |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Company |isbn=0688123643}} (map of forced marches)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This needs rewriting; death marches started in 1939, as the linked article explains in more detail.--&gt; The death marches were judged as a [[crime against humanity]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

* During the [[Korean War]], prisoners held by [[North Korea]] underwent what became known as the "Tiger Death March". The march occurred in the context of [[North Korea]] being over-run by [[United Nations]] forces. As North Korean forces retreated to the [[Yalu River]] on the border with [[China]], they evacuated their prisoners with them. On 31 October 1950, some 845 prisoners, including about eighty noncombatants, left [[Manpo]] and went upriver, arriving in [[Chunggang]] on 8 November 1950. A year later, fewer than 300 of the prisoners were still alive. The march was named after the brutal North Korean colonel who was in charge, nicknamed "The Tiger". Among the prisoners was [[George Blake]], an [[MI6]] officer who had been stationed in [[Seoul]]. While being held as a prisoner, he became a KGB double agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis H Carlson|title=Remembered Prisoners of a Forgotten War: An Oral History of Korean War POWs|year=2002 |publisher=St Martin's Press |pages=49–50, 60–62 |isbn=0-312-28684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''European Public Prosecutor's Office''' ('''EPPO''') is an independent body of the [[European Union]] (EU) to be established under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] between 22 of the 28 members of the EU following the method of [[enhanced cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/20-eu-nations-back-plan-for-eu-prosecutors-office/2017/06/08/0192c0ea-4c36-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It will be based in [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]] alongside the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) and the [[European Court of Auditors]] (ECA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/ministry-of-justice-new-european-public-prosecutor-s-office-to-be-based-in-luxembourg-5939316ca5e74263e13c1884&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and structure==
The role of the EPPO is to investigate and prosecute fraud against the [[EU budget]] and other crimes against the EU's financial interests including fraud concerning EU funds of over €10,000 and cross-border VAT fraud cases involving damages above €10 million. Previously only national authorities could investigate and prosecute these crimes and could not act beyond their borders. [[OLAF]], [[Eurojust]] and [[Europol]] similarly had no ability to act. The body is intended to be decentralized, based around European Delegated Prosecutors located in each Member State. The central office will have a European Chief Prosecutor supported by 20 European Prosecutors, technical and investigatory staff. The EPPO may request a suspect's arrest, but this must be confirmed by the relevant national authority.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/judicial-cooperation/public-prosecutor/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://globalcompliancenews.com/eu-public-prosecutors-office-20170620/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative procedure through enhanced cooperation==
The [[European Commission]] proposed a regulation on the establishment of a Public Procecutor's Office on 17 July 2013, based on a mandate in the Treaty of Lisbon to set up such an office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/justice/116485] Brussels explores creation of EU public prosecutor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-709_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on 7 February 2017 the Council concluded that no consensus existed among the member states on the proposed regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/02/07-epo-enhanced-cooperation/|title=European Public Prosecutor's Office : Council takes first step towards a possible enhanced cooperation|date=2017-02-07|accessdate=2017-10-21|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, 17 EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) requested on 14 February 2017 that the proposal be referred to the European Council for their consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://wwww.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/03/pdf/eppo-factsheet_pdf/|title=Proposal on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) - State of play|date=2017-03-07|accessdate=2017-10-21|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After no agreement was reached at the by the European Council on 9 March 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2017/03/09-conclusions-pec_pdf/|title=Conclusions by the President of the European Council|date=2017-03-09|accessdate=2017-10-21|publisher=[[European Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 members states (the prior 17 less Austria, Estonia and Latvia, plus Cyprus and Portugal) notified the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 3 April 2017 that they would proceed with establishing the EPPO by the use of [[enhanced cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/03-eppo/|title=European public prosecutor's office : 16 member states together to fight fraud against the EU budget|date=2017-04-03|accessdate=2017-10-21|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done under [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title V: Area of Freedom, Security and Justice|TFEU Article 86]], which allows for a simplified enhanced cooperation procedure which does not require authorization from the Council to proceed.  The participating member states agreed on the legislative text to establish the EPPO on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/06/08-eppo/|title=20 member states agree on details on creating the European Public Prosecutor's office (EPPO) - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By this point, Latvia and Estonia had begun participating in the enhanced cooperation procedure.  The proposal was approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 5 October 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2013/0255(APP)|title=Procedure file - 2013/0255(APP) - European Public Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=2017-10-21|publisher=[[European Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 12 October 2017 the regulation was given final approval by the 20 participating states, which had grown to include Austria and Italy.&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{citejournal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1939/oj|title=Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 of 12 October 2017 implementing enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (‘the EPPO’)|date=2017-10-31|accessdate=2017-10-31|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=L 283/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPPO will not have authority to begin investigating or prosecuting crimes until a decision of Commission approves this, which per the terms of the Regulation cannot take place until 3 years after the entry into force of the Regulation in November 2017.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

==Legal Basis==
The Public Prosecutor was inserted as article 86 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] by the Treaty of Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF] eur-lex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0042:0133:EN:PDF] eur-lex&lt;/ref&gt; The article states the following:

;Establishment;
*The [[Council of the European Union]], by a special legislative procedure, may establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office on the basis of [[Eurojust]].
*This must be done by unanimity in the Council and with the consent of the [[European Parliament]]
*If the Council cannot reach unanimity, a group of at least nine [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] may refer a draft to the [[European Council]].
*Those member states may also proceed to establish [[enhanced co-operation]] between themselves after informing Parliament, the Council and the Commission.

;Role;
*The office shall, in liaison with [[Europol]], be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgement those connected to offences against the EU's financial interests.
*It shall exercise this function in the relevant national courts.
*The regulations establishing the office shall determine rules governing how it performs its duties including the admissibility of evidence.
*The European Council may amend the treaty, after consulting the Commission and gaining the consent of Parliament, to extend its powers to include serious cross border crime

==History==
===Early Proposals===
It was strongly backed by the former [[List of European Commission portfolios#Justice, Freedom and Security|Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security]], [[Franco Frattini]] as part of plans to strengthen the Eurojust agency. Frattini stated in August 2007 that he is "convinced that Europe will have its general prosecutor in the future" and suggested that the Commission was just waiting for the treaty to come into force. He stated that a prosecutor "could prove useful" in areas "where important European interests are at stake", namely in dealing with financial crime, fraud and counterfeiting at European level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/24556] Brussels eyes single European public prosecutor, Goldirova, Renata (1 August 2007).EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm, in late 2007, the Lisbon Treaty by all Member States of the European Union, which refers explicitly to the idea of creating a European Public Prosecutor to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union and, where appropriate, to combat serious crime with cross-border dimension, resulted in the conclusion of an International Seminar in Madrid to study the new institution and the possibilities of its implementation. The Seminar was called by the Spanish Attorney General [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]], and led by Prosecutors Jorge Espina and Isabel Vicente Carbajosa. The presentations, discussions and conclusions of the meeting were collected in a book, "The future European Public Prosecutor's Office", in English and Spanish, and have served to date guide to the proposals and jobs that have been carried out on the implementation of this Institution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cita web|publisher=Fiscalía General del Estado|title=La futura Fiscalía Europea-The Future European Public Prosecutors Office|url= https://www.fiscal.es/fiscal/PA_WebApp_SGNTJ_NFIS/descarga/The_Future_European_Public_Prosecutors_Office.pdf?idFile=a8d5153e-f77c-4c30-92e3-1d084fd80f44|}}&lt;/ref&gt;          

Following the [[short selling]] of certain euro-zone financial products in 2009 and 10, Spain proposed the EU enact the European Public Prosecutor provision so the post could co-ordinate legal action in retaliation. "Spain wants the European Union to use a planned public prosecutor's office for the region to protect the euro currency against speculators", Spanish attorney general Cándido Conde-Pumpido said in March 2010.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/fundsNews/idINLDE6222G620100303?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0] Spain calls for EU prosecutor to protect euro, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 Eurojust cited the European Public Prosecutor's Office as a potential solution to the problem of cross border crime in the EU. Despite opposition from some member states seeing it as impinging on their sovereignty (partly due to the necessary harmonisation of legal codes) Eurojust set up a working group to study the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/29703] Eurojust&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish Presidency draft for the implementation of the EPPO ===

The Spanish Attorney General [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]], officially launched in Brussels, in March 2010, on Spanish Presidency draft for the implementation of the European Prosecutor, pursuant to the provision of Article 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Conde-Pumpido, speaking with the President of the Commission of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, and the Spanish State Secretary for the European Union (EU), Diego Lopez Garrido, presented a technical project, developed from the conclusions of the International Conference convened by the Spanish Prosecutor in 2008 and 2009, which would be discussed later in the Luxembourg Council.

The creation of this institution was subsequently discussed, according to the Spanish proposal, by the meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs held in Luxembourg on 27 April 2010, but its implementation was suspended until a new discussion in 2013.

=== Seminar of the Belgian Presidency and Eurojust in Bruges ===

[[File:Netherlands, The Hague, International Criminal Court.JPG|300px|thumb| Eurojust, The Hague, Netherlands]]

On 21 and 22 September 2010, Eurojust, in co-operation with the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, held a strategic seminar, "Eurojust and the Lisbon Treaty: towards more effective action", "Establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust?", at the College of Europe in [[Bruges]], Belgium.

The goals of the seminar were the development of Eurojust in light of the Lisbon Treaty and the possible establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust under Article 86 TFEU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-09-08b.aspx] Strategic Seminar – Establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust?&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barroso Commission Proposals ===

The [[European Commission President]] [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] said on 12 September 2012 in his speech to the European Parliament on the state of the Union, the next presentation of a proposal for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor, based on "commitment to uphold the rule of law ".

On 17 July 2013 the [[European Commission]], at the initiative of Vice-President [[Viviane Reding]] and Commissioner [[Algirdas Semeta]], proposed a regulation for the establishment of a, European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/justice/116485] Brussels explores creation of EU public prosecutor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-709_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal will now be discussed by the representatives of the EU Member States' experts under the specific procedure set by Article 86 of the Treaty. The following 3 main options may be considered within the range of options concerning the scope of the initiative to tackle offences against PIF (protection of financial interests):
* Doing nothing – criminal investigations of PIF offences are (still) conducted by Member State authorities exclusively;
* Setting-up the EPPO with a limited mandate (PIF offences) – EPPO has priority competence to order investigations and direct prosecutions into PIF offences
* Setting up the EPPO with an extended mandate (PIF offences and serious cross-border crimes) – EPPO has exclusive/shared competence to order investigations and direct prosecutions into PIF offences and other serious cross-border crimes (money laundering, corruption, accounting offences).
Besides these 3 options regarding scope, the Commission will need to consider a series of significant legal, institutional and organisational matters (relationship with Eurojust, OLAF, national authorities, judicial review) which could be formulated as sub-options. Moreover, particular procedural issues (EP involvement, legislative process, what if unanimity requirements are not met, enhanced co-operation with which member States, etc.) should be considered in these options. In accordance with Article 86 the proposal could include one or more regulations covering different aspects of the setting up of an EPPO. Soft law instruments are not relevant as legislative measures are needed to address criminal offences and law enforcement.

Likely impacts will include a more effective, dissuasive and equivalent criminal law protection of the Union's financial interests. Irregularities affecting the European budget may reach or exceed 1 Billion Euro per year, from which around 280 Million Euro could be suspected EU fraud cases to be investigated within the EPPO's competence. This amount could be significantly reduced if the EPPO were to direct investigations and prosecutions throughout the EU, acting on all cases of PIF offences. Moreover, economies of scale might be achieved for the benefit of justice budgets of Member States, due to a streamlining of the judicial procedures involving EU financial interests across the EU.

Depending on how the relationship between the EPPO and the national authorities will be defined, the impact will be primarily on national police and judicial authorities, which will certainly have to cope with the new framework for investigations and prosecutions ordered by the EPPO. The administrative burden depends on the new relations established between the EPPO and the national authorities and whether the initiative will impose new information obligations on Member States.

Preparatory work, in particular the 2001 Green paper on the establishment of a European Prosecutor, will be taken into consideration. Existing studies and evaluations, in particular the Criminal Justice Systems Study, the Euroneeds Study, the Pretrial investigative model rules, the Spanish Presidency Report, officially launched in Brussels in March 2010, etc. and studies regarding Eurojust, will provide valuable input.

===National and European Parliaments===

In November 2013 the Commission indicated its intention to go ahead with the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor, despite the opposition of 14 EU national parliaments.&lt;ref name="EPP Commission Review"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/sefcovic/headlines/news/2013/11/2013_11_27_public_prosecutor_en.htm|title='YELLOW CARD' ON EPPO TRIGGERS COMMISSION REVIEW |publisher=Vice President of the European Commission|date=November 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament has subsequently voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to set up the office.&lt;ref name="European Parliament backs European Public Prosecutors office"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/march/european-parliament-backs-european-public-prosecutors-office/|title=European Parliament backs European Public Prosecutor's office|publisher=out-law.com|date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11201">An '''extended warranty''', sometimes called a '''service agreement''', a '''service contract''', or a '''maintenance agreement''', is a prolonged [[warranty]] offered to [[consumer]]s in addition to the standard warranty on new items.  The extended warranty may be offered by the warranty administrator, the retailer or the manufacturer.  Extended warranties cost extra and for a percentage of the item's retail price. Occasionally, some extended warranties that are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of malfunction. Thus, what is often promoted as a five-year extended guarantee, for example, is actually only a four-year guarantee.

Extended warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, "acts of God", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and [[lubrication]] on a vehicle.

These types of warranties are provided for various products, but [[automobile]]s and [[Small appliance|electronics]] are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as [[Best Buy]] may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of [[reverse competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199569 Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation].&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an auto warranty from a [[car dealership]] may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.

==Overview==
An extended warranty is coverage for electrical or mechanical breakdown. It may or may not cover peripheral items, wear and tear, damage by computer viruses, re-gassing, normal maintenance, accidental damage, or any consequential loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/garden/28repairside.html | work=The New York Times | title=Should You Buy an Extended Warranty? | first=Julie | last=Scelfo | date=2009-05-28 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most state insurance regulators have approved the inclusion of normal wear and tear, accidental damage from handling, rental car and towing, power surge and other coverages in addition to the standard coverage for defects in materials and workmanship. The indemnity is to cover the cost of repair and may include replacement if deemed uneconomic to repair. It is important for consumers to read and understand the terms and conditions offered at the point of sale. In retail consumer electronics, extended warranties cost 20% to 30% of the price, and give sales associates up to 15% commission at some retailers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/money/extended_warranties/ "Extended warranties: A deal or dud?" article] from CBC Marketplace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20061024.html "Extended Warranty Pricing"] from WarrantyWeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer advocate]] groups, such as the [[non-profit]] [[Consumers Union]], advise against purchasing extended warranties unless they can be purchased at manufacturers cost. David Butler of the Consumers Union says, "The extended warranty is definitely in the best interest of the company because if the product breaks down they want you to be satisfied with it and buy another one when the time comes, but isn't often in the best interest of the consumer unless it can be purchased at cost with no or very little markup." Consumers Union says only two products deserve extended warranty consideration: [[projection television|projection TVs]] and [[digital camera]]s, as both are expensive to repair and require frequent repairs.&lt;ref name="cbcnews"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2006/11/15/consumer-warranty.html "Skip extended warranties, Consumers Union urges"] from [[CBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended auto warranty ==

An extended auto warranty is a service contract between the owner of a vehicle and an auto warranty provider, the latter which may be either the original manufacturer or a third party. All new cars come with a warranty that cover repairs for a certain period of time and a certain number of miles, such as 3 years and 36,000 miles. Auto warranties do not generally cover vandalism or theft, dings or dents, road salt damage, environmental or natural disaster-related damage. car wash damage, or normal routine maintenance.&lt;ref name="CARCHEX"&gt;{{cite web|title = Facts About Extended Auto Warranties|url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of sale, auto dealers may sell car buyers an extended warranty offered by the manufacturer. When that time period runs out, consumers have the option to purchase an extended auto warranty from a third-party, which is not an extension of the terms and coverages provided in the original car manufacturer’s warranty, rather it is a new contract provided a third-party provider.  According to the [[Automobile Protection Association]] (APA), which publishes the ''Lemon-Aid Car Buyer’s Guides'', extended warranties are a good idea if they cover items likely to break down within the warranty period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/should-i-buy-a-third-party-extended-warranty-for-my-car/article13615611/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Should I buy a third-party extended warranty for my car? | date=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended auto warranties often offer other perks not included in a general factory warranty, such as trip interruption insurance and roadside assistance.

== By region ==

=== Canadian province of Québec ===
Based upon the Québec civil code and the ''Loi sur la protection du consommateur'' every merchant is responsible to uphold the legal guarantee of a product. This legal guarantee protects the consumer from: purposefully hidden malfunctions, defaults that could not be readily identified at the moment of purchase, the guarantee that the item purchased can be used for its stated uses and finally guarantees a reasonable life expectancy based on the price paid. This guarantee survives even when the initial purchaser sells his goods to another person. A merchant cannot ask a consumer to pay any fees or shipping charges in order to be eligible to receive their legal guarantee. The [[Office de la protection du consommateur|office for the protection of consumers]] does not take a particular stance towards extended warranties. However, they recommend that consumers should be vigilant and question themselves whether the warranty really adds anything to the already applicable legal warranty. Finally they point out that the number of consumers who go to court against merchants in order for them to apply the legal warranty is almost proportional to the number of consumers who take legal means against a merchant for failing to respect extended warranties they have sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/dep_garantie_garantie.asp Office de la protection du consommateur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818163424/http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/dep_garantie_garantie.asp |date=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, extended warranties are regulated by many state insurance commissioners as "service contracts."  Service contracts can cover automobiles, consumer goods (such as appliances, electronics, lawn equipment, etc...) and homes.  The regulatory structure requires licensure or registration of the warranty providers, financial solvency regulation, and service contract consumer disclosures. Service warranty "providers" apply for licensure or registration, and then may sell their products, usually at the point of sale of the product, for example at the car dealership, or at the retail consumer electronics store, but some companies such as [[afterinc.com|After, Inc]], [[SquareTrade]], [[Warranty Direct]]  and MotorEasy also sell directly to consumers. In the United States, a type of extended warranty called vehicle service contracts are typically regulated by the states as insurance. In July 2010, California issued a cease and desist letter to several corporations which were selling the insurance illegally in the state; the corporations contended that it was not insurance because the contracts required that certain additives be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2010/release082-10.cfm Commissioner Poizner Orders Vehicle Warranty Company to End Illegal Telemarketing, Stop Operating as Unlicensed Insurance Company]. California Department of Insurance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://go-scic.com/ Service Contract Industry Council] was founded by [[Fredrick D. Schaufeld]] in 1988 and is a [[trade association]] of members of the industry.

=== United Kingdom ===
The extended warranty market has been subject to several investigations. In 2002 the [[Office of Fair Trading]] decided that self-regulation of the industry had failed and passed the case onto the [[Competition Commission]]. This concluded that the market was not acting in the interests of consumers. The [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] have expressed concerns about extended warranties being mis-sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elise Cross |url=http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/pressoffice/press_index/press-050407.htm |title=New protection for consumers taking out extended warranties welcomed - but many offer little value for money says Citizens Advice |publisher=Citizensadvice.org.uk |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012141931/http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/pressoffice/press_index/press-050407.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Fair trading investigated the extended warranty market again and published a [http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/othermarketswork/electrical-goods/#named4 market review] in 2012. They said that the UK market is worth an estimated £1billion&lt;ref&gt;The OFT has completed a [[market study]] of extended warranties which highlighted competition concerns in the £1 billion per year extended warranties market.&lt;/ref&gt; a year. Out of this £1billion they estimate 75% of people do not compare prices before buying an extended warranty.

{{Patent law}}
This is a list of '''legal terms relating to patents'''. A patent is not a right to practice or use the invention, but a territorial right to exclude others from commercially exploiting the invention, granted to an [[inventor (patent)|inventor]] or his successor in rights in exchange to a public disclosure of the invention.

{{Compact ToC|short1|refs=|num=no}}

==A==

===Abandonment===
The reply of an applicant to an [[office action]] must be made within a prescribed time limit. If no reply is received within the time period, the application may be considered, depending on the jurisdiction, as abandoned or deemed to be withdrawn, and, therefore, no longer pending.

===Annuity fee===
{{Main article|Maintenance fee (patent)}}
A fee to be paid to maintain a patent or a patent application in force. Also called "maintenance fee" or "renewal fee".

===Application===
{{Main article|patent application}}
An application for a patent, or patent application, is a request by a person or company to the competent authority (usually a patent office) to grant him a patent. By extension, a patent application also refers to the content of the document which that person or company filed to initiate the application process. This document usually contains a description of the invention and at least one claim used to define the sought scope of protection.

===Assignor estoppel===
{{Main article|Assignor estoppel}}
In [[United States patent law]], an [[equitable estoppel]] barring a patent's seller (assignor) from attacking the patent's validity if he/she is found to have infringed that patent later.

===Auslegeschrift===
{{Main article|Auslegeschrift}}
In outdated [[German patent law]], the second reading, or publication, of a patent application.

===Author’s certificate===
A form of inventor's recognition formerly available in the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Enclopedia of Comparative Law |year=1976 |publisher=BRILL |isbn= |page=U-42 |url= |quote=A particular feature of the legal protection of inventions in the USSR is that legislation establishes two means of protection: the author's certificate and the patent. The author of an invention may by his own choice require either only the recognition of his authorship or the recognition of his authorship and the grant to him of the exclusive right to the invention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of Socialist countries.&lt;ref name="ladas-1975"&gt;{{cite book |title=Patents, trademarks, and related rights: national and international protection, Volume 1 |last=Ladas |first=Stephen Pericles |year=1975 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-65775-6 |page=380 |url= |quote=In the Soviet Union and in a number of Socialist countries, there is another kind of grant for an invention called Author's or Inventor's Certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called "inventor's certificate".&lt;ref name="ladas-1975"/&gt;

==B==

===Biogen sufficiency===
U.K. law concept according to which, if "the extent of the monopoly claimed [in a patent] exceeds the technical contribution to the [[prior art|art]] made by the invention as described in the specification", the patent may be revoked on the ground of [[insufficiency of disclosure]]. The concept stems from the decision ''[[Biogen v. Medeva]]'', issued by the [[House of Lords]] on 31 October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;EPO Board of Appeal decision [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t121727eu1.html T 1727/12 of 1 February 2016], point 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolar exemption===
See [[Glossary of patent law terms#Research exemption|research exemption]].

===Branching off===
Under German patent law, a procedure consisting in deriving a [[utility model]] (German: ''Gebrauchsmuster'') from a pending patent application. Also called "derivation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology and Chemical Inventions: World Protection and Exploitation |last=Bucknell |first=Duncan |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= 9780199289011 |page=274 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 5(1) of the German Utility Model Act&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding German term is ''[[:de:Abzweigung (Gebrauchsmuster)|Abzweigung]]''.

==C==

===Catch and release===
The practice of a [[patent holding company]] buying a patent, offering a [[license]] to its members and then selling or donating the patent after a certain period of time.&lt;ref name ="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;refer=conews&amp;tkr=1149L:US&amp;sid=aI70xRS4IR9w|title=Sun, EBay, Rock &amp; Republic, Troyer: Intellectual Property|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter I===
In the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), "Chapter I" refers to the prosecution procedure when no demand under {{PCT Article|31}} is made. The states selected under Chapter I by the applicant are called "designated States".&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|4|1|ii}} and {{PCT Article|2|xiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter II===
In the PCT, "Chapter II" refers to the prosecution procedure when a demand under {{PCT Article|31}} is made. An international preliminary examination is conducted in this case. The demand indicates the Contracting State or States in which the applicant intends to use the results of the international preliminary examination ("elected States").&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|31|4|a}} and {{PCT Article|2|xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claim===
{{Main article|Claim (patent)}}
A [[noun phrase]] defining the extent of the protection conferred by a patent, or the extent of protection sought in a patent application.

===Clearance search and opinion===
A search done on issued patents or on pending patent applications to determine if a product or process infringes any of the claims of the issued patents or pending patent applications. These searches and opinions are also called [[Glossary of patent law terms#Freedom-to-operate|freedom-to-operate searches and opinions]]. See [[Patent infringement]].

===Common general knowledge===
A legal concept used notably when assessing whether an invention involves an [[inventive step]] and whether the [[sufficiency of disclosure|disclosure of the invention is sufficiently clear and complete]] for a [[skilled person in the art]] to be able to carry out the invention. The common general knowledge "is the common knowledge in the field to which the invention relates." The information "must be generally known and generally regarded as a good basis for further action by the bulk of those engaged in that art before it becomes part of their common stock of knowledge relating to the art, and so part of the common general knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2008/2413.html ''Generics (UK) Ltd v Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd &amp; Anor''] [2008] EWHC 2413 (Pat) (October 15, 2008), items 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the inventive step assessment, "[if] information is part of the common general knowledge then it forms part of the stock of knowledge which will inform and guide the skilled person's approach to the problem from the outset. It may, for example, affect the steps it will be obvious for him to take, including the nature and extent of any literature search."&lt;ref&gt;''Generics (UK) Ltd v Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd &amp; Anor'' [2008] EWHC 2413 (Pat) (October 15, 2008), item 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under European practice, "the common general knowledge of the person skilled in the art is, as a general rule, established on the basis of [[encyclopaedia]]s, [[textbook]]s and the like".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t090412eu1.pdf EPO Board of Appeal decision T 0412/09 of 9 May 2012], point 2.1.3, referring to decision T 890/02, OJ EPO 2005, 497, point 2 of the reasons.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally however, common general knowledge may also be established on the basis of the content of patent specifications "and in particular when a series of patent specifications provides a consistent picture that a particular technical procedure was generally known and belonged to the common general knowledge in the art at the relevant date".&lt;ref&gt;Decision T 0412/09 of 9 May 2012, point 2.1.3, referring to "''T 890/02, point 2, and "Case Law of the Boards of Appeal" EPO, 6th edition, 2010, chapter I, section C.1.5 and last paragraph of section C.3.2.6''" and "''decisions T 151/05, points 3.4.1, 4.1 and 4.3 of the reasons, and T 452/05, point 2.4.1, paragraph (b)(ii)''".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compulsory license===
{{Main article|Compulsory license}}
Using compulsory licenses, a government may force a patent proprietor to grant use to the state or others. Usually, the holder does receive some [[royalties]], either set by law or determined through some form of [[arbitration]].

===Continuation-in-part application===
Under United States law, a type of [[continuing application]] in which the applicant adds subject-matter not disclosed in the parent application, but repeats substantial portion of the parent's specification, and shares at least one inventor with the parent application. See [[continuing patent application]].

===Continuing application===
{{Main article|Continuing patent application}}
In United States law, an active patent application, prior to final action, may give rise to additional applications for additional claims carrying the priority date of the original application.  With the move to published applications, this has become a common way of producing [[submarine patents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark A. Lemley]], Kimberly A. Moore, [http://repositories.cdlib.org/boaltwp/20/ ''Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations''], Boalt Working Papers in Public Law (University of California, Berkeley), Year 2003, Paper 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contribution approach===
Under European patent practice, a legal approach, now abandoned by the European Patent Office (EPO), for assessing whether an invention was patentable. The approach consisted in establishing whether the "contribution to the art" made by the invention was only in a field excluded from patentability by {{EPC Article|52|2) and (3}} and, if so, the application could be refused.&lt;ref&gt;European Patent Office Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion [[G 3/08]] of May 12, 2010, Reasons 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPO now applies the sometimes named "any hardware" or "any technical means" approach, notably formulated in EPO Board of Appeal decisions [[T 258/03]] (Auction Method/Hitachi) and T 424/03 (Microsoft).&lt;ref&gt;Opinion G 3/08 (May 12, 2010), Reasons 10.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributory infringement===
A form of [[Glossary of patent law terms#Indirect infringement|indirect infringement]].

==D==

In United States patent law, a legal document filed in the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) that establishes an early filing date, but which does not mature into an issued patent unless the applicant files a regular patent application within one year. See also [[Glossary of patent law terms#Non-provisional patent application|Non-provisional patent application]].

===Provisional (patent) rights or provisional protection===
The rights conferred to a published [[patent application]], i.e. the rights conferred before the patent is granted. See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20060228211036/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_154.htm U.S. patent law, 35 USC 154(d)]. Under the [[European Patent Convention]],
:"for the period of provisional protection, between the moment of publication of the patent application and the moment of the publication of the patent grant, {{EPC Article|67}} requires Member States to ensure that the applicant can claim compensation reasonable in the circumstances from any person who has used the invention in their territory. Following publication of the mention of the patent grant, full compensation of any losses suffered may be claimed, depending also on whether the infringer knew or should have known that he or she was infringing."&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper)], November 28, 2008, page 98, footnote 116 (pdf, 1.95 MB).

==R==

===Reading a claim===
The process of establishing patent infringement involves "reading" a claim onto the technology of interest. If all of the claim's elements are found in the technology, the claim is said to "read on" the technology; if a single element from the claim is missing from the technology, the claim does not literally read on the technology and the technology does not infringe the patent with respect to that claim. Also, the process of contesting or invalidating a patent can involve showing that the claim reads on prior art, i.e., the claim's elements are found in the prior art.

===Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing===
{{Main article|Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing}}
A type of licensing typically used during standardisation processes. Also abbreviated "RAND".

===Reduction to practice===
{{Main article|Reduction to practice}}

===Reexamination===
{{Main article|Reexamination}}
The examination of a granted patent, which can result in the revocation of that patent.

===Regional patent===
A single patent covering a set of countries. As of 2012, the only true regional patent covering more than two countries appears to be the [[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle|OAPI patent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ficpi.org/library/montecarlo99/patentsafrica.html |title=Regional Patent Systems in Africa |last1=James |first1=Peter |last2= |first2= |date=November 3–6, 1999 |location=Monte Carlo |work=Open Forum Monte Carlo 1999 |publisher=[[FICPI]] |quote=An apparently unique feature of OAPI is that the OAPI patent is a single patent which extends to each member country. |ref=PAPER: MC/1.6 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European patent]], the [[Eurasian patent]], and the [[ARIPO patent]] each effectively lead, once granted, to a bundle of national patents for which there might be separate translation requirements (for example in the European Patent Convention), maintenance fees,&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eapo.org/eng/ea/patsys/history.html|title=History of the Eurasian patent organization|work=[[Eurasian Patent Organization]]|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} durations of protection (for example with ARIPO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ficpi.org/library/montecarlo99/patentsafrica.html|title=Regional patent systems in Africa|author=Peter James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and separate jurisdiction exist (a patent invalidated in one country might still be valid in others). The [[unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein]] can also be regarded as a regional patent with a truly unitary effect. See also [[Glossary of patent law terms#Unitary patent|unitary patent]].

===Regional phase===
The prosecution phase wherein an international application filed under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT) becomes subject to examination at a regional level. There are four regional patent treaties: the [[European Patent Convention]], the [[Eurasian Patent Convention]], the Bangui Agreement (see [[African Intellectual Property Organization]] or [[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle|OAPI]]), and the Harare Protocol (see [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization]] or ARIPO). See also [[Glossary of patent law terms#National phase|National phase]].

===Registration patent===
A type of patent that takes effect, even if the substantial requirements (e.g. regarding novelty) have not been fulfilled. The Belgian, Dutch and French patents are examples of registration patents.

===Rejection===
In the United States, to have patent claims "rejected" in a patent application means that the subject matter as claimed is considered by the patent examiner to be unpatentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0700_706_01.htm|title=706-|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A final [[Office action]] based on rejection of claims is subject to review by the [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]] (BPAI). cf Objections, supra.

===Research exemption===
{{Main article|Research exemption}}

===Restitutio in integrum===
{{Main article|Restitutio in integrum under the European Patent Convention}}
In the [[European Patent Convention]], a means of redress following a loss of right due to the non-observance of a time limit in spite of all due care.

===Revocation action===
Lawsuit initiated by a party requesting a patent to be declared invalid, i.e. to be revoked. Also called "nullity action".

==S==

===Sandor Obviousness===
In United States patent law, an obviousness rejection based on a single reference.  Generally a case for an obviousness rejection requires the examiner to rely on 2 or more references.  Sandor Obviousness stems from Ex Parte Sandor Nagy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/board-of-patent-appeals/2003/fd012095001.html|title=Ex Parte NAGY et al - Page 1|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the examiner relied on only a single reference to reject the claims at issue.  Ultimately the case was remanded on appeal back to the examiner.

===Search report===
{{Main article|Search report}}
A report established by a [[patent office]], which mentions documents which may be taken into consideration in deciding whether the invention to which a patent application relates is [[patentable]].

===Second medical use===
The patenting of a particular medical use of a molecule (or more generally product or composition), wherein a first particular use of a molecule is already known and, therefore, wherein the novel and inventive aspect lies solely in the second use of the molecule. Also known as further medical use.

===Selection invention===
An invention consisting in the selection of individual elements, sub-sets, or sub-ranges, within a larger, [[prior art|known]] set or range.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|vi|8}}: "Selection inventions" (Novelty), {{EPO Guidelines|g|vii|12}}: "Selection inventions" (Inventive step).&lt;/ref&gt; A selection patent is a patent granted on a selection invention.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen E.

'''Harriet E. Wilson''' (June 28, 1825 &amp;ndash; March 15, 1900) is considered the first female [[African-American]] [[Novel|novelist]], as well as the first African American of any gender to publish a novel on the North American continent. Her novel ''[[Our Nig]], or Sketches from the Life of a Free Black'' was published anonymously in 1859 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and was not widely known. The novel was discovered in 1982 by the scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], who documented it as the first African-American novel published in the United States. However, the novel ''[[The Bondwoman's Narrative]]'' by [[Hannah Crafts]], published for the first time in 2002, may have been written before Wilson's book.

Born a free person of color (free Negro) in [[New Hampshire]], Wilson was orphaned when young and bound until the age of 18 as an indentured servant. She struggled to make a living after that, marrying twice; her only son George died at the age of seven in the poor house, where she had placed him while trying to survive as a widow. She wrote one novel. Wilson later was associated with the [[Spiritualist]] church, was paid on the public [[lecture circuit]] for her lectures about her life, and worked as a housekeeper in a boarding house.

==Biography==
Born Harriet E. "Hattie" Adams in [[Milford, New Hampshire]], she was the [[mixed-race]] daughter of Margaret Ann (or Adams) Smith, a washerwoman of Irish ancestry, and Joshua Green, an African-American "hooper of barrels." After her father died when Hattie was young, her mother abandoned Hattie at the farm of Nehemiah Hayward Jr., a well-to-do Milford farmer "connected to the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Glynis Carr, "Our Nig", in ''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'', Fourth Edition (1996), New York:  HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an orphan, Adams was bound by the courts as an [[indentured servant]] to the Hayward family, a customary way for society at the time to arrange support and education for orphans. The intention was that, in exchange for labor, the orphan child would be given room, board and training in life skills, so that she could later make her way in society.

From their [[documentary research]], the scholars P. Gabrielle Foreman and Reginald H. Pitts believe that the Hayward family were the basis of the "Bellmont" family depicted in ''Our Nig''. (This was the family who held the young "Frado" in indentured servitude, abusing her physically and mentally from the age of six to eighteen. Foreman and Pitts' material was incorporated in supporting sections of the 2004 edition of ''Our Nig''.)

After the end of her indenture at the age of eighteen, Hattie Adams (as she was then known), worked as a house servant and a [[seamstress]] in households in southern New Hampshire...

===Marriage and family===
Adams married Thomas Wilson in Milford on October 6, 1851. An escaped slave, Wilson had been traveling around New England giving lectures based on his life. Although he continued to lecture periodically in churches and town squares, he told Hattie that he had never been a slave and that he had created the story to gain support from [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].

Wilson abandoned Harriet soon after they married.  Pregnant and ill, Harriet Wilson was sent to the [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire]] Poor Farm in [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]], where her only son, George Mason Wilson, was born. His probable birth date was June 15, 1852. Soon after George's birth, Wilson reappeared and took the two away from the Poor Farm. He returned to sea, where he served as a sailor, and died soon after.

As a widow, Harriet Wilson returned her son George to the care of the Poor Farm, where he died at the age of seven on February 16, 1860. She could not make enough money to support them both and provide for his care while she worked.

After that, Wilson moved to Boston, hoping for more work opportunities. On September 29, 1870, Wilson married again, to John Gallatin Robinson in Boston. An [[apothecary]], he was a native of Canada born in [[Sherbrooke|Sherbrooke, Quebec]]. Robinson was of English and German ancestry; he was nearly 18 years younger than Wilson. From 1870-1877, they resided at 46 Carver Street, after which they appear to have separated. After that date, city directories list Wilson and Robinson in separate lodgings in Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]].  No record has been found of a divorce, but divorces were infrequent at the time.

===Writing a novel===
While living in Boston, Wilson wrote ''Our Nig''. On August 18, 1859, she copyrighted it, and deposited a copy of the novel in the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. On September 5, 1859, the novel was published anonymously by George C. Rand and Avery, a publishing firm in Boston. Wilson said that she wrote the novel in order to raise money to help care for her sick child, George.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honey, Hush: An Anthology of African American Women's Humor|authorlink=Daryl Cumber Dance|last=Dance|first=Daryl Cumber|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York|pages=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, Harriet Wilson appeared on the "Report of the Overseers of the Poor" for the town of [[Milford, New Hampshire]].  After 1863, she disappeared from records until 1867, when she was listed in the Boston [[Spiritualist]] newspaper, ''[[Banner of Light]],'' as living in East [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  She subsequently moved across the [[Charles River]] to the city of Boston, where she became known in Spiritualist circles as "the colored medium."&lt;ref&gt;P. Gabrielle Foreman and Katherine E. Flynn, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/02/15/mrs_he_wilson_mogul/?page=full "Mrs. H. E. Wilson, Mogul? The Curious New History of an American Literary Mogul"], Boston ''Globe'', February 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 to 1897, "Mrs. Hattie E. Wilson" was listed in the ''Banner of Light'' as a trance reader and lecturer.  She was active in the local Spiritualist community, and she would give "lectures", either while entranced, or speaking normally, wherever she was wanted. She spoke at camp meetings, in theaters, and in private homes throughout New England; she shared the podium with speakers such as [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Andrew Jackson Davis]]. In 1870 Wilson traveled as far as Chicago as a delegate to the American Association of Spiritualists convention. Wilson delivered lectures on labor reform, and children's education. Although the texts of her talks have not survived, newspaper reports imply that she often spoke about her life experiences, providing sometimes trenchant and often humorous commentary.

Closer to home, Wilson was active in the organization and maintenance of Children's Progressive Lyceums, the Spiritualist church equivalent to [[Sunday Schools]]; she organized Christmas celebrations; she participated in skits and playlets; and at meetings she sometime sang as part of a quartet. She was also known for her floral centerpieces, and the candies she would make for the children were long remembered. Wilson worked as a Spiritualist nurse and healer ("clairvoyant physician").

In addition, for nearly 20 years from 1879 to 1897, she was the housekeeper of a boardinghouse in a two-story dwelling at 15 Village Street (near the present corner of Dover [now East Berkeley Street] and Tremont Streets in the South End.) She rented out rooms, collected rents and provided basic maintenance.

In Wilson's active and fruitful life after ''Our Nig,'' there is no evidence that she wrote anything else for publication.

On June 28, 1900, Hattie E. Wilson died in the Quincy Hospital in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. She was buried in the Cobb family plot in that town's [[Mount Wollaston Cemetery]]. Her plot number is listed as 1337, "old section."

At Wilson's death, her estranged husband Robinson, describing himself as a "capitalist", was living in the town of [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]] with a 24-year-old woman named Izah Nellie Moore. Two years later they married.

==Competition for "first novel"==
The scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] rediscovered ''Our Nig'' in 1982 and documented it as the first novel by an African American to be published in the United States. His discovery and the novel gained national attention.

In 2006, William L. Andrews, an [[English literature]] professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and Mitch Kachun, a history professor at [[Western Michigan University]], brought to light [[Julia C. Collins]]' ''[[The Curse of Caste]]; or The Slave Bride'' (1865), first published in serial form in the ''Christian Recorder,'' the newspaper of the AME Church. Publishing it in book form in 2006, they maintained that ''The Curse of Caste'' should be considered the first "truly imagined" novel by an African American to be published in the U.S. They argued that ''Our Nig'' was more autobiography than fiction.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news | author=Dinitia Smith| title=A Slave Story Is Rediscovered, and a Dispute Begins | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/28/books/28slav.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | page=B7| work=The New York Times | date=October 28, 2006 | accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birkerts"&gt;{{cite news | author=Sven Birkerts | title=Emancipation Days | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/books/review/Birkerts.t.html | work=The New York Times | date=October 29, 2006 | accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Gates responded that numerous other novels and other works of fiction of the period were in some part based on real-life events and were in that sense autobiographical, but they were still considered novels.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Examples include [[Fanny Fern]]'s ''[[Ruth Hall: A Domestic Tale of the Present Time|Ruth Hall]]''; [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''[[Little Women]]''; and [[Hannah Webster Foster]]'s ''[[The Coquette]]'' (1797).&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

The first known novel by an African American is [[William Wells Brown]]'s ''[[Clotel; or, The President's Daughter]]'' (1853), published in the United Kingdom, where he was living at the time.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The critic [[Sven Birkerts]] argued that the unfinished state of ''The Curse of Caste'' (Collins died before completing it) and its poor literary quality should disqualify it as the first building block of African-American literature. He contended the works by Wilson and Brown were more fully realized.&lt;ref name="Birkerts"/&gt;

Eric Gardner thought that ''Our Nig'' did not receive critical acclaim from abolitionists when first published because it did not conform to the contemporary genre of [[slave narrative]]s. He thinks the abolitionists may have refrained from promoting ''Our Nig'' because the novel recounts "slavery's shadow" in the North, where free blacks suffered as [[indentured servants]] and from racism. It fails to offer the promise of freedom, and it features a protagonist who is assertive toward a white woman.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Eric, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/365845 "'This Attempt of Their Sister': Harriet Wilson's ''Our Nig'' from Printer to Readers"], ''The New England Quarterly'', 66.2 (1993): 226-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her article "Dwelling in the House of Oppression: The Spatial, Racial, and Textual Dynamics of Harriet Wilson's Our Nig", Lois Leveen argues that, although the novel is about a free black in the north, the "free black" is still oppressed. The "white house" of the novel represents, as Leveen puts it: "The model home for American society is built according to the spatial imperatives of slavery." Frado is a "free black", but she is treated as a lower-class person and is often abused as a slave would be. Leveen argues that Wilson was expressing her view that even the "free blacks" were not really free in a racist society.

== Legacy and honors ==
*Since Henry Louis Gates, Jr's work in 1982, Harriet Wilson has been recognized as the first African American to publish a novel in the United States.
*The Harriet Wilson Project of Milford, New Hampshire raised funds to commission and install the Harriet E. Wilson Memorial Statue (2006) in the town's Bicentennial Park in her honor.

[[File:Kloster Herrenchiemsee 03.jpg|thumb|270px|Herrenchiemsee Abbey]]
The '''Constitutional Convention at Herrenchiemsee''' ({{lang-de|Verfassungskonvent auf Herrenchiemsee}}) was a meeting of constitutional experts nominated by the [[minister-president]]s of the [[West Germany|Western]] [[States of Germany|States]] of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]], held in August 1948 at former [[Herrenchiemsee]] Abbey in [[Bavaria]]. It was part of the process of drafting and adopting the current German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (''Grundgesetz''). The draft document prepared by the Herrenchiemsee convention served as a starting point for the deliberations of the ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' in [[Bonn]] during 1948 and 1949.

==Proceedings==
On 1 July 1948 the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] had officially recommended the implementation of a West German state by handing out the "[[Frankfurt Documents]]" to the minister-presidents and governing mayors of the Western occupation zones. From 8 to 10 July the minister-presidents met at [[Koblenz]] and proclaimed the establishment of a Federal Republic of Germany, which should only be a provisional arrangement but not a [[Succession of states|successor state]] of the [[German Reich]].

Chaired by the representative of the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]], the convention was inaugurated on August 10 at the Herrenchiemsee "Old Palace", a former residence of King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]]. The assembly did not adopt an official name, it was later called Herrenchiemsee Convention by the members of the ''Parlamentarischer Rat''. Every West German state was represented by an expert, the [[West Berlin]] deputy [[Otto Suhr]] due to Allied reservations attended the meeting as a non-voting "guest". Three committees were established, which until August 23 drafted a nearly complete concept of a new German constitution, whereby the basic principles of the Basic Law were fixed:
*A [[bicameralism|bicameral]] system of a directly elected federal parliament (the later [[Bundestag]]) and a representation of the German states. No agreement was reached on the configuration of the second chamber; instead of a genuine [[Senate]] "[[upper house]]", the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] legislative body was implemented in 1949.
*The [[Cabinet of Germany]] as the federal executive body is dependent on a majority in the parliament, provided that it is able to fulfil the task of forming a government. The confidence of the parliament is essential but also sufficient for the [[head of government]] (i.e. the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]).
*A negative majority shall not prevent the formation of the government nor just overthrow it (see: [[Constructive vote of no confidence]]). 
*Beside the head of government is a neutral legitimizing [[head of state]] (the [[President of Germany]]) with limited executive powers.
*The President is neither allowed to take emergency measures (''Notverordnungen'' as according to [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]]) nor to execute [[federal law]]s in the States, these rights are reserved for the German government and the States' chamber.
*The execution of federal laws is supervised by the federal judicial system.
*The States are most responsible for legislation, administration, justice and [[public finance|financing]].
*States and federal government prepare and execute separate [[government budget|budgets]].
*The instruments of [[direct democracy]] on federal level are limited: there is no provision of a country-wide [[referendum]], a plebiscite shall only be held to adopt a new constitution.
*Any [[constitutional amendment]] in order to abolish the fundamental principles of human [[dignity]] or the [[republic]]an, [[democracy|democratic]] and [[federation|federal]] form of government is illegal—see: [[Eternity clause]].
The federal character of the Herrenchiemsee draft corresponded with the assignment of the convention by the German States. It was adopted by a minister-presidents' conference before it was forwarded to the ''Parlamentarischer Rat''. The council in Bonn could rely on a highly qualified conception with several contentious points resolved in advance, though many [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] and [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] deputies originally objected against a too strong exertion of influence by the States' governments.

{{intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual rights''' (from "{{lang-fr|droits intellectuels}}") is a term sometimes used to refer to the legal protection afforded to owners of [[intellectual capital]].  This notion is more commonly referred to as "[[intellectual property]]", though "intellectual rights" more aptly describes the nature of the protections afforded by most nations.

Both terms were used in [[Europe]] during the 19th century as a means of distinguishing between two different views of intellectual protection.  "Intellectual property" was generally used to advocate a belief that [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s should provide rights similar to physical [[Legal property|property]] rights.  The term "intellectual rights" was used by those who felt that such protection should take the form of temporary, limited grants.

Although most modern copyright systems do not treat copyrighted or patented materials in the same way as real property, the term "intellectual property" has gained prominence.  For more on this subject, see "[[intellectual property]]".

Also, at least three different kinds of capital and rights are involved:
*creativity ([[individual capital]]) which implies rights to benefit from one's free expression
*invention ([[instructional capital]]) which implies rights to benefit from having created some more efficient device or process
*reputation ([[social capital]]) which implies rights not to have one's name or specific distinguishing tagline or ethic sullied by imitators or rivals

All three capital terms predate the term [[intellectual capital]], which appears to be a 19th-century artifact of early, now-discredited, economic theory.

In 20th-century Europe also originated another more modern approach, intended to sweep away the differences between the historical "[[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]]" and "Intellectual Rights" camps, allowing every creator both perpetual and temporary rights:
* [[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] became the [[unalienable]] part of the rights every author was entitled to. These rights could generally not be [[waiver|waived]];
* All other [[intellectual property rights]] were to become both limited in time and tradeable.

Note that this is one of the chief differences between [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Union|EU]] approach towards [[Intellectual property rights]] up till the early 21st century, in that the crystallisation of this modern approach (the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]) is still only partially put in practice in the [[United States|U.S.]], and, where applied, this is done largely outside the legislation regarding [[Intellectual property|IP]].

The '''International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture''' ('''IT PGRFA'''),&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0510e/i0510e.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; popularly known as the '''International Seed Treaty''', is a comprehensive international agreement in harmony with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], which aims at guaranteeing [[food security]] through the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]], exchange and [[sustainable use]] of the world's [[plant genetic resources]] for food and agriculture (PGRFA), as well as the fair and equitable benefit sharing arising from its use. It also recognises [[farmers' rights]], subject to national laws to: a) the protection of traditional knowledge relevant to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; b) the right to equitably participate in sharing benefits arising from the utilisation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; and c) the right to participate in [[decision-making|making decisions]], at the national level, on matters related to the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Treaty establishes the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing to facilitate plant [[germplasm]] exchanges and benefit sharing through [[Material transfer agreement|Standard Material Transfer Agreement]] (SMTA).

However, as Regine Andersen of the farmers' rights project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmersrights.org/&lt;/ref&gt; among others, including [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/officialreports/20091021_report-ga64_seed-policies-and-the-right-to-food_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; argue, the interpretation and realisation of farmers' rights is weak and is not the same across all countries. Without a consistent, strong international focus on the realising the rights of farmers who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA to save, use, exchange and sell seeds saved on-farm, genetic variety of crops and related [[agricultural biodiversity]] will suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419031546/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; India, for example, includes an interpretation of farmers' rights in its Plant Variety Protection and Farmers' Rights Act, allowing farmers a restricted right to save and sell seed they have produced on-farm as they always have, even if it contains genes from a protected variety.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706080544/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |archivedate=6 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104832/http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty has implemented a Multilateral System (MLS) of access and benefit sharing, among those countries that ratify the treaty, for a list of 64 of some of the most important food and forage crops essential for [[food security]] and interdependence. The genera and species are listed in Annex 1 to the treaty.

The treaty was negotiated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (CGRFA) and since 2006 has its own Governing Body under the aegis of the FAO.  The Governing Body is the highest organ of the Treaty as established in Article 19. Composed of representatives of all Contracting Parties, its basic function is to promote the full implementation of the Treaty, including the provision of policy guidance on the implementation of the Treaty. The Governing Body elects its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, in conformity with its Rules of Procedure. They are collectively referred to as "the Bureau".

Some believe the treaty could be an example of responsible global governance for ensuring that plant genetic resources essential for present and future food security can be kept accessible to all farmers and in the public domain. Chapter 7 of the Second Report on the State of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (SoWPGR-2)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1500e/i1500e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Access to Plant Genetic Resources, the sharing of benefits arising out of their utilization and the realization of Farmers' Rights" is mainly dedicated to the International Treaty.

==Sessions of the Governing Body ==
* The Governing Body met for the first time in Madrid in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planttreaty.org/meetings/gb1_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It had a ministerial segment and a ministerial declaration was adopted and included in the Report.&lt;ref&gt;GB-1/06/REPORT,  Report of the First Session of the Governing Body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. ftp://ftp.fao.org/ag/agp/planttreaty/gb1/gb1repe.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Second Session of the Governing Body was held in Rome in October/November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planttreaty.org/meetings/gb2_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting discussed the implementation of Farmers' Rights, financial rules; the funding strategy, relationship with the Global Crop Diversity Trust; implementation of the Multilateral System (MLS) for access and benefit-sharing, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;GB-2/07/REPORT,  Report of the Second Session of the Governing Body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. ftp://ftp.fao.org/ag/agp/planttreaty/gb2/gb2repe.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Third Session of the Governing Body was held in Tunis in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planttreaty.org/meetings/gb3_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting continued the unfinished business of the previous meeting and discussed, among other issues, funding strategy, compliance, sustainable use, the implementation of Farmers' Rights, relationship with the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the CGRFA, implementation of the Multilateral System (MLS) for access and benefit-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;GB-3/09/REPORT,  Report of the Third Session of the Governing Body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. ftp://ftp.fao.org/ag/agp/planttreaty/gb3/gb3repe.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Fourth Session of the Governing Body was held in Bali, Indonesia in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itpgrfa.net/International/content/gb4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222221349/http://www.itpgrfa.net/International/content/gb4 |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Governing Body meeting, Ministers adopted the Bali Declaration on the Treaty &lt;ref&gt;http://www.itpgrfa.net/International/sites/default/files/Ministerial_Declaration_Bali.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that commits them to engage in further enhancing Treaty implementation to help meet the challenges of agricultural biodiversity erosion, food insecurity, extreme poverty and the effects of climate change; and calls upon parties and relevant stakeholders to prioritize activities relevant to the MLS, sustainable use of PGRFA, and Farmers' Rights, and to mobilize more funds. With the addition of 'compliance' mechanisms and financial rules, these issues took up most negotiating time in the Governing Body meeting. The relationship of the Treaty with the CGRFA, the CBD's [[Nagoya Protocol]], the [[Global Crop Diversity Trust]] and [[Biodiversity International]] were also included in resolutions.
* The Fifth Session of the Governing Body was held in Muscat, Oman in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planttreaty.org/content/gb5&lt;/ref&gt; The session was preceded by two days of regional consultations. The Fifth Session achieved:
**a resolution on Farmers' Rights (FRs), which renewed the commitment of governments to implement Farmers' Rights ;
**a coded call to [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|UPOV]] and [[WIPO]] to report on their impacts on Farmers' Rights ;
**warm acceptance of the offer by Farmers' Organisations to produce a report for GB6 on the state of implementation of Farmers' Rights ;
**actions designed to improve the sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, linked to commitments to realise Farmers' Rights ;
**commitments to review and change the multi-lateral Access and Benefit Sharing mechanism (MLS), to prevent pillaging of the System by patents on native traits, for example ;
**significant new voluntary financial contributions from Norway for the Global Crop Diversity Trust and for the benefit sharing fund to support on-farm conservation ; 
**acceptance of the distinction between NGOs and Farmers' Organisations and the need to include representatives of farmers' social movements in negotiations ;
**a request to the Secretary to report on relevant discussions that relate to Farmers' Rights within other UN fora including the Committee on World Food Security. Civil Society including NGOs (e.g. [http://www.cenesta.org/ CENESTA]) and the International Farmers' Movement, [[La Via Campesina]], were active throughout the Session.&lt;ref&gt;CSO summary of results of GB5 http://www.ukabc.org/gb5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negotiations and entry into force ==
The treaty was under negotiation for 7 years. A previous voluntary agreement, the [[International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (IU), was adopted in 1983. However, the IU was reliant on the principle of genetic resources being the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn N. Sullivan, 2004. Plant Genetic Resources and the Law: Past, Present, and Future. Plant Physiology May 2004 vol. 135 no. 1 10-15. http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/135/1/10.full#sec-2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1993) brought genetic resources under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of national governments. However, the CBD recognised the special and distinctive nature of agricultural genetic resources: they were international - crossing countries and continents - their conservation and sustainable use requires distinctive solutions and they were important internationally for food security. Subsequently, the IU was renegotiated, to bring it in harmony with the CBD, and was renamed as a treaty. An account of the long process to achieve the treaty called ''Negotiating the Seed Treaty'' can be found at [http://practicalaction.org/docs/advocacy/negotiatingseedtreatycoupe.pdf].

The treaty was approved during the FAO Conference (31st Session resolution 3/2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/004/Y2650e/Y2650e01.htm#3&lt;/ref&gt;) on 3 November 2001, with 116 votes and 2 abstentions (USA and Japan). In accordance with its Article 25, it was opened for signatures until 4 November 2002 by all members of [[FAO]] or any state member of the [[United Nations]] or of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. It was subject to ratification, acceptance or approval (Article 26), by all members.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was open to accession a year after adoption and once closed to signatures (Article 27), i.e., on 4 November 2002. 77 countries and the European Union had signed the treaty by that date.

In accordance with Article 28, the treaty entered into force on the ninetieth day after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, provided that at least twenty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession have been deposited by Members of FAO. Having reached the required number of instruments in order for the treaty to enter into force (40) on 31 March 2004, on which date 13 instruments (including the European Union) were deposited with the Director-General of FAO, the date of entry into force was on 29 June 2004.

Plant genetic resources are essential to a [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[food security]]. FAO estimates humans have used some 10 000 species for food throughout history. However, only about 120 cultivated species provide around 90% of food requirements and 4 species (Maize, Wheat, Rice and Potatoes) provide about 60% of human dietary energy for the world's population. Of the myriad of varieties of these crops developed by farmers over millennia, which form an important part of [[agricultural biodiversity]], more than 75% have been lost in the past 100 years.

Some fear that corporate financial interests might prevent safeguarding of livelihoods, promotion of food security, biodiversity-rich farming under control of local communities, and implementation of Farmers' Rights.

Critics say many of the central issues are unresolved or open to interpretation. Some of the points raised are:

* to what extent will [[intellectual property rights]] be allowed on genetic resources in the MLS, within treaty rules: some argue an agreement aiming at open access to genetic resources for food and agriculture should not allow restrictive property rights, and the treaty says in Article 12.3.d that ''"Recipients shall not claim any intellectual property or other rights that limit the facilitated access to the plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, or their genetic parts or components, in the form received from the Multilateral System"'';
* to what extent will farmers and communities be allowed to freely use, exchange, sell and breed the [[seed]]s, and what enforcement procedures will be used by national governments to ensure principles of Farmers' Rights will be respected;
*The mechanism for dispute settlement under the Third Party Beneficiary and the role of FAO.
*The first group of 11 projects funded by the treaty was announced during the Third Session of the Governing Body in Tunis in June 2009. The projects were funded according to criteria established by the Governing Body including regional balance: 5 from Latin America, 5 from Africa and 1 from Asia.  The ranking of the projects was done by a Group of Experts nominated by the 7 regional representatives of the Bureau and the final approval was done by the Bureau on behalf of the Governing Body.
* while the whole Brassica family (Cruciferae) including all its sub-species and varieties is in the MLS the total number of food crops and forages and their relatives included in the treaty is very limited. Soya, sugar cane, oil palm and groundnut are among important crops missing from the list in Annex 1.

The treaty came into force on 29 June 2004 at which time there were more than 54 ratifications by countries. An article prepared on the occasion of the treaty becoming law is posted at [http://www.ukabc.org/itpgrfa29june2004.htm]. From the entry into force, countries that previously signed are allowed to ratify the treaty, while countries that did not sign the treaty before it came into force can also accede to it.  The instrument of ratification has to be deposited with the Director-General of FAO.

== Participating countries ==
There are 144 contracting parties to the Treaty (143 states and the European Union) as of September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/legal/docs/033s-e.pdf Treaty status], fao.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of crops covered in Annex 1 ==
Even foods that have been part of a culture for centuries often are indigenous to a region on the other side of the world.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Khoury, C.K.; Achicanoy, H.A.; Bjorkman, A.D.; Navarro-Racines, C.; Guarino, L.; Flores-Palacios, X.; Engels, J.M.M.; Wiersema, J.H.; Dempewolf, H.; Sotelo, S.; Ramírez-Villegas, J.; Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P.; Fowler, C.; Jarvis, A.; Rieseberg, L.H.; Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

As people ventured forth, looking for new lands, their seeds were part of their diasporas. As a result, we now live in a world in which not one country can be considered self-sufficient in terms of being able to survive solely on crops indigenous within its borders. The Treaty facilitates the continued open exchange of food crops and their genetic materials.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.fao.org/ag/agp/planttreaty/training/brochure07_en.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of plant genetic material included in the Multilateral System of the Treaty is made of major food crops and forages.  The Forages are also divided in legume forages and grass forages. They were selected taking into account the criteria of food security and country interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Flores Palacios, 1998.

==History==
Kemp Little was founded in 1997 by Richard Kemp after he left a law firm under the now defunct firm Andersen Legal, called Garretts.&lt;ref name="Steve Hoare"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Hoare |url= http://www.thelawyer.com/firm-profile-kemp-little/130197.article |title= Firm profile: Kemp Little |publisher=The Lawyer |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally launched as Kemp &amp; Co., Kemp spent the first few weeks of the company’s inception practising on his own before his colleague Ashley Winton joined him, before he moved on to [[White &amp; Case]].&lt;ref name="Steve Hoare"/&gt;

With its focus on technology, the law firm was able to ride the [[Dotcom boom]], growing rapidly and even avoiding damage when the ‘bubble’ burst. However, when the boom did end, growth did slow down notably. Jonathan Little joined the company in 1999 and Kemp &amp; Co. became Kemp Little two years later in 2001. At the same time, Kemp Little became the first law firm ever to transfer to [[LLP]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal500.com/firms/4863-kemp-little-llp/offices/8855-london-england/profile |title=Kemp Little LLP |publisher=The Legal 500 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Little quit in 2005 to join [[Simmons &amp; Simmons]] but Kemp kept his surname in the brand as it was by now well established.&lt;ref name="Steve Hoare"/&gt;

In May 2014, Richard Kemp left the law firm to establish his own [[IT]] boutique, Kemp IT Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathon Manning |url= http://www.thelawyer.com/analysis/the-lawyer-business-leadership/financial-news/kemp-littles-revenue-jumps-32-per-cent-to-break-through-10m-threshold/3035899.article?adfesuccess=1  |title= Kemp Little’s revenue jumps 32 per cent to break through £10m threshold |publisher=The Lawyer |date=5 June 2015 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Queen's Counsel}}
The '''Law Officers of the Commonwealth''' are the chief legal advisers to [[the Crown]], and advise and represent the central and devolved governments in the [[United Kingdom]] and national and sub-national governments in other [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

In [[England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]] and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[British colony|colonial]] governments, the chief law officer of the Crown is the [[Attorney General]].   In England and Wales the Attorney General is supported by the Solicitor General.  Following [[devolution]] of justice to the [[Scottish Parliament]] a new position of [[Advocate General for Scotland]] was created to advise the [[UK Government]] on matters of [[Scots law]].  So there are '''three UK Government Law Officers''': the Attorney General, the Solicitor General and the Advocate General for Scotland. 

There are also '''two Scottish Government Law Officers'''.  In [[Scotland]], the chief law officer to the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland is the [[Lord Advocate]].  The Lord Advocate is supported by the Solicitor General for Scotland.

==England and Wales==
The [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], a member of the [[UK Government]], is similarly the chief law officer of the Crown in England and Wales and advises and represents the Crown and government departments in court. By convention, and unlike the papers of other ministers, this legal advice is available to subsequent governments. In the second half of the 20th century it became unusual for the Attorney General to be formally a member of the Cabinet. Rather he/she would attend only when the Cabinet required legal advice.

The Attorney General oversees the small [[Attorney General's Office (UK)|Attorney General's Office]] and also has responsibility for the [[Government Legal Department]], which is headed by the [[Treasury Solicitor]]. In practice, the [[Treasury Solicitor]] (who also has the title of Procurator General) normally provides the lawyers or briefs Treasury Counsel to appear in court, although the Attorney General may appear in person. The person appointed to this role provides legal advice to the Government, acts as the representative of the public interest and resolves issues between government departments. The [[Government Legal Department]] provides advice to Government Departments, instructing independent counsel where necessary.  The Attorney General is a barrister and can appear in court in person, though in practice he/she rarely does so, and then only in cases of outstanding national importance.  In those cases the [[Government Legal Department]] provides his back-up. When appearing in court in person he/she is addressed by the judge as "Mr Attorney".

The Attorney General also has supervisory powers over prosecutions, including those mounted by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], headed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]]; the [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]]; and the [[Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office]]. While the Attorney General is not personally involved with prosecutions, some prosecutions (e.g. [[riot]]) cannot be commenced without their consent, and they have the power to halt prosecutions generally. Criminal prosecutions are the responsibility of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], headed by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]. The Attorney General may appeal cases to the higher courts where, although the particular case is settled, there may be a point of law of public importance at issue.

The Attorney General has public interest functions, being, for example, the [[trustee]] of default where a sole trustee has died, and can also take cases to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] where points of general legal importance need to be settled.

The Attorney General's deputy is the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]], currently [[Robert Buckland]]. Under the [[Law Officers Act 1997]], the Solicitor General may do anything on behalf of, or in the place of, the Attorney General, and vice versa.

Under the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], the [[Counsel General for Wales]] is the chief legal adviser to, and a member of, the [[Welsh Government]].

==Scotland==
Under the recent constitutional reforms, the [[Lord Advocate]] has become an officer of the [[Scottish Government]], while the [[United Kingdom]] Government is advised on [[Scots law]] by the [[Advocate General for Scotland]]. The Lord Advocate, currently [[James Wolffe]], heads the [[Crown Office|Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] and is the chief [[public prosecutor]] in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is assisted by the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], currently [[Alison Di Rollo]].  
==Northern Ireland==
Since the prorogation of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1972, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] was also Attorney General for Northern Ireland. The separate office of [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]] was re-created alongside the new office of [[Advocate General for Northern Ireland]] upon the devolution of policing and justice powers to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] on 12 April 2010. As a result, these functions were split between: 

* The [[Advocate General for Northern Ireland]], who is the chief legal adviser to the [[UK Government]] on Northern Ireland law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx Attorney General's Office: Statement on Northern Ireland devolution, 12 April 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705174807/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx |date= 5 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post is held by the Attorney General for England and Wales by virtue of office. 
* The [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]], who is the chief legal adviser to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;section 22, Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Larkin (Northern Ireland)|John Larkin]] QC was appointed to that position on 24 May 2010 by the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-may-2010/news-ofmdfm-240510-appointment-of-attorney.htm OFMDFM: Appointment of Attorney General announced, 24 May 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424105404/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-may-2010/news-ofmdfm-240510-appointment-of-attorney.htm |date=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth==
Most Commonwealth and colonial governments also have their own attorneys general. Sometimes the legal advisers of subnational governments are given the title [[advocate general]]. In Hong Kong, apart from the [[Solicitor General]] and the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|Crown Prosecutor]] (the Director of Public Prosecutions before 1997), there are also the Law Officer (Civil), the Law Officer (International) and the Law Draftsman. All these five offices are "Law Officers" reporting to the Attorney General (known since 1997 as the Secretary for Justice).

In [[Canada]] the term law officers are not used, but the title holders with similar roles are:
* [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] is also the Attorney General of Canada
* [[Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], who was formerly the [[Solicitor General of Canada]]

==Other persons==
Some subjects are entitled to have an attorney general: these include a [[queen consort]] and the [[Prince of Wales]], who has an Attorney General for the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. There is also an Attorney General for the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is a mostly landed inheritance that is held by the Crown (in trust for the [[monarch|monarch)]] and administered independently of the monarch under the supervision of a government minister, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

==Defunct offices==
Before the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, the legal advisers to the Crown in the Courts of Ireland were the [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] and the [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]]. These offices became redundant in 1921. 

The Crown also had a legal adviser for the [[High Court of Admiralty]], known as the [[Admiralty Advocate]], but this office lapsed in 1875 when the Admiralty Court became part of the [[Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice]].

The Crown's representative in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] of England was the [[King's Advocate]] (or [[Queen's Advocate]] when the monarch was female). This office has been vacant since the resignation of its last holder in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Haydn's ''Book of Dignities'', 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Li livres de jostice et de plet'''('''z''')'' ("The Book of Justice and of Pleas") is an [[Old French]] legal treatise compiled by the [[postglossator]]s of the school of [[Orléans]] in the mid-thirteenth century (c. 1260). It was influenced by [[canon law]] (especially the [[decretals]] of [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]]), [[Roman law]] (especially the ''[[Pandects|Digest]]''), the [[customary law]] of the Orléanais, and the legislation of the [[House of Capet|Capet]]ian [[Kings of France]]. It does not have the sense of a finished work, possesses ''[[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]]e'', and is somewhat disorganised, being possibly the work of a student of the [[University of Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, p. 62 n16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first book of the ''Livres'' is a free translation of the first three paragraphs of the ''Digest''. It is not a ''[[coutoumier]]'' (compilation of customary law) and most of the customary law it cites is limited to Orléans. Among the royal acts it reproduces is one of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] from 1254, in which the king depicted as judge declares himself the guardian of the peace and rest of his subjects: ''nos deserrens de la dete de la real poesté la pez et le respous de nos sojeiz''. The ''Livres'' may have influenced the later legislation of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. 

==Examples==
;Feudalism
With regards to the [[law of fiefs]], the ''Livres'' states that [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[viscount]]s, and [[baron]]s could all hold their land from one another.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p .288.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Livres'' also states that ''la bone devise de droit des persones, des gens, est tele que tot homes ou il sont franc ou serf'': "the good division of the law of persons is that all men are either free or servile."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This law is based on the ''Digest'' but the meaning of the word ''servi'' that the medieval author translates "[[serf]]" meant "[[slave]]". 

;Laws of war
The ''Livres'', by defining treason (''traïson'') as ''férir, et l'en ne voie pas le cop venir'' (to wound [someone], and when the blow could not be seen coming), declared all [[crossbow]]men to be traitors, since nobody could see their blows coming. 

;Sexual crimes
The ''Livres'' has provided scholars with unique insight into medieval legal attitudes to sexual crimes. It does not lay out punishment for [[prostitute]]s, preferring to reintegrate them into society in accordance with canon law. It does, however, prescribe the banishment and confiscation of property of the ''maquerel des femmes'' ([[procurer]]) and the owner of a [[brothel]] (''bordelerie'').&lt;ref&gt;Otis, p. 162 n32.&lt;/ref&gt; It also describes penalties for male [[homosexuality]] and is the first known work to describe penalties for [[lesbianism]] as well. On the first offence the male sodomite was to be [[castrated]], on the second [[dismembered]], and on the third burned alive. The lesbian offender was to be dismembered on the first two offences (although exactly what two "members" were to be cut off is uncertain) and burned alive on the third. All their goods accrued to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, pp. 289&amp;ndash;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

[http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020808-9999_1n8feldman.html “Lawyer says case against defendant is 'guesswork',"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 8 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Harriet. [http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html “Experts: Girl's prints found in Westerfield's RV,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211022/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html |date=4 February 2009 }} Court TV, 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One orange fiber with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibers with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV). Contrary to media reports, only a few items from her house were tested so that can’t be excluded as the source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html “Witnesses for the Prosecution,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227001224/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html |date=27 December 2008 }} Court TV, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the clothes of Danielle and her family during the cookie sale were not determined and eliminated. There were apparently two different types of the orange fibers, dull and very bright (so the number which matched might have been much less than 200).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html “A Single Strand,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406142035/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html |date=6 April 2009 }} Court TV, photogallery, evidence28, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; There were red fibers with her [[fingernails]], and many other fibers with her body, which could not be matched to his environment.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The only non-Danielle hair found with her body wasn’t his, nor was any desert sand reported with the body, and no soil or vegetation from the dump site was reported on his shoes, laundry, shovel or RV.

To explain why so much expected evidence was missing, the prosecution argued that he went on a cleaning frenzy, and tossed out evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4997">{{Legislature}}
A '''lower house''' is one of two [[debate chamber|chambers]] of a [[bicameral]] [[legislature]], the other chamber being the [[upper house]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bicameralism'' (1997) by George Tsebelis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its official position "below" the upper house, in many legislatures worldwide, the lower house has come to wield more power. The lower house typically is the more numerous of the two chambers. A legislature composed of only one house is described as [[unicameral]].

== Common attributes ==
In comparison with the upper house, lower houses frequently display certain characteristics.
;Powers:
* In a [[parliamentary system]], the lower house:
**In the modern era, has much more power, usually based on restrictions against the upper house.
**Able to override the upper house in some ways.
**Can vote a [[motion of no confidence]] against the government.
**Exceptions are [[Australia]], where the Senate has considerable power approximate to that of the House of Representatives, and Italy, where the Senate has exactly the same powers as the Chamber of Deputies.
* In a [[presidential system]], the lower house:
** Debatably somewhat less, the lower house also has exclusive powers in some areas.
** Given the sole power to impeach the executive (the upper house then tries the [[impeachment]]).
** Frequently, bills to raise revenue and to appropriate funds must originate in the lower house.
;Status of lower house:
* Always elected directly, while the upper house may be elected directly, indirectly, or not elected at all.
* Its members may be elected with a different voting system to the upper house.
* Most populated [[administrative division]]s are better represented than in the upper house; representation is usually proportional to population.
* [[Election|Elected]] more frequently.
* Elected all at once, not by staggered terms.
* In a parliamentary system, can be dissolved by the executive.
* More members.
* Has total or original control over budget and monetary laws.
* Lower [[age of candidacy]] than the upper house.

== Titles of lower houses ==
=== Common names ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11052">'''Lèse majesté in Norway''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''majestetsfornærmelse'', ''majestetsforbrytelse'', ''crimen (læsæ) majestatis'', etc.) was judicially based and defined in [[Norway|Norway's]] [[Penal Code (Norway)|1902 Penal Code]], which provided fines or prison for this [[crime]]. Often related to political conflicts, accusations of [[lèse majesté]] were frequent in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and many cases resulted in [[execution]]. Virtually no legal actions have been taken after 1905. The last to be charged for lèse majesté was a man who attacked Queen [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] with a [[tomato]] during her [[state visit]] in 1981. As of 2015, lèse majesté is no longer a criminal offence in Norway.

== Laws ==
=== Current law ===
On 1 October 2015, the 2005 Penal Code entered into effect, after which lèse majesté is no longer a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-05-20-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1814 [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway]] states in article 5 that the King's person is holy and that he may not be blamed or accused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-18140517-000-003.html Grunnloven, § 5] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Kongens Person er hellig; han kan ikke lastes, eller anklages.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former laws ===
[[File:Christian V (Abraham Wuchters).jpg|thumb|King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V's]] Norwegian Law of 1687 provided, alike older and newer laws, capital punishment for lèse majesté]]

According to the 1902 [[Penal Code (Norway)|Penal Code]], article 100, a person should be punished with 21 years of prison if he causes, attempts to cause or contributes to the death of the King or of the Regent.

Article 101 said: "If any defamation is exercised against the King or the Regent, the guilty is punished with a fine or up to five years of prison."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#101 Straffeloven, § 101] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Forøves nogen Ærekrenkelse mod Kongen eller Regenten, straffes den skyldige med Hefte eller Fængsel indtil 5 Aar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 102 provided similar protection to other members of the Royal House.

Article 103 stated that prosecutions demand either the command or the acceptance of the King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#103 Straffeloven, § 103] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to article 96, foreign heads of state enjoyed, on certain conditions and when visiting or staying in the Kingdom, protection against lèse majesté.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html#96 Straffeloven, § 96] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 100-102 were amended in 1981. Article 103 has remained the same since 1902. The 1902 penal code was gradually replaced by the 2005 penal code.

The 1842 Penal Code contained provisions concerning "violations of the body or the health"&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Fornærmelser paa Legeme eller Helbred}}&lt;/ref&gt; of (article 9–13) the [[King]], (article 9–17) the [[Queen consort]], the [[Queen dowager]], and the [[Royal family|Royal]] [[Prince]]s and [[Princess]]es. The punishment was lifetime [[slavery]] or [[capital punishment]].

King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V's]] Norwegian Law of 1687, article 6–4–1, stated:

{{Quote|Who to [the Majesties'] disgrace accuse the King or the Queen, or attracts their or their children's life, has forfeited honour, life, and estate, the right hand to be cut off him alive. The body is parted and placed on the [[breaking wheel]], and the head together with the hand are placed on a stake. If the malefactor gets away and cannot suffer on his body, then the punishment shall be done on a picture or an imitation of him. If the malefactor is of the nobility or higher estate, then his [[coat of arms|arms]] shall be destroyed by the executioner, and all his heirs of the body lose their estate [i.e. noble status] and stem [i.e. ancestry].&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Hvo som laster Kongen, eller Dronningen, til Beskæmmelse, eller deris og deris Børns Liv eftertragter, have forbrut Ære, Liv og Gods, den højre Haand af hannem levendis afhuggis. Kroppen parteris og læggis paa Stægle og Hiul, og Hovedet med Haanden sættis paa en Stage. Undkommer Misdæderen, og ikke kand lide paa Legemet, da bør Straffen at skee paa hans Billede og Efterlignelse. Er Misdæderen af Adel, eller højere Stand, da skal hans Vaaben af Bødelen sønderbrydis, og alle hans Livs Arvinger miste deris Stand og Stamme.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Cases ==
=== Mediaeval cases ===
* 1301: Execution of [[False Margaret]] and a German man
* 1302: Execution of Baron [[Audun Hugleiksson]]

=== Case of Lykke ===
In the end of the 1650s, Danish nobleman [[Kai Lykke]] wrote a letter to [[Corfitz Ulfeld]] in which he accused Queen [[Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Sophie Amalie of Denmark and Norway]] of sleeping together with her servants. The letter's content was presented to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III of Denmark and Norway]], and Lykke confessed it. Few months later, he went into exile. The King initiated a trial in which Lykke was found guilty, and he was sentenced to forfeit honour, life, and estate. As Lykke had escaped and could not be executed, an imitational doll was made for and used in a ceremony where it got its right hand cut off and thereafter was beheaded. Also Lykke's [[coat of arms]] was destroyed. His large estates were confiscated by the Crown.

=== Case of Count Griffenfeld ===
In 1676, Danish and Norwegian count [[Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld]] was accused of and sentenced for lèse majesté and other crimes. Bearing his destroyed coat of arms, Griffenfeld was transported to the place of execution. However, just seconds before the sword was to behead Griffenfeld, an officer acting on behalf of King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V of Denmark and Norway]] shouted "Stop, it is [[pardon]]!", whereafter his sentence was changed to lifetime prison.

=== Case of Juel ===
In 1723, [[Povel Juel]] was executed at the [[Nytorv|New Square]] in [[Copenhagen]] after having been sentenced on King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V's]] Danish Law of 1683, articles 6-4-1 and 6-4-2. His alleged contribution to possible occupation of [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark and Norway]] was considered an attack on the King rather than on the two countries.

=== Case of Count Struensee and Count Brandt ===
[[File:Struensees henrettelse.jpg|thumb|Contemporary depiction of ex-counts [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Struensee]] and [[Enevold Brandt|Brandt]] being executed]]
[[File:Rifleringen.png|thumb|Front cover of ''Rifleringen'']]

A famous case of lèse majesté is that of Count [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] and Count [[Enevold Brandt]], who in 1772 were accused of and sentenced for this and several other crimes, whereafter they were executed by [[beheading]] and placed on the [[breaking wheel]].

=== Case of Heiberg ===
In 1799, the [[Government of Denmark|Danish Chancery]] initiated a process against Dano-Norwegian man [[Peter Andreas Heiberg]],&lt;ref name="Lexow"&gt;Lexow, Carl: ''P.A. Heiberg : Borger av menneskeligheten'' 2010, Novus forlag. {{ISBN|978-82-7099-590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom they accused of lèse majesté and whom Crown Prince [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick of Denmark and Norway]]—the real initiator of the process—considered a troublesome political opponent. The Crown Prince wrote in a letter of 24 July that he considered Heiberg's magazine "exceedingly shameless".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|overmaade skammelig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter of 21 August, the Crown Prince wrote in general that "no mercy"&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|ingen Eftergivenhed}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to be shown and that "fear has to be chased into these humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Frygt maa jages i disse Mennesker}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the Chancery initiate a trial and subsequently execute them. However, the Chancery considered that popular opinion in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] made an execution of Heiberg too dangerous. Instead, he was [[Exile|banished]] from the Kingdoms. Heiberg settled in [[Paris]], where he lived until his death in 1841.

=== Case of Lysne ===
In 1803, having led a group of [[Lærdal]] farmers who claimed to be exempt from compulsory military service, farmer [[Anders Olsen Lysne]] was executed by beheading.&lt;ref&gt;Krefting, Nøding and Ringvei 2014. Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to obey the King's commands was considered treason against the country: in an absolute monarchy, this was in practise equal to treason against the King himself, i.e. lèse majesté.

=== Case of Hielm ===
''[[Det norske Nationalblad]]'' (1815–1822; English: ''The Norwegian National Magazine'') was an oppositional magazine in [[Oslo]]. Through its publishers, the magazine was involved in a case of lèse majesté, after which it lost its postage reduction, forcing it to shut down. In 1825, one of the said publishers, [[Jonas Anton Hielm]], was sentenced to pay a fine of 500 [[speciedaler]].

=== Case of Løberg ===
In 1878, Member of Parliament [[Hjalmar Løberg]] was sentenced for lèse majesté because of an article, published in the magazine ''[[Hardangeren]]'', where he claimed that King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]] had political motivations for giving a medal to a specific [[member of parliament]].

=== Case of Hol ===
In 1884, [[Jon Hol|Jon Gundersen Hol]] was arrested, accused of lèse majesté in his pamphlet ''Rifleringen'' (English: ''The Ring of Rifles''). The pamphlet, published on 6 February, called upon semi-military personnel and other civilians possessing weapons to encircle and protect the [[Storting|Parliament]] in the case a [[coup d'état]], thereby indirectly accusing King Oscar II of having such plans. On 8 February, samples of the pamphlet were confiscated by the police, and at the same time, the printer Nikolai Olsen was arrested. The apprehension of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and on 11 May, he was charged for lèse majesté. [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] and [[Lars Holst]] faced the same charge. However, proceedings were stayed after the fall of the conservative government of [[Christian Selmer]].

=== 1981 case ===
In 1981, a protesting [[Punk subculture|punk]] was charged with lèse majesté for throwing a [[tomato]] at, but failing to hit Queen [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], who was in [[Oslo]] on her second [[state visit]] to [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Aftenposten (6 May 1981): ''Dronningen var målet'' [...] (English: ''The Queen was the Target'' [...])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aftenposten (7 May 1981): ''Punker siktet for majestetsforbrytelse'' (English: ''Punker Charged for Lèse Majesté'')&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">{{Politics of Mali}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Mali]] on 2 June 1974, following the 1968 military coup. The new constitution would allow for a directly elected [[List of heads of state of Mali|president]] (previously the post had been elected by the [[National Assembly of Mali|National Assembly]] who would serve five-year terms, together with a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] National Assembly. It also proposed that the country be run for the next five years by the Military Committee for National Liberation.

The new constitution was reportedly approved by 99.66% of voters with a 92.2% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/ml.html Elections in Mali] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maples and Calder''' is a multi–jurisdictional law firm headquartered in the [[Cayman Islands]], with offices in traditional [[tax havens]] and [[corporate tax haven]]s. It is a member of the [[offshore magic circle]].  The firm specialises in advising on the laws of the Cayman Islands, [[Ireland]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]], across a range of legal services including commercial litigation, intellectual property, sport, and finance, in which the firm has a focus on the structuring of tax efficient legal structures (or vehicles), and executing [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") type transactions for corporations.

==History==

'''MacDonald and Maples''' was founded by Jim MacDonald and [[John Maples]]. MacDonald later retired and Douglas Calder joined as a partner, resulting in the name of the firm being changed to Maples and Calder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maplesandcalder.com/news/article/maples-and-calders-co-founding-partner-passes-298/|title=Founding Partner passes|author=Maples and Calder|date=9 June 2012|quote=Lord Maples first partnered with fellow lawyer, James MacDonald, in the 1960s and later with Douglas Calder to form the partnership of Maples and Calder, now a leading international law firm. His contributions and impact on the legal profession in the Cayman Islands were notable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today it is often referred to simply as '''Maples''' and is headquartered in [[Ugland House]] in the Cayman Islands.

The Cayman Islands office was opened in the early 1960s, followed by the Hong Kong office in 1995. Three years later, the London office opened its doors, with the British Virgin Islands and Dubai office establishing a presence in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Maples and Calder opened a Dublin office in 2006. 
2012 saw the opening of a second office in Asia, when their Singapore office opened in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Maples boosts offshore presence in Singapore | url = http://www.thelawyer.com/maples-boosts-offshore-presence-in-singapore/1014204.article | accessdate = 2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alasdair Robertson is the firm's global managing partner and is based in the Cayman Islands office.

==Practice areas==

The principal focus is on tax management (e.g. structuring and domiciling of tax vehicles, corporate transactions for [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based]] and [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based]] based erosion and profit shifting (or [[BEPS]]) actions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8aff482c-c4a3-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656|title=Offshore Magic Circle law firms fear Paradise Papers fallout|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=10 November 2017|author=Madison Marraige|quote=The “offshore magic circle”, a term given to the top firms based in the Caribbean and the Channel Islands that specialise in helping clients move money to low-tax countries, include Ogier, Mourant Ozannes, Walkers, and Maples and Calder, as well as Appleby.  “All offshore firms are terrified about this,” said one partner at a UK-based law firm, speaking privately. Another said: “The offshore firms are in complete company lockdown.” Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, added: “There will be some concern the heavens will come down on [these firms]. There will be collateral damage for the offshore centres.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Maples and Calder in Bloomberg Business Week | url = http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1664206 | accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maples and Calder also offers a range of other tax focused legal services, including providing advice on major infrastructure and property development projects (domiciled in offshore [[tax havens]] or [[corporate tax haven]]s), and the establishment and structuring of a "physical presence" in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and Dublin, including business licensing, real estate, immigration and employment law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/maples-calder-tax-haven-dublin-75-jobs-492262-Jun2012/|title=Law firm specialising in tax havens to create 75 jobs in Dublin|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=19 June 2012|quote=AN INTERNATIONAL corporate and finance law company which advises international clients on the laws of global tax havens – including Ireland – is to create 75 new jobs in Dublin over the next three years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], described Ugland House, the then legal home of 12,000 U.S. corporations as: "That's either the biggest building in the world or the biggest tax scam in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7972695.stm|title=Tax Spotlight worries the Cayman Islands|date=March 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|quote=During last year's US presidential campaign, Mr Obama referred to a building in the Cayman Islands that, he said, supposedly housed 12,000 US–based corporations. "That's either the biggest building in the world or the biggest tax scam in the world," he said. The building Mr Obama talked about is Ugland House, the head office of the international law firm Maples and Calder. Situated on the outskirts of Georgetown, it is actually the address of almost 19,000 companies. For some, the building has come to symbolise the drain on the economies of the big nations, a view rejected by the law firm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Maples and Calder has maintained its position as the largest Cayman Islands law firm, holding top rankings for finance, corporate, investment funds and litigation in legal directories such as Chambers and Partners, Legal 500,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Maples and Calder | url = http://www.legal500.com/firms/51273-maples-and-calder/54100-grand-cayman | accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Practical Law Company (PLC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The offshore law firm elite | url = http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-500-2422 | accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only [[offshore magic circle]] law firm to ever achieve Tier 1 in every category of the International Financial Law Review (IFLR).

==Locations==

Maples and Calder maintains a multi–jurisdictional network of offices in leading Caribbean and Channel Islands offshore [[tax havens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Who's Who Legal Profile | url = http://www.whoswholegal.com/firms/132/maples-calder/ | accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, [[Dubai]], and [[Jersey]].  As with other [[offshore magic circle]] law firms, Maples and Calder have also opened up offices in the major [[corporate tax haven]]s, and particularly [[Dublin]] and [[Singapore]] (see [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]).

'''The Microinsurance Centre''' was created in 2000 by Michael J. McCord.  It is as an independent institution dedicated to promoting responsible [[microinsurance]], with their focus on the partner-agent model.  The partner-agent model links [[microinsurance scheme]]s (hosted primarily by MFIs) to established commercial [[insurance]] companies.  This link allows the risk of the schemes to remain with the insurer, and thereby can enable greater sustainability and long-term viability.

The Microinsurance Centre works on two fronts, helping to establish proper dialogue on micro-insurance policies and helping to set up proper [[microinsurance scheme]]s.  They have a wide range of partners that they work with, including insurers, regulators, donors, [[Microfinance institution|MFIs]], and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].  They have played a role in projects in numerous countries that include Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, India, Nepal, Jordan, Peru, Laos, and Indonesia.  They are also actively involved in disseminating information on micro-insurance through their periodic Briefing Notes, web site, and speaking engagements.  In addition, they have conducted several country case studies and held trainings in Italy, Uganda, and Pakistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">The '''National Association of Enrolled Agents''' ('''NAEA''') is an organization of [[enrolled agent]]s (EAs) in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1972, it claims a membership of 11,000 EAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.About NAEA|url=http://www.naea.org/about-naea}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While its mission statement presents itself publicly as an advocate of taxpayer rights, its primary functions are educating tax professionals in best practices for representing taxpayers to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), protecting the interests of the profession, and expanding the role of enrolled agents in both the public and private sectors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Requirements ==
Enrolled Agent status is required for NAEA membership, although EA status does not need to be ''active''. Inactive/retired EA's may retain their membership. NAEA members have slightly higher Continuing Professional Education requirements than is normally required by the IRS to retain EA status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Continuing professional education ==
NAEA offers [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) webinars and seminars for EAs and presents a professional conference, the NTPI annually. The NTPI (National Tax Practice Institute) is a fellowship of NAEA members that meet very specific educational standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naea.org/events-education/national-tax-practice-institute | title=National Tax Practice Institute | publisher=NAEA | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111034844/http://www.naea.org/events-education/national-tax-practice-institute | archivedate=November 11, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the CE Webinars, NAEA offers continuing education for tax professionals through the EA Journal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webinars {{!}} NAEA|url=http://www.naea.org/education-events/ce-webinars-level-1-online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605233747/http://www.naea.org/education-events/ce-webinars-level-1-online|archivedate=2013-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarships ==
Each year the NAEA offers scholarships through the National Association of Enrolled Agents Education Foundation (NAEA-EF). The exact number and nature of these scholarships varies slightly from year to year but they are available to both practicing Enrolled Agents and tax professionals aspiring to the position. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Organization ==
The NAEA is led by a board comprising two officers and twelve directors. In addition there are twelve independently chaired committees.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

'''Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI)''' is a category of [[intellectual capital]] defined by the [[United States Navy]] to be "classified or unclassified information concerning the design, arrangement, development, manufacture, testing, operation, administration, training, maintenance, and repair of the propulsion plants of naval nuclear-powered ships and prototypes, including the associated shipboard and shore-based nuclear support facilities.." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/09000%20General%20Ship%20Design%20and%20Support/09-200%20Propulsion%20Plants%20Support/N9210.3%20(Unclas%20Portion).pdf
|title=OPNAVINST N9210.3, SAFEGUARDING OF NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION (NNPI), 6/7/2010, Unclassified Portion, page 1-1, Definition|accessdate=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all NNPI is [[classified information]].  While most NNPI is sensitive, the Navy recognizes that the public has an interest in [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[safety]], and [[health]] information, and that the basic [[research]] carried out by the Navy can be useful to [[industry]].  Unclassified information is therefore marked with the acronym "U-NNPI", but is still restricted as [[wikt:NOFORN|NOFORN]].&lt;ref&gt;See OPNAVINST N9210.3, esp. Chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

NNPI is explicitly protected information and is not released to the general public without authority.  Those who release even NNPI-U without authority may be administratively punished, and even [[criminal law|criminally]] in the case of NNPI-C.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  NNPI is restricted from disclosure under the Arms Export Control Act, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2778 22 USC §§2778] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2794 2794(7)]; such information is listed in the [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=d148ef6a9390b1e27fc09865c734666c;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.13.60;idno=22;cc=ecfr US Munitions List, 22 CFR §121.1], Category VI, paragraph (g).  

In some instances, small events that would normally be reported as "Events" or LOC (Loss of Control) to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] from other licensees can be classified as NNPI-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/national/dangerous-tennessee-radioactive-spill-kept-from-public-papers-sealed/article_70fed1e3-e100-5f8e-91b6-4535b39289d6.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13082">'''Neo-medievalism''' (or '''neomedievalism''', '''new medievalism''') is a term with a long history&lt;ref&gt;"neo-medieval", s.v. "neo-, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 27 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; that has acquired specific technical senses in two branches of scholarship. In political theory about modern [[international relations]], where the term is originally associated with [[Hedley Bull]], it sees the political order of a globalized world as analogous to high-medieval Europe, where neither states nor the Church, nor other territorial powers, exercised full sovereignty, but instead participated in complex, overlapping and incomplete sovereignties.&lt;ref name=Kobrin&gt;Stephen J. Kobrin. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.131.6106&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy"].&lt;/ref&gt; In literary theory about the use and abuse of texts and tropes from the Middle Ages in [[postmodernity]]. The use of ''neomedieval'' in this sense was popularized by the Italian medievalist [[Umberto Eco]] in his 1986 essay "Dreaming of the Middle Ages".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], "Dreaming of the Middle Ages," in ''Travels in Hyperreality'', transl. by W. Weaver, NY: Harcourt Brace, 1986, pp. 61–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==
The idea of neomedievalism in political theory was first discussed in 1977 by theorist [[Hedley Bull]] in ''[[The Anarchical Society|The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics]]'' to describe the erosion of state [[sovereignty]] in the contemporary globalized world:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also conceivable that sovereign states might disappear and be replaced not by a world government but by a modern and secular equivalent of the kind of universal political organisation that existed in Western Christendom in the Middle Ages. In that system no ruler or state was sovereign in the sense of being supreme over a given territory and a given segment of the Christian population; each had to share authority with vassals beneath, and with the Pope and (in Germany and Italy) the Holy Roman Emperor above. The universal political order of Western Christendom represents an alternative to the system of states which does not yet embody universal government.&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), pp. 245–46 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus Bull suggested society might move towards "a new mediaevalism" or a "neo-mediaeval form of universal political order", in which individual notions of rights and a growing sense of a "world common good" were undermining [[Nation-state|national]] [[sovereignty]]. He proposed that such a system might help "avoid the classic dangers of the system of sovereign states by a structure of overlapping structures and cross-cutting loyalties that hold all peoples together in a universal society while at the same time avoiding the concentration inherent in a world government", though "if it were anything like the precedent of Western Christendom, it would contain more ubiquitous and continuous violence and insecurity than does the modern states system".&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), p. 246 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

In this reading, [[globalization]] has resulted in an international system which resembles the medieval one, where political authority was exercised by a range of non-territorial and overlapping agents, such as religious bodies, [[principalities]], [[empires]] and [[city-states]], instead of by a single political authority in the form of a state which has complete sovereignty over its territory. Comparable processes characterising Bull's "new medievalism" include the increasing powers held by regional organisations such as the [[European Union]], as well as the spread of sub-national and devolved governments, such as those of [[Scotland]] and [[Catalonia]]. These challenge the exclusive authority of the state. [[Private military companies]], [[multinational corporations]] and the resurgence of worldwide religious movements (e.g. [[political Islam]]) similarly indicate a reduction in the role of the state and a decentralisation of power and authority.

[[Stephen J. Kobrin]] in 1998 added the forces of the digital world economy to the picture of neomedievalism. In an article entitled "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy" in the ''Journal of International Affairs'',&lt;ref name="Kobrin" /&gt; he argued that the sovereign state as we know it{{snd}}defined within certain territorial borders{{snd}}is about to change profoundly, if not to wither away, due in part to the digital world economy created by the Internet, suggesting that cyberspace is a trans-territorial domain operating outside of the jurisdiction of national law.

[[Anthony Clark Arend]] also argued in his 1999 book ''Legal Rules and International Society'' that the international system is moving toward a "neo-medieval" system. He claimed that the trends that Bull noted in 1977 had become even more pronounced by the end of the twentieth century. Arend argues that the emergence of a "neo-medieval" system would have profound implications for the creation and operation of international law.

Although Bull originally envisioned neomedievalism as a positive trend, it has its critics. [[Bruce Holsinger]] in ''Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror'' argues that [[neoconservative]]s "have exploited neomedievalism's conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|title=Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|accessdate=2017-12-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102062453/http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|archivedate=2017-01-02|deadurl=no|quote=While international-relations theorists promote neomedievalism as a model for understanding emergent modes of global sovereignty, neoconservatives exploit its conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Philip G. Cerny's "Neomedievalism, Civil War and the New Security Dilemma" (1998) also sees neomedievalism as a negative development and claims that the forces of globalization increasingly undermine nation-states and interstate forms of governance "by cross-cutting linkages among different economic sectors and social bonds,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerny|first=Philip G.|date=1998|title=Neomedievalism, civil war and the new security dilemma: Globalisation as durable disorder |url= |journal=Civil Wars|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=42 |doi=10.1080/13698249808402366 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling globalization a "durable disorder" which eventually leads to the emergence of the new security dilemmas that had analogies in the Middle Ages. Cerny identifies six characteristics of a neomedieval world that contribute to this disorder: multiple competing institutions; lack of exogenous territorializing pressures both on sub-national and international levels; uneven consolidation of new spaces, cleavages, conflicts and inequalities; fragmented loyalties and identities; extensive entrenchment of property rights; and spread of the "grey zones" outside the law as well as black economy.

==Neo-medievalism and medieval studies==
{{See also|Medievalism}}
An early use of the term ''neo-medievalism'' in a sense like Umberto Eco's was in [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s 1953 "[[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]": &lt;blockquote&gt;There is no kinship between him [[Joseph de Maistre|[Joseph de Maistre]]] and those who really did believe in the possibility of some kind of return{{snd}} neo-medievalists from Wackenroder and Görres and Cobbett to G. K. Chesterton, and Slavophils and Distributists and Pre-Raphaelites and other nostalgic romantics; for he believed, as Tolstoy also did, in the exact opposite: in the "inexorable" power of the present moment: in our inability to do away with the sum of conditions which cumulatively determine our basic categories, an order which we can never fully describe or, otherwise than by some immediate awareness of it, come to know.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy’s View of History'' (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1953), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Then, in 1986, Umberto Eco said "we are at present witnessing, both in Europe and America, a period of renewed interest in the Middle Ages, with a curious oscillation between fantastic neomedievalism and responsible philological examination".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, the term has been used by various writers such as [[medievalist|medieval historians]] who see it as the intersection between popular fantasy and [[Middle Ages|medieval history]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ketterer (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA211&amp;lpg=RA1-PA211&amp;dq=%22neo+medievalism%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Q0nAw3mTxu&amp;sig=4sqtdAulyPgPJn6_sEyDsxWImLM#PRA1-PA211,M1 "Chapter 18: Fantasic Neomedievalism"] by Kim Selling, in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC Flashes of the Fantastic]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as a term describing the [[post-modern]] study of medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Cary John Lenehan. [http://www.tased.edu.au/tasonline/sca/thesis-d.htm "Postmodern Medievalism"], [[University of Tasmania]], November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread interest in medieval themes in [[popular culture]], especially [[computer games]] such as [[MMORPG]]s, [[film]]s and [[television]], [[neo-medieval music]], and popular [[literature]], has been called ''neomedieval''. Critics have discussed why medieval themes continue to fascinate audiences in a modern, heavily technological world. A possible explanation is the need for a [[romantic nationalism|romanticized historical narrative]] to clarify the confusing panorama of current political and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eddostern.com/texts/Stern_TOME.html|author=Eddo Stern|title=A Touch of Medieval: Narrative, Magic and Computer Technology in Massively Multiplayer Computer Role-Playing Games|publisher=Tampre University Press 2002|accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have paid increasing attention to neomedievalism, in what some see as a burgeoning field of study. Important works include Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements 2009 paper “Living with Neomedievalism,” in ''Studies in Medievalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements, “Living with Neomedievalism,” ''Studies in Medievalism'' 18 (2009): 55–75&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and Clements’ anthology ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games'' (forthcoming), a collection of papers from MEMS (Medieval Electronic Multimedia Organization),&lt;ref&gt;[http://medievalelectronicmultimedia.org/publications.html ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games''] at MEMS.&lt;/ref&gt; the academic journal ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fugelso (ed.), ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'', D. S. Brewer, Cambridge, 2010. {{ISBN|9781843842286}}&lt;/ref&gt; panels at the 2009 Annual International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, Michigan included “Neomedievalist Communities” and “Gaming Neomedievally”, and it was the official focus of the entire 22nd Annual International Conference on Medievalism, “Neomedievalisms” (2007).

}}

'''''Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor''''' is a landmark decision delivered in 1980 by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on appeal from [[Singapore]] which deals with the constitutionality of section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (No. 5 of 1973) (now section 17 of the {{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2008}}) ("MDA"), and the [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory]] [[capital punishment in Singapore|death penalty]] by the Act for certain offences. The appellants contended that the presumption of trafficking under section 15 of the MDA violated [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 9(1)]] of the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1980|lk=off}} (now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|abbr=on|ed=1985|rep=1999}}) and that the mandatory death penalty was arbitrary and violated [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12(1)]] of the Constitution.

Dismissing the appeal, the Privy Council clarified several issues of [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]]. It explained that the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) includes fundamental rules of [[natural justice]]. The court also held that Article 12(1) does not prohibit differentiation between classes of people, but requires that like should be compared with like. It also laid out the "reasonable relation" test to determine if legislation is in breach of Article 12(1).

''Ong Ah Chuan'' has been referred to in subsequent cases. In some of them, attempts have been made to argue that certain legal principles are fundamental rules of natural justice, and thus constitutionally protected by Article 9(1). There has also been academic discussion concerning whether fundamental rules of natural justice enable the courts to examine the substantive fairness or reasonableness of laws. The ruling in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional has not been followed in later Privy Council decisions. These cases were [[distinguishing|distinguished]] by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Singapore Court of Appeal]] in ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010) on the basis that the constitutions involved in those cases contained express prohibitions against [[cruel and unusual punishment|inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment]], which the Singapore Constitution lacks.

The reasonable relation test applied to Article 12(1) by the Privy Council has been applied in a number of local and foreign cases. It was reformulated into a three-stage test by the Court of Appeal in ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong]]'' (1998). The Court applied a modified version of the test to situations involving the discriminatory application of neutral laws in ''[[Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General]]'' (2009), and expressed the view that Article 12(1) would only be infringed in such cases where there was intentional and arbitrary discrimination, or inequalities due to inadvertence or inefficiency on a very substantial scale. The element of [[arbitrariness#Law|arbitrariness]] was also mentioned by the Court in ''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1988) – it said a law that allows a public authority to exercise arbitrary discretionary power is in violation of Article 12(1).

[[File:Heroin discovered inside hollow books - 20090417.jpg|thumb|[[Heroin]] found hidden inside hollow books for [[illegal drug trade|trafficking]] purposes]]

The case involved an appeal by two appellants, Ong Ah Chuan and Koh Chai Cheng, to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] – then Singapore's final appellate court – against their separate convictions under section 3 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] 1973 ("MDA").&lt;ref&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (No. 5 of 1973), s. 3, now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2008}}, s.&amp;nbsp;5 ("MDA"): see {{cite BAILII|litigants=Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor|court=UKPC|year=1980|num=32|format=1|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 648, [1981] 1 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 64, [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 710 at 713, para. 1|courtname=auto|juris=Singapore}} ("''Ong Ah Chuan''").&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[High Court of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;''Public Prosecutor v. Ong Ah Chuan'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 417, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore) ("''Ong Ah Chuan'' (H.C.)").&lt;/ref&gt; which were upheld by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Criminal Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor'' [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 53, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ong Ah Chuan was charged for [[illegal drug trade|trafficking]] {{convert|209.84|g}} of [[heroin]]. Two narcotics officers witnessed the appellant putting a plastic bag into his car and followed him. The appellant drove to [[Bukit Timah Road]], where he was arrested by the officers. The officers searched the appellant's car and found the heroin in his car.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 713, para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Koh Chai Cheng was charged for trafficking {{convert|1,256|g}} of heroin. The appellant brought the heroin into Singapore from Malaysia in order to sell it to a buyer, who was actually a police informer. The appellant was arrested when he was about to drive away from the meeting place and the heroin was discovered in the boot of his car.&lt;ref name="Ong 4"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 714, para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural history==
Before the High Court, counsel for Ong submitted that since the accused had been carrying the drugs for personal purposes and not for the purposes of delivery or sale, the actions did not amount to trafficking within the meaning of the MDA. The accused also claimed that he had purchased the large quantity of heroin because it was cheaper and more convenient to buy it in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'' (H.C.), p. 421, para. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judges dismissed the defence and found that the accused had invented the story "to escape the consequences of his criminal act".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'' (H.C.), p. 422, para. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Having found that the accused had been transporting the drugs, his act fell under the definition of ''traffic'' in the Act. He was convicted for trafficking heroin and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'' (H.C.), p. 422, paras. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Koh Chai Cheng's case, he denied knowledge of the drugs and contended that they had been planted in the boot of his car by police informers after he had arrived in Singapore. The trial judges rejected the argument, and the accused was accordingly convicted.&lt;ref name="Ong 4"/&gt;

Both Ong Ah Chuan and Koh Chai Cheng appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which upheld the convictions and sentences. They sought and obtained leave to appeal to the Privy Council against the constitutionality of sections 15 and 29 of the MDA.&lt;ref name="Ong 5"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 714, para. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 15&lt;ref&gt;Section 17 of the 2008 Rev. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; created a [[rebuttable presumption]] that if a person was in possession of an amount of drugs exceeding the minimum quantities specified in the section, the possession was for trafficking purposes. The effect of section 29&lt;ref&gt;Section 33 of the 2008 Rev. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Second Schedule of the Act was to impose the [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory]] [[capital punishment in Singapore|death penalty]] for trafficking above a certain quantity of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;The MDA, s. 29, stated that the punishments for offences were set out in the Second Schedule to the Act, and the Second Schedule specified that the penalty for unlawfully exporting, importing or trafficking in more than {{convert|15|g}} of diamorphine ([[heroin]]) or more than {{convert|30|g}} of [[morphine]] was death. The mandatory death penalty was also imposed for the unauthorized manufacture of any quantity of these drugs. These penalties were introduced by the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 1975 (No. 49 of 1975), in force on 12 December 1975: see {{Singapore Hansard|mp=Chua Sian Chin|office=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Education]]|reading=Second|bill=Misuse of Drugs (Amendment)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00056223-ZZ|date=20 November 1975|volume=34|columns=1379–1386}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues on appeal==
Three issues were raised by counsel for the appellants when the case went before the Privy Council:&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Whether the Court of Criminal Appeal was wrong in construing the presumption of trafficking under section 15 of the MDA. 
#Even if the presumption of trafficking under section 15 of the MDA was validly construed, whether the presumption was not "in accordance with law" as set out in [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 9(1)]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1980|lk=off}}, now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was thus unconstitutional.
#Whether the mandatory nature of capital punishment, for offences as broadly drawn as that of trafficking created by section&amp;nbsp;3 of the MDA, was unconstitutional. In addressing this issue, two sub-issues were raised. The first was whether mandatory capital punishment was "in accordance with law" as set out in Article 9(1). The second was whether the mandatory nature of capital punishment was unconstitutional because it contravened Article 12(1) of the Singapore Constitution.

==Decision of the court==

===Presumption of trafficking===
The appellants' first submission was that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in deciding that the drugs found in the possession of the accused persons had been for trafficking purposes under section 15 of the MDA.&lt;ref name="Ong 5"/&gt; This argument was rejected by the Privy Council.

The Privy Council's decision was delivered by [[Lord Diplock]] on 15 October 1980. His Lordship held that in Singapore, the offences of drug ''possession'' and drug ''trafficking'' are distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 717, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Drug trafficking was an offence under section 3 of the MDA. Drug possession, on the other hand, was an offence under section 6 of the MDA.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8 of the 2008 Rev. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The cases of ''Poon Soh Har v. Public Prosecutor'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;''Poon Soh Har v. Public Prosecutor'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 97, C.C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Seow Koon Guan v. Public Prosecutor'' (1978)&lt;ref&gt;''Seow Koon Guan v. Public Prosecutor'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 287, C.C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; were cited as evidence of Singapore courts upholding this distinction. Where the accused was found to be ''transporting'' controlled drugs, it was held that the transporter's purpose would determine whether the offence was one of drug possession or drug trafficking. Trafficking entailed the moving of drugs for the purpose of transferring possession from the mover to some other person, whether this purpose was achieved or not.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', pp. 717–719, paras. 9, 12 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was observed by the Privy Council that section 15 of the MDA assigned various quantity levels to certain controlled drugs, such as {{convert|2|g}} for heroin.&lt;ref&gt;MDA, s. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On securing proof that an accused possessed more than 2&amp;nbsp;grams of heroin, the courts could adopt a rebuttable presumption that such possession was for trafficking purposes, pursuant to section 3 of the MDA. It would be for the accused to rebut the presumption by proving that the possession of drugs above the limits set out under section 15 was not for trafficking purposes. Acquittal from the offence of drug trafficking could be secured if the accused could prove that the conveying of the drugs from one place to another was for the purpose of personal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 719, paras. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Diplock explained that the rationale for the section 15 presumption was the difficulty in proving the purpose of trafficking. In drug trafficking cases, the strongest attainable evidence was likely to be the act of transporting the drugs. Regardless of this, his Lordship held that even in the absence of section 15, it could be inferred that the transportation of a large quantity of drugs was for trafficking purposes. As a matter of common sense, the larger the quantity, the more likely it is for trafficking. Therefore, the appellants' argument that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in construing the presumption created by section 15(2) of the MDA was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', pp. 718–720, paras. 13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 9(1) of the Constitution===
The second argument of the counsel for the appellants was that even if the Court of Criminal Appeal had not erred in construing the presumption in section 15 of the MDA, the presumption was inconsistent with Article 9(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 720, para. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpreting the Constitution====
In addressing this argument, Lord Diplock first clarified how the Constitution should be interpreted. Referring to the judgment by [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]] in ''Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher'' (1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher|court=UKPC|year=1979|num=21|format=1|parallelcite=[1980] A.C. 319|courtname=P.C.|juris=Bermuda}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he affirmed that a constitution on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]] should be interpreted not as an Act of Parliament, but as "''[[sui generis]]'', calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its character".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher'', p. 329, cited in ''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 721, para. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He also held that fundamental liberties in Part IV of the Constitution should be given a "generous interpretation" so as to give individuals the full measure of the liberties referred to.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 721, para. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9(1) of the Constitution states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law." Counsel for the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Public Prosecutor]] argued that the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) included written law. Since Article 2(1) defined ''written law'' included all Acts in force in Singapore, all Acts which were validly passed by Parliament would be consistent with Article 9(1) even if they deprived a person of life or personal liberty. Being Acts in force in Singapore, they were "in accordance with the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 721, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council rejected such an approach to interpreting the term "in accordance with law". Citing Article 4, which declares the Constitution to be the supreme law of Singapore and states that laws enacted by the Legislature which are inconsistent with the Constitution are void, the court maintained it had the duty to determine whether any Act of Parliament was inconsistent with the Constitution and thus void. A law that is void will not be in force in Singapore, and consequently, will not be grounds for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty under Article 9(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', pp. 721–722, paras. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fundamental rules of natural justice====
In line with the generous approach that should be taken when engaging in constitutional interpretation, the Privy Council interpreted the meaning of ''law'' in contexts such as the term "in accordance with law" as in Article 9(1) to refer to a system of law incorporating fundamental rules of [[natural justice]]. This interpretation was, in the court's view, justified, as "[i]t would have been taken for granted by the makers of the Constitution that the 'law' to which citizens could have recourse for the protection of fundamental liberties assured to them by the Constitution would be a system of law that did not flout those fundamental rules".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 722, para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating, Lord Diplock stated that one of the fundamental rules of natural justice in the field of criminal law is that a person should not be punished for an offence unless it has been established to the satisfaction of an independent and unbiased tribunal that he committed it. This requires that there be material before the court logically probative of facts sufficient to constitute the offence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 722, para. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council then considered whether the presumption of trafficking under section 15 of the MDA was inconsistent with the Constitution. The appellants had argued that the presumption was inconsistent with the [[presumption of innocence]], which was part of Singapore law by virtue of Article 9(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 720, para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Diplock rejected this argument, and instead upheld the validity of a presumption of trafficking where possession of a quantity of prohibited drugs higher than the minimum specified in section 15 of the MDA has been proved. Where the difference between an offence and some lesser offence was the particular purpose with which that unlawful act was committed, there was nothing unfair about requiring the accused to prove his actual purpose. This was because the accused alone is armed with the knowledge of the purpose of the illegal act.&lt;ref name="Ong 28-29"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 723, paras. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The section 15 presumption of trafficking was also held to be in accordance with law for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="Ong 28-29"/&gt;

*This sort of presumption was a common feature in modern legislation.
*The presumption of trafficking itself arose from an already illegal act of possession, and thus no wholly innocent explanation of the purpose for which the drug was transported was possible.
*The quantity specified in section 15 was many times greater than the daily dose consumed by drug addicts, fortifying the likelihood of trafficking.

Since the presumption in section 15 was rebuttable, it did not conflict with any fundamental rule of natural justice, and was logically probative of facts sufficient to constitute the offence. The presumption of trafficking was thus held to be consistent with Article 9(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 723, paras. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandatory death penalty====
The appellants' contention concerning the mandatory death penalty, as understood by the Privy Council, was that the punishment was not in accordance with law within the meaning of Article 9(1) because the offence was so broadly drawn that it prevented the court from punishing offenders according to their individual blameworthiness.&lt;ref name="Ong 32"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 724, para. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council clarified that it was for the Legislature of Singapore to decide whether there should be capital punishment in Singapore, and what offences should warrant capital punishment. It added that there was nothing unusual in a capital sentence being mandatory as its efficacy as a deterrent may diminish to some extent if it is not mandatory. At [[common law]] all capital sentences were mandatory, and this is still so for murder and offences against the [[President of Singapore|President]]'s person under the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|cap=103|ed=1970|lk=off}}, now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ong 33"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 724, para. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court also mentioned in passing that contending the constitutionality of capital punishment was foreclosed by the recognition in Article 9(1) that a person may be deprived of life in accordance with law.&lt;ref name="Ong 32"/&gt;

===Article 12(1) of the Constitution===
[[File:Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint) - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]] (1985 Revised Edition, 1999 Reprint)]]

Counsel for the appellants contended that the mandatory nature of capital punishment imposed by the MDA forbids the court from imposing punishment on offenders according to their "individual blameworthiness". This contravened the principle of equality before the law stated in [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12(1)]] of the Constitution because it forced the court to prescribe the highest penalty of death to an addict who supplies to a friend {{convert|15|g}} of heroin, and to mete out a less severe punishment for a drug dealer who sells to others a total of {{convert|14.99|g}} of heroin.&lt;ref name="Ong 32"/&gt;

Article 12(1) states: "All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law." The Privy Council explained that the Article provides for all like persons to be treated alike, and prohibits laws that impose different punishments for individuals within the same class.&lt;ref name="Ong 35"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 725, para. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the equality provision does not forbid discrimination in prescribing different punishments for different classes of individuals. These classes are differentiated by the circumstances of the offence committed. Such differentiation is consistent with Article 12(1) as long as the element that the Legislature adopts as the differentiating factor is not entirely [[arbitrariness#Law|arbitrary]] but bears a "reasonable relation to the social object of the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 725, para. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying this reasonable relation test to the case, the Privy Council held that the mandatory death penalty was consistent with Article 12(1). This was because a reasonable relation exists between the social objective of the MDA and the differentiating factor – the quantity of drug involved in the offence. The objective of the MDA is to control the illicit drug trade, especially with regard to drugs that are highly addictive. This creates a social evil – one that the MDA seeks to prevent – which is said to be "broadly proportional to the quantity of addictive drugs"&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 725, para. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; brought into the market. This accordingly justifies the severe punishment of the mandatory death penalty as it serves as a form of [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]]. In addition, Lord Diplock expressed the opinion that the appropriate boundary to be drawn between varying classes of persons is a question best left to the Legislature. He declined to comment on whether differences in circumstances justified the imposition of different punishments. Rather, the doctrine of [[separation of powers in Singapore|separation of powers]] indicated that such "questions of social policy" are not within the purview of the [[judicial system in Singapore|judiciary]]. Since the appellants could not show that the differentiation amongst offenders on the basis of the quantity of the drug was arbitrary, the appeal on this ground was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 725, paras. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent legal developments and academic opinions==

===Article 9(1)===
{{main|Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore}}

====Regarding fundamental rules of natural justice====
In the Privy Council case ''[[Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor|link=Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor|court=UKPC|year=1981|num=23|format=1|parallelcite=[1982] A.C. 136, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) 133|courtname=P.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the appellants criticized amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Criminal Procedure Code|cap=113|ed=1970|lk=off}} (now {{Singapore legislation|cap=68|ed=2012}}).&lt;/ref&gt; that removed an accused person's right to make an unsworn statement not subject to [[cross-examination]], and replaced it with a power exercisable by the court to draw an [[adverse inference]] if the accused person opts to remain silent after being warned about the possible consequences of doing so. They submitted that the changes violated the privilege against [[self-incrimination]] which was a fundamental rule of natural justice. Lord Diplock, speaking for the court, questioned if the [[right to silence]] is a fundamental rule of natural justice but found it unnecessary to decide this point as he held that the new CPC provisions provided an accused person with an inducement to testify but did not compel him or her to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', pp. 143–145, paras. 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaching this conclusion, the judge noted that "[i]n considering whether a particular practice adopted by a court of law offends against a fundamental rule of natural justice, that practice must not be looked at in isolation but in light of the part which it plays in the complete judicial process", and that "what may properly be regarded by lawyers as rules of natural justice change with the times".&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', p. 144, paras. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 968, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that the right to silence is related largely to the giving of evidence, and that there is no constitutional or statutory provision in Singapore protecting it. As such, to say it is a constitutional right in the form of a fundamental rule of natural justice would be to "elevate an evidential rule to constitutional status" despite the lack of "explicit provision" in the Constitution. This, in the opinion of the Court, required "a degree of adventurous extrapolation" in the interpretation of Article 9(1) which the Court did not consider justified.&lt;ref&gt;''Mazlan'', p. 973, para. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor V. Ramraj has suggested that there are four models of [[due process]]: the formal model, procedural model, procedural-privacy model, and full substantive model. [[Substantive due process]], represented by the full substantive model, is concerned with the content or subject matter of a law. [[Procedural due process]], its extreme form represented by the formal model, deals with the manner which a law, administrative justice or judicial task is carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Victor V[ridar] Ramraj|title=Four Models of Due Process|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|year=2004|volume=2|issue=3|pages=492–524 at 492–493|doi=10.1093/icon/2.3.492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Singapore's position on the interpretation of "law" in Article 9(1) of the Constitution.png|frame|centre|The models of [[due process]] evidenced by the Singapore courts' interpretation of the word ''law'' in [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 9(1)]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], based on work by Victor Ramraj]]

[[Natural justice]] principles originated from the procedural elements of due process, but it is uncertain if substantive elements of due process are accepted in local law yet. ''Ong Ah Chuan'' is said to adopt the idea of procedural fairness.&lt;ref name="Lee 201"&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Rediscovering the Constitution|url=http://works.bepress.com/jacklee/8/|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=157–211 at 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the procedural model, courts go beyond a mere assessment of formal validity and inquire into the procedural fairness of legal processes. In Singapore, the current legal position is somewhere between the formal model as evidenced by the case of ''Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite WorldLII|litigants=Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor|court=ICHRL|year=1995|num=11|parallelcite=[https://www.webcitation.org/6Bi0iaQyF?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1995%5D_SGCA_18.html &amp;#91;1995&amp;#93; SGCA 18], [1995] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 326|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}, archived from [http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1995%5D_SGCA_18.html the original] on 26 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the procedural model evidenced by ''Ong Ah Chuan''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramraj, pp. 496–498.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Jabar'', the Court of Appeal held that a law is valid and binding as long as it has been validly passed by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]]. Consequently, whether the law is fair, just and reasonable does not matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Jabar'', p. 343, para. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim Chin Leng has opined that to accord principles of natural justice an elevated constitutional status may cause it to override statutes, which might contradict the Constitution which vests the law making power in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C[hin] L[eng] Lim|title=The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law: ''Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor''|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2005|volume=1|pages=218–233 at 229|ssrn=952611}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Andrew J. Harding disagrees with the idea of "substantive natural justice" because, in his view, it cannot be shown that it was the Privy Council's intent to apply natural justice in a substantive sense, since this would mean that the court can strike down a provision for inconsistency with natural justice even if it satisfies the rational nexus test under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=A[ndrew] J. Harding|title=Natural Justice and the Constitution|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=226–236 at 235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It will also be hard to ascertain the limits of judicial power. However, the view has been expressed that such [[judicial activism]] would merely be the judiciary exercising its proper role.&lt;ref name="Lee 201"/&gt; Furthermore, a judicial inquiry arguably involves both substantive and procedural aspects, so both concepts require no differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=T.K.K. Iyer|title=Article 9(1) and 'Fundamental Principles of Natural Justice' in the Constitution of Singapore|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/sjls23&amp;div=25|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=213–225 at 224–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these academic opinions, at present the Singapore courts are still [[judicial deference|deferential]] to the exercise of Parliament's legislative powers and adopt a respectful attitude towards its pronouncements. In ''Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave|court=SGHC|year=2008|num=116|parallelcite=[2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 754|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that the words ''save in accordance with law'' in Article 9(1) of the Constitution "incline liberally in favour of legislative power, but the clear words cannot be altered by the court". On the facts, assuming that the appellants had been deprived of personal liberty pursuant to certain statutory provisions, this had been carried out in accordance with law and thus was not unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Lo Pui Sang'', p. 760, para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regarding the mandatory death penalty====
In ''Ong Ah Chuan'', the Privy Council held that the argument that capital punishment is unconstitutional is foreclosed by Article 9(1) of the Constitution itself because it clearly states that a person can be deprived of his life "in accordance with law". The court further noted that "[t]here is nothing unusual in a capital sentence being mandatory" since at common law all capital sentences were mandatory, and that if a capital sentence was discretionary this might reduce its [[deterrence (legal)|deterrent effect]].&lt;ref name="Ong 33"/&gt; Also, the [[Prerogative of Mercy|prerogative of mercy]] is available to [[parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritans]] who find themselves involved in drug trafficking cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 726, para. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The court's ruling that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional was applied by the [[Federal Court of Malaysia]] in ''Public Prosecutor v. Lau Kee Hoo'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;''Public Prosecutor v. Lau Kee Hoo'' [1983] 1 M.L.J. [''Malaya Law Journal''] 157, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Capital punishment in the world.svg|thumb|400px|Countries in the world that impose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] ''(click on the image for a larger version)''|alt=A world map showing countries imposing capital punishment.]]

However, in the subsequent case ''Reyes v. The Queen'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Reyes v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=2002|num=11|parallelcite=[2002] 2 A.C. 235|courtname=P.C.|juris=Belize}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Privy Council found ''Ong Ah Chuan'' of limited assistance as it felt that at the time it was decided the [[international human rights law|jurisprudence on international human rights]] was "rudimentary".&lt;ref&gt;''Reyes'', p. 257, para. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The appellant in ''Reyes'', who had been convicted of a double murder, appealed as to the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence imposed on him. The Privy Council held that this penalty contravened the [[cruel and unusual punishment|prohibition against inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment]] in section&amp;nbsp;7 of the [[Constitution of Belize]]. While recognizing that the Constitution provides for the prerogative of mercy by vesting power to alter punishments in the [[Governor-General of Belize|Governor-General]] acting on the advice of an Advisory Council. However, this power was executive and not judicial in nature, and its existence could not remedy the constitutional defect in the sentencing process.&lt;ref&gt;''Reyes'', pp. 256–257, paras. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Privy Council reached a similar conclusion in ''R. v. Hughes'' (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Hughes|court=UKPC|year=2002|num=12|parallelcite=[2002] 2 A.C. 259|courtname=P.C.|juris=Saint Lucia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fox v. The Queen'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Fox v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=2002|num=13|parallelcite=[2002] 2 A.C. 284|courtname=P.C.|juris=Saint Christopher &amp; Nevis}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Watson v. The Queen'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Watson v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=2004|num=34|parallelcite=[2005] A.C. 472|courtname=P.C.|juris=Jamaica}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court stated that "[i]t is no
longer acceptable, nor is it any longer possible to say, as Lord Diplock did on behalf of the Board in ''Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor'' [1981] AC 648, 674, that there is nothing unusual in a death sentence being mandatory. ... [T]he mandatory penalty of death on conviction of murder long predated any international arrangements for the protection of
human rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Watson'', p. 852, para. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. S. Rajah|K.S. Rajah]] has noted that Singapore, having been a United Nations member state since 21 September 1965, is deemed to have accepted the obligations in the [[United Nations Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Charter]], Art. 4(1).&lt;/ref&gt; which entails acceptance of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration states: "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." Furthermore, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] applied to Singapore from October 1953 when it entered into force until 1963 when Singapore ceased to be part of the [[British Empire]] by [[Singapore in Malaysia|becoming a state of Malaysia]]. [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]] of the Convention prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=K.S.

{{quote|The provisions of the Articles [of the European Convention] must in some measure be regarded as incorporated into Part IV of the Constitution. It could not have been the intention of the framers of our Constitution to diminish the rights which Singaporeans as colonial subjects were entitled to enjoy, and to lose it on becoming independent citizens of a Republic with censorial power in their hands after freedom has taken effect.}}

Rajah proposed that,&lt;ref&gt;Rajah, "Unconstitutional Punishment", p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; in the light of the ''Reyes'', ''Hughes'' and ''Fox'' cases, the holding in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional should no longer be relied on by the Singapore courts. Thus, provisions such as section 302 of the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which imposes the penalty for the offence of murder, should be construed such that the death penalty is not mandatory in order to bring it into conformity with the Constitution pursuant to Article 162.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Constitution, Art. 162, states: "Subject to this Article, all existing laws shall continue in force on and after the commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been brought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution may, subject as aforesaid, be brought into force on or after its commencement, but all such laws shall, subject to this Article, be construed as from the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with this Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, those cases were strictly based on the issue of what kind of punishment would be considered inhuman and not directly related to the issue on appeal in ''Yong Vui Kong'', which was the meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'', pp. 514–515, para. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 12(1)===
{{main|Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore}}

====Regarding the reasonable relation test====

=====Application=====
Several local and foreign cases have adopted the Privy Council's approach in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' to interpreting Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2005),&lt;ref name=Nguyen/&gt; the Court of Appeal reiterated Lord Diplock's statements and applied the reasonable relation test.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', p. 123, para. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite WorldLII|litigants=Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor|court=ICHRL|year=1996|num=85|parallelcite=[1996] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 570 at 577–578 and 580–581, paras. 30–33 and 40|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Johari bin Kanadi v. Public Prosecutor'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Johari bin Kannadi v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGHC|year=2008|num=62|parallelcite=[2008] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 422 at 431–432, para. 14|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yong Vui Kong'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'', pp. 536–537, paras. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v. Public Prosecutor'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGHC|year=2012|num=163|pinpoint=para. 58|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the courts reaffirmed the position in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' that the [[wikt:differentia|differentia]] used to define a class of persons in a statute has to bear a reasonable relation to the social object of the statute.

''Ong Ah Chuan'' was found not to be applicable by the Court of Appeal in ''Ramalingam Ravinthran v. Attorney-General'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Ramalingam Ravinthran v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2012|num=2|parallelcite=[2012] 2 S.L.R. 49|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case involved a constitutional challenge by the appellant against the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Public Prosecutor]] for charging him with a capital offence when another accused person involved in the same drug trafficking incident was not. While the Court said that the Public Prosecutor was required to compare like with like&lt;ref name="Ong 35"/&gt; when deciding what charge to levy on accused persons, the present case differed from the factual situation in ''Ong Ah Chuan''. In that case, the Privy Council was examining the constitutionality of a criminal offence, and held that an offence does not violate Article 12(1) so long as provides "equal punitive treatment for similar legal guilt". It is not necessary for an offence to distinguish between degrees of moral blameworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', p. 726, para. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ramalingam'', p. 77, paras. 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the present case concerned the constitutionality of prosecutorial discretion. When making a charging decision, the Public Prosecutor:&lt;ref&gt;''Ramalingam'', pp. 77–78, para. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... is obliged to consider, in addition to the legal guilt of the offender, his moral blameworthiness, the gravity of the harm caused to the public welfare by his criminal activity, and a myriad of other factors, including whether there is sufficient evidence against a particular offender, whether the offender is willing to co-operate with the law enforcement authorities in providing intelligence, whether one offender is willing to testify against his cooffenders, and so on – up to and including the possibility of showing some degree of compassion in certain cases.}}

In the Malaysian case ''Datuk Yong Teck Lee v. Public Prosecutor'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;''Datuk Yong Teck Lee v. Public Prosecutor'' [1993] 1 M.L.J. 295, [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]] (Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiff claimed that section&amp;nbsp;27(8) of the [[Police Act 1967 (Malaysia)|Police Act 1967]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Police Act 1967 (Malaysia)|Police Act 1967]] (No. 41 of 1967; now [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722232859/http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Act%20344.pdf Act 344 of 1988, 2006 Reprint], archived from [http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Act%20344.pdf the original] on 22 July 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; violated Article&amp;nbsp;8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, which provides that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. It was argued that this provision was violated because parliamentarians who participated in illegal demonstrations were subject to a higher mandatory fine as compared to non-parliamentarians who had committed similar offences. The [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court of Malaya]] applied the doctrine of reasonable classification and identified a rational relation between the differentia and the object of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Datuk Yong Teck Lee'', pp. 301–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the Indian case ''D.C. Bhatia v. Union of India'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;''D.C. Bhatia v. Union of India'' (1995) 1 S.C.C. 104, [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] (India).&lt;/ref&gt; the appellant challenged the constitutional validity of an amendment to the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (No. 59 of 1958) (India).&lt;/ref&gt; that sought to limit the protection of [[rent control|rent-control]] legislation to areas where the monthly rent was less than 3,500 [[Indian rupee|rupees]]. In evaluating the challenge, the [[Supreme Court of India]] applied ''Ong Ah Chuan'' and identified "a rational connection between the legislative classifications and the object of the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Bhatia'', p. 113, para. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Refinement=====
The current test applied to Article 12(1) of the Constitution is a three-stage test that was reformulated by the Court of Appeal in ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20090413014255/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/8595.html &amp;#91;1998&amp;#93; 2 S.L.R.(R.) 489], C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/8595.html the original] on 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In determining whether section&amp;nbsp;37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Prevention of Corruption Act|cap=241|ed=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is discriminatory against [[Singaporean nationality law|Singaporean citizens]], the Court cited ''Ong Ah Chuan'' for the proposition that equality simply ensures like treatment for individuals in like situations, and not that all persons should be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'', p. 506, para. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, and drawing on cases from foreign jurisdictions, the court set out the three-stage test as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'', pp. 507–508, paras. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Stage 1''' – whether the law differentiates by prescribing a different treatment for different classes of individuals.
*'''Stage 2''' – whether the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia that distinguishes people that are grouped together from others which are left out from the group.
*'''Stage 3''' – whether the classification bears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.

The Court of Appeal held that a law that is over- or under-inclusive can still bear a rational relation to the object of the legislation. The Court was of the view that it is impractical to expect the enactment of a piece of legislation to be "seamless and perfect to cover every contingency".&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'', p. 514, para. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable relation test has since been applied in cases decided following ''Taw Cheng Kong'' such as ''Nguyen Tuong Van''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', p. 120, para. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has attracted academic criticism. Tan Yock Lin has commented that the Privy Council's approach in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' was a mere [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] as it provides a "glib answer" to any allegations of inequality. He argues that in determining a reasonable differentia, an ideal approach should extend beyond "mere demonstration of rationality".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tan Yock Lin|title=Equal Protection, Extra-territoriality and Self-incrimination|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/singlrev19&amp;div=5|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1998|volume=19|pages=10–44 at 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yap Po-Jen has argued that the test does not allow the court to take into consideration the "wisdom or propriety of the legislative policy".&lt;ref name=Yap&gt;{{citation|author=Po-Jen Yap|title=Four Models of Equality|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1579&amp;context=ilr|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BDdC2MCF?url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1579&amp;context=ilr|archivedate=6 October 2012|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|year=2005|volume=27|pages=63–100 at 73|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the court can identify a rational nexus between a classification and the object of a statute, it will uphold the legislative policy even if it is "invidiously discriminatory, unreasonable, irrational or unjust".&lt;ref name=Yap/&gt;

=====Arbitrariness in relation to Article 12(1)=====
A legislative provision that does not employ a form of classification inconsistent with the Constitution may nevertheless be applied in a way that violates Article 12(1). The reasonable relation test has been developed and broadened to serve as a legal test for the constitutionality of such administrative decisions. This modified reasonable relation test considers the arbitrariness of the administrative decision. The notion of arbitrariness with regard to an equality clause was elucidated in the Indian case ''Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;''Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20101003101458/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597], S.C. (India), archived from [http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ the original] on 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, in reference to Article 14 of the [[Constitution of India]] (the equivalent of Article 12 of the Singapore Constitution), the Indian Supreme Court stated that along with the notion of reasonable classification, there must also be a consideration of arbitrariness in an equality clause. It highlighted:&lt;ref&gt;''Maneka'', p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits ... Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.}}

''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' [1996] 1 M.L.J. 261, [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; applied the principle in ''Maneka Gandhi''. In discussing Article 8(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], the court held that failure to adopt such a principle would result in an "archaic and arcane approach" to the interpretation of Article 8(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore courts have integrated the notion of arbitrariness into the reasonable relation test. In ''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [https://www.webcitation.org/64ATf2EyI?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1988%5D_SGCA_16.html &amp;#91;1988&amp;#93; SGCA 16], [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1988%5D_SGCA_16.html the original] on 24 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the appellants contested the validity of sections 8 and 10 of the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ("ISA"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment dealt with whether the exercise of discretionary powers by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] under the ISA is objective or subjective, and thus whether it is subject to [[judicial review]]. The Court of Appeal held that sections 8 and 10 were not arbitrary as "they provide for the exercise of the power to detain only for specific purposes"&lt;ref name="Chng 82"&gt;''Chng Suan Tze'', p. 552, para. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore "bore a reasonable relation to the object of the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Chng Suan Tze'', p. 552, para. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Court held that if the discretion is not subject to review by a court of law, the decision is also rendered arbitrary and contrary to Article 12(1).&lt;ref name="Chng 82"/&gt;

[[File:Jin Long Si Temple, Singapore - 20070121.jpg|thumb|[[Jin Long Si Temple]], the subject of the case ''[[Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General]]'' (2009)]]

In ''[[Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General]]'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2009|num=1|parallelcite=[2009] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 542|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal was concerned with whether the decision by the Collector of Land Revenue to [[eminent domain|compulsorily acquire]] the piece of land on which the [[Jin Long Si Temple]] stood was contrary to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Next to the temple was the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] and the Bartley Christian Church, but land belonging to these properties was not acquired. The appellants, who were the trustees of the temple land, argued, among other things, that the acquisition of that piece of land was against the equal protection clause as the State had discriminated against them in acquiring only their property and not the other two properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 545, paras. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court applied a modified reasonable relation test in determining the constitutionality of the land acquisition decision. It stated that to determine if it violated Article 12(1), "[t]he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 550, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of a law "may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 553, para. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The mere existence of inequalities "due to inadvertence or inefficiency" is insufficient, unless it is on a "very substantial scale".&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 550, para. 28,  citing ''Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor, Singapore'' [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) 594, p. 600, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Alternatives to the ''Ong Ah Chuan'' approach=====
Approaches differing from the ''Ong Ah Chuan'' reasonable relation test have been applied to guarantees of equal protection in other jurisdictions. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has adopted a framework that serves as an alternative to the reasonable relation test adopted in ''Ong Ah Chuan''. American jurisprudence on the [[Equal Protection Clause]] is based on a "[[suspect classification]]" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aaron Baker|title=Proportional, Not Strict, Scrutiny: Against a U.S. 'Suspect Classifications' Model under Article 14 ECHR in the U.K.|journal=[[American Journal of Comparative Law]]|year=2008|volume=56|pages=847–894 at 868|doi=10.5131/ajcl.2007.0030|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/9306/1/9306.pdf?DDC72+DDC71+DDD19+DDC108+dla4jap+dla0acb+dul4eg}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''Ong Ah Chuan'' approach, this model encompasses three tiers of scrutiny. The level of scrutiny to be applied in each case is dependent upon the particular facts involved.

{| class=wikitable
|-
!Level of scrutiny
!Test

|- valign=top
|align=center|[[Strict scrutiny]]
|The measure must be narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest to withstand strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;''Palmore v. Sidoti'' {{ussc|466|429|1984}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt;
|Applied when the challenged law impinges on [[fundamental rights]] or involves a "suspect classification". Race, [[nationality|national origin]] and [[alienage]] are recognized as suspect.&lt;ref name="Baker 869"&gt;Baker, p. 869.&lt;/ref&gt; 
|- valign=top

|The challenged law must substantially advance an important state interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Craig v. Boren]]'' {{ussc|429|190|1976}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt;
|Applied when "quasi-suspect" classifications are involved, which are classifications based on gender or [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimacy]].&lt;ref name="Baker 869"/&gt;
|- valign=top
|align=center|[[Rational basis review]]
|The law must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.'' {{ussc|220|61|1911}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; The test requires only the existence of "any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification" and the legislature is not required to supply reasons for enacting the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Communications Commission v. Beach Communications, Inc.'' {{ussc|508|307|1993}} at 315, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt;
|Applied when the law in question neither impinges a fundamental right nor involves a suspect or quasi-suspect classification. 
|}

It has been suggested that a [[proportionality (law)|proportionality analysis]] safeguards equality better than the American three-tiered scrutiny approach.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 877.&lt;/ref&gt; The test of proportionality in English law, which is applied to determine whether a fundamental right is appropriately restricted by legislation, has three limbs:&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Daly) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department|court=UKHL|year=2001|num=26|parallelcite=[2001] 2 A.C. 532 at 547|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

#The legislative objective must be sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right.
#The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it.
#The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Peru]] on 31 October 1993. It followed the [[Alberto Fujimori]]'s [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|presidential coup]] on 5 April 1992.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011993 Peru, 31 October 1993: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new constitution was published on 4 September 1993, limiting the President to two terms of four years, creating a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Congress]]. Constitutional amendments would be possible with either a referendum or a two-thirds majority in two successive Congresses.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Referendums would also be possible if a petition had 0.3% of voters' signatures.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; After being approved by 52% of voters, the [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] came into force on 29 December 1993.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

'''Radio Justice'''&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Justice." Project:. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 May 2014. &lt;http://birn.eu.com/en/programmes-and-projects/project-radio-justice&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three programs directed by the Justice Report Agency, under the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network. Radio Justice is one component of the organization’s aims to increase the understanding of and support for the work of war crimes trials in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).

== History ==

Radio Justice is a sub-program of BIRN BiH’s Justice Series Programme. Justice Series, launched in 2005, produces daily courtside reports and investigative reports and analyses of local and regional [[transitional justice]].  In 2007 Justice Series expanded to radio, due to the high demand for reportage on war crimes trials in audio format.

Initially, BIRN BiH produced daily audio reports about war crimes trials held before the [[Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Since then, the scope of Radio Justice has expanded. In 2010 the organization started to produce a weekly magazine about the most important trials conducted before the War Crimes Chamber of the Court of BiH.&lt;ref&gt;A. Barbour, Stephanie, and International Center for Transitional Justice. "CHAPTER 2: Making Justice visible: Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Domestic war Crimes Trials Outreach." Transitional Justice, Culture, and Society. New York: Social Science research Council, 2014. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Radio Justice expanded its reporting to the war crimes trials held before the Cantonal and District courts of BiH in order to support local courts.

== Programming ==

Radio Justice's three different programs are distributed to over 140 radio stations in BiH. They include daily audio reports, a Justice Report Weekly Magazine, and a monthly show entitled: Local Justice Under Spotlight.

The Weekly Magazine focuses exclusively on what it considers to be the most important trials before the Court of BiH today. Each trial discussed in the magazine is selected in accordance to the level of public interest and available quality of content. The magazine, which airs every Friday, consists of four trial reporting segments and a central topic titled 'In Focus'.

'Local Justice Under Spotlight' is a 10-minute monthly radio edition of BIRN BiH realized in cooperation with the local contributor journalists. Each episode of 'Local Justice Under Spotlight' consists of up to 10 high quality reports from trials in different local Cantonal and District courts in BiH, as well as an 'In Focus' segment. It is aired on the first Monday of every month.

All radio content is available on BIRN BiH’s signature web site 'Justice Report', the Sound Cloud social network, and is also aired by the vast number of local radio outlets in the country.

== Achievements ==

Radio outlets in BiH rely on BIRN BiH radio editions since due to the lack of human and financial resources, as well as specialised expertise on transitional justice, they are not able to put correspondents in war crime chambers in BiH or in the Hague. Thus BIRN BiH holds an important position in bringing the work of the judiciary of BiH and especially the ICTY, closer to the audience.

All of the radio editions are done in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian and are exclusively for the domestic and diaspora based audience. They are also available for download and/or streaming on the organization’s website.

The Radio Justice team produces approximately 650 daily radio reports, over 80 weekly radio magazines, and 12 monthly specials each year. So far over 2,500 radio reports have been aired on various stations within the country and region.&lt;ref&gt;BIRN. Annual Report 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7152">In many countries, a '''statutory instrument''' is a form of [[delegated legislation]].

==United Kingdom==

Statutory instruments are the principal form of [[delegated legislation|delegated or secondary legislation]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

===England and Wales===
{{main article|Statutory instrument (UK)}}

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], statutory instruments (or "regulations")&lt;ref&gt; UK Statutory Instrument regulations  should be distinguished from [[EU]] [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]] which are legislative acts that become immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously.]] &lt;/ref&gt; are primarily governed by the [[Statutory Instruments Act 1946]],&lt;ref name="1946-c-36"&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1946|chapter=36|act=Statutory Instruments Act 1946 (c. 36, 9–10 Geo. VI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the system of [[statutory rules and orders]] governed by the [[Rules Publication Act 1893]]. Wales Statutory Instruments&lt;!-- not "Welsh", legislation.gov.uk uses "Wales" --&gt; are published as a subseries of the UK statutory instrument series—for example, the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2017 is numbered ''2017{{nbsp}}No.{{nbsp}}714{{nbsp}}(W.{{nbsp}}171)'', meaning it is the 714th statutory instrument in the UK series and 171st in the Wales subseries.&lt;ref name="2017-wsi-714"&gt;{{cite legislation Wales|type=wsi|year=2017|number=714|title=The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2017 (SI 2017/714 (W. 171))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum 2016|2016 EU membership referendum]] and the subsequent publication of the [[European Union (Withdrawal) Bill]], there has been concern that its powers enabling ministers to issue statutory instruments under the bill may enable the government to bypass Parliament. Although this has been criticised by some as being undemocratic, draft regulations must be "laid before" Parliament, which may always demand a full debate on contentious issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/01/what-are-statutory-instruments-and-do-they-show-contempt-democracy What are statutory instruments, and do they show “contempt for democracy”?] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
{{main article|Scottish Statutory Instrument}}

In [[Scotland]], statutory instruments were governed by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 following devolution until the [[Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010]] came into force.&lt;ref name="1999-si-1096"&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=si|year=1999|number=1096|si=The Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Statutory Instruments) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1096)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2010-asp-10"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2010|chapter=10|act=Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011-ssi-195"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2011|number=195|ssi=The Scottish Statutory Instrument Regulations 2011 (SSI 2011/195)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Wales Statutory Instruments, Scottish Statutory Instruments are not published as a subseries of the UK series—instead, they are published separately by the [[Queen's Printer for Scotland]]. However, any UK statutory instruments dealing with [[reserved matter]]s and applying only to Scotland are published in a UK subseries, such as the Insolvent Companies (Reports on Conduct of Directors) (Scotland) Rules 2016 numbered ''2016{{nbsp}}No.{{nbsp}}185{{nbsp}}(S.{{nbsp}}1)''.&lt;ref name="si-practice-4th"&gt;{{cite book | title=Statutory Instrument Practice: A manual for those concerned with the preparation of statutory instruments and the parliamentary procedures related to them | publisher=Office of Public Sector Information | author=Her Majesty's Stationery Office | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="2016-si-185"&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=si|year=2016|number=185|si=The Insolvent Companies (Reports on Conduct of Directors) (Scotland) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/185 (S. 1))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===

In [[Northern Ireland]], delegated legislation is organised into [[Statutory Rules of Northern Ireland|statutory rules]], rather than statutory instruments.

== Republic of Ireland ==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the term "statutory instrument" is given a much broader meaning than under the UK legislation. Under the [[Statutory Instruments Act 1947 (Ireland)|Statutory Instruments Act 1947]] a statutory instrument is defined as being "an order, regulation, rule, scheme or bye-law made in exercise of a power conferred by statute."

However, only certain statutory instrument are published and numbered by the [[Stationery Office (Ireland)|Stationery Office]], this being mostly where the statute enabling the enactment of delegated legislation required that any such legislation be laid before the Houses of the [[Oireachtas]].

== United States ==

Two close equivalents of similar operation are 
* [[Executive order]]s of the [[President of the United States]], which give instructions to various federal agencies on certain actions they are to take in various cases.
* Regulations of various government agencies (a form of [[delegated legislation]]) are issued by those agencies regarding subjects those agencies have jurisdiction or responsibility over, or in response to statutes of Congress directing them to take responsibility over a particular subject or issue. They are published in the [[Federal Register]] for public notice and comment before becoming valid, and unless objected to by Congress, become effective and have the force and effect of law.

== Other countries ==
Similarly to the United Kingdom, national and state/provincial governments in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] also call their delegated legislation statutory instruments.
 
Canada uses statutory instruments for [[proclamations]] by the Queen of Canada. For example, the Proclamation of the Queen of Canada on April 17, 1982 [[coming into force|brought into force]] the [[Constitution Act 1982]], the UK parts of which are known as the [[Canada Act 1982]].

'''''Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division''''', 450 U.S. 707 (1981),&lt;ref name="450 U.S. 707"&gt;{{ussc|name=Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division|volume=450|page=707|pin=|year=1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that [[Indiana]]'s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to petitioner violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, under ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Sherbert v. Verner|volume=374|page=398|pin=|year=1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Thomas, a [[Jehovah's Witness]], was initially hired to work in his employer's roll [[foundry]], which fabricated sheet steel for a variety of industrial uses, but when the foundry was closed, he was transferred to a department that fabricated [[turret]]s for military tanks. Since all of the employer's remaining departments were engaged directly in the production of weapons, petitioner asked to be laid off. When that request was denied, he quit, asserting that his religious beliefs prevented him from participating in the production of weapons. He was denied unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act.

== Prior history ==
At an administrative hearing, Thomas testified that he believed that contributing to the production of arms violated his religion, but he could, in good conscience, engage indirectly in the production of materials that might be used ultimately to fabricate arms. The hearing referee found that petitioner had terminated his employment because of his religious convictions but held that petitioner was not entitled to benefits because his voluntary termination was not based upon a "good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work," as required by the Indiana statute.

The Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division affirmed, but the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]] reversed, holding that the Indiana statute, as applied, improperly burdened petitioner's right to the free exercise of his religion. The [[Indiana Supreme Court]] vacated on petitioner's free exercise right, the burden justified by legitimate state interests.

==Decision==
The majority held that Indiana's denial of unemployment compensation violated Thomas' right to free exercise of religion.

Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court and was joined by Justices Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall, and Stevens. Justice Blackmun filed a statement concurring in part and in the result.

Justice Rehnquist filed a dissenting opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''The Tolerance Act''' ({{lang-sv|Toleransediktet}}) was a Swedish law, enacted by [[Gustav III of Sweden]] 24 January 1781. It guaranteed freedom of religion and full citizen rights for all Christian immigrants and residents in Sweden.   

Since the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, Lutheranism had officially been the only religion allowed in Sweden, though the foreign embassies were given dispensation. The Tolerance Act was introduced in line with the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. There were also an economical aspect, as it would make it easier for foreigners to work in Sweden. By the Act, all Christian immigrants were granted full freedom of religion and guaranteed their right to bring up their children in their faith as well. This act was followed in 1782 by the ''[[Judereglementet]]'' (The Jew's Law), which guaranteed the freedom of religion for Jewish immigrants. This Act was a step toward full freedom of religion in Sweden. However, they only applied to immigrants and foreigners, while the Lutheran Swedish citizens were still prohibited their freedom of religion through the ''[[konventikelplakatet]]''. 

The Tolerance Act was replaced by the [[Dissenter Acts (Sweden)]] from the 1850s, which guaranteed freedom of religion to all Swedish citizens. 

The final act was the law of 1951, which allowed for complete freedom of conscience by allowing citizens from leaving their religion without replacing it with another one, thereby formally also allowing atheism.

The '''Trade Disputes Act 1906''' (6 Edw. 7 c. 47) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. The Act declared that unions could not be sued for [[damages]] incurred during a strike.

Its key reform was to add the famous words, now found in the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], section 219, to the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] that, "An act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or more persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, not be actionable unless the act, if done without any such agreement or combination, would be actionable."

==Law==
The immediate cause for the Act was a trio of cases in the [[House of Lords]], which had for the first time imposed damages in [[tort]] on trade unions for going on strike. Previously, the legal status of trade unions as an "unincorporated association", was accepted to mean that they did not have legal standing to sue, or be sued, in court.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Before the change, the two important cases were ''[[Lumley v Gye]]'' (1857) and ''[[Allen v Flood]]'' (1897). ''Lumley'' did not concern trade unions, but invented a new legal principle. An actress, Miss Wagner, had been engaged by Mr. Lumley to sing at Her Majesty's Theatre. Mr. Gye, who ran [[Covent Garden Theatre]], procured her to break her contract with Mr. Lumley by promising to pay her more. He was held liable to Mr. Lumley for inducing a breach of contract. This is a principle readily applicable to union situations. In the case of a strike, a union effectively persuades or decides for workers to go on strike, in breach of their contracts with employers. But in ''Allen'', the House of Lords held that a trade union could not be sued by a non-union worker for pressuring the employer into not hiring them. They said that even though the union's motive was malicious, the employer not hiring the non-union worker was lawful.

But then, ''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' (1901) surprised everyone by saying that [[trade union]]s could be held liable for damages caused by industrial action. The Lords said if unions can harm people, they are bodies capable of being sued. The Labour movement was so incensed that it met at Farringdon Town Hall and resolved to form a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to get the decision reversed in Parliament. Two further cases followed worsening the possibility to collectively bargain. ''[[Quinn v Leatham]]'' ended all possibilities of a closed shop and ''[[South Wales Miners' Federation v Glamorgan Coal Co]]'' held that a union which induced a breach of contract had no defence of an "honest motive" (for instance, wanting to improve working conditions and get fair pay for employees).

==Politics==
The Liberal Party was returned with a large majority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]]. A minority in the new Cabinet, including Campbell-Bannerman and [[John Burns]], wanted to introduce a Bill stating that trade unions could not be liable for damages. However the majority opinion in the Cabinet, led by [[H. H. Asquith]] and other members with legal experience, argued that this would make unions too powerful and instead proposed to limit the application of the [[law of agency]] in respect to union activities.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson, ''CB. A Life of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman'' (London: Purnell Book Services Limited, 1973), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter faction prevailed and a Bill was introduced on 28 March 1906 by the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]], [[William Robson, Baron Robson|William Robson]]. Many of the radical MPs did not understand the complicated legal wording of the Bill and so trade union MPs, led by [[Walter Hudson (politician)|W. Hudson]], introduced their own Bill.

==Passage through Parliament==
The Private Members' Bill was severely criticised by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], [[John Lawson Walton]], "who tore it to pieces in his best forensic style".&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 505"&gt;Wilson, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; Without warning his colleagues Campbell-Bannerman spoke in favour of the trade unionists' Bill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have never been, and I do not profess to be now, very intimately acquainted with the technicalities of the question, or with the legal points involved in it. The great object then was, and still is, to place the two rival powers of capital and labour on an equality so that the fight between them, so far as fight is necessary, should be at least a fair one. ...I always vote on the second reading of a Bill with the understood reservation of details, which are to be considered afterwards. That is the universal practice. Shall I repeat that vote today? [Cries of "Yes".] I do not see any reason under the sun why I should not.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 505"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Conservative MP [[George Wyndham]] said he had heard Campbell-Bannerman's [[peroration]] with blank amazement as it was incredible that he should on Friday request that MPs vote for a Bill which his Attorney-General had strongly denounced on Wednesday. Asquith and the rest of the Government opposition to the trade unionists' Bill argued against it inside the Cabinet but the outcome of the Committee dealing with the Bill in August was to favour the trade unions' alternative.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p. 505"/&gt;

During the Second Reading of the Trade Disputes Bill, Sir [[William Robson, Baron Robson|William Robson]] noted that the Bill was intended to prevent "industrial conflict being the subject of litigation".&lt;ref&gt;Hansard HC vol .. col 1490 (25 April 1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
[[George Dangerfield]] wrote in his ''[[The Strange Death of Liberal England]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It gave the Unions an astounding, indeed an unlimited immunity. Labour was jubilant. The most powerful Government in history had been compelled, by scarcely more than a single show of power, to yield to the just demands of organized workers.&lt;ref&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England'' (Stanford University Press, 1997), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English constitutional theorist [[A. V. Dicey]] argued that the Act conferred

&lt;blockquote&gt;upon a trade union a freedom from civil liability for the commission of even the most heinous wrong by the union or its servant, and in short confer[red] upon every trade union a privilege and protection not possessed by any other person or body of persons, whether corporate or incorporate... [this Act] makes a trade union a privileged body exempted from the ordinary law of the land. No such privileged body has ever before been deliberately created by an English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Dicey, ''Lectures on the Relation between Law and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth Century: Second Edition'' (London: Macmillan, 1919), pp. xlv-xlvi. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2119&amp;layout=html#a_2930181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'' said of the Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult, at the present time, to realize how this measure must have struck people who still believed in a state and in a legal system that centered in the institution of private property. For in relaxing the law of conspiracy in respect to peaceful picketing&amp;mdash;which practically amounted to legalization of trade-union action implying the threat of force&amp;mdash;and in exempting trade-union funds from liability in action for damages ''for torts''&amp;mdash;which practically amounted to enacting that trade unions could do no wrong&amp;mdash;this measure in fact resigned to the trade unions part of the authority of the state and granted to them a position of privilege which the formal extension of the exemption to employers' unions was powerless to affect.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Schumpeter, ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy'' (New York: 1942), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It remained in force until 1971.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} For the centenary of the Act, the [[Trades Union Congress]] campaigned for a Trade Union Freedom Bill.

==Right to strike==
{{main|Right to strike}}
The Act was one of the most significant pieces of legislation for the 20th century, and was the cornerstone of the whole country's system of [[collective bargaining]]. It was also heavily influential abroad. The right to strike is now a "fundamental [[human right]]". In ''[[London Underground Ltd v NUR]]'', Millett LJ said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a right which was first conferred by Parliament in 1906, which has been enjoyed by trade unions ever since and which is today recognised as encompassing a fundamental human right".&lt;ref&gt;[1996] ICR 170, 181&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Territorial evolution of Poland}}

The '''Treaty of Warsaw''' ({{lang-de|Warschauer Vertrag}}, Polish: Układ PRL-RFN) was a treaty between [[West Germany]] and the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. It was signed by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and Prime Minister [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]] at the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] on 7 December 1970, and it was ratified by the German [[Bundestag]] on 17 May 1972.

In the treaty, both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing border—the [[Oder-Neisse line]], imposed on [[Germany]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] at the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]] following the end of [[World War II]]. This had been a quite sensitive topic since then, as Poland was concerned that a German government might seek to reclaim some of the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]]. From the Polish perspective, the transfer of these regions was considered to be a compensation for the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former Polish territory]] east of the [[Curzon Line]] ("[[Kresy]]"), which had been annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939.

In West Germany, Brandt was heavily criticised by the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] opposition, who marked his policy as a betrayal of national interests. At the time the treaty was signed, it was not seen as the last word on the Polish border in West Germany,&lt;ref name=EEJ&gt;Johnson, Edward Elwyn. [http://www.eej-esq.com/PDFs/German_Reunification.pdf International law aspects of the German refunification alternative answers to the German question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009043103/http://www.eej-esq.com/PDFs/German_Reunification.pdf |date=2007-10-09 }}. Page 18 and footnote 35 that cites Ludwig Gelberg, ''The Warsaw Treaty of 1970 and the Western Boundary of Poland'', at 125–127; Jochen Abr. Frowein, ''The Reunification of Germany'', 86 Am. J. Int'l L. 152, 156 (1992), at 156.&lt;/ref&gt; because Article IV of this treaty stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement, so the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II—as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement.&lt;ref name=EEJ/&gt;

The Treaty of Warsaw was an important element of the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', put forward by Chancellor Brandt and supported by his ruling [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. In the aftermath of the 1990 [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]], the Oder-Neisse line was reaffirmed without any reservation with the [[German–Polish Border Treaty (1990)|German-Polish Border Treaty]], signed on 14 November 1990 by re-united [[Germany]] and [[Poland]].
