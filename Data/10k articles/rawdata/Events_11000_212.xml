The '''10th World Science Fiction Convention''' was held on [[Labor Day]] weekend from August 30 to September 1, 1952, at the Morrison Hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. This Worldcon never chose an official name other than the title "10th World Science Fiction Convention," as both the convention's issued membership card and program book clearly stated. Only the first Worldcon in New York City (1939) and the 11th in Philadelphia, 1953, shared this lack of a formal convention name. The phrases "Tenth Anniversary World Science Fiction Convention" (TAWSFiC) and "Tenth Anniversary Science Fiction Convention" (TASFiC, likely a simple [[Linotype machine|linotype]] error, as "World" is missing) were each used in some of this Worldcon's pre-convention materials; the phrase's acronyms "TAWSFiC" and "TASFiC" were never officially used in print or otherwise by the Chicago committee at that time.&lt;ref name="llnotes"/&gt; However, the 10th Worldcon ''was'' frequently referred to by its members by the unofficial name '''Chicon II''', so dubbed after the previous Chicago [[Worldcon]] ('''Chicon''') in 1940; this name proved so popular that the convention became known as Chicon II in [[science fiction fandom]]'s lore and written histories.

The convention chair was [[Julian May|Julian C. May]] (later also known as Judy Dikty). [[Hugo Gernsback]] was the convention's official guest of honor. The program included the performance of an original science fiction ballet.

For years this Worldcon held the record for the largest attendance at any early science fiction convention, with 870 registered attendees, a figure which was not surpassed by another Worldcon until 1967 for [[27th World Science Fiction Convention|Nycon 3]] in New York City. By way of comparison, the previous year's Worldcon, the [[9th World Science Fiction Convention|Nolacon]] in [[New Orleans]], had an attendance of 190.

It was at this Worldcon that the idea for the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] science fiction awards was first proposed and adopted. These awards, the highest and oldest honor in science fiction, were first awarded at the 1953 Worldcon in Philadelphia.

The convention is said to have been the place where [[Sturgeon's Law]] was first formulated (although other origin stories claim Sturgeon first articulated the concept in 1951, a year earlier). During a panel discussion on science fiction, one of the panelists observed that about 90% of science fiction was crud. [[Theodore Sturgeon]], also on the panel, replied that 90% of ''everything'' was crud.

The pirates shot at random targets, killing at least 21 people and injuring 11 others,&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt; and snatched some $200,000 from a local bank as well as another $5,000 from the [[Malaysia Airlines]] office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Opinion/Columnists/OK-Bah/Profile/Articles/2014/02/19/Thoughts-on-Sabahs-piracy-problem/|title=Thoughts on Sabah’s piracy problem|author=Clement Jaikul|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=19 February 2014|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Most areas in the east coast of Sabah are known for many [[Filipino people|Filipino]] communities, both legal and [[Illegal immigrants in Malaysia|illegal]].&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt; These areas have become the haven for pirates from the Philippines and Sabah itself has suffered 10 major attacks since 1976.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pirates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jati-dseas.um.edu.my/filebank/published_article/4259/12.%20171-188%20Ramli..%20Lanun%20Atau%20Mundu%20Di%20Sabah..%20Jati%209.pdf|title=Lanun atau Mundu di Sabah|publisher=[[University of Malaya]]|date=9 December 2004|accessdate=30 October 2014|author=Ramli Dollah|language=ms|pages=176 and 178 (6 and 8)|format=[[PDF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030060419/http://jati-dseas.um.edu.my/filebank/published_article/4259/12.%20171-188%20Ramli..%20Lanun%20Atau%20Mundu%20Di%20Sabah..%20Jati%209.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September evening, suddenly a number of armed men clad in [[jungle green]] uniforms appeared in the town and started to shoot random targets.&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt; The shoot-out left the town with destruction and blood could be found anywhere. One of the victims, a pregnant woman, was shot when she was being driven home in a [[van]]. The van driver brought her to the hospital but she was pronounced dead on arrival.&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt; Another victim, a [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], was injured by a gunshot during the raid. During an interviewed with him, he told..
{{cquote|While I was walking around a coastal road, I saw eight men dressed in combat uniforms carrying [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[machine guns]] running towards the centre of the town. Gunfire was then heard with men running towards me. I then hid in a cafe with the proprietor, huddled under a table and heard the continuous gunshots and explosions. I thought the town was under attack by the [[Philippine Army]]. Suddenly, I heard a bullet crashing the window and saw my leg was hit with it. I saw images of my wife and three children and I thought I would never see them again. But later I consider myself fortunate because I lived to see my family. But even so, I cannot help wondering about [[Government of Malaysia|our government]], which can’t seem to defend us against these marauders.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;}}

The instability of the Philippines has caused major economic problems for Sabah. Philippine army raids against anti-[[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] factions in the [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]] and [[Mindanao]] island have left many houses and fields destroyed, forcing an estimated 100,000 [[Moro people]] in the Southern Philippines to flee to Sabah.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt; While many who have not left the Philippine islands have involved in criminal activities, mainly on [[smuggling]] and armed robbery.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After their successful attempt, the pirates later retreated to a jetty where they engaging a group of [[Marine Operations Force|Malaysian Marine Police]].&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt; Two of the pirates were wounded during a gun battle with the marine police which their friends still managed to carry their injured friends into two awaiting [[pump boats]] as the pirates made their getaway back to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt; In the next day, the Marine Police launched a surprise attacks on an island which believe to be their hide-out and managed to kill five pirates.&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt; While the rest of the pirates have escaped to the [[Malaysia–Philippines border|international border]],&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt; the police recovered a number of M16 rifles with a whole armoury of assorted weapons.&lt;ref name="darkest"/&gt; Some ambiguous source alleged on the apparent retaliation, the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] with four ships and three helicopters attacked a Filipino island, bombed the island's settlement, burning houses and killing 53 Filipino residents.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ambiguous"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&amp;dat=19850930&amp;id=6vpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ovkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4616,3601850|title=Moslem community attacked in raid?|publisher=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|date=30 September 1985|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian Embassy in [[Manila]] declined to comment on the report and said the Malaysian embassy has not received any information from the Philippine government or from the Malaysia's capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name="ambiguous"/&gt;

== Reactions ==
* {{flag|Malaysia}} – The [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian Government]] denied the reports on the retaliation attack to a Filipino island with both the Malaysian and Philippine government hinted that an unnamed third party was responsible for the incident.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;
* {{flag|Philippines|1985}} – The [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine Government]] protested the [[Marine Operations Force|Malaysian Marine Police]] action during the chasing of the pirates to the international border, saying the Malaysian police had breached the Philippines border.&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt; However, this allegation was retracted since there were no concrete proofs.&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt;

==Report==

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of Darlington Raceway, the track where the race is held.]]
'''Darlington Raceway''' is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is nicknamed '''"The Lady in Black"''' and '''"The Track Too Tough to Tame"''' by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as "A NASCAR Tradition." It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.

==Involvement in 2008 Mumbai attacks==
Kasab was seen on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] during his attacks at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] along with another recruit, Ismail Khan. Kasab reportedly told the police that they wanted to replicate the [[Islamabad]] [[Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing|Marriott hotel attack]], and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the [[9/11 attacks]] in India.&lt;ref name="azam"/&gt;

Kasab and his accomplice Khan, then aged 25, attacked the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] (formerly Victoria Terminus) railway station. They then moved on to attack a police vehicle (a white [[Toyota Kijang|Toyota Qualis]]) at [[Cama Hospital]], in which senior Mumbai police officers ([[Maharashtra]] [[Anti Terrorist Squad (India)|ATS]] Chief [[Hemant Karkare]], encounter specialist [[Vijay Salaskar]] and Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police [[Ashok Kamte]]) were travelling. After killing them in a gun battle and taking two constables hostage{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} in the Qualis, Kasab and Khan drove towards the Metro cinema. Kasab joked about the bulletproof vests worn by the police and killed one constable when his mobile phone rang. The two fired some shots into a crowd gathered at the Metro Cinema. They then drove to Vidhan Bhavan where they fired more shots. Their vehicle had a tire puncture, so they stole a silver [[Škoda Laura]] and drove towards [[Girgaum Chowpatty]] beach.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;!-- this whole paragraph requires citations--&gt;

The D B Marg{{clarify|reason=This appears to be the name of a police station|date=July 2016}} police had received a message from police control at about {{Nowrap|10 pm}}, that two heavily armed men had gunned down commuters at CST. 15 policemen from D B Marg were sent to Chowpatty to set up a double barricade on Marine Drive.&lt;ref name="toi_lathi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-09/mumbai/27923425_1_lathis-terrorists-policemen|title=Police overcomes deadly terrorists at Chowpatty|work=The Times of India|date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Škoda reached Chowpatty and halted 40 to 50 feet from the barricade. It reversed and attempted a U-turn. A shootout ensued and Khan was killed. Kasab lay motionless playing dead. Assistant sub-inspector [[Tukaram Omble]], armed only with a [[Fighting stick|lathi]], charged the vehicle, being shot five times.

Initially Kasab pretended to be dead and was being transported to the [[Topiwala National Medical College and Nair Hospital|Nair Hospital]] when a police officer discovered Kasab was breathing. Seeing the mutilated body of another slain terrorist Kasab begged doctors to put him on saline, saying "I do not want to die".&lt;ref name="b-mirror"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coward"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11292008/news/worldnews/india_terror_timeline_141432.htm|title=Terrorist: 'I Do not Wanna Die'; Mumbai Mass Killer Turns Coward|last=Fanelli|first=James|date=30 November 2008|work=New York Post|accessdate=30 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203054855/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11292008/news/worldnews/india_terror_timeline_141432.htm|archivedate=3 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctors who treated Kasab said he had no bullet wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/No-bullet-hit-Kasab--no-active-treatment-on--says-hospital-s-dean/393116|title=No bullet hit Kasab, no active treatment on, says hospital's dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasab told interrogators that all through the operation, the Lashkar headquarters from [[Karachi, Pakistan]], remained in touch with the group, calling their phones through a voice-over-internet service. Investigators succeeded in reconstructing the group's journey through the [[Garmin]] [[GPS]] that was found on Kasab. The email sent from a group calling itself the [[Deccan Mujahideen]] claiming responsibility was traced to a Russian proxy which was traced back to [[Lahore]] with the help of the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/99F16988F6BDB91165257511003FB3F5?OpenDocument|title=Lashker-e-Taiba members learnt Hindi before Mumbai attacks|date=30 November 2008|agency=Press Trust of India|accessdate=5 December 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-02/india/27948426_1_terror-attacks-terror-mail-serial-blasts|title=Terror mail routed through Pakistan's Lahore|date=2 December 2008|work=The Times of India|accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mumbai Police said much of the information that Kasab provided proved to be accurate.

==Police interrogation==

===Naming confusion===
On 6 December 2008, ''[[The Hindu]]'' reported that the police officers who interrogated him did not speak his language, [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and misinterpreted his [[caste]] origin "[[Qassab|kasai]]", meaning butcher, to be a surname, writing it as "Kasav".&lt;ref name="thehindu_ajmal_amir_name"&gt;{{cite news|first=Praveen|last=Swami|title=Terrorist's name lost in transliteration|date=6 December 2008|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/06/stories/2008120661211200.htm |accessdate=6 December 2008|location=Chennai, India|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081208090328/http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/06/stories/2008120661211200.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' reported a different version of the error. The paper stated that the police officers correctly understood that Ajmal Kasab [[Pakistani name|does not have a surname]]. To satisfy an administrative requirement that people have surnames, the officers asked Kasab for his father's profession, and decided to use "butcher", or "Kasab" in Urdu, as his surname.&lt;ref name="timesIndia_copsgavename"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mumbai cops gave Ajmal his surname|date=7 December 2008|work=[[The Times of India]]| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-07/mumbai/27927339_1_surname-mumbai-cops-kasab|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesIndia_kasavbutcher"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cops called him 'Kasav' as dad was a butcher|date=7 December 2008|work=[[The Times of India]]| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-07/india/27922614_1_kasav-butcher-terror-attacks| archive-url=https://archive.is/20121123182115/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-07/india/27922614_1_kasav-butcher-terror-attacks| dead-url=yes| archive-date=23 November 2012|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasab told the police that he and his associate, Ismail Khan, were the ones who shot Anti-Terror Squad chief [[Hemant Karkare]], encounter specialist [[Vijay Salaskar]] and Additional Commissioner [[Ashok Kamte]].

====Confessions on video====
Kasab repeatedly asked the interrogators to turn the camera off and warned them he would not speak otherwise. Nonetheless the following confessions were recorded on video:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Kasab+Confession+  The Kasab Confession, Newsxlive, Nov 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

When police asked Kasab what he understood about jihad, Kasab told the interrogators "it [[Jihad]] is about killing and getting killed and becoming famous." "Come, kill and die after a killing spree. By this one will become famous and will also make God proud."&lt;ref name="ABCUSA_AjmalAmirvideo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=6385015&amp;page=2|title=Mumbai Terrorist Wanted to Kill and Die and Become Famous, ABC News, 3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an officer, Kasab spoke Pathani Hindi, and told the police that he threw up the moment he saw all the blood and gore. "Kasab said that he could not bear the sight of dead bodies and after creating enough havoc wanted to go back to Pakistan," the officer said.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

"We were told that our big brother India is so rich and we are dying of poverty and hunger. My father sells [[dahi vada|dahi wada]] in a stall in Lahore and we did not even get enough food to eat from his earnings. I was promised that once they knew that I was successful in my operation, they would give 150,000 rupees (around US$3,352), to my family," said Kasab.&lt;ref name="ABCUSA_AjmalAmirvideo"/&gt;

Police said they were shocked by his readiness to switch loyalties after he was apprehended.&lt;ref name="ABCUSA_AjmalAmirvideo"/&gt; "If you give me regular meals and money I will do the same for you that I did for them," he said.&lt;ref name="ABCUSA_AjmalAmirvideo"/&gt;

"When we asked whether he knew any verses from the Quran that described jihad, Kasab said he did not," police said. "In fact he did not know much about Islam or its tenets," according to a police source.&lt;ref name="ABCUSA_AjmalAmirvideo"/&gt;

===Face to face with Abu Jundal===
On 9 August 2012, Kasab was brought face-to-face with [[Zabiuddin Ansari|Abu Jundal]], the handler of Mumbai attacks, at the Arthur Road jail where they identified each other. Kasab also admitted that Jundal had taught him Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Kasab-identifies-Jundal-as-26-11-handler/Article1-911122.aspx|title= Kasab identifies Jundal as 26/11 handler|date= 10 August 2012|accessdate= 27 November 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120813035158/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Kasab-identifies-Jundal-as-26-11-handler/Article1-911122.aspx|archivedate= 13 August 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Several Indian lawyers refused to represent Kasab citing ethical concerns. A resolution was passed unanimously by the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association, which has more than 1,000 members, saying that none of its members would defend any of the accused of the terror attacks.&lt;ref name="lawyers_refusal_rediff"&gt;[[Press Trust of India]] (6 December 2008) [http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/dec/06mumterror-lawyers-refuse-to-defend-kasab.htm Lawyers refuse to take up arrested terrorist's case] [[Rediff.com]].

==Execution==
Kasab's plea for [[clemency]] was rejected by President [[Pranab Mukherjee]] on 5 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajmal Amir Kasab hanged|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/video/national/6/ajmal-amir-kasab-hanged-----/13626|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November, [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] [[Sushilkumar Shinde]] confirmed the President's rejection of the petition. The following day, the Maharashtra state government was formally notified and requested to take action. The date of 21 November was then fixed for the execution, and the Indian government faxed their decision to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Pakistani Foreign Office]].&lt;ref name="ie"/&gt;

Everything so far on secret basis, Kasab was formally informed of his execution on 12 November, after which he requested government officials to inform his mother. On the night of 18–19 November, a senior prison official at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai read Kasab's death warrant to him, informing him at the same time that his petition for clemency had been rejected. Kasab was then asked to sign his death warrant, which he did. He was secretly transferred under heavy guard to [[Yerwada Jail]] in [[Pune]], arriving in the early morning of 19 November. The death and funeral of nationalist politician [[Bal Thackeray]] also aided in diverting attention from Kasab.&lt;ref name=ie&gt;{{cite news|title=I swear by God, won't do such a thing again, uttered Kasab before his execution|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Last-words-Dobara-aisi-galti-nahi-karunga/Article1-962444.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=26 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127172052/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Last-words-Dobara-aisi-galti-nahi-karunga/Article1-962444.aspx|archivedate=27 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An officer at Arthur Road Jail stated anonymously: "Throughout the journey from Mumbai to Pune, he did not cause any trouble. Kasab's attitude was of resignation when he came to know that his mercy petition was rejected by the president. Kasab did not shed a single tear during the last few days."&lt;ref name=ie/&gt;

Only the jail superintendent at Yerwada was made aware of Kasab's identity. Kasab was placed in a special cell when he was at Yerwada and no other inmates were informed of his presence. It was only a few minutes before Kasab's execution that the executioner was informed whom he would be hanging.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|title=Hangman gets last-minute surprise|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hangman-gets-last-minute-surprise/article1-962259.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though reportedly nervous in the final minutes before his execution, Kasab remained quiet and offered prayers.

In Pakistan, the general and official government response was muted, with the media treating the execution as another news item, according to ''[[The Hindu]]''.&lt;ref name="Pakistan quietly absorbs news of execution"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan quietly absorbs news of execution|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakistan-quietly-absorbs-news-of-execution/article4121591.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some journalists attempted to elicit statements from villagers in Kasab's village of Faridkot, they met with a hostile response. A senior LeT commander issued an anonymous statement, saying Kasab was a hero who would "inspire more fighters to follow his path."&lt;ref name="Pakistan quietly absorbs news of execution"/&gt; The [[Pakistani Taliban]]'s spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan issued a statement threatening Indians with retaliation and declaring Kasab would be avenged.

While commending on the well appreciated role of two women officers in the smooth handling of the execution, Patil later responded to threats to avenge Kasab's death by stating that anybody daring to attack the soil of Maharashtra would meet the same fate.&lt;ref name="jailstaffpayhike"&gt;{{cite news|title=Maharashtra jail staff to get pay parity with police department |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/maharashtra-jail-staff-to-get-pay-parity-with-police-department-296711|date=24 November 2012|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|location=Pune|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashya King case''' concerns a boy with a [[brain tumour]] named Ashya King, whose parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, took their son out of [[Southampton General Hospital]] (England) in August 2014 over a disagreement with doctors regarding his treatment.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32013634 | title=Brain tumour boy Ashya King free of cancer, parents say | work=[[BBC News]] | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

King had a [[medulloblastoma]], which was successfully removed through surgery on 24 July 2014. He received further neurosurgery on 22 August.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

King's parents desired their son be treated with [[proton therapy]], which they felt was less harmful than conventional  [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=A.|last2=Sokol|first2=D.

On 28 August 2014, an international manhunt for King and his parents commenced.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ashya-king-s-father-says-u-k-boy-cancer-free-after-prague-treatment-that-led-to-manhunt-1.3005156 | title=Ashya King's father says U.K. boy cancer-free after Prague treatment that led to manhunt | work=[[CBC News]] | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August, King and his parents were found in [[Velez Malaga]], [[Spain]].

The issues about treating the boy were brought to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to be resolved, and on 5 September 2014, the court ruled that King could receive proton therapy in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Doctors from Southampton General Hospital said the treatment would have the same side effects as conventional radiotherapy.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; On 9 September, King arrived at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, where he underwent proton beam therapy.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

'''Boo.com''' was a short-lived, British [[Internet]] company, founded in 1998 by [[Swedes]] [[Ernst Malmsten]], [[Kajsa Leander]] and [[Patrik Hedelin]], who were regarded as sophisticated Internet entrepreneurs in Europe by the investors because they had created an online bookstore named [[Bokus.com]], the third largest book e-retailer (in 1997), before founding the new business '''Boo.com'''. &lt;ref name="Boo Introduction addition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing Strategy, Implementation and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-1-292-07761-1|page=108|edition=sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boo Intro 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wray|first1=Richard|title=Boo.com spent fast and died young but its legacy shaped internet retailing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/may/16/media.business|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several highly publicized delays, Boo.com launched in the autumn of 1999 selling branded fashion apparel over the [[Internet]]. The company spent $135 million of [[venture capital]] in just 18 months,&lt;ref name="boohoo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Boo Hoo: A dot.com Story from Concept to Catastrophe|last1=Malmsten|first1=Ernst|publisher=Random House Business Books|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7126-7239-9}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-07-07 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and it was placed into [[receivership]] on 18 May 2000 and [[liquidated]].

In June 2008, [[CNET]] hailed Boo.com as one of the greatest dot-com busts in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters-49296926/|title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=5 June 2008|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst Malmsten wrote about the experience in a book called ''Boo Hoo: A dot.com Story from Concept to Catastrophe'', published in 2001.&lt;ref name='boohoo'/&gt;

==Marketing plan==

===Company vision===

The vision of Boo.com was to become the first largest online sports e-retailer around the world and not just as a European brand. It planned to set up stores in both Europe and America simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Boo Introduction addition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing Strategy, Implementation and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-1-292-07761-1|page=108|edition=sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand name===

The brand name was initially suggested as Bo.com, which was inspired by the actor [[Bo Derek]]. The final domain name, Boo.com, was bought for $2500 from a dealer as the domain Bo.com was already in use.&lt;ref name="Boo brand name"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malmsten|first1=Ernst|last2=Portanger|first2=Erik|last3=Drazin|first3=Charles|title=Boo Hoo. A Dot.Com Story from Concept of Catastrophe|date=2001|publisher=Random House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===

The target customers of Boo.com were young, wealthy and fashionable people between 18 to 24 years old, who were expected to be attracted by sports and fashion brands offered by Boo.com.&lt;ref name="Boo Introduction addition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing Strategy, Implementation and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-1-292-07761-1|page=108|edition=sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boo.com created a virtual shopping assistant, Miss Boo, to assist customers with tips given at each step. Boo.com also developed technology that allowed online customers to put their chosen products onto 3D models and then inspect the result.&lt;ref name="Boo brand strategy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing Strategy, Implementation and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-1-292-07761-1|page=109|edition=sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headquarters and relaunch==
The company had its headquarters along [[Carnaby Street]] in [[London]] in a building which it initially shared with the ''Erotic Review Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Wray"&gt;Wray, Richard. "[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/may/16/media.business Boo.com spent fast and died young but its legacy shaped internet retailing]." ''[[The Guardian]]''. 16 May 2005. Retrieved on 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The company initially had 40 employees.&lt;ref name="Sorkin"&gt;Sorkin, Andrew Ross. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/business/international-business-boocom-online-fashion-retailer-goes-out-of-business.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Boo.com, Online Fashion Retailer, Goes Out of Business]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. 19 May 2000. Retrieved on 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, it had a total of eight offices and 400 employees&lt;ref name="Wray"/&gt; in [[Amsterdam]], [[Munich]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="Sorkin"/&gt; It relaunched in the autumn of 2000 with Kate Buggeln, an ex-[[Bloomingdale's]] salesperson and Internet consultant, appointed as president. She told ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' that they were working to "expand beyond the portal business model into Boo products and Boo licensing."&lt;ref&gt;Seckler, Valerie, "Boo Names New Boss: Kate Buggelin," WWD, Mon. 17 July 2000, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for failure ==

===Timing===
Although there were several months of delays prior to launch and problems with the user experience when boo.com first launched, these had been largely fixed by the time the company entered receivership. Sales had grown rapidly and were around $500,000 for the fortnight prior to the site being shut down.

The fundamental problem was that the company was following an extremely aggressive growth plan, launching simultaneously in multiple European countries. This plan was founded on the assumption of the ready availability of venture capital money to see the company through the first few years of trading until sales caught up with operating expenses. Such capital ceased to be available for all practical purposes in the second quarter of 2000 following dramatic falls in the NASDAQ presaging the "dot crash" following the [[Dot-com bubble]]. Boo was one of numerous similar [[Dot-com company]] failures over the subsequent two years.
One Boo.com manager acknowledges that the company's failure is that global marketing and advertising costs too much, and that managers and technology invest too little. It spent 135 million of its investment in 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boocom公司为何倒闭|url=http://www.docin.com/p-845376311.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with the user experience===

[[File:Boo Homepage.jpg|thumb|right|The Boo.com Homepage as it appeared in May 2000.]]

The boo.com website was widely criticized as poorly designed for its target audience, going against many [[usability]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bohmann.dk/articles/usability_reviews/boo_com.html&lt;/ref&gt; The site relied heavily on [[JavaScript]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] technology to display [[pseudo-3D]] views of wares as well as Miss Boo, a sales-assistant-style [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. The first publicly released version of the site included many large pages; the home page, for example, was several hundred kilobytes which meant that many users had to wait minutes for the site to load, as [[broadband]] technologies were not widely available at the time. The site's front page contained the warning, "this site is designed for 56K modems and above".

The complicated design required the site to be displayed in a fixed-size window, which limited the space available to display product information to the customer. Navigation techniques changed as the customer moved around the site.

The site's interface was complex and included a hierarchical system that required the user to answer four or five different questions before sometimes revealing that there were no products in stock in a particular sub-section. The same basic questions then had to be answered again until results were found.

===Problems with the management===

Boo.com management team can not provide answers of the goal of the website visitors, the conversion percentage, each customer's minimum spend and their purchase cost to one of their going-to-be investor [[Pequot Capital]] before launching, and the founder planned to release it with thousands of tasks that some of them need to be done by employees who had not been recruited.&lt;ref name="Boo brand name" /&gt;

===Problems with the supply channels===

At the beginning, it was difficult to become a [[distribution channel]] of prestigious sports and leisure brands as they have already have their own distribution network with [[high street]] and small retailers. These brands also concerned that their brands values would be negatively influenced when their products were sold cheaper on Boo.com or with different price in different countries.&lt;ref name="Boo brand name" /&gt;

===Excessive expenditure on marketing activities===

$135 million of marketing investment was used by Boo.com within 18 months in order to set up a worldwide online sport and fashion brands retailer in a short amount of time. Some of the investments are shown below.&lt;ref name="Boo failure"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roggio|first1=Armando|title=2 Ecommerce Blunders to Avoid in 2015|url=https://www.practicalecommerce.com/2-Ecommerce-Blunders-to-Avoid-in-2015|website=Practical Ecommerce|publisher=Practical Ecommerce|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. To attract consumers to shop on Boo.com, it developed a brand new [[Internet virtual technology]] with which consumers could drag their intended clothes on the virtual 3D body model and then view it from whatever angles and distance they wanted. The investment in this technology cost Boo.com over $6 million to develop and $0.5 million every month to maintain.

2. Hundreds of staff in many countries were employed and paid for local marketing in order to set up a global brand at the beginning.

3. Boo.com spent $25 million on [[advertising]] and [[public relations]] marketing before it opened and sold products.

A manager of Boo.com admitted that the failure of the company is also that the global marketing and advertising expenses were too large, and the technology investment was too small. It consumed 135 million of its investment in 2 years.

== Burn rate ==
Boo.com spent £125 million in just six months.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E4DB103CF931A35755C0A9669C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Fashionmall.com Swoops In for the Boo.com Fire Sale | date=2 June 2000 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boo.com's sales did not match expectations, due partly to a higher-than-expected rate of product returns (a service that was offered for free, but charged for by their logistics supplier [[Deutsche Post]]). Poor management and a lack of communication between departments resulted in rapid growth in costs. The effectiveness of an expensive ad campaign was limited because the website was not ready in time, resulting in curious visitors being greeted with a holding page.

Staff and contractors were recruited in large numbers, with a lack of direction and executive decision about how many people were required, resulting in high payroll costs.

== Aftermath ==

The biggest loser among boo.com's investors was Omnia, a fund backed by members of [[Lebanon]]'s wealthy [[Rafic Hariri|Hariri family]], which put nearly £20 million into the company.

Creditors, most of whom were advertising agencies, were owed around £12 million. Over 400 staff and contractors were made redundant in London and around the world, and many had not been paid for several months.

In a widely circulated article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnl.net/who/bibliography/learned-boo-com//|title=Tristan Louis (TNL.net)|website=Tristan Louis (TNL.net)}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Interim CTO [[Tristan Louis]] broke down the problems that plagued the company, in one of the first [[Postmortem documentation|post-mortems]] of a technology company posted online.

[[Fashionmall.com]], which had been operating since 1994, bought the remains of Boo.com, which included brand, Web address and advertising materials but did not include any physical assets, software or distribution channels.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; The deal also included the Miss Boo character. Boo's main assets, its software and technology, were sold to [[Dan_Wagner#Bright Station|Bright Station]], a British company run by [[Internet]] entrepreneur [[Dan Wagner]], for $250,000 and served as the basis for [[Venda Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/02/business/international-business-fashionmallcom-swoops-in-for-the-boocom-fire-sale.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Fashionmall.com Swoops In for the Boo.com Fire Sale|first=Andrew Ross|last=Sorkin|date=2 June 2000|publisher=|via=query.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Less than $2 million was earned by selling all Boo's remaining assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jobfairy.com/articles01/BooAndthe100OtherDumbestM.html|title=jobfairy.com - Boo! And the 100 Other Dumbest Moments in e-Business History|website=www.jobfairy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[CNET]] called Boo.com the sixth greatest dot-com flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html |title=Top 10 dot-com flops |accessdate=2014-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210101028/http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current state of the domain ==
In May 2007 [[Web Reservations International]] (WRI) turned boo.com into a travel site with reviews and listings. When the new site launched, it already had more than one million user reviews which had been collected from existing WRI travel sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utalkmarketing.com/Article.aspx?id=1895 |title=boo.com in new travel guise |work=utalkmarketing.com |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014939/http://www.utalkmarketing.com/Article.aspx?id=1895 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the new boo.com site announced that it was closing down with effect from 1 November 2010.

{{As of|November 2017}} boo.com redirects to hostelworld.com.

'''Breakin' Up Winter''' is an old-time music 'retreat', a gathering of old-time string band musicians that began the first weekend of March, 1994.  It eschews the contest approach common to the larger festivals. It brings together hundreds of old-time musicians in a state park setting where the first focus is on educational programs and presentations by scholars and icons of the old-time music worlds.  And, of course, jamming.  It is presented by the Nashville Old-Time String Band Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that began as an offshoot of a community education class in Nashville, Tennessee.

==History==
The first Breakin' Up Winter retreat was just that - an informal gathering of friends who shared an interest in and love for old-time string band music.  Fresh from another small old-time gathering in Athens, Alabama, they wanted to create that same atmosphere in Middle Tennessee.  The first gathering was held in the Cedar Forest Lodge of the Cedars of Lebanon State Park near Lebanon, Tennessee, about 30 miles outside Nashville.  The retreat continues at Cedars of Lebanon, but now encompasses the entire state park. Legendary old-time fiddler Charlie Acuff was a guest of honor at that first event and has been a central artist through the years.

==Scholars and Artists==
Charlie Acuff was the first in a long line of widely respected "heritage artists" - icons of old-time music - to headline Breakin' Up Winter. There developed a theme for the first day of the event - 'Roots of Old-Time Music' - that brings in noted researchers, authors, and performers.  

Noted traditional music researcher/author/folklorist Charles Wolfe was a mainstay until his untimely death in 2006.

Each year, the event begins with scholarly presentations by researchers and authors and demonstrations by musicians with deep roots in the music.

"Participatory music like old-time music involves a great deal of gifting—passing along tunes, playing with others, learning from others, sharing, and coming together for events such as Breakin’ Up Winter to do all of this," writes Jeff Todd Titon, professor of ethnomusicology at Brown University.

In addition to Charlie Acuff and Charles Wolfe, presenters and performers have included: 
*[[Alan Jabbour]]
*Bill Mansfield
*Bruce Greene
*[[Clyde Davenport]]
*Dan Gellert
*Don Pedi
*Evan Hatch
*Franklin George
*Gerry Milnes
*[[George Gruhn]]
*J.P. Fraley
*James Bryan
*Jim Griffith
*John Harrod
*Joyce Cauthen
*[[Mike Seeger]]
*Kerry Blech
*Paul Wells
*Ralph Blizard
*Ron Pen
*Will Keys
*Walt Haden

== The Focus: Old-time String Band Music ==
Some call it "mountain music" or "old-timey" or "fiddle tunes."  It's the heart of this retreat and the mission of the Nashville Old-Time String Band Association: ". . . to preserve, promote, and perform old-time string band music."  

A flurry of interest in "old-time" music in the 1940s, and the folk music revival of the 1960s and 70's, brought millions of new listeners to this traditional music.  

But in the hills and hollows of Appalachia and many communities beyond, it didn't need reviving.  It remained the music that people learned to play knee-to-knee with musicians who learned it the same way. There remain many players whose introduction to the music came (and still comes) not from radio or recordings, but through family and friends who themselves who were passing it down directly through the generations. 

It is to those roots of old-time music that this retreat reaches and which is the focus of the first day of the event.

In 2008, NOTSBA began presenting its Heritage Award to musicians. The first went to Charlie Acuff, the second to Clyde Davenport, the third to Franklin George. The fourth will be presented in 2010 to Lester McCumbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1745">The '''Brooklyn Underground Film Festival''' was an annual showcase of typically low-budget, under-distributed or [[amateur]] videos and [[metavideo]]s.  The festival was initially held in DUMBO, Brooklyn and later moved to [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The festival ran from 2002-2007.

The festival also showed the work of emerging non-media artists.  The first festival included a large wheat paste mural by the artist known as [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]].

==History==
The festival was founded in 2002 by graduates of [[Pratt Institute]], Josh Koury, [[Myles Kane]], Cris Moris and Gaia Cornwall. It was funded in part by a growing number of local businesses.

The festival ceased operations in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Evolution of the Underground Film Festival: Changes at NYUFF, CUFF, BUFF... |author=Benjamin Crossley-Marra  |url=http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2008/04/the_evolution_o.html |agency= |work=[[IndieWire]] |publisher= |location= |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=   |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405202115/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2008/04/the_evolution_o.html |archivedate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dumb Ways to Die''' is an Australian [[public service announcement]] campaign made by [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Metro Trains]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia]] to promote railway safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNR2EpS0jw |title=Dumb Ways to Die | format=YouTube |author = DumbWays2Die |date=14 November 2012 }} - official video link&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign video went [[viral video|viral]] through sharing and [[social media]] starting in November 2012.&lt;ref name="Age19102012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/metros-tongueincheek-transport-safety-animated-video-goes-viral-on-social-media-20121118-29kbn.html|title=Metro's tongue-in-cheek transport safety animated video goes viral on social media|publisher=The Age|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The campaign was devised by advertising agency [[McCann Erickson|McCann Melbourne]]. It appeared in newspapers, local radio and outdoor advertising throughout the Metro Trains network and on [[Tumblr]].&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.australiancreative.com.au/news/mccann-s-dumb-ways-to-die|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119024033/http://www.australiancreative.com.au/news/mccann-s-dumb-ways-to-die|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 November 2012|title=McCann's dumb ways to die|publisher=Australian Creative|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mescall, executive creative director of McCann, said "The aim of this campaign is to engage an audience that really doesn't want to hear any kind of safety message, and we think ''Dumb Ways To Die'' will."&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; McCann estimated that within two weeks, it had generated at least [[AUD|$]]50 million worth of global media value in addition to more than 700 media stories, for "a fraction of the cost of one TV ad".&lt;ref name="Age29112012"/&gt; According to Metro Trains, the campaign contributed to a more than 30% reduction in "near-miss" accidents, from 13.29 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2011 – January 2012, to 9.17 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2012 – January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No dumb luck: Metro claims safety success|author=Stephen Cauchi |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-dumb-luck-metro-claims-safety-success-20130214-2eelt.html |newspaper=The Age|date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated video===
The video was animated by Julian Frost and produced by Cinnamon Darvall.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; It was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 14 November 2012 and made public two days later. It featured "Numpty, Hapless, Pillock, Dippy, Dummkopf, Dimwit, Stupe, Lax, Clod, Doomed, Numskull, Bungle, Mishap, Dunce, Calamity, Ninny, Botch and Doofus killing themselves in increasingly stupid ways"&lt;ref name="HS19102012"/&gt; culminating in the last three characters (Stumble, Bonehead and Putz) being killed by trains due to unsafe behavior. It was viewed 2.5 million times within 48 hours&lt;ref name="Age19102012"/&gt; and 4.7 million times within 72 hours.&lt;ref name="HS19102012"/&gt; Within two weeks, the video had been viewed 30 million times.&lt;ref name="Age29112012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/aussie-viral-video-dumb-ways-to-die-lives-on-20121129-2ahm0.html|title=Aussie viral video, 'Dumb Ways to Die', lives on|publisher=The Age|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{As of|2018|11}}, the video has received over 171 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Dumb Ways to Die YouTube video|format=YouTube| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNR2EpS0jw|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song===
The song "Dumb Ways to Die" from the video was written by John Mescall with music by [[Ollie McGill]] from [[The Cat Empire]], who also produced it.&lt;ref name="3AW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3aw.com.au/blogs/3aw-breakfast-blog/dumb-ways-to-die-goes-viral/20121119-29kvr.html|title='Dumb ways to die' goes viral|publisher=3AW|date=19 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202158/http://www.3aw.com.au/blogs/3aw-breakfast-blog/dumb-ways-to-die-goes-viral/20121119-29kvr.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by Emily Lubitz, the lead vocalist of [[Tinpan Orange]], with McGill providing backing vocals.&lt;ref name="Age19102012" /&gt; The band on the recording consists of Gavin Pearce on Bass, Danny Faruggia on drums and Brett Wood on guitar.&lt;ref name="HS19102012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cute-dumb-ways-to-die-melbourne-safety-video-becomes-internet-smash/story-e6frf7jo-1226519417846|title=Cute Melbourne safety video Dumb Ways to Die becomes internet smash|publisher=Herald Sun|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on [[iTunes]], attributed to the artist "Tangerine Kitty" (a reference to [[Tinpan Orange]] and [[The Cat Empire]]).&lt;ref name="Age19102012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1481518/australian-dumb-ways-to-die-ad-goes-viral-song-gains-sales |first = William | last = Gruger | title=Australian 'Dumb Ways to Die' Ad Goes Viral, Song Gains Sales | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  Within 24 hours of its release, it was in the top 10 on the iTunes chart and on 18 November was the sixth most popular song globally,&lt;ref name="Age19102012"/&gt; ahead of "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" by [[Rihanna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/advertising/mccann-creates-australia-s-biggest-ever-viral-hit|title=McCann creates Australia's biggest ever viral hit|publisher=B&amp;T Marketing &amp; Media|date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "Australia's biggest ever viral hit".&lt;ref name="3AW"/&gt; It also reached the top 10 on iTunes charts in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/hk/itunes |title=Hong Kong iTunes Top 20 Songs |date=21 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKsD4KVA?url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/hk/itunes |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/sg/itunes |title=Singapore iTunes Top 20 Songs |date=21 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKrabpxy?url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/sg/itunes |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/tw/itunes |title=Taiwan iTunes Top 20 Songs |date=21 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKrttnBk?url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/tw/itunes |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/vn/itunes |title=Vietnam iTunes Top 20 Songs |date=21 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKrpzboc?url=http://www.hotmusiccharts.com/vn/itunes |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks, 65 [[cover version]]s had been uploaded to YouTube.&lt;ref name="Age29112012"/&gt;  --&gt;

In May 2013, Metro released a "Dumb Ways to Die" game as an app for [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb Ways to Die|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/dumb-ways-to-die/id639930688?mt=8|work=Apple App Store|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Piranhas and Swat Wasps in new 'Dumb Ways to Die' Game|url=http://creativity-online.com/work/metro-dumb-ways-to-die-game/31616|work=Creativity Online|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game, developed by Julian Frost and Samuel Baird,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost|first=Julian|title=Dumb Ways to Die Game|url=http://julianfrost.co.nz/things/|work=julianfrost.co.nz|publisher=Julian Frost|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; invites players to avoid the dangerous activities engaged in by the various characters featured throughout the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb Ways to Die: You have to Keep Them Alive, or Die Hilariously|url=http://appchronicles.com/dumb-ways-to-die-you-have-to-keep-them-alive-or-die-hilariously/|work=App Chronicles|accessdate=27 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607191846/http://appchronicles.com/dumb-ways-to-die-you-have-to-keep-them-alive-or-die-hilariously/|archivedate=7 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the app, players can also pledge to "not do dumb stuff around trains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nudd|first=Tim|title=Dumb Ways to Die Is Now a Video Game for the iPhone and iPad McCann Australia extends beloved train-safety ad|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dumb-ways-die-now-video-game-iphone-and-ipad-149625|work=AdWeek|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb Ways To Die tops charts with new iPhone + iPad app game via McCann + Barrel Of Donkeys|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2013/05/dumb-ways-to-die-tops-charts-w.html|work=Campaign Brief|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities include things like getting toast out with a fork and poking a stick at a grizzly bear.
An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was also eventually released in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb Ways to Die|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.au.com.metro.DumbWaysToDie|work=Google Play Store|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the game is to earn as many points as possible by avoiding "dying" in one of the activities. Lives can be lost by "dying" in one of the activities. The player has three chances to prevent the characters from dying.

A sequel titled "Dumb Ways to Die 2: The Games" was released on November 14, 2014. In the sequel, there are a lot more varieties of challenges in each particular building, and each building has a particular theme. Before a train arrives at a building, the player plays a challenge to counter something related to trains. If successful, bonus points can be earned at the end of the game. There are 8 challenges each in every building. Like the original game, the game's characters do plenty of dangerous and unsafe activities. Lives can be lost by "dying" in one of the activities. The player has three chances to prevent the characters from dying.

A second sequel titled "Dumb Ways to Die 3: World Tour" was released on December 21, 2017 and requires the player to collect coins from houses that are fixed up from being initially broken. The houses are fixed by the player playing a new minigame for each area containing those houses.

==Reception==
Susie O'Brien in the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' in Melbourne criticised the ad for trivialising serious injuries and being about advertisers' ego rather than effective safety messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/ego-trip-a-dumb-way-to-tackle-rail-safety/story-fn56aaiq-1226523387207 | title = Ego trip a dumb way to tackle rail safety | first = Susie | last = O'Brien | date = 25 November 2012 | work = [[The Herald Sun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Crerar of the ''Herald Sun'' wrote that the song's "catchy chorus was the most arresting hook since [[Psy (entertainer)|PSY]]'s [[Gangnam Style]]."&lt;ref name="HS19102012" /&gt; Alice Clarke writing in the ''Herald Sun'' described the video as "adorably morbid" and wrote that Victoria's public transport "broke its long running streak of terrible ads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/how-weve-cornered-market-in-terrible-advertising/story-e6frfhqf-1226523822413|title=How we've cornered the market in terrible advertising|publisher=Herald Sun|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisy Dumas of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' described it as "darkly cute — and irksomely catchy" and the chorus as "instant [[earworm]] material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/being-dumb-is-almost-cool-with-surprise-advertising-hit-20121118-29k6z.html|title=Being dumb is almost cool with surprise advertising hit|first=Daisy |last=Dumas| work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Starr of [[CNET]] described the campaign as the [[Darwin Awards]] meets ''[[The Gashlycrumb Tinies]]'' and the song as "a cutesy indie-pop hit in the style of [[Feist (singer)|Feist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle | last=Starr | url=http://www.cnet.com.au/metro-trains-psa-details-dumb-ways-to-die-339342487.htm|title=Metro Trains PSA details dumb ways to die|publisher=CNET|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan Booker of [[Gizmodo]] described it as "taking a page out of the ''[[Happy Tree Friends]]'' book and mixing cute with horrifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Logan |last=Booker|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/11/adorable-yet-horrifying-metro-trains-safety-video-quietly-becomes-a-youtube-hit/|title=Adorable, Yet Horrifying Metro Trains Safety Video Quietly Becomes A YouTube Sensation|publisher=Gizmodo|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen Stocks of YouTube Australia said the video was unusual due to the high number of views from mobile devices.&lt;ref name="mUmBRELLA"&gt;{{cite news|first=Karen |last=Stocks|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/dumb-ways-to-die-the-most-viral-australian-brand-video-of-all-time-126244|title=Mobile devices help ‘Dumb ways to die’ become the fastest spreading Australian viral brand video of all time|publisher=mUmBRELLA|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stocks attributed the success to "A snappy headline. A catchy tune that gets stuck in your head. And a message that is easy to understand and perfectly targeted."&lt;ref name="mUmBRELLA"/&gt;

The ''[[Sunshine Coast Daily]]'' described it as "the Gangnam Style of train safety campaigns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/dumb-ways-die-video-gangam-style-train-safety/1628930/|title=Dumb ways to die video the Gangam Style of train safety|publisher=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arlene Paredes of the ''[[International Business Times]]'' said the video was "brilliant in getting viewers' attention" and "arguably one of the cutest [[Public service announcement|PSA]]s ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/406599/20121120/viral-video-8m-views-dumb-ways-die.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125192855/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/406599/20121120/viral-video-8m-views-dumb-ways-die.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=Viral Video with 8M Views: "Dumb Ways to Die" Melbourne Metro Ad - Cute, Twisted, Brilliant|publisher=International Business Times|date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness and unwanted repercussions===
The campaign received some criticism on the basis that suicide is one of the most influential causes of rail trauma, and the ad reinforces deadly trains as a possible suicide method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safetyrisk.com.au/dumb-ways-to-die-and-a-strange-sense-of-success/ Dumb Ways To Die – A Strange Sense of Success] Retrieved 16 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[Mumbrella]] in February 2013, a former employee of Victoria's Department of Infrastructure advised [[critical thinking]] when evaluating claims made regarding improvements to safety. Reference was made specifically to the claimed 20 percent reduction in risky behavior as being "[[social media]] bullshit".&lt;ref name="mumbrella evans 20130211"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mumbrella.com.au/dumb-ways-to-die-and-social-media-bullshit-138887 | title=Dumb Ways To Die and social media bullshit | work=Mumbrella | author = Karalee Evans | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship in Russia===
In February 2013, [[Artemy Lebedev]]'s [[blog]] was censored by [[Roskomnadzor]], the Russian government agency in charge of Internet censorship, for including the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=ru&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://lenta.ru/news/2013/02/05/dumbwaystoblacklist/|title=Post on your blog for clip on blocked Lebedeva stupid ways to commit suicide|publisher=Lenta.ru|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the YouTube video was also censored, with the "This content is not available in your country due to a legal complaint from the government" message. The official takedown notice sent to [[Livejournal.com]] was quoted, in part, by Lebedev in his blog.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The song's lyrics contains a description of different ways of committing suicide, such as: using drugs beyond their expiration date, standing on an edge of a platform, running across the rails, eating [[Cyanoacrylate|superglue]] and other. The animated personages demonstrate dangerous ways of suicide in attractive for children and teenagers comic format. The lines such as "hide in a [[Clothes dryer|dryer]]” and “What’s this red button do?" contain an incitement to commit those acts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this fact, the video was included into the [[ABC Show]] and was shown in more than 50 cities of Russia.

===Awards===

===Life Insurance Partnership===
Due to their success, the Dumb Ways to Die characters have been featured in a promotional campaign for [[Empire Life|Empire Life Insurance]], with their key message being, "the dumbest way to die is without life insurance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://empirelife.ca |title=The Unexpected Happens Everyday - Empire Life Insurance | date=1 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715005456/https://www.empirelife.ca/ |archivedate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empire.ca/consumer/about-us/news/news-archive-2014/2014-05-29/en/ |title=The dumbest way to die is without life insurance, Empire Life launches new advertising campaign |date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign was met with mixed reviews, with some advertising critics accusing Metro of "selling out" on a successful campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nudd |first=Tim |url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/nothings-sacred-dumb-ways-die-now-being-used-hawk-life-insurance-158279 |title=Nothing's Sacred: Dumb Ways to Doe Now Being Used to Hawk Life Insurance |work = [[Adweek]] | date = 12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elvis the Concert''' is a [[concert tour]] started in 1997 that features a video and the voice of [[Elvis Presley]] performing with his 1970s backup band via computer technology.

== Origins ==

In the mid-1990s, [[Elvis Presley Enterprises]] started experimenting with recordings of Elvis' live concerts, and discovered that through the use of [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|sound mixing]] they were able to eliminate virtually all of the ambient noise from the [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] recordings, thus leaving only Elvis' voice. After some work, they conceived a special concert, to be held on August 16, 1997, the twentieth Anniversary of Elvis' death. The show featured Elvis' original 1970s back-up band ([[TCB Band]]), his back-up singers (The Stamps Quartet, [[The Imperials]], [[The Sweet Inspirations]] and [[Millie Kirkham]]) and was performed at Memphis, Tennessee's [[Mid-South Coliseum]]. During the show, Priscilla Presley introduced a video that Lisa Marie Presley made. The video was of Lisa Marie performing a duet with her father Elvis on the song "Don't Cry Daddy". It was so successful that the video was shown again.

The show was a huge success, gaining worldwide press. The massive success of the show prompted EPE to draw up plans for a special version of the show to take on the road.

== The World Tour ==

Starting in 1998, a scaled-down version of the show was taken on tour. The format of the show follows one of Elvis' 1970s live concerts, albeit somewhat differently.

The line-up of musicians involved is as follows:
*[[James Burton]]{{spaced ndash}}Lead Guitar
*[[Jerry Scheff]]{{spaced ndash}}Bass
**After Scheff left the TCB band, he has been replaced on the more recent tours by [[Norbert Putnam]]
*[[Ronnie Tutt]]{{spaced ndash}}Drums
**Tutt is sometimes unable to perform with Elvis' band due to pressing worldwide commitments (which include playing drums in [[Neil Diamond]]'s band). For these shows, he is replaced by his friend and protégé [[Paul Leim]]
*[[Glen D. Hardin]]{{spaced ndash}}Piano, Keyboards
*[[Joe Guercio]]{{spaced ndash}}Orchestra Conductor

Backing Vocals:
*[[The Sweet Inspirations]]{{spaced ndash}}Estelle Brown, Myrna Smith, Portia Brown
*[[The Stamps Quartet]]&lt;ref name=AlternatingTours/&gt;{{spaced ndash}}Ed Enoch, Ed Hill, Royce Taylor, Butch Owens
*[[The Imperials]]&lt;ref name=AlternatingTours/&gt;{{spaced ndash}}Terry Blackwood, Joe Moscheo, Sherman Andrus
*[[Millie Kirkham]]{{spaced ndash}}Soprano

Rhythm guitarist [[John Wilkinson (guitarist)|John Wilkinson]], having suffered a stroke in 1989, was unable to join the band and was replaced by Tony Smith. (However, Wilkinson did join the group at the 25th Anniversary concert, held at the Pyramid in Memphis.)

The show was conceived by Todd Morgan, Randy Johnson. Joe Guercio and Stig Edgren.

*Produced by Elvis Presley Enterprises and Stig Edgren
*Directed and staged by Randy Johnson
*Musical Direction by Joe Guercio

== Show Format ==

The format of the show begins with the traditional opening theme of Elvis' concerts: "[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]" by [[Richard Strauss]] (better known as the theme to the movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''). This segues into the song "[[See See Rider]]" from ''[[Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii]]''.

The show is divided into two different acts, each one 45 minutes to an hour, with an intermission between them. The main material used for the shows comes from ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]'', ''[[Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii]]'', and ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. And in recent years songs from the [[Elvis_(1968_TV_program)|'68 Comeback Special]] has been added to the mix, most notably the songs "Trouble" (which usually segues into either "Hound Dog" or "That's All Right"), and "If I Can Dream" which is used to end the first act.

During the show, a large video screen hangs above the main set upon which the video of Elvis' performance is projected. Two smaller screens hang on either side, and video of the live musicians, or special video packages are shown.

The first act usually ends with a gospel music segment. If The Imperials are performing, they perform a solo version of "He Touched Me". If the Stamps are performing, they perform an a cappella rendition of "Sweet, Sweet Spirit" (after an introduction by Elvis from the movie ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''). After that song, a version of "How Great Thou Art" by Elvis is played with the band. In early shows, this proved to be problematic: since the audio was taken from the 1974 live album ''Elvis As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis'', but there was no video footage. Thus, the screen was left black, and only the audio was played. After a few tours, a special piece of footage was made from the 1972 movie ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'' which was edited, sped up, and slowed down in a few places in order to have it match up with the 1974 audio.

The show always ends with Elvis' traditional show closer "Can't Help Falling in Love", and the traditional announcement of "Elvis has Left the Building." At the 1997 and 2002 concerts Elvis' former announcer [[Al Dvorin]] closed the show by saying "Elvis has left for Graceland".

After a domestic tour (which ended with a show at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, IN, the site of Elvis' final live concert on June 26, 1977), the show went to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. 

=== 25th anniversary – 2002 ===

In 2002, a special 25th anniversary show commemorating the 25th anniversary of Presley's death was held in Memphis, TN at the Pyramid arena. This show was even bigger than the 20th anniversary concert, and featured three different acts. The first act served as a retrospective of Elvis' career from 1956 to 1968. Elvis' former drummer [[D.J. Fontana]] made an appearance, playing drums to footage from one of Elvis' appearances on ''The Steve Allen Show''. Saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]] made an appearance as well playing sax on "Blue Suede Shoes" and on a performance of "Return to Sender" (taken from his movie ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'') as part of a special section highlighting Elvis' career in movies.

Act Two showed the gospel side of Elvis. During a special section of gospel music, a surprise was in store for fans as J.D. Sumner's voice was multi-tracked for a performance (with Elvis and the Stamps) of "Why Me, Lord?" Lisa Marie also made an appearance singing an original song she wrote called "Nobody Noticed It (You're Still Lovely)".

Act 3 was the usual Elvis: the Concert show format and featured new songs, like "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" from ''That's The Way It Is'' outtakes. This was the only show in which John Wilkinson, who was Elvis' rhythm guitar player from 1969 to 1977, made an appearance. He is not shown on the new DVD ''Elvis Lives'', but he can be seen on the fan footage of this show.

=== 30th anniversary – 2007 ===

On August 16, 2007, Elvis: The 30th Anniversary Concert was held at the Fed-Ex Forum in Memphis and was on a bigger scale than the 20th and 25th anniversary concerts. It featured:
*Joe Guercio (musical director and conductor)
*the TCB Band members James Burton (lead guitar), Glen D. Hardin (piano), Jerry Scheff (bass), and Ronnie Tutt (drums)
*Sweet Inspirations members Myrna Smith, and Estelle Brown
*Imperials members Sherman Andrus, Terry Blackwood, Joe Moscheo, and Gus Gaches
*Stamps members Bill Baize, Ed Hill, Larry Strickland, and Donnie Sumner
*Jordanaires members Gordon Stoker and Ray Walker
*D.J. Fontana (drums) and Millie Kirkham (soprano). 

Also appearing:
*The Dempseys and members of the [[Memphis Symphony Orchestra]].

The 30th Anniversary featured another duet by Elvis Presley and Lisa Marie Presley. This time singing "In The Ghetto". The video is available for download on iTunes.

Also, a new opening was done for the show which featured a space view of Earth which zoomed in on Memphis and then Graceland, right into the window which led to Elvis' bedroom. There, "Elvis" is getting ready for the show with Jerry Schilling giving him his sunglasses. They go down the stairs to the outside of Graceland where they meet up with Joe Esposito and then go into a helicopter. The group flies to the Fed-Ex Forum where audio of Elvis (from the CD ''An Afternoon in the Garden'') says "It's a big place, man". Then they land and go inside the arena, starting the show.

At the show, Priscilla announced that this would be the final show for Elvis: The Concert.

In late 2007, Elvis: The Concert opened for The White Stripes on their European tour.

==Home media==
In 2007, the 2002 25th Anniversary Concert was made available in DVD form in a disc called ''Elvis Lives''. The concert was shown on [[PBS]] Stations during the annual pledge week. ''Elvis Lives'' only contains Act III (70s Concert) which was a regular Elvis: The Concert segment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">[[File:Enric Marco Batlle (2001).jpg|thumb|Enric Marco receiving the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award]] in 2001.]]
'''Enric Marco''' (born 1921 in [[Barcelona]]) is an [[impostor]] who claimed to have been a [[prison]]er in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[concentration camp]]s [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] and [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] in [[World War II]].  He was awarded the [[Creu de Sant Jordi]] by the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] government in 2001 and wrote a book on his experiences.  In 2005 he admitted his claims were false and returned his medal, after his deception was revealed by university researcher [[Benito Bermejo]].

Marco told [[TV3 (Catalonia)|Catalan TV]]: "''I wasn't in a concentration camp. I was held in captivity and the Nazis did impose penalties on me. But that does not exonerate me from being an impostor."'' He said he was released after being mistreated for several weeks and returned to [[Spain]] in 1943. Marco claimed he had volunteered in 1941 to work in [[Kiel]] for the Nazi war industry. In his made-up story called ''Memoir of Hell'' Marco wrote he had been involved in the [[French resistance]] and captured by the [[Gestapo]] in southern France.&lt;ref name="news.bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4539461.stm | title=Spanish Nazi camp 'survivor' lied | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=A leading representative of Holocaust survivors in Spain has admitted to being "an impostor" | date=12 May 2005 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2001 Marco represented an association of survivors of the thousands of [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] who had truly been deported to Nazi concentration camps.

In the period 1978&amp;ndash;1979 Marco, a metal worker, had been the General Secretary of the Spanish [[Anarchism|anarchist]] Union CNT ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]), from which he was expelled in 1980.

{{Crusade}}
{{Christianization of Finland}}
The '''First Swedish Crusade''' was a mythical military expedition in 1150s to [[Southwest Finland]] by Swedish [[Monarchy of Sweden|King]] [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric IX]] and English Bishop [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Henry]] of [[Uppsala]].

Earliest written sources of the crusade are from the end of 13th Century. The main sources of the crusade, the legend of [[Eric IX of Sweden|Saint Erik]] and the legend of [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Saint Henry]], describes that the reason for the crusade were the multiple raids that pagan Finns made to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pyhän Henrikin Legenda|last=Heikkilä|first=Tuomas|publisher=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seuran toimituksia 1039|year=2006|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=138-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The crusade has traditionally been seen as the first attempt of [[Catholic Church]] and [[Sweden]] to convert pagan [[Finns]] to [[Christianity]]. However, the [[Christianisation]] of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to legends, after the crusade [[Bishop Henry]] was killed at lake [[Köyliönjärvi]] by [[Lalli]]. He later became a central figure of the Catholic Church in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=1109|title=Eric's crusade to Finland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051320/http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=1109|archivedate=2007-09-27}}. Original medieval legend in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity of the crusade ==
Academics debate whether this crusade actually took place. No archaeological data give any support for it and earliest written sources are from much later date. No surviving written source describes Swedish influence in Finland before the end of the 13th Century. Furthermore, the diocese and bishop of Finland are not listed among their Swedish counterparts before the 1250s. Also, the [[Christianisation]] of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muinaisuutemme jäljet|last=Georg Haggren, Petri Halinen, Mika Lavento, Sami Raninen ja Anna Wessman|first=|publisher=Gaudeamus|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish bishop normally involved in the eastern campaigns was the [[Bishop of Linköping]], not the Bishop of Uppsala.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The mid-12th century was a very violent time in the northern Baltic sea, with Finnish tribes such as [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelians]] as well as Swedes in frequent conflicts with [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and with each other.&lt;ref&gt;See articles [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]] and [[Prehistoric Finnish wars]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Novgorod Chronicle]] tells that in 1142 a Swedish "prince" and bishop accompanied by a fleet of 60 ships plundered just three Novgorodian merchant vessels somewhere "on the other side of the sea", obviously being after something more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=15|title=First Novgorod Chronicle entry on the attack in 1142|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051331/http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=15|archivedate=2007-09-27}}. In Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing of the crusade ==
Almost all years of the 1150`s have been suggested as the year that the crusade possibly took place. Most widely supported years have been years 1150, 1155, 1157 and 1158. Other candidates have been years 1153, 1154 and1156.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pyhän Henrikin legenda|last=Heikkilä|first=Tuomas|publisher=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seuran toimituksia 1039 (2.painos)|year=2006|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=55-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, leading the ''[[leiðangr]]'' was the responsibility of the [[Jarl in Sweden|jarl]]. This gave rise to a theory that Eric conducted the expedition before he became king or pretender to the throne.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Legends give no year for the expedition, and attempts to date it to an exact year in the 1150s are all much later speculations. All that is known about King Eric and Bishop Henry is that they most probably held important positions in Sweden some time in the mid-12th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Four Four Bravo''' was the [[call sign]] of a fifteen-man [[Sri Lankan Army]] patrol, deployed in the [[Jaffna Peninsula]] on July 23, 1983. The patrol was ambushed and thirteen of its members were killed by the [[LTTE]]. This incident sparked the [[Black July|Black July riots]] and is considered to be the start of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/080727/Plus/sundaytimesplus_08.html That massacre upon massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

By July 1983 tension was rising in the Jaffna Peninsula and throughout the country, the [[TULF]] had decided that their Members of Parliament resign their seats and on July 21, 1983 in Parliament, V.N. Navaratnam delivered an emotional farewell address. On the July 23 was a quiet day in Jaffna, even though there were political activity in Mannar. That day at the Army Camp at [[Gurunagar]] under the command of Brigadier J.G. Balthazar, the army was preparing an ambush for a LTTE leader ''Sellakili'', who had been engaged in terrorist activities. It was to be carried out by a group of [[Commandos]] with the call sign ''Four Four Charlie'', at Kondavil.

Patrol Four Four Bravo was scheduled to leave Gurunagar (code name ''Four Four'') at 2200 hours as a routine patrol from the C Company of the First Battalion of the [[Sri Lanka Light Infantry]] based at Madagal about 20 miles away. The patrol arrived at 2147 hours. It consisted of a detachment of 15 soldiers led by Second Lieutenant A.P.N.C. De S. Vaas Gunawardene. The instructions of the Brigadier were that the patrol should be back in Madagal before 2359 hours, if necessary shortening the prescribed route: Gurunagar - Jaffna - Naga Vihara - Nallur - Kopay - Urumpirai - Kondavil - Kokuvil - [[Jaffna]]- Kaliyan - kadu - Madagal. 2nd Lt. Gunawardene received the instructions from Major De Silva who further emphasized that the patrol must be in Madagal Camp by midnight. Four Four Bravo left Gurunagar at 2206 hours and was in radio contact every five minutes all reports indicated that Jaffna was quiet.

==Ambush==

During this time ''Sellakili'' was planning on getting revenge for the death of [[Charles Lucas Anthony]] aka Seelan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DC02Df02.html Chapter 29 - Prisoners massacred ]&lt;/ref&gt; and had observed the army patrols. That night a group of 25 LTTE men, including [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]], [[Kittu (Tamil militant)|Kittu]], Iyer, Victor, Pulendran, Shellakili, Santhosam and Appiah gathered at Tinneveli on the Palali - Jaffna road at a point where the road was dug up to install new telecommunication equipment. Near one such excavation four mines were placed and a plunger stolen from the Kankesanturai Cement Factory was placed on the balcony of a nearby house. A machine gun nests were placed near the exploder and across the road. The force was split in two and placed on both sides of the road with Sellakili present.

At 2328 hours the patrol reported that it was leaving Urumpirai junction and everything was quiet. The patrol was made up of a jeep with 2nd Lt. Vaas Gunawardene, Private N.A.S. Manutange driving and Corporal G.D. Perera and Private S.S. Amarasinghe, Private S.P.G. Rajatillake and Private K.P. Karunaratne in the rear and a Tata Benz half truck with the rest of the patrol with Sergent S.I. Thelakaratne in the front seat with Corporal G.R. Perera at the wheel and Private A.J.R. Fernando between them. Five minutes of leaving Urumpirai the Jeep was slowing down near Tinneveli because of the obstruction on the road due to the installation of telecommunication equipment. As it was passing the excavation on the road, the exploder set off the mines, followed by a hail of machine gun fire on the Jeep and the half-truck. The explosion of the mines wounded many of the men in the jeep including 2nd Lt. Vaas Gunawardene who leapt out of the Jeep and pulled out a hand grenade, but was mowed down by machine gun fire. The rest in the jeep scrambled out attacked the enemy with hand grenades before being killed. Cpl. G.D. Perera charged at the enemy firing his SLR, his body was found a short distance from the jeep.

On witnessing the explosion the half truck stopped and it too came under fire from both parties of the LTTE. The fire killed Cpl. Perera in the driver's seat, Private Robert, Sunil and Wijesiri in the rear and wounded Private Manapitiya. Sgt. Thelakaratne and Private Fernando who were both wounded scrambled out, took cover from the vehicle and opened fire, however Fernando was soon killed. Thilakaratne kept firing until home-made grenade blew off one hand and all but blew off one foot. Cpl. R. A. U. Perera and Cpl. Sumathipala kept on firing and the latter in addition lobbed his grenade. In his dying moments Private Manapitiya gave his grenade to the Cpl. Sumathipala who changed their magazines and kept on the pressure on the enemy. At one stage they alighted from the vehicle and kept on firing at the enemy in two different directions thus pinning them down. At 2340 hours a message was sent to Brigadier Balthazar that radio contact with the patrol was lost and that a sentry had heard gunfire and explosions in the distance. The Army camps in Palali, Madagal, Thondamanar and Velvettiturai were alerted and the ambush prepared for Four Four Charlie was canceled by the Brigadier. It was sent in search of Four Four Bravo.

Four Four Charlie located the destroyed vehicles at 0009 hours and reported in. Cpl. R. A. U. Perera also telephoned from the Kondavil CTB Depot about that time. He had fired till he ran out ammunition and thereafter had retreated, wounded in both legs. He gave the location of Cpl. Sumathipala, who had also fired till his ammunition was almost expended, and thereafter had retreated and was lying wounded. Brigadier Balthazar himself reached the location, and found Sgt. Thelakaratne in critical condition and sent him to the hospital. He died on the way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/08/24/fea06.html Actual story of the attack that sparked the riots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231830/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/08/24/fea06.html |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georgia Shakespeare Festival's production of Macbeth.jpg|thumb|220px|Joanna Mitchell and Jason Loughlin in Georgia Shakespeare's 2007 production of Macbeth]]
'''Georgia Shakespeare''' (formerly ''Georgia Shakespeare Festival'') was a professional, [[not-for-profit]] [[theatre]] company located in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the [[United States]] on the campus of [[Oglethorpe University]] from 1985-2014.  Georgia Shakespeare produced plays annually, primarily between June and November.  At its peak, it welcomed 60,000 patrons annually to its performances.

== History ==
Georgia Shakespeare was founded in 1985 by Lane Anderson, Richard Garner, and Robert Watson under the name ''Georgia Shakespeare Festival''.  The company produced two plays each year, with its first offering being productions  of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and ''[[King Lear (play)|King Lear]]'' in rotating repertory starting July 10, 1986.

The rising theatre company went through several locations in its first years.  Its first season was on the Oglethorpe University front athletic field in a rectangular, white 60' X 90' tent with a [[seating capacity]] of 300.  The theatre changed tents for its second season and was housed in a circular tent with a 90' diameter.  This new tent increased the [[seating capacity]] by 50.  For the theatre's fifth season, it moved into a 110' diameter circular tent that seated 400.

In 1991, Georgia Shakespeare expanded to three plays annually, and performed an adaptation of ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' as its first work not written by [[William Shakespeare]].  In later years, the company has performed between three and seven plays per season.

In 1997, Georgia Shakespeare opened its season in the $5.7 million John A. and Miriam H. Conant Performing Arts Center with ''[[The Tempest]]''.  The Conant Center has a 509-seat modified thrust stage and it was this move that allowed the addition of a fall performance to the season schedule.

In 2001, Georgia Shakespeare became a member of the League of Resident Theaters.  At the time, it was one of only two theatres in the state of Georgia to be a part of this league.

In 2011, mired in debt, the theatre launched a 'Save Georgia Shakespeare' campaign which was successful in raising over $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/09/23/georgia-shake-meets-money-goal-wont-shatter-glass |title= Georgia Shake meets money goal, won't shatter 'Glass' |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |work=Creative Loafing |first=Curt |last=Holman |date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the theatre company closed for good in the middle of its 29th season, unable to stay open due to its high debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsculture.blog.ajc.com/2014/10/08/stifled-by-debt-georgia-shakespeare-calls-it-curtains-after-29-years |title= Stifled by debt, Georgia Shakespeare calls it curtains after 29 years |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|first=Howard |last=Pousner |date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education programs ==
Twelve educational programs were developed in the history of Georgia Shakespeare.  These programs included "The High School Tour", a "High School Acting Competition", "Camp Shakespeare", a "High School Conservatory", a "No Fear Shakespeare" training program for educators, after school residencies, school tours, student matinees, classes for professionals, and in-school workshops.

== Picnicking ==
When Georgia Shakespeare was still performing under a tent, patrons of the theatre started bringing pre-show picnics.  This became a tradition and when the Conant Performing Arts Center was built, a covered area with tables and chairs was set aside for picnics. In 2014, the grounds underwent a renovation funded through several Atlanta-area Private Foundations.

==Leadership==
*Richard Garner, Producing Artistic Director, 1985-2014
*Jennifer Bauer-Lyons, Managing Director, 2013-2014

==Associate artists==
Georgia Shakespeare had a core group of artists who, in 2014, had been with them between six and twenty-nine years and help define the theatre's identity.  At the time of closing, &lt;ref&gt;http://gashakespeare.org/associate_artists&lt;/ref&gt; those artists were:

The '''Gnaoua World Music Festival''' is a [[Gnawa music]] festival held annually in [[Essaouira]], [[Morocco]]. 

The festival provides a platform for a meeting point of music and dialogue between foreign artists and the mystical [[Gnaoua]] (also [[Gnawa]]) musicians. In this melting-pot of musical fusion, the [[Gnaoua]] masters  invite players of [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]] and contemporary [[World music]] to explore new avenues. The festivals see up to 500,000 visitors every year over four days; many of the performances can be viewed for free, which complicates comparison with other festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/42150834/page/21 "The Worlds's Biggest Music Festivals"] [sic], CNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==

The city of Essaouira is located on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, 350 km from Casablanca, 175 km from Marrakech and 190 km from Agadir.


During the weekend of Gnaoua Festival, transportation to Essaouira becomes very rare and expensive, so it is recommended to book your transport as soon as possible if you plan to participate in the event

Below the means of transport available:

By Bus / Coach:
Essaouira is served by several bus companies from several Moroccan cities, to book your ticket you can go to the bus station
Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to book your coach bus online on the website '' 'marKoub.ma' '' , to avoid any unpleasant experience when buying the ticket:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2191">The '''Great Depression''' which followed the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|US stock market crash of 1929]] badly affected the countries of '''[[Latin America]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo Drinot and Alan Knight. ''The Great Depression in Latin America'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Chile]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] were, according to a [[League of Nations]] report, the countries worst-hit by the Great Depression. The rise of fascism also became apparent in Latin American countries in the 1930s due to the Great Depression. Fascist governments were the result of a desire for nationalism, which rulers like  [[Getúlio Vargas]] of Brazil  played on through propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Thorp, ''Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]], for its part, came out of the Great Depression as an independent country after the US pulled out their troops in 1936.

In Brazil and in other Latin American countries such as Mexico, responses to the Great Depression also led to a strengthening of the industrialization process (begun in the nineteenth century). Brazil needed an economic alternative to the highly devalued [[coffee]], its main commodity at the time. The [[Getúlio Vargas|Vargas]] government started to purchase and burn coffee from the farmers, in order to avoid their complete bankruptcy.

'''''Heroes in Crisis''''' is an ongoing [[American comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by [[DC Comics]]. It is being written by [[Tom King (comics)|Tom King]] and illustrated by [[Clay Mann]]. ''Heroes in Crisis'' follows the "[[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis]]" naming convention of prior DC [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]], but is billed as a [[murder-mystery]]. The first issue debuted on September 26, 2018.

==Publication history==
''Heroes in Crisis'' is a nine-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] being written by [[Tom King (comics)|Tom King]], who has worked on [[DC Vertigo]] titles, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', and ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and illustrated by [[Clay Mann]].&lt;ref name="CBRSanctuary"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Tim |title=DC’s Sanctuary Arrives in Heroes in Crisis Series from King &amp; Mann |url=https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-heroes-in-crisis-king-mann/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be published by [[DC Comics]]; cover art will be provided by Mann, [[J.

Instead, it expands on a concept King introduced in ''Batman'', the rehabilitation center the Sanctuary, which is based on veterans' crisis centers.&lt;ref name="PolyNext"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Polo |first1=Susana |title=DC Comics’ next Crisis is a heavier drama than any before |url=https://www.polygon.com/comics/2018/6/13/17454818/dc-comics-heroes-in-crisis-tom-king-sanctuary |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to King, the idea for ''Heroes in Crisis'' was conceived in 2016 after he suffered from a [[panic attack]] and went to the hospital, and his grandmother (who raised him) died on the same day. King had to go through therapy, after which he decided to use what he learned in a DC comic. The homestead of the Sanctuary on the cover of ''Heroes in Crisis'' #1 is modeled after his grandmother's house as a tribute to her.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt;

''Heroes in Crisis'' primarily deals with the emotional cost of being a superhero&lt;ref name="THRExplore"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Graeme |title=DC's 'Heroes in Crisis' to Explore Superhero Trauma |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/heroes-crisis-comic-focuses-dc-superhero-trauma-1119410 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will explore "what violence does to a society", a common theme in King's work.&lt;ref name="PolyNext"/&gt; King, a former [[CIA]] counterterrorism officer, believed this was an important subject that needed to be discussed.&lt;ref name="PolyNext"/&gt; "Comic books, throughout the whole history of the medium, have been reflective of history. In [[World War II]], there were comics about fighting in World War II. In the seventies, the comics were about psychedelic escape. Unfortunately, our moment right now is a moment of violence and living with violence and our comics have to address that," he said.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yehl |first1=Joshua |title=DC's Heroes in Crisis Is Caused By a Superhero Shooting - Comic-Con 2018 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/20/dcs-heroes-in-crisis-is-caused-by-a-superhero-shooting-comic-con-2018 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 20, 2018 |date=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Isle of Man Courier''' is a free weekly [[newspaper]] on the [[Isle of Man]].
It is owned by [[Isle of Man Newspapers]] (now part of [[Tindle Newspapers]]) and its sister newspapers are the ''Isle of Man Examiner'' and the ''Manx Independent''.

==History==
The ''Isle of Man Courier'' can trace its roots back to the ''Ramsey Courier'', which began in 1884. The paper dropped the "Ramsey" part of its title and moved to Ridgeway Street, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], in the 1970s. Its sister newspaper, ''Mona's Herald'', closed in the same decade. The Isle of Man Courier was taken over by another Courier, the ''Halifax Courier'', and was printed in [[Yorkshire]] for some time.

The ''Isle of Man Courier'' became a free, delivered newspaper in 1981. The company made the decision after complaining that the [[Isle of Man Government]] was starving it of [[advertising]] by favouring the ''Isle of Man Examiner'' and its sister papers, the ''Isle of Man Weekly Times'' and the ''Manx Star''. After a strike killed off the ''Examiner'', ''Isle of Man Times'', ''Manx Star'' and ''Isle of Man Gazette'' in 1987, the Courier Group bought the titles and the ''Examiner'''s premises in Hill Street, Douglas.

This meant the ''Courier'' could print on the island again. The Courier Group relaunched the ''Isle of Man Examiner'' in competition with the ''Manx Independent'', which was started by [[journalist]]s who had been sacked during the ''Examiner'' group strike.

The Isle of Man Courier Group was renamed [[Isle of Man Newspapers]] a few years after it absorbed the ''Examiner''. The ''Manx Independent'' folded in 1993 and was bought by Isle of Man Newspapers and relaunched as a weekly newspaper.

{{nihongo|3='''''Karōshi'''''|2=過労死}}, which can be translated literally as "overwork death" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is occupational sudden mortality. The major medical causes of ''karōshi'' deaths are [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] due to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and a [[starvation diet]]. This phenomenon is also widespread in other parts of Asia as well.

==History==
The first case of ''karōshi'' was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the [[Freight transport|shipping]] department of [[Japan]]'s largest newspaper company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.workhealth.org/whatsnew/lpkarosh.html |title=Karoshi-Death from overwork: Occupational health consequences of the Japanese production management|date=February 4, 1997|journal=International Journal of Health Services|authors=Katsuo Nishiyama and Jeffrey V. Johnson|accessdate=June 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214232217/http://workhealth.org/whatsnew/lpkarosh.html |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was invented in 1978 to refer to an increasing number of people suffering from fatal strokes and heart attacks attributed to overwork. A book on the issue in 1982 brought the term into public usage.

It was not until the mid to late 1980s, during the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Bubble Economy]], when several high-ranking business [[corporate officer|executives]] who were still in their prime years suddenly died without any previous sign of illness, that the term emerged into Japanese public life. This new phenomenon was immediately seen as a new and serious menace for people in the work force. In 1987, as public concern increased, the [[Japanese Ministry of Labour]] began to publish statistics on ''karōshi''.

In 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week, which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour weekly working schedule.

Japan's rise from the devastation of [[World War II]] to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new [[epidemic]]. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6–7 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally. It is common for the [[overtime]] to go unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-11suits.13624023.html Japanese salarymen fight back] ''The New York Times'' - Wednesday, June 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2009/gb2009015_807968.htm Recession Puts More Pressure on Japan's Workers] Business Week, January 5, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107010556/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2009/gb2009015_807968.htm |date=January 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[International Labour Organization]] article about ''karōshi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/publications/WCMS_211571/lang--en/index.htm|title=Case Study: Karoshi: Death from overwork|date=23 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following four typical cases of ''karōshi'' were mentioned:
# Mr. A worked at a major snack food processing company for as long as 110 hours a week (not a month) and died from a heart attack at the age of 34. His death was recognized as work-related by the Labour Standards Office.
# Mr. B, a [[bus driver]], whose death was also recognized as work-related, worked 3,000 hours a year. He did not have a day off in the 15 years before he had a stroke at the age of 37.
# Mr. C worked in a large printing company in [[Tokyo]] for 4,320 hours a year including [[Shift work|night work]] and died from a stroke at the age of 58. His widow received workers' compensation 14 years after her husband's death.
# Ms. D, a 22-year-old nurse, died from a heart attack after 34 hours of continuous duty five times a month.
As well as physical pressure, [[Stress (biology)|mental stress]] from the workplace can cause ''karōshi''. People who commit [[suicide]] due to mental stress are called "''karōjisatsu'' (過労自殺)." The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:
# All-night, late-night or holiday work, both long and excessive hours. During the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|long-term economic recession]] after the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1980s and 1990s, many companies reduced the number of employees. The total amount of work, however, did not decrease, forcing each employee to work harder.
# Stress accumulated due to frustration at not being able to achieve the goals set by the company. Even in economic recession, companies tended to demand excessive sales efforts from their employees and require them to achieve better results. This increased the psychological burden placed on the employees at work.
# [[Dismissal (employment)|Forced resignation, dismissal]], and [[bullying]]. For example, employees who worked for a company for many years and saw themselves as loyal to the company were suddenly asked to resign because of the need for staff cutbacks.
# Suffering of [[middle management]]. They were often in a position to [[Layoff|lay off]] workers and torn between implementing a corporate restructuring policy and protecting their staff.

==Karoshi Hotline==
In a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either passed away because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Kato, Tetsuro. “The Political Economy of Japanese 'Karoshi' (Death from Overwork).” Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies, vol. 26, no. 2 (December 1994), pp. 41-54. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294355?seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overworking or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly by seeking help.

The Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year decreased, but still maintained an average of 400 calls per year.&lt;ref&gt;Karoshi Hotline: National Defense Counsel for Victims of KAROSHI.

==Effects on society==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}

Suicide can be induced by overwork-related stresses or when businessmen are laid off from their jobs.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adelstein|first1=Jake|title=Killing Yourself To Make A Living: In Japan Financial Incentives Reward "Suicide"|url=http://www.japansubculture.com/killing-yourself-to-make-a-living-in-japan-financial-social-incentives-keep-suicide-rates-high/|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deceased person's relatives demand [[Damages|compensation]] payments when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"/&gt; They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order to receive the money.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"/&gt;

There is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of ''karōshi''. Young Japanese are choosing part-time work, contrary to their elder counterparts who work overtime. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for "hourly wages rather than regular salaries,"&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are called "[[freeter]]s." The number of freeters has increased throughout the years,&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Freeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as "part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed as part-time workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanai|title=Karoshi (Work to Death) in Japan|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeters are not in school, are aged 15–34, and if they are women, are unmarried. The movement of the freeters has its problems, however. Most freeters fail to launch successful careers, based on a few factors.

Due to their part-time work, their annual income is around 1 million [[Japanese yen|yen]], or around $8,500 USD. Also, economic growth in Japan is slow, making it difficult for freeters to switch to regular employment. Another problem is that freeters are given menial tasks, which makes it almost impossible to gain any real experience, which is necessary when converting to full-time employment. (Kanai, 2003) It may seem as if being a freeter is the answer to the overworked, near-''karōshi'' individual suffering from long work hours. Those who are being non-regular employees or freeters who are supposedly wanting to only work part-time are finding themselves working 60 hours a week or more. Since non-regular employees' wages are so low, it is necessary for them to work longer hours, negating the desire to be a freeter. Freeters are now facing the risk of ''karōshi'', just as regular workers have, due to their long hours.

There are other undesirable results, other than ''karōshi'', that arise from working long hours. A psychological trait known as [[Workaholic|workaholism]] has been shown to lead one to work long hours. (Spence &amp; Robbins, 1992) There are three defining factors of workaholism: high work involvement, being driven to or compelled to work by inner pressures, and low enjoyment of work. (Kanai, 1996). The last of these factors suggests a contradiction. However, Kanai argued that workaholism is not a psychological trait, but rather results from adaptation to that work demand overload. Individuals that overload on work are not doing so because they are workaholics, but that the demand of the workload brings out psychologically and behavioral characteristics similar to those with workaholism. Management welcomes hard work and rewards with promotions. Morioka (2005), suggests that in order to eliminate the harmful effects of workaholism, the workplace should be responsible for managing workload issues.

Overworking also has a negative effect on the family. Men who become too busy with their jobs think less about their family. High levels of family [[Depression (mood)|depression]] exist as a result. As the men focus on their jobs, they tend to develop negative feelings towards family. They take on less of a role in family life as they continue to overwork. The men see the family as something that is taking away from their work, which creates a resentment toward the family. As a result, avoidance of family time increases, even though it is their family that inspires them to work hard in the first place (Kanai, 2002). Kanai's findings suggest that excessive working hours are harmful to family life, not only in that are they spending less time with their families, but that they also develop hostility towards the family.

However, it could also be said that the men had taken on these jobs for the sake of providing for their family, but ultimately become less effective as a resource due to their exhaustion and complete focus on earning money. It is likely salarymen go into that lifestyle simply for the money, because the jobs pay well; if they work long hours, they can earn large sums of money and send it to their families to help provide for them, since in traditional Japanese families, the father is usually the main worker in the household. In an interview, a man had said that "the best thing about being born male was, 'having a family, and being able to support that family.' Conversely the worst thing was 'being unable to quit your job even if you want to' due to the same responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility men have to provide for the family correlates with their masculinity, so if a man gets laid off he may think that "their own ability is really poor, and would get quite depressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressures are ones that society puts on them, since it is expected that the men work and provide for the family.

The Cabinet Office analyzes the Household Survey on the Quality of Life to examine how large of an impact overwork has on health issues, including karoshi. The study finds that a long weekly working schedule, which is defined as over 60 hours for men and over 45 hours for women, significantly increased the anxiety of employees who believe they will be suffering from health issues. In other words, regardless of whether employees had health issues, merely working for longer hours created anxiety towards perceived health issues. The 15-hour gap between men and women does not mean that women are less capable of dealing with stress, but is because of the traditional Japanese value that puts the burden of taking care of children and other mundane household tasks on women. Women thus have much larger range of responsibilities to be concerned with, in addition to their everyday jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamesaka, Akiko and Tamura, Teruyuki. “Work Hours and Anxiety Towards Karoshi”.

The [[Crisis hotline|suicide prevention hotline]] in Japan is often so busy, callers occasionally have to try between 30 and 40 times until they can get an answer.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAVING 10,000 - Winning a War on Suicide in Japan - 自殺者１万人を救う戦い - Japanese Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0SHLxc2d0|website=Youtube|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, roughly 30,000 people in Japan commit suicide.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; A potential reason why the number is so high could be the kind of camaraderie involved in the process of committing suicide, where people will spend time searching online to find other suicidal individuals and then "[[Suicide pact|make plans to die together]]."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==Government Policies==
To provide a strategic plan on how to decreases the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other disease caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from three different groups, the government, the labour unions and employers, and the employees. The government, as the policy maker, should promote shorter working hours, make health services readily accessible, encourage voluntary health examination and enhance the effectiveness of medical care. As the group that is more closely involved with the everyday health of employees, labour unions and employers should strive to implement and comply with government policies that focus on reducing work overtime and create a better work environment. The employees themselves should recognize their needs to take rests promptly and take preventative measures as needed.&lt;ref&gt;Araki, Shunichi, and Iwasaki, Kenji. “Death Due to Overwork (Karoshi): Causation, health service, and life expectancy of Japanese males.” Japan Medical Association Journal, vol. 48, no. 2, February, 2005, pg. 92-98. http://www.med.or.jp/english/pdf/ 2005_02/092_098.pdf. Accessed: 19 Jan, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher possibility of having work related illness.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Safety and Health Act (Act No. 57 of 1972) http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ hourei/data/isha.pdf. Accessed: 22 Jan, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It might seem to be an odd decision, speaking from an economic standpoint, to use government policy to force companies to reduce work hours. It seems to be counterproductive of the profit maximizing nature of market economy. This counterintuitive intervention, according to Yoshio Higuchi, is attributed to the several factors unique to the Japanese society. Traditionally, Japanese workers are very loyal employees.&lt;ref name="esri.go.jp"&gt;Kamesaka, Akiko and Tamura, Teruyuki. “Work Hours and Anxiety Towards Karoshi”. Economic and Social Research Institute Discussion Papers, No. 325, March, 2017. http://www.esri.go.jp/jp/archive/e_dis/e_dis325/e_dis325-e.pdf. Accessed: 9 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common for someone to work for the same company from a freshly out of school graduate to a nearly retired man. The society also views those who constantly change jobs with skeptical eyes. Such discouragement directly caused the difficulty in moving into new jobs. Thus, companies usually have a much higher bargaining power when it comes to “exploiting” their employees. In order to cut costs, companies would usually demand their employees work for longer hours instead of hiring someone to take over part of the workload. Therefore, if the government does not intervene and mandate companies to reduce working time, no orders would be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="esri.go.jp"/&gt;

The current Labor Standards Act is not effective if the majority of the representative employees agree with working over 40 hours per week, despite clauses in the Act prohibits such overtime. A study by the Cabinet Office of the Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan (the Cabinet Office) pointed out that refusing to consent with the ILO's treaty on work time regulations could be a large contributing factor to the current state of the labor market.

==Salaryman==
{{Main|Salaryman}}

A Japanese businessman, also known as a [[salaryman]] (サラリーマン, "''sararīman''"), is often a victim of ''karōshi'' due to the strenuous work hours their job requires, in addition to the mandatory after-hours socializing and drinking that their jobs require.&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakamoto|first1=Kay|title=Why Drinking With Coworkers Is So Important In Japanese Work Culture|url=https://blog.gaijinpot.com/japanese-drinking-culture/|website=Gaijinpot|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these salarymen are invited to [[nomikai]], or "drinking parties," to build better connections between coworkers in the company.&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"/&gt; According to an article on Gaijinpot, "A common saying in Japan is, 'if you want to work your way up the corporate ladder you have to drink.' This was how many older generation workers established relationships and considered this the normal way of doing business."&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"/&gt;

According to these values, a key to business success was a willingness to go out and participate in this mandatory socializing with coworkers. Since not everyone can keep up with the pace and immersion of salaryman life, stress-induced death became fairly common. Due to this high-stress nature of a salaryman's job, death by cardivascular diseases or mental disorders were some of the two biggest factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanai|first1=Atsuko|title="Karoshi (Work to Death)" in Japan|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=18 March 2008|volume=84|pages=209–216|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9701-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Japanese businessmen are under a lot of work-related pressures, ''karōshi'' suicides have increased, especially due to economic crises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondo|first1=Naoki|last2=Oh|first2=Juhwan|title=Suicide and karoshi (death from overwork) during the recent economic crises in Japan: the impacts, mechanisms and political responses|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|date=August 2010|volume=64|issue=8|pages=649|doi=10.1136/jech.2009.090787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those that were able to keep their jobs, after their company laid off multiple employees, experienced a large increase in work. "In 2000, 28% of regular Japanese employees worked 50 hours or more per week, compared to 16% to 21% in [[New Zealand]], [[United States|USA]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and less than 6% in 13 other industrialized nations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Businessmen in Japan have been overworked, but [[physician]]s specifically have been feeling great pressures of being overworked, while still facing a moral obligation to continue. Physicians work an average of 65 hours a week or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiyama|first1=T|last2=Yoshihara|first2=M|title=New occupational threats to Japanese physicians: karoshi (death due to overwork) and karojisatsu (suicide due to overwork)|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2008|volume=65|issue=6|page=428|doi=10.1136/oem.2007.037473}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They are reaching the limit in terms of the number of service hours they can provide without risking their own health.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiyama|first1=T|last2=Yoshihara|first2=M|title=New occupational threats to Japanese physicians: karoshi (death due to overwork) and karojisatsu (suicide due to overwork)|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2008|volume=65|issue=6|page=429|doi=10.1136/oem.2007.037473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government used to have restrictions on the number of physicians that could attend medical school, but now they have increased medical school enrollment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It takes years for physicians to become qualified, so it is critical that alternative measures come into play before ''karōshi'' takes a toll on physicians in Japan.

==Corporate response==
A number of companies have been making an effort to find a better work-life balance for their employees. [[Toyota Motor Company|Toyota]], for example, now generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. [[Nissan]] offers [[telecommuting]] for office workers to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; Dozens of large corporations have also implemented "no overtime days", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. However, since their workload is too high, few workers can actually take advantage of this, and opt to stay in the office with the lights off or to simply take their work home, "cloaked overtime" called "''[[furoshiki]]''" (風呂敷) after the Japanese traditional wrapping cloth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 2007, [[Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation|Mitsubishi UFJ Trust &amp; Banking]], a division of Japan's largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company's 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;

In February 2017, [[Japanese government|Japanese Government]] launched a campaign called "[[Premium Friday]]" asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm [[Dentsu]] who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as [[Honda]], the drinks maker [[Suntory]] and the confectioner [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga]], have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the [[Nikkei Business Publications|Nikkei business]] newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of [[Premium Friday]] or had plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/premium-fridays-japan-gives-workers-break-go-shopping|title=Premium Fridays: Japan gives its workers a break – to go shopping|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-02-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with unpaid overtime in companies is that the overtime is simply not recorded in many cases. The amount of overtime is regulated by labor regulations, so, in order to not contradict labor regulations, workers are told not to record the overtime, since it would be considered an illegal action from the side of the company. The workers themselves often rationalize this by attributing the overwork to lacking skills from their side, describing a lack of familiarity with the work, "not being trained enough" as the cause for not being able to finish in a more timely manner. In general, overtime is something that is accepted as part of work, and protest against it is rare, due to concern for the reaction of colleagues, superiors and even family and friends.

"''Seken''" (世間), or the "public gaze" (others' opinions about one's behavior) is a strong cultural factor in this. It is safe to assume that most statistics of overtime in Japanese companies are not accurate, since overtime is not recorded in many occasions. It is not uncommon for many Japanese employees to work late hours until 2-3am, and being expected to be in the office again at 9am. In some cases (especially in subsidiaries of big listed companies that have to cope with the pressure of parent companies, who generate margins through exploitation of daughter companies) employees have been reported to have worked 300 hours of overtime in a single month. These statistics are in almost all cases not official, and most employees would always refrain from making such statements to authorities or the press, nor would they agree to be named.

==China==
In China, the analogous "death by overwork" concept is '''''guolaosi''''' (Traditional:過勞死 Simplified:过劳死), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Work Killing You? In China, Workers Die at Their Desks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-29/is-work-killing-you-in-china-workers-die-at-their-desks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building [[guanxi]]. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote “Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich,” about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the 'biggest boss in [[Chengdu]],' was in the hospital for 'excessive drinking.' This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, “I can't stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally 'depend on me to eat.'). I've got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
In South Korea, the term '''''gwarosa''''' (과로사) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 68.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vagabondjourney.com/south-korean-work-hours-highest-in-oecd/&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from gwarosa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2017/02/641_224791.html&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce many problems caused from overworking, the government enacted a law cutting the working hours from 68 to 52.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/south-korea-cuts-inhumanely-long-68-hour-working-week&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention==
The French-German [[Television channel|TV channel]] [[Arte]] showed a documentary called "Alt in Japan" (Old in Japan) on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, ''karōshi'' again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-07-10/business/17170864_1_toyota-city-heart-disease-camry|title=Man, 45, died of overwork, Japanese labor bureau says|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">The '''Linux Beer Hike''' (a.k.a. "LBW")  is a week-long event which takes place in a different European country each summer, drawing together [[Open Source]] software enthusiasts from more than a dozen different countries, for a combination of talks, presentations, hands-on mini-projects, outdoor exercise, and good food and drink.

The name Linux Bier Wanderung comes from the fact that the first event was held in [[Pottenstein, Bavaria|Pottenstein]] in [[Germany]] (in 1999) in the form of a traditional German "Bier Wanderung" for [[Linux]] enthusiasts. Since then the event has been held at the following locations:
* 2000: [[Coniston, Cumbria]], [[England]]
* 2001: [[Bouillon]], [[Belgium]]
* 2002: [[Doolin]], [[Ireland]]
* 2003: [[Tajov]], [[Slovakia]]
* 2004: [[Schin op Geul]], Netherlands

* 2006: [[Palūšė]], [[Lithuania]]
* 2007: [[Hersonissos]], in [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion Prefecture]], [[Crete]], Greece. LBW was organised by [[Hellenic Linux User Group]], and was held on 2–9 September 2007.

The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[red kangaroo]].

In practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of [[Quaternary glaciation|the last ice age]], such as [[mammoth]]s, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and [[Australian megafauna|Australia]] became extinct within the last forty thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/ice_age_animals.html# Ice Age Animals]. Illinois State Museum&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly used for the largest [[extant taxon|extant]] wild land animals, especially [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, and large [[bovines]]. (Of these five categories of large herbivorous mammals, only [[bovine]]s are presently found outside of [[Africa]] and southern [[Asia]], but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging.) Megafauna may be subcategorized by their [[Trophic species|trophic]] position into megaherbivores (e.g., [[elephants]]), megacarnivores (e.g., [[lion]]s), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., [[bear]]s).

Other common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially [[whales]], any larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger [[antelope]] and [[cattle]], as well as numerous [[dinosaur]]s and other extinct giant reptilians.

The term is also sometimes applied to animals (usually [[extinction|extinct]]) of great size ''relative to'' a more common or surviving type of the animal, for example [[Meganisoptera|the {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} dragonflies]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period.

==Ecological strategy==
Megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally [[R/K selection theory|K-strategist]]s, with high longevity, slow population growth rates, low mortality rates, and (at least for the largest) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/K-selected-species. ''Britannica.'' Retrieved 2017-4-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics, although not exclusive to such megafauna, make them vulnerable to human [[overexploitation]], in part because of their slow population recovery rates.&lt;ref name="Barnosky2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Barnosky|first1=A. D.|title=Assessing the Causes of Late Pleistocene Extinctions on the Continents|journal= Science|volume= 306|issue=5693|date= 2004-10-01|pages= 70–75|doi= 10.1126/science.1101476|pmid=15459379|bibcode=2004Sci...306...70B|citeseerx=10.1.1.574.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brook2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Brook|first1=B.

==Evolution of large body size==
One observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of [[insular dwarfism]]. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

===In terrestrial mammals===
[[File:Patagotitan vs Mammals Scale Diagram SVG Steveoc86.svg|thumb|Large terrestrial mammals compared in size to one of the largest sauropod dinosaurs, ''[[Patagotitan]]'']]
Subsequent to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about {{period start|Paleogene}} [[Megaannum|Ma]] (million years) ago, terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant.&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith|first1=F.

Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; vs. time (in Ma) occurred in [[perissodactyl]]s (a slope of 2.1), followed by [[rodent]]s (1.2) and proboscids (1.1),&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; all of which are hindgut fermenters.

Terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several [[eutheria]]n groups (the [[artiodactyl]] ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' - formerly considered a [[mesonychid]], the [[creodont]]s ''[[Megistotherium]]'' and ''[[Sarkastodon]]'', and the carnivorans ''[[Amphicyon]]'' and ''[[Arctodus]]'') all reached a maximum size of about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"/&gt; (the carnivoran ''[[Arctotherium]]'' apparently actually got somewhat larger).

Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the [[Oligocene]]) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern [[blue whale]]. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming movements]] as opposed to [[terrestrial locomotion]]. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] advantage of large body size in marine [[endotherm]]s, although diminishing returns apply.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

Cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach unprecedented size in the modern era. The largest [[carnivora]]n of all time is the mostly aquatic modern [[southern elephant seal]].

This is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous [[gastornithid]] birds evolved in the Northern Hemisphere, while flightless [[paleognath]]s evolved to large size on [[Gondwana]]n land masses and [[Europe]]. Gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in Europe, both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45&amp;nbsp;kg (in contrast with other landmasses like [[North America]] and [[Asia]], which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals) and were the largest European tetrapods in the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Buffetaut2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buffetaut|first1=E.|last2=Angst|first2=D.|title=Stratigraphic distribution of large flightless birds in the Palaeogene of Europe and its palaeobiological and palaeogeographical implications|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=138|date=November 2014|pages=394–408|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early [[Cenozoic]]. Later in the Cenozoic, however, they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out. In North America, the [[bathornithids]] ''[[Paracrax]]'' and ''[[Bathornis]]'' were apex predators but became extinct by the [[Early Miocene]]. In South America, the related [[phorusrhacid]]s shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian [[Sparassodonta|sparassodont]]s during most of the Cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]) during the [[Pliocene]]. In contrast, large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present.

However, none of the largest predatory (''[[Brontornis]]''), possibly omnivorous (''[[Dromornis]]''&lt;ref name = "Murray 2004"&gt;{{cite book

An analysis of the timing of [[Holarctic]] megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within [[interstadial]]s, periods of abrupt warming, but only when humans were also present.

An analysis of ''[[Sporormiella]]'' fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from [[Lynch's Crater]] in [[Queensland]], Australia, showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when [[climate change]]s were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name="Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional [[Holocene extinction#Ongoing Holocene extinction|megafaunal extinctions in the recent past]], and has created a [[IUCN Red List critically endangered species|serious danger of further extinctions]] in the near future (see examples below).

A number of other [[Extinction event|mass extinction]]s occurred earlier in Earth's geologic history, in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out. Famously, in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated. However, the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna; i.e., many species of other types, including plants, marine invertebrates&lt;ref name="Alroy"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Consequences of depletion of megafauna===

====Effect on nutrient transport====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name="Wolf2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C.

====Effect on methane emissions====
Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal

Recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in [[atmospheric methane]]. This hypothesis is relatively new.&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;{{Cite journal

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

==Examples==
The following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna (in the sense of the "large animal" definition). This list is not intended to be exhaustive:

*Clade [[Synapsida]]
**Class [[Mammalia]] ([[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetically]], a [[clade]] within Therapsida; see below)
***Infraclass [[Metatheria]]
****Order [[Diprotodontia]]
*****The [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') is the largest living [[Australia]]n mammal and [[marsupial]] at a weight of up to {{convert|85|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, its extinct relative, the [[Procoptodon|giant short-faced kangaroo]] ''Procoptodon goliah'' reached {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}}, while extinct [[diprotodon]]ts attained the largest size of any marsupial in history, up to an estimated {{convert|2750|kg|abbr=on}}. The extinct [[marsupial lion]] (''Thylacleo carnifex''), at up to {{convert|160|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was much larger than any extant carnivorous marsupial.
***Infraclass [[Eutheria]]
****Superorder [[Afrotheria]]
*****Order [[Proboscidea]]
******[[Elephants]] are the largest living land animals. They and their relatives arose in [[Africa]], but until recently had a nearly worldwide distribution. The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') has a shoulder height of up to {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|10.4|tonnes|ST}}.&lt;ref name=probos_mass&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larramendi | first1 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–574 |jstor =  | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | url = https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app001362014.pdf | accessdate = 2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among recently extinct proboscideans, [[mammoth]]s (''Mammuthus'') were close relatives of elephants, while [[mastodon]]s (''Mammut'') were much more distantly related. The [[steppe mammoth]] (''M. trogontherii'') is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes, making it possibly the largest [[Proboscidea|proboscid]], which would make it the second largest land mammal after [[Indricotheriinae|indricotherines]].
*****Order [[Sirenia]]
******The largest sirenian at up to {{convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is the [[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus''). [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') was probably around five times as massive, but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote [[Commander Islands]] in 1741. In prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern [[Asia]] and northwestern [[North America]]; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters.
****Superorder [[Xenarthra]]
*****Order [[Cingulata]]
******The [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodonts]] were a group of large, heavily armored [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaur]]-like [[xenarthra]]ns related to living [[armadillos]]. They originated in [[South America]], invaded North America during the [[Great American Interchange]], and went extinct at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|epoch]].&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fariña, Richard A.|author2=Vizcaíno, Sergio F.|author3=De Iuliis, Gerry |title=Megafauna: Giant Beasts of Pleistocene South America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUAKgNfiAvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00719-3|oclc= 779244424}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*****Order [[Pilosa]]
******[[Ground sloth]]s were another group of slow, terrestrial xenarthrans, related to modern [[sloth|tree sloth]]s. They had a similar history, although they reached North America earlier, and spread farther north (e.g., ''[[Megalonyx]]''). The largest genera, ''[[Megatherium]]'' and ''[[Eremotherium]]'', reached sizes comparable to elephants.&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013" /&gt;
****Superorder [[Euarchontoglires]]
*****Order [[Primates]]
******The largest living primate, at up to {{convert|266|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is the [[gorilla]] (''[[Gorilla beringei]]'' and ''[[Gorilla gorilla]]'', with three of four subspecies being [[critically endangered]]). The extinct Malagasy [[sloth lemur]] ''[[Archaeoindris]]'' reached a similar size, while the extinct ''[[Gigantopithecus#Gigantopithecus blacki|Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' of [[Southeast Asia]] is believed to have been at least two times larger.

***Order [[Struthioniformes]]
****The [[ratite]]s are an ancient and diverse group of [[flightless bird]]s that are found on fragments of the former [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. The largest living bird, the [[ostrich]] (''Struthio camelus'') was surpassed by the extinct ''[[Vorombe]]'' of [[Madagascar]], the heaviest of the group at up to ({{convert|860|kg|lb|abbr=on}}), and the extinct [[Dinornis|giant moa]] (''Dinornis'') of [[New Zealand]], the tallest, growing to heights of {{convert|3.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

***Order [[Gastornithiformes]]
****Extinct [[Dromornithidae|dromornithid]]s of Australia such as ''[[Dromornis]]'' approached the largest ratites in size. (Due to its small size for a continent and its isolation, Australia is sometimes viewed as the [[Australia#Geography and climate|world's largest island]]; thus, these species could also be considered insular giants.)
***Order [[Cathartiformes]]
****The extinct [[condor]]-like [[teratorn]] ''[[Argentavis]]'' of South America had an estimated wing span of {{convert|5|to|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a mass of approximately {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it the best example of a megafaunal flying bird.
**Class [[Reptilia]] (traditional; [[paraphyletic]])
***Order [[Saurischia]]
****Saurischian [[dinosaur]]s of the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] include [[Sauropoda|sauropod]]s, the longest (at up to {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and most massive terrestrial animals known (''[[Argentinosaurus]]'' reached 80–100&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]nes, or 90–110&amp;nbsp;[[short ton|ton]]s), as well as [[Theropoda|theropod]]s, the largest terrestrial carnivores (''[[Spinosaurus]]'' grew to 7–9 tonnes; the more famous ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', to 6.8 tonnes).
***Order [[Pterosauria]]
****The largest [[azhdarchid]] [[pterosaur]]s, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'' and ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'', attained wingspans around {{cvt|11-12|m}} and weights probably in the {{cvt|70-250|kg}} range. The former is thought to have been the apex predator of its [[Hațeg Island|island ecosystem]].
***Order [[Crocodilia]]
****[[Alligators]] and [[crocodiles]] are large semiaquatic reptiles, the largest of which, the [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), can grow to a weight of {{convert|1360|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. Crocodilians' distant ancestors and their kin, the [[Pseudosuchia#Evolution|pseudosuchians]] (traditional [[crurotarsan]]s), dominated the world in the late [[Triassic]], until the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] allowed dinosaurs to overtake them. They remained diverse during the later [[Mesozoic]], when [[Crocodyliformes|crocodyliforms]] such as ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' and ''[[Sarcosuchus]]'' reached lengths of 12 m. Similarly large crocodilians, such as ''[[Mourasuchus]]'' and ''[[Purussaurus]]'', were present as recently as the [[Miocene]] in South America.
***Order [[Squamata]]
****While the largest extant [[lizard]], the [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''), another island giant, can reach {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length, its extinct Australian relative ''[[Megalania]]'' may have reached more than twice that size. These [[monitor lizard]]s' marine relatives, the [[mosasaur]]s, were [[apex predator]]s in late Cretaceous seas.
****The heaviest extant [[snake]] is considered to be the [[Eunectes murinus|green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), while the [[Python reticulatus|reticulated python]] (''Python reticulatus''), at up to 8.7 m or more, is considered the longest. An extinct Australian [[Pliocene]] species of ''[[Liasis]]'', the [[Bluff Downs giant python]], reached 10 m, while the [[Paleocene]] ''[[Titanoboa]]'' of South America reached lengths of 12–15 m and an estimated weight of about {{convert|1135|kg|lb|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}.
***Order [[Testudines]]
****The largest turtle is the [[critically endangered]] marine [[leatherback turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea''), weighing up to {{convert|900|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. It is distinguished from other [[sea turtle]]s by its lack of a [[bone|bony]] [[exoskeleton|shell]]. The most massive terrestrial chelonians are the [[giant tortoise]]s of the [[Galápagos Islands]] (''[[Chelonoidis nigra]]'') and [[Aldabra|Aldabra Atoll]] (''[[Aldabrachelys gigantea]]''), at up to {{convert|300|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. These tortoises are the biggest survivors of an assortment of giant tortoise species that were widely present on continental landmasses&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{Cite journal

*Class [[Amphibia]] (in the wide, probably paraphyletic, sense)
**Order [[Temnospondyli]] (relationship to [[Lissamphibia|extant amphibians]] is unclear)
***The Permian temnospondyl ''[[Prionosuchus]]'', the largest amphibian known, reached 9 m in length and was an aquatic predator resembling a crocodilian. After the appearance of real crocodilians, temnospondyls such as ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' (5 m long) had retreated to the Antarctic region by the Cretaceous, before going extinct.
*Class [[Actinopterygii]]
**Order [[Tetraodontiformes]]
***The largest extant [[bony fish]] is the [[ocean sunfish]] (''Mola mola''), whose average adult weight is {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. While phylogenetically a "bony fish", its skeleton is primarily [[cartilage]] (which is lighter than [[bone]]). It has a disk-shaped body, and propels itself with its long, thin [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s; it feeds primarily on [[jellyfish]]. In these three respects (as well as in its size and diving habits), it resembles a leatherback turtle.
**Order [[Lampriformes]]
***The [[giant oarfish]] (''Regalecus glesne'') is the longest bony fish, reaching {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
**Order [[Acipenseriformes]]
***The [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]] (European sturgeon, ''Huso huso'') at up to {{convert|1476|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is the largest [[sturgeon]] (which are also mostly cartilaginous) and is considered the largest [[anadromous]] fish.
**Order [[Siluriformes]]
***The [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[Mekong giant catfish]] (''Pangasianodon gigas''), at up to {{convert|293|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is often viewed as the largest [[freshwater fish]].
*Class [[Chondrichthyes]]
**Order [[Lamniformes]]
***The largest living predatory fish, the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), reaches weights up to {{convert|2240|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Its extinct relative ''[[megalodon|C. megalodon]]'' (the disputed genus being either ''Carcharodon'' or ''Carcharocles'') was more than an [[order of magnitude]] larger, and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history); it preyed on whales and other [[marine mammal]]s.
**Order [[Orectolobiformes]]
***The largest extant [[shark]], [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]], and [[fish]] overall is the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''), which reaches weights in excess of {{convert|21.5|t|lb|abbr=off}}. Like baleen whales, it is a [[filter feeder]] and primarily consumes [[plankton]].
**Order [[Rajiformes]]
***The [[manta ray]]  (''Manta birostris'') is another filter feeder and the largest [[Batoidea|ray]], growing to up to 2300&amp;nbsp;kg.
*Class [[Placodermi]]
**Order [[Arthrodira]]

The arthrodires were eliminated by the environmental upheavals of the [[Late Devonian extinction]], after existing for only about 50 million years.
*Class [[Cephalopoda]]
**Order [[Teuthida]]
***A number of deep ocean creatures exhibit [[Deep-sea gigantism|abyssal gigantism]]. These include the [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis'') and [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni''); both (although rarely seen) are believed to attain lengths of {{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} or more. The latter is the world's largest [[invertebrate]], and has the largest [[eye]]s of any animal. Both are preyed upon by sperm whales.
*Stem-group [[Arthropoda]]
**Order [[Radiodonta]]
***[[Anomalocarid]]s were a group of very early legless marine arthropods that included the largest predators of the [[Cambrian]], such as ''[[Anomalocaris]]''. By the early [[Ordovician]] they had evolved into giant (for the time) filter feeders, apparently in response to the proliferation of plankton during the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]]. ''[[Aegirocassis]]'' grew to over 2 m in length.&lt;ref name="Van_Roy2015"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anomalocaridid trunk limb homology revealed by a giant filter-feeder with paired flaps|authors=Van Roy, P.; Daley, A.

**Order [[Eurypterida]]
***Eurypterids (sea scorpions) were a diverse group of aquatic and possibly amphibious predators that included the most massive [[arthropod]]s to have existed. They survived over 200 million years, but finally died out in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] along with [[trilobite]]s and most other forms of life present at the time, including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids. The Early [[Devonian]]'' [[Jaekelopterus]]'' reached an estimated length of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, not including its [[raptorial]] [[chelicerae]], and is thought to have been a freshwater species.

"'''Oh, Jeez'''" is the seventh episode in the [[South Park (season 20)|twentieth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 274th episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 9, 2016.

The episode lampooned the result of [[United States presidential election, 2016|the 2016 United States presidential election]] the night before this episode was aired, in which [[Donald Trump]] defeated [[Hillary Clinton]].

==Plot==
The day after [[United States presidential election, 2016|the 2016 United States presidential election]], people are shocked that [[Mr. Garrison]] has defeated [[Hillary Clinton]], especially [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]]. In contrast to his earlier actions, Garrison in a dazed speech embraces his election. Randy visits Garrison and his running mate [[Caitlyn Jenner]] to confront their changed attitude and their changed belief that ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' was not a bad movie when Jenner suddenly vomits a [[Member Berries|member berry]]-based substance onto Randy, causing him to fall into the same dazed state of acceptance. Later at his home, Randy vomits on Sharon and [[List of South Park families#Shelly Marsh|Shelly]], bringing them into the same state.

The city of [[Fort Collins, Colorado]] has not had their election votes tallied as they are walled off due to the city's entire Internet histories being published from the Danish website known as Troll Trace. Government representatives arrive at [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski]]'s home and take Gerald away, who believes that this is a result of his [[Internet troll|trolling]] actions as Skankhunt42. He is led under a bridge where he meets with Hillary Clinton. Hillary and her agents task Gerald to become a spy and infiltrate Troll Trace headquarters in Denmark as an ambassador with a briefcase that would emit an [[electromagnetic pulse]], destroying their computer equipment. When Gerald arrives in Denmark, he is warmly welcomed to the Troll Trace headquarters and taken to a room he believes is the server room only to be surprised by meeting his Internet troll friend Dildo Schwaggins and the rest of his trolling team. Schwaggins reveals that they were all set up by Hillary to be fake spies and purposefully given to the Danes in return for Denmark not activating the Troll Trace website. Their briefcases then simultaneously all open to reveal that they have been [[rickrolling|rickrolled]].

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is scared that his girlfriend [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Heidi Turner|Heidi Turner]] will find out about his previous Internet history, so he asks [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to help him cover up his previous Internet actions, but Butters is still mad at Cartman and the girls. Later, [[List of South Park Elementary staff#PC Principal|PC Principal]] hosts a school assembly with [[Bill Clinton]] who also brings along [[Bill Cosby]] to introduce a new [[gentlemen's club]] in hopes that the boys and girls of the school can get along. Bill Clinton has [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy Testaburger]] try to make up but Butters interrupts their session by pressing his [[penis]] against the window. Bill Clinton later meets with Butters and reveals to him that this gentlemen's club is only an act to avoid the wrath of Hillary and the rest of the women when their Internet histories are revealed by Troll Trace.  Eventually, Cartman takes Heidi to a [[SpaceX]] station with plans to escape to Mars and be completely isolated from the rest of the world.

==Production==
This episode was originally going to be titled "The Very First Gentleman";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=PRESS - South Park Episode 2007 The Very First Gentleman November 9 at 10pm Comedy Central |url=http://press.cc.com/press-release/2016/11/07/press-south-park-episode-2007-the-very-first-gentleman-november-9-at-10pm-comedy-central |publisher=Comedy Central Press |accessdate=October 1, 2018 |date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the title and a large amount of the content was changed at the last minute to reflect the results of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]. Critics seemed to believe that [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] had originally written the episode with the premise of Hillary Clinton winning the election.&lt;ref name="firstgentlemen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=William|title=South Park was forced to re-write tonight’s episode after Trump’s win|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/south-park-was-forced-re-write-tonights-episode-af-245669|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Reception==
Many of the critical reviews focused on the changes the episode had to incorporate due to the election results. Jesse Schedeen from [[IGN]] rated the episode an 8.5 out of 10, noting "It'll be interesting to see how much Parker and Stone's reaction to the outcome of the election fuels these final three episodes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/10/south-park-oh-jeez-review|title=South Park: "Oh, Jeez" Review|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 7.8 out of 10, and summarized "''South Park'' had their work cut out for them, but I thought they handled everything as you would expect ''South Park'' to handle these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/movies/south-park-20-7-review-the-very-first-gentleman/|title=South Park 20.7 Review – "The Very First Gentleman"|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|publisher=411 Mania|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Caffrey with ''[[The A.V.

== Etymology ==
Ratha-yatra is derived two Sanskrit words, ''Ratha'' ([http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A5&amp;searchhws=yes रथ]) which means chariot or carriage, and ''yātrā'' ([http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE&amp;searchhws=yes यात्रा]) which means journey or pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nori J. Muster|title=Betrayal of the Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3uoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09499-6|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Indian languages such as Odia, the phonetic equivalents are used, such as ''ratha'' and ''jatra''. Other names for the festival are ''ratha jatra'' or ''chariot festival''.

==Description==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Rathayatra'' is a journey in a chariot accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders.&lt;ref name="Michaels1996p270"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michaels|author2=Cornelia Vogelsanger|author3=Annette Wilke|title=Wild Goddesses in India and Nepal: Proceedings of an International Symposium, Berne and Zurich, November 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wbXAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=P. Lang|isbn=978-3-906756-04-2|pages=270–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in medieval texts of India such as the [[Puranas]], which mention the Rathayatra of [[Surya]] (Sun god), of [[Devi]] (Mother goddess), and of [[Vishnu]]. These chariot journeys have elaborate celebrations where the individuals or the deities come out of a temple accompanied by the public journeying with them through the ''Ksetra'' (region, streets) to another temple or to the river or the sea. Sometimes the festivities include returning back to the sacrosanctum of the temple.&lt;ref name="Michaels1996p270"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;

===Jagannath Rath Yatra at Puri (Odisha)===
{{Main|Ratha-Yatra (Puri)}}
[[File:Bahuda Jatra, Nabakalebara 2015.jpg|thumb|Rathayatra in Odisha]]
Triads are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|temple]] at [[Puri]], but once during the month of [[Asadha]] (Rainy Season of [[Odisha]], usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and travel (3&amp;nbsp;km) to the Shri [[Gundicha Temple]], in huge chariots ([[ratha]]), allowing the public to have [[darśana]] (Holy view). This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey ([[yatra]]) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=16}} The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=40}} The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word [[Juggernaut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juggernaut-Definition and Meaning|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra.

The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the ''chhera pahara.'' During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati King]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]n kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.

As per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in ''Pahandi vijay''.

In the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the [[Gundicha Temple]], where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''Poda Pitha,'' a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the people of Odisha.

[[File:Kolkata rath yatra.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Rath Yatra Festival in [[Kolkata]]]]
The observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in [[Brahma Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]]. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In [[Moghul]] period also, King Ramsingh of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.

Moreover, Starza{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genoese]] prison.{{Sfn|Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the "idols" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the "church" with song and music.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=129}} {{Sfn|Das|1982|p=48}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7805">A '''scam letter''' is a document, distributed electronically or otherwise, to a recipient misrepresenting the truth with the aim of gaining an advantage in a [[fraudulent]] manner.

==Origin==
Currently it is unclear how far back the origin of scam letters date. The oldest reference to the origin of scam letters could be found at the [[Spanish Prisoner]] scam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.austin.rr.com/tsote/scams/various.html Scams that Keep Being Used on People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911140128/http://home.austin.rr.com/tsote/scams/various.html |date=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scam dates back to the 1580s, where the fictitious prisoner would promise to share non-existent treasure with the person who would send him money to bribe the guards.

Today scam letters are a general part of electronic life, ending up in mailboxes in hordes.

==Types==

===Lottery scam letter===
Based on mostly the same principles as the Nigerian 419 [[advance-fee fraud]] scam, this scam letter informs recipients that their e-mail addresses have been drawn in online lotteries and that they have won large sums of money. Here the victims will also be required to pay substantial small amounts of money in order to have the winning money released, which never materializes.

===Phishing scam letter===
[[Phishing]] scam letters, in short, are a notification from an online 'financial institution', requiring its clients to log into their accounts and verify or change their log-in details. A fraudulent website is set up by offenders, which appears to be the website of the actual financial institution. Once a victim follows the log-in link from the scam letter and logs into the 'account', the log-in details are sent to the offenders.

===Cheap Viagra and software product scam letter===
This is yet another [[scam]] where the [[misrepresentation]] is made as an offer for cheap medical products and computer software. Often, when ordered, victims will not receive the goods or in certain instances a [[counterfeit|fake]] version of the goods ordered.

===Dating love scam letter===
Often users will find the letter from a young and attractive female wanting to meet or relocate to the users' country. After invoking their [[confidence trick]] on the user they will require the recipient of the scam letter to pay the funds necessary for the relocation. Once paid, the correspondence ends and the writer never appears.

===Subscription scam===
Users of some Web sites are sometimes faced with invoices from Internet sites which they have visited. One company with a reputation for this is the Swiss-German based company [[Media Intense]] GmBH, which runs win-load.net.&lt;ref&gt;http://antiabzockenet.blogspot.com/2008/12/media-intense-gmbh.html&lt;/ref&gt; Users are asked to create an account before downloading a piece of software. The terms and conditions state that the account requires a subscription of 8 euros per month for a minimum of 24 months, but that the user forfeits the right to cancel. The user will then receive threatening invoices from the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://74.125.43.132/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://lawblog.mcneubert.de/2009/03/12/abofallen-katja-gunther-beantragt-mahnbescheide-fur-online-content-ltd/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522media%2Bintense%2Bgmbh%2522%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtNrK1QdbJT23DqcJ5aN9QD31qLQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kuendigung-blog.de/?p=61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.computerbetrug.de/allgemeines/55652-win-loads-net.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there exist many forms of scam letters distributed on the Internet. The mentioned examples above acs as an indication of how these scam letters work and how victims are defrauded.

==Distribution==

===Postal services===
In the past, before the introduction of electronic communications, scam letters were posted by normal postal services, which had been a slow and tedious method of defrauding victims. Although this method tremendously decreased its appearance today, it still occurs that a victim might receive the posted scam letter.

===Fax===
Faxed scam letters are in no way an uncommon occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/ The Nigerian Scam Defined]&lt;/ref&gt; Today many scam letters are still faxed to corporate institutions, although they are not a large amount due to cost restraints on behalf of offenders.

===Electronic mail===
E-mail is today the prevalent way in which scam letters are distributed. Due to its cost-effectiveness and international reach, offenders prefer this method as victims are reached in a much more timely manner.

===Forums and chat rooms===
Often offenders will target busy Internet-based forums and chat rooms where they will circulate their scam letters to registered users.

==Law enforcement==
Generally, law enforcement agencies from around the world are interested in scam letters where actual losses incurred upon a victim. Due to the sheer volume of scam letters distributed on the Internet, no law enforcement agency will be in a position to investigate every scam letter reported.

Most law enforcement agencies, however, introduced a method of reporting scam letters to them. Information on reporting scam letter to them can be found at [http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/ The Nigerian Scam Defined].

During August 2007, a new private initiative, [http://www.scamletters.com ScamLetters.com], was launched with the aim of assisting law enforcement agencies by relieving the burden of scam letter reports, as well as assisting in scam letter investigations by availing a unique database for reporting of scam letters by the public.

===Penalty===
Edna Fiedler, 44, of [[Olympia, Washington]], on June 25, 2008, pleaded guilty in a [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] court and was sentenced to two years imprisonment and five years of supervised release or [[probation]] in an Internet $1 million "Nigerian check scam". She conspired to commit bank, wire and mail fraud against US citizens, specifically using Internet by having an [[accomplice]] ship counterfeit checks and money orders to her from [[Lagos]], Nigeria in November 2007. Fiedler shipped out $609,000 fake check and money orders when arrested and  prepared to send additional $1.1 million counterfeit materials. Also, the U.S. Postal Service intercepted $2.1 billion in counterfeit checks, lottery tickets and eBay overpayment schemes with a face value of $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/06/26/Woman_gets_prison_for_Nigerian_scam/UPI-73791214521169/  upi.com, Woman gets prison for 'Nigerian' scam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.yahoo.com/news/pcworld/147575  yahoo.com,  Woman Gets Two Years for Aiding Nigerian Internet Check Scam (PC World)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Six Degrees of Separation''' is a play written by [[Americans|American]] playwright [[John Guare]] that premiered in 1990. The play was nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] and was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama "Pulitzer Prize for Drama"] pulitzer.org, accessed November 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The play explores the existential premise that everyone in the world is connected to everyone else in the world by a chain of no more than six acquaintances, thus, "[[six degrees of separation]]".

==Synopsis==
A young black man named Paul shows up at the home of art dealer Flan Kittredge and his wife Louisa, known simply as "Ouisa", who live overlooking [[Central Park]] in New York City. Paul has a minor stab wound from an attempted mugging, and says he's a friend of their children at [[Harvard University]]. The Kittredges are trying to get the money to buy a painting by [[Paul Cézanne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Krasner|editor1-first=David|title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century American Drama|date=2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781405137348|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plunka|first1=Gene A.|title=The Black Comedy of John Guare|date=2002|publisher=U of Delaware P|isbn=9780874137637|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, who is directing a film version of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]].'' Paul continues to charm them with his story, though, in reality, it is all a lie: Paul is not a Harvard student but obtained details on the Kittredges from another male student he had seduced. Eventually Paul uses their home for an encounter with a hustler, but is caught red-handed. The police are called, but Paul escapes.

Soon after, Paul starts up another con against a sensitive young man named Rick and his live-in girlfriend, Elizabeth. The naive young couple are new to the big city having just moved to New York from [[Utah]] and, based on Paul's con, invite him to live with them until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father—who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him in order to get the money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick's father had always questioned his son's sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.

In desperation, Paul calls the Kittredges for assistance. Partly due to strained relations with her children, Ouisa finds herself feeling emotionally attached to Paul, hoping to be able to help him in some way despite the fact that he has victimized them. Over a protracted and laborious phone call, he agrees to give himself up to the police; however, during the arrest, he and the couple are separated. Despite their efforts—Ouisa's more than Flan's—his fate is unresolved, except for a possibly tragic end. Towards the end of the play, in a climactic moment of reflection, she delivers the play's most famous [[monologue]]:

{{cquote|''I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people.  Six degrees of separation.  Between us and everybody else on this planet.  The president of the United States.  A gondolier in Venice.  fill in the names.  I find that A) tremendously comforting that we're so close and B) like Chinese water torture that we're so close.  Because you have to find the right six people to make the connection.  It's not just big names.  It's anyone.  A native in a rain forest.  A Tierra del Fuegan.  An Eskimo.  I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.  It's a profound thought.  How Paul found us.  How to find the man whose son he pretends to be.  Or perhaps is his son, although I doubt it.  How every person is a new door, opening up into other worlds.  Six degrees of separation between me and everyone else on this planet.  But to find the right six people.''}}

[[Kristin Griffith]] and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] read the role of Ouisa Kittredge in workshops in 1989 before Stockard Channing was cast. Channing was originally unavailable and was committed to coming to Broadway in another play, [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Jake's Women]]''. The play's Broadway run was canceled. Channing had starred previously in John Guare's ''[[The House of Blue Leaves]]'', and he offered her the role for the official Off-Broadway run. Kurtz later replaced Channing during the Broadway run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-07/entertainment/ca-638_1_simon-jake-broadway Jake's Women canceled] accessed 11/23/2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Separation-John-Guare/dp/0822210347 Play script notes] accessed 11/23/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
The play premiered [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center]], on May 16, 1990. Stockard Channing won an [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress|Obie Award]] for Best Actress for her performance. Guare won an Obie Award for his script.

The production transferred to the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]] for its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut on November 8, 1990. The production closed on January 5, 1992 after 485 performances, directed by [[Jerry Zaks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/11250/Six-Degrees-of-Separation "'Six Degrees of Separation' Broadway"] playbillvault.com, accessed November 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[Kelly Bishop]] played the role of Ouisa as a replacement on Broadway, and [[Laura Linney]] made her Broadway debut as a replacement for the role of Tess. The original Broadway production was nominated for four [[Tony Awards]], winning for Best Direction for Zaks. A US. National tour was launched in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-04-04/features/9302030976_1_tour-off-broadway-six-degrees&lt;/ref&gt;[[Veronica Hamel]] also played Ouisa in the first production in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-24/news/9203060876_1_six-degrees-john-guare-veronica-hamel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The play was inspired by the real-life story of [[David Hampton]], a [[confidence trick|con]] man and robber who managed to convince a number of people in the 1980s that he was the son of actor [[Sidney Poitier]]. The writer John Guare was a friend of [[Inger McCabe Elliott]] and her husband [[Osborn Elliott]]. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliott's New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ugCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=stockard+channing+inger+elliott&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3rs0iOwbSe&amp;sig=E-5y6DRK5DqvvPcvkkYW6hG1H7s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI4-vi7u36xgIVyFk-Ch0sMgD7#v=onepage&amp;q=stockard%20channing%20inger%20elliott&amp;f=false New York Mag The Story of David Hampton ] accessed 7-27-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After the play became a dramatic and financial success, Hampton was tried and acquitted for harassment of Guare; he felt he was due a share of the profits that he ultimately never received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Larrt McShane | title=Six Degrees' Inspiration Hampton Dies | url=http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg01075.html | work=The Associated Press | date=19 July 2003 | accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong influence on the play is the novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' by [[J. D. Salinger]]. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on ''The Catcher in The Rye''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027114943/http://www.geocities.com/exploring_citr/sixdegrees.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; to the family who takes him in for the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Colin L. Ryono | title=Six Degrees of Separation | url=http://www.whysanity.net/monos/sdop.html | publisher=Colin's Movie Monologue Page | date=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also more subtle [[allusions]] made both in the script and in the [[cinematography]] of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on [[Holden Caulfield]]-esque characteristics and attitudes.

==Film adaptation==
{{main article|Six Degrees of Separation (film)}}

==Biography==
===Early life===
Steve Vai, a descendant of [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrants]], was born in [[Carle Place, New York]] on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai: the 10 Records That Changed My Life|url = http://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-12-15/steve-vai-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|website = TeamRock|publisher = |date = 2015-12-15|accessdate = 2016-01-10|language = en-GB|first = Joe|last = Bosso|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160128114634/http://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-12-15/steve-vai-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|archivedate = January 28, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his first experiences with music as, "at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint—the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want."&lt;ref name="http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Interview · Make Weird Music|url = http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/interview/steve-vai/|website = Make Weird Music|publisher = MakeWeirdMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/interview/steve-vai/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Musician's Friend Exclusive Interview with Steve Vai, Part I Buyer's Guide {{!}} Musicians Friend|url = http://www.musiciansfriend.com/resources/article/Musicians-Friend-Exclusive-Interview-with-Steve-Vai-Part-I/m710806|website = www.musiciansfriend.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151226081151/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/resources/article/Musicians-Friend-Exclusive-Interview-with-Steve-Vai-Part-I/m710806|archivedate = December 26, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americansongwriter.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q&amp;A: Steve Vai Drops Some Knowledge « American Songwriter|url = http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/qa-steve-vai-drops-some-knowledge/|website = American Songwriter|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151230223246/http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/qa-steve-vai-drops-some-knowledge/|archivedate = December 30, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, "I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen."&lt;ref name="http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americansongwriter.com"/&gt;

As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his "musical awakening" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film ''[[West Side Story (soundtrack)|West Side Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Record that Changed My Life: Steve Vai Discusses &amp;#039;West Side Story: Original Broadway Cast Recording&amp;#039;|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/record-changed-my-life-steve-vai-discusses-west-side-story-original-broadway-cast-recording|website = Guitar World|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105121231/http://www.guitarworld.com/record-changed-my-life-steve-vai-discusses-west-side-story-original-broadway-cast-recording|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and [[progressive rock|progressive]] music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar.

In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native [[Joe Satriani]], and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Things You Didn't Know About Steve Vai|url = http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-steve-vai/|website = Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225080806/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-steve-vai/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vai cites artists such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[Brian May]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as [[jazz fusion]] guitarists [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Al Di Meola]] as some of his major influences in that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Music Influences|url = http://www.mtv.com/artists/steve-vai/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|website = MTV Artists|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.mtv.com/artists/steve-vai/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. While at Berklee, Vai began working for [[Frank Zappa]] as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Berklee Press: An Interview with Steve Vai|url = http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|website = www.berkleepress.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150901080843/http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|archivedate = September 1, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse [[Pia Maiocco]], with whom he has been together since; they have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pia Maiocco|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583921/|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583921/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Steven+Tyler,+Steve+Vai,+and+Patty+Larkin+Among+Five+High+Profile...-a0115904470|title=Steven Tyler, Steve Vai, and Patty Larkin Among Five High Profile Artists and Composers Supporting Berklee's New Online Music Scholarship; Berklee Honorary Doctor of Music Degree Recipient, Steven Tyler, and Berklee Alumni Steve Vai, Patty Larkin, Alf Clausen, and Tom Snow Back Positive 'Music and the Internet' Initiative. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Vai sent both a notated transcription of Frank Zappa's "[[The Black Page]]", and a recording of his college band, Morning Thunder, to Zappa.&lt;ref name="berkleepress.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Berklee Press: An Interview with Steve Vai|url = http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|website = www.berkleepress.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150901080843/http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|archivedate = September 1, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vaiography - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/vaiography/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227031927/http://www.vai.com/vaiography/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary as a [[transcriptionist]] to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' and ''[[Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar]]'' albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tempo Mental - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219101709/http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|archivedate = December 19, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving [[Berklee College of Music]] and moving to California, Vai auditioned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkleeshares.com/guitar/stevevai|title=Steve Vai On His Audition for Frank Zappa's Band  -|last=Online|first=Berklee|website=www.berkleeshares.com|access-date=2017-03-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401232757/http://www.berkleeshares.com/guitar/stevevai|archivedate=April 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for and became a full-time member of Zappa's band, going on his first tour with Zappa in the fall of 1980.&lt;ref name="berkleepress.com"/&gt; Zappa often referred to Vai as his "little Italian virtuoso",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai|url = https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/steve-vai|website = NAMM.org|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222110714/https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/steve-vai|archivedate = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa's albums as having performed "stunt" or "impossible" guitar parts.&lt;ref name="Play Like Steve Vai"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Play Like Steve Vai|url = http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995|website = www.guitarplayer.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090709/http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995|archivedate = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release ''[[Zappa's Universe]]'', and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on [[Dweezil Zappa]]'s [[Zappa Plays Zappa]] tour; both projects won Vai a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Awards|publisher = vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/awards/|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095812/http://www.vai.com/awards/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in [[Sylmar, Los Angeles]], where he built his first professional studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Studios - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227025257/http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bands - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/bands/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227041625/http://www.vai.com/bands/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album ''[[Flex-Able]]''. He created his own record label, [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take ''Flex-Able'' directly to distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vai.com - The Official Steve Vai Website: Disc Notes - Flex-Able|url = http://www.vai.com/AllAboutSteve/disconotes_flexable.html|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051804/http://www.vai.com/AllAboutSteve/disconotes_flexable.html|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flex-Able'' was released in January 1984.

Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of ''Flex-Able'', his composition "[[The Attitude Song]]" was published in ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Play Like Steve Vai"/&gt; The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the [[time signature]] 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as [[tapping#Two-handed tapping|two-handed tapping]], [[whammy bar|whammy bar acrobatics]], [[sweep-picking|sweep picking]], [[alternate picking]], [[harmony|multi-part harmonies]], and odd [[phrase (music)|phrasing]]) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time.&lt;ref name="Play Like Steve Vai"/&gt; Interest from the public eye grew more so when Vai's song "Blue Powder" (a demonstration for the [[Carvin Corporation|Carvin]] X100b [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]]) was published in ''Guitar Player'' as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'' as the Devil's guitar player "Jack Butler". In the famous "duel scene" between Vai and [[Ralph Macchio]]'s characters, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by [[Ry Cooder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/soundtrack|title = Crossroads (1986)|date = |accessdate = |publisher = IMDb|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/soundtrack|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In between solo work, Vai replaced [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of [[Alcatrazz]], with whom he recorded the album ''[[Disturbing the Peace (album)|Disturbing the Peace]]''. Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join [[David Lee Roth]]'s band.

===With David Lee Roth (1985–1989)===
In 1985, Vai joined David Lee Roth's post-[[Van Halen]] band as [[lead guitar]]ist, together with former [[Talas (band)|Talas]] Bassist [[Billy Sheehan]] on bass; and former [[Maynard Ferguson]] drummer [[Gregg Bissonette]] on drums. The foursome's debut album ''[[Eat 'Em and Smile]]'', released on July 7, 1986, was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and selling over two million copies. ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine editor [[Brad Tolinski]] commented on Vai's playing at the time, saying that "Steve Vai's guitar wizardry is so profound that in earlier times he would have been burned as a witch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.hdtracks.com/music/artist/view/id/2338/|title =Steve Vai|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151223154823/http://www.hdtracks.com/music/artist/view/id/2338/|archivedate =December 23, 2015|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, ''Eat 'Em and Smile'' is frequently evaluated as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Metal Odyssey's Good Times Album Pick: David Lee Roth - "Eat 'Em and Smile"|url = http://metalodyssey.net/2010/04/01/metal-odysseys-good-times-album-pick-david-lee-roth-eat-em-and-smile/|website = Metal Odyssey &gt; Heavy Metal Music Blog|accessdate = 2015-12-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151223140528/http://metalodyssey.net/2010/04/01/metal-odysseys-good-times-album-pick-david-lee-roth-eat-em-and-smile/|archivedate = December 23, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's [[Eat 'Em and Smile Tour]] began in August 1986 and continued through February 1987.

Roth's subsequent album ''[[Skyscraper (album)|Skyscraper]]'', released in 1988, was produced by both Roth and Vai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Discusses His Albums with David Lee Roth &amp; Van Halen's 'A Different Kind Of Truth'|url = http://www.vhnd.com/2012/08/21/steve-vai-discusses-a-different-kind-of-truth-his-albums-with-david-lee-roth/|website = Van Halen News Desk|accessdate = 2015-12-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092347/http://www.vhnd.com/2012/08/21/steve-vai-discusses-a-different-kind-of-truth-his-albums-with-david-lee-roth/|archivedate = December 23, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor, the album was a  commercial success, reaching number six on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. In 1989, following the successful [[Skyscraper Tour]], Vai departed from the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Special «  martingoulding.com|url = http://martingoulding.com/lessons/special-features/steve-vai-special/|website = martingoulding.com|accessdate = 2015-12-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160208232521/http://martingoulding.com/lessons/special-features/steve-vai-special/|archivedate = February 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Cacophony guitarist [[Jason Becker]].

In 1985, after having joined Roth's band, Vai designed the [[Ibanez JEM|JEM]] guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry. Vai began working with Ibanez in 1986 to develop the guitar, and the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were released in 1987.

===1990s===

From 1985 to 1990, Vai recorded ''[[Passion and Warfare]]'' at his home studio, his second studio solo album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Studios - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227025257/http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vai.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – Passion &amp; Warfare - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-passion-warfare/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225052602/http://www.vai.com/album-passion-warfare/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving Roth's band in 1989, Vai bought out of his [[Capitol Records]] contract and signed on with [[Relativity Records]] for the release of ''Passion and Warfare'', which was completed shortly after he began recording the guitar parts for [[Whitesnake]]'s ''[[Slip of the Tongue]]'' album, where he replaced the injured [[Adrian Vandenberg]].&lt;ref name="vai.com"/&gt;

Upon its release in November 1989, ''Slip of the Tongue'' sold over three million copies worldwide, reaching number 10 on the ''Billboard'' 200 while Vai joined the band on their thirteen-month world tour.&lt;ref name="vai.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bands - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/bands/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227041625/http://www.vai.com/bands/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Slip of the Tongue - Whitesnake {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/slip-of-the-tongue-mw0000653833|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/slip-of-the-tongue-mw0000653833|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1990, Vai released ''Passion and Warfare'' through Relativity Records,&lt;ref name="vai.com"/&gt; and within the first week of release, the album had reached number 18 in the ''Billboard'' 200, selling over a million and a half copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="vai.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Passion and Warfare - Steve Vai {{!}} Awards {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/passion-and-warfare-mw0000308521/awards|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225064346/http://www.allmusic.com/album/passion-and-warfare-mw0000308521/awards|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musicradar.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Steve Vai talks about his solo studio recordings|url = http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/interview-steve-vai-talks-about-his-solo-studio-recordings-555180|website = MusicRadar|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225033650/http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/interview-steve-vai-talks-about-his-solo-studio-recordings-555180|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passion and Warfare'' won Vai a number of awards such as ''Guitar World'' and ''Guitar Player'''s "Best Album" and "Best Rock Guitarist" awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Awards - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/awards/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095812/http://www.vai.com/awards/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passion and Warfare'' has been cited as one of the most pertinent instrumental albums released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/passion-and-warfare-mw0000308521|title =Passion and Warfare- AllMusic|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/passion-and-warfare-mw0000308521|archivedate =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fascinating Facts About Steve Vai’s Passion And Warfare|url = http://iheartguitarblog.com/2015/09/fascinating-facts-about-steve-vais-passion-and-warfare.html#sthash.FUgPsPpm.dpbs|website = I Heart Guitar|accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151229172801/http://iheartguitarblog.com/2015/09/fascinating-facts-about-steve-vais-passion-and-warfare.html#sthash.FUgPsPpm.dpbs|archivedate = December 29, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 also saw the release of the [[Ibanez Universe]] [[seven-string guitar]] co-designed by Vai in conjunction with Ibanez. Vai left Whitesnake in 1990 to pursue his own musical avenues, and formed a band that included [[Devin Townsend]] on vocals, [[T. M. Stevens]] on bass, and [[Terry Bozzio]] on drums.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt; The group released ''[[Sex &amp; Religion]]'' on July 23, 1993, that was described as visceral in nature, combining a compositional and [[progressive metal]] rhythm section with Devin Townsend's vocal arrangements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – Sex &amp; Religion - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-sex-religion/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225043250/http://www.vai.com/album-sex-religion/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the following tour in support of the album, the group disbanded.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Vai began working with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in 1994, with whom he wrote and recorded the ''[[Ozzmosis]]'' album.

While recording his fourth studio album ''[[Fire Garden]]'', Vai took time to record and release the stripped down EP ''[[Alien Love Secrets]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – Alien Love Secrets - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-alien-love-secrets/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225033127/http://www.vai.com/album-alien-love-secrets/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A departure from the often highly compositional and heavily produced style of his previous projects, the seven-track EP was recorded in four weeks and released through Relativity/[[Epic Records]] on March 21, 1995.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Steve-Vai-Alien-Love-Secrets/release/3865831|title=Steve Vai - Alien Love Secrets|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730175557/https://www.discogs.com/Steve-Vai-Alien-Love-Secrets/release/3865831|archivedate=July 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vai cites this record as one of his favorites, saying "The recording and release of ''Alien Love Secrets'' marked another turning point in my personal evolution. I was more concerned with making the record that I wanted to make, and not worry about what some others thought I should be doing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

On September 17, 1996, Vai released ''Fire Garden'', 19-track double album, through Epic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Steve-Vai-Fire-Garden/release/378320|title=Steve Vai - Fire Garden|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801022057/https://www.discogs.com/Steve-Vai-Fire-Garden/release/378320|archivedate=August 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first half being primarily instrumental while the second half featured Vai on vocals.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt; After the release of ''Fire Garden'', Vai joined his former teacher [[Joe Satriani]], along with guitarist [[Eric Johnson]], for the second installment of the ongoing [[G3 (tour)|G3]] concert tours.

In December 2001, Vai recorded two performances at [[London Astoria|The Astoria]] in London, with his band The Breed (composed of former David Lee Roth bandmate Billy Sheehan, guitarist/pianist [[Tony MacAlpine]], guitarist [[Dave Weiner]], and drummer [[Virgil Donati]]). This live show was released independently in DVD format as ''[[Live at the Astoria, London|Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria, London]]'' in 2003, and was Vai's first of many successful live concert DVD projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430632/|title =IMDb- Steve Vai: Live At The Astoria London|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430632/|archivedate =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Vai released twelve tracks from the DVD in an online only release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Live at the Astoria - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-astoria-mw0001007027|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-astoria-mw0001007027|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001 saw the [[special edition|limited]] release of ''[[The Secret Jewel Box]]'', a conceptual ten-CD box set containing unique material from various eras of Vai's career. Four compilation albums (''[[The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1]]''; ''[[Mystery Tracks – Archives Vol. 3]]''; ''[[Various Artists – Archives Vol. 4]]''; and ''[[Vai: Piano Reductions, Vol. 1]]'') included as part of the box set, were released to the public both in 2001 and the years following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vai.com : The Secret Jewel Box : About the Box|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/boxset/about.html|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194043/http://www.vai.com/minisites/boxset/about.html|archivedate = March 3, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2001, Vai's record label [[Favored Nations]] released ''[[No Substitutions: Live in Osaka]]''. The release, which Vai himself produced and engineered, won him his second [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album|Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album]] in February 2002.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Awards - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/awards/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095812/http://www.vai.com/awards/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most widely recognized for his stature as a rock guitar player, Vai is also a musical composer fluent in the composition and arranging of [[orchestra]]l music. In May 2004, Vai premiered "The Aching Hunger", a project commissioned by the Netherlands Programme Service and performed with the Netherlands' [[Metropole Orkest|Metropole Orchestra]]. "The Aching Hunger" performances consisted of two parts: the first showcasing Vai's original contemporary orchestral compositions, and the second consisting of Vai (on guitar) playing newly arranged material from his catalog with the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vai.com - The Official Steve Vai Website &gt; Inside Real Illusions: Reflections|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/07lotusfeet.html|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175927/http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/07lotusfeet.html|archivedate = March 3, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project yielded both the ''[[Visual Sound Theories]]'' DVD and the ''[[Sound Theories Vol. I &amp; II]]'' album, which were recorded in 2005 during multiple "Aching Hunger" performances and released in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sound Theories, Vols. 1-2 - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-theories-vols-1-2-mw0000470643|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-theories-vols-1-2-mw0000470643|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "The Aching Hunger" and its following releases started Vai's public career as an orchestral composer, Vai had been composing since he began a music theory class (taught by Bill Westcott) in high school. In speaking of Westcott, Vai says "He taught me how to write, compose and appreciate music. There was no greater musical influence in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bill Westcott - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/bill-westcott-3/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227123126/http://www.vai.com/bill-westcott-3/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Vai released ''[[Real Illusions: Reflections]]'', the first installment in an ongoing three-part trilogy concept album. Each of the three installments to the series contain material (songs, lyrics, and both spoken and written narration) with particular relationships to the storyline, purposefully left out of order. Upon the release of the third installment, Vai intends to complete a fourth album of material, which will then be released with the previous three installments and completed storyline in order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vai.com - The Official Steve Vai Website &gt; Inside Real Illusions: Reflections|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003029/http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Real Illusions: Reflections - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/real-illusions-reflections-mw0000261218|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/real-illusions-reflections-mw0000261218|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In speaking of the storyline, Vai says "It's a human interest story, about the human condition. ... It's a story about this man who has a traumatic experience in his life, and it drives him insane. We see the story through his eyes. It also involves the town he lives in and this stranger that enters the town who's like a shaman; he builds this giant edifice, like a reflecting pond, and when people come to it they see aspects of their personalities and identities and discover things about themselves. There's some comedy involved, too, but it's pretty esoteric. It's about a lot of lofty principles, so it's not a bad idea to dish this all out slowly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Steve Vai Breaks Down His New Album, &amp;#039;The Story of Light&amp;#039;|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-steve-vai-breaks-down-his-new-album-story-light|website = Guitar World|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227124107/http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-steve-vai-breaks-down-his-new-album-story-light|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installments to the series will be released over periods of time, with the second, ''[[The Story of Light (Steve Vai album)|The Story of Light]]'', having been released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – The Story of Light - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-the-story-of-light/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227135232/http://www.vai.com/album-the-story-of-light/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Vai joined the [[Zappa Plays Zappa]] tour as a special guest, alongside additional Zappa band alumni Terry Bozzio and [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]]. In 2008, for his performance of "Peaches en Regalia" from the Zappa Plays Zappa tour, Vai won his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business,{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} Vai began a series of "Alien Guitar Secrets" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play (see Notable contributions for more on this).

In support of ''Sound Theories Vol. I &amp; II'' and ''Visual Sound Theories'', Vai put together a new band for a five-month world tour of the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Unveils New Band String Theories|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories/|website = Blabbermouth.net|date = 2007-05-23|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105070447/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While evaluating unique options for the band (which included ideas for a [[horn (instrument)|horn]] section or [[percussion instrument|percussion]] section), Vai began auditioning violin players to complement the new lineup. This new band, known as the String Theories band, featured previous The Breed members Jeremy Colson (drums) and Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar), along with new members [[Bryan Beller]] (bass), Alex DePue (violin), and [[Ann Marie Calhoun]] (violin). During a month of twelve- to fifteen-hour a day rehearsals, Vai and the band perfected the performance (which consisted of pieces from Vai's catalog, arranged by Vai to include the two violins).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Unveils New Band String Theories|url = http://bravewords.com/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories|website = bravewords.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151229111646/http://bravewords.com/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories|archivedate = December 29, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour began in June 2007 and ended in December the same year.

Midway through the String Theories tour in 2007, Vai recorded a performance at the [[State Theatre (Minneapolis)|State Theatre]] in [[Minneapolis]], which yielded the acclaimed 2009 live concert DVD and Blu-ray release of ''[[Where the Wild Things Are (Steve Vai album)|Where the Wild Things Are]]''. Certified gold in the United States and Canada, ''Where the Wild Things Are'' showcased the diverse musical range of the String Theories band, with pieces such as the visceral Grammy-nominated "[[Now We Run]]", to the dynamic ballad "Angel Food".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245526/|title =IMDb- Where The Wild Things Are|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245526/|archivedate =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Where the Wild Things Are - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/where-the-wild-things-are-mw0000825761|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/where-the-wild-things-are-mw0000825761|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 also marked the 20th anniversary of the production of the Ibanez JEM guitar, a milestone which was commemorated with the 20th anniversary JEM model. Made of an acrylic body with three-dimensional "swirl painted" interior, this guitar can be seen in the beginning of the ''Where the Wild Things Are'' DVD. In 2008, Vai announced the release of his signature Ibanez Jemini [[distortion (music)#Overdrive.2Fdistortion pedals|distortion pedal]], a twin distortion pedal with both a custom overdrive and lead distortion section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review: Ibanez Jemini Steve Vai signature distortion pedal|url = http://iheartguitarblog.com/2011/04/review-ibanez-jemini-steve-vai-signature-distortion-pedal.html#sthash.kLtlOpWY.dpbs|website = I Heart Guitar|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105020121/http://iheartguitarblog.com/2011/04/review-ibanez-jemini-steve-vai-signature-distortion-pedal.html#sthash.kLtlOpWY.dpbs|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "cutting heads" scene between Vai's Jack Butler and [[Ralph Macchio]]'s Eugene "Lightning" Martone, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar (which was performed by [[Ry Cooder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/|title =Crossroads (1986)-IMDb|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/|archivedate =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main body of the final piece performed in the duel scene (the fast-paced [[neoclassical metal|neoclassical]] track "Eugene's Trick Bag") was based heavily on [[Niccolò Paganini]]'s [[Caprice No. 5 (Paganini)|Capriccio number 5]].  The ''Crossroads'' duel appeared on the 2002 album ''The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – The Elusive Light And Sound - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-the-elusive-light-and-sound/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.vai.com/album-the-elusive-light-and-sound/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Vai performed "Amazing Grace" in the film [[Dudes (film)|''Dudes'']]. In 1991, Vai performed on the film ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey]]'', as well as on 1992's ''[[Encino Man]],''  ''[[PCU (film)|PCU]]'' (1994), and [[John Carpenter]]'s ''Ghosts of Mars'' (where he played on the tracks "Ghosts of Mars" and "Ghost Poppin'").

In 2010, Vai's record label Favored Nations produced and released the award-winning original motion picture ''Crazy''. An independent film, ''Crazy'' was inspired by the life and music of the guitarist [[Hank Garland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.guitar.com/articles/favored-nations-release-crazy|title =Favored Nations- Crazy|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105170853/https://www.guitar.com/articles/favored-nations-release-crazy|archivedate =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
At the age of thirteen, after having purchased his first guitar and begun taking his first lessons with fellow New York native [[Joe Satriani]], Vai became obsessed with the discipline of practice. Vai's practice routine, consisting of a rigid and structured regiment of ten-to-fifteen hour-a-day practice schedules, became the basis of his work ethic for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Play Like Steve Vai|url = http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995|website = www.guitarplayer.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090709/http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995|archivedate = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his employment by Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed and played very rhythmically complex music, believing that if started slow and perfected, any piece of music could be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tempo Mental - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227045132/http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vai's first solo album, ''Flex-able'', began his career as a solo artist in 1984. During the period of time that the album was recorded, Vai was heavily influenced by his previous tenure in Frank Zappa's band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – Flex-Able - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-flex-able/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151341/http://www.vai.com/album-flex-able/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally not intended for release, ''Flex-able'' expressed a certain creative "quirky" and "angular" freedom in the eclectic nature of Vai's writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Flex-Able - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/flex-able-mw0000196197|website = AllMusic|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160124042303/http://www.allmusic.com/album/flex-able-mw0000196197|archivedate = January 24, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passion and Warfare'', Vai's second solo album, expressed a more mature and evolved "signature" style but retained a certain freedom of unfettered inspiration that would continue to influence Vai's future releases.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In speaking of his inspiration, Vai has said that it comes to him in many forms (even from the flowers pushed up against a fence outside of his studio, which he transcribed and used in the ninth track "Weeping China Doll", from ''The Story of Light'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vai.com &gt; Naked Tracks &gt; Volumes VI &amp; VII (Naked Tracks)|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/nakedtracks/nakedtracks_vol67.html|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151028224906/http://www.vai.com/minisites/nakedtracks/nakedtracks_vol67.html|archivedate = October 28, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While expressing that he is not continuously inspired, Vai uses a concept he calls "musical meditation" to enter a state of consciousness that he calls "The Ultra Zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Part Two - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/part-two/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.vai.com/part-two/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When inside this un-critical frame of mind, Vai is able to achieve inspiration in the form of musical ideas (often in forms of melody or rhythm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Martian Love Secrets - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/martian-love-secrets/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227045543/http://www.vai.com/martian-love-secrets/|archivedate = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these moments of inspiration, Vai created what he calls the "Infinity Shelf", a drive of thousands of snippets of song ideas that he has collected over his entire career.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Opens His Vaults for VaiTunes Series|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/steve-vai-opens-his-vaults-vaitunes-series|website = Guitar World|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105103715/http://www.guitarworld.com/steve-vai-opens-his-vaults-vaitunes-series|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These esoteric principles are taught by Vai during his Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses, among a host of other information.

Vai's playing style utilizes specialized guitar techniques (such as [[tapping#Two-handed tapping|two-handed tapping]], [[alternate picking]], [[legato]], [[hybrid picking]], [[sweep picking]], whammy bar acrobatics, and circular [[finger vibrato|vibrato]]) in his music, as well as a wide range of recording techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 8 Essential Steve Vai Licks|url = http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/8_Essential_Steve_Vai_Licks|website = www.premierguitar.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222023118/http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/8_Essential_Steve_Vai_Licks|archivedate = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guitar Lessons You Can Learn From Steve Vai|url = http://tomhess.net/SteveVaiGuitarLesson.aspx|website = tomhess.net|accessdate = 2015-12-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://tomhess.net/SteveVaiGuitarLesson.aspx|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable contributions==
===Work with Frank Zappa===
As a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed some of Zappa's most rhythmically complex music, using a range of conceptualizations for the notation of rhythmic music. Vai says "While transcribing the material, I was often confronted with situations that led me to reach into the intuitional areas of my imagination to come up with various notational devices and constructions that I had never seen before. I soon discovered that many contemporary composers were then (and are still) using these notations". These concepts can be seen throughout the "Frank Zappa Guitar Book", which were composed of Vai's guitar and drum transcriptions from various Zappa albums. Vai toured with Zappa from 1980 to 1983, performing selections of this technically demanding music with Zappa's band at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tempo Mental - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2016-01-08|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JEM and Universe guitars===
Vai designed the [[Ibanez JEM]] guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, in 1985. In speaking of the development of the guitar, Vai says, "[[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocasters]] had [[Vibrato systems for guitar|whammy bars]]—which were fantastic—but they were very limited, were always going out of tune, and had [[Single coil guitar pickup|single-coil pickups]]. [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Pauls]] had [[humbucker]]s—which gave you that real scream in the bridge position—but no whammy bar, and I didn't like the way they sat. Neither guitar had twenty-four [[fret]]s. So I went to a guitar shop in Hollywood, where I had these elements implemented into a guitar (what would have been considered a [[Superstrat]] at the time). The guitar was designed with a sharper body shape, a large cutaway around the neck, twenty-four frets, a fully floating tremolo system, a specially wired five-way pickup selector switch, and an output jack angled on the side of the body (so that when you step on the cable, it doesn't pull out of your guitar). I knew of course that these features would eventually be taken and used in other guitars, so I did something completely preposterous: I said, 'Put a handle in it!' That way, during videos and photoshoots I could swing the guitar around."&lt;ref name="guitarworld.com"/&gt;

Vai had several custom prototypes of these guitars built (which were used on the ''Eat 'Em and Smile'' tour) by Joe "Jem" Despagni, a custom guitar luthier and friend of Vai's. Due to Vai's highly coveted position in Roth's band, many guitar companies were eager to propose endorsement opportunities. In response to these offers, Vai sent out the specifications of the JEM guitar, detailing that the company that returned the best guitar would be given the endorsement. Dissatisfied with the guitars returned and unwilling to compromise, Vai held out on a guitar endorsement until [[Ibanez]] approached him, sending him an instrument superior to that of the other companies and willing to follow his instructions. After the pre-production prototypes were perfected, the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were unveiled at the [[NAMM Show]] in 1987. Since its original 1987 release, the JEM has become one of the longest-running and most successful signature series guitars in history, with its sister guitar, the [[Ibanez RG]], being the second highest-selling guitar (behind the Fender Stratocaster) on the market.

Another design by Vai was the [[Ibanez Universe]], the first production [[seven-string guitar]], which was released in 1989. The Universe incorporated many of the aspects that made the JEM a unique instrument (24 frets, full floating tremolo, special pickup configuration, angled output jack, and deeper body cutaway), with an added low 'B' string, allowing for new low-range sonic possibilities. Used by Vai on much of ''Passion and Warfare'' and all of Whitesnake's ''Slip of the Tongue'', the Universe was a large stepping stone for the burgeoning [[Nu metal|Nu-metal]] genre (with bands such as [[Korn]] having adopted the instrument and incorporating it into their signature sound).

===Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses===
Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of "Alien Guitar Secrets" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play. Vai details certain concepts he has discovered that have helped him in all areas of his life and career, both in playing guitar/ musically as well as spiritually. Vai accessibly shares these concepts with masterclass participants using examples from his own experiences, delving into the ongoing process of identifying the self-critical nature of one’s own thoughts. Vai explains the techniques and exercises he uses to circumnavigate one’s own insecurities and thoughts of self-doubt, and encourages masterclass participants to use these tools in their own lives. Often embarking on masterclass tours through Europe, South America, and Russia, Vai considers this ongoing series of classes as one of his most important contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = - Alien Guitar Secrets|url = http://www.alienguitarsecrets.com|website = www.alienguitarsecrets.com|accessdate = 2016-01-08|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107105640/http://www.alienguitarsecrets.com/|archivedate = January 7, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Talks about the new DVD and more|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/wtwta/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2016-01-09|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052241/http://www.vai.com/minisites/wtwta/|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eventide H3000 Ultra-Harmonizer===
Guitar effects manufacturer [[Eventide, Inc|Eventide]] approached Vai in the mid-1980s to contribute unique ideas for their H3000 effects unit. Vai suggested many specific concepts, such as diatonic pitch change and multi-voice harmony, that were used in the unit and have since become standard algorithms in guitar effects processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = H3000 Factory {{!}} Eventide|url = https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/pitch-delay-modulation-filtering/h3000-factory|website = www.eventideaudio.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160208063159/https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/pitch-delay-modulation-filtering/h3000-factory|archivedate = February 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DiMarzio pickups===
In 1993, Vai's signature series high-output "Evolution" humbucker pickup set was released by DiMarzio. The Evolution pickups use DiMarzio's patented "Dual-Resonance" design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = United States Patent: 4501185 - Transducer for stringer musical instrument|url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4501185.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4501185&amp;RS=PN/4501185|accessdate = 2016-01-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180501200736/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4501185.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F4501185&amp;RS=PN%2F4501185|archivedate = May 1, 2018|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "EVO 2" humbucker, a lower output model, was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evo 2™ Bridge {{!}} DiMarzio|url = http://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/humbuckers/high-power/evo-2-bridge|website = www.dimarzio.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151212174230/http://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/humbuckers/high-power/evo-2-bridge|archivedate = December 12, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carvin Legacy amplifier===
In 1997, Vai had begun working with the [[Carvin Corporation]] to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 Epic Records release ''[[The Ultra Zone]]''.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Album – The Ultra Zone - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-the-ultra-zone/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225042332/http://www.vai.com/album-the-ultra-zone/|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III being released in 2012.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Legacy Tube Amplifier Series|url = http://www.carvinaudio.com/collections/steve-vai-legacy-tube-amplifier-series|website = Carvin Audio|accessdate = 2015-12-24|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225031635/http://www.carvinaudio.com/collections/steve-vai-legacy-tube-amplifier-series|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touring===
In the 1990s, Vai began touring in European and Asian countries (such as Russia and China) as well as South America, often having been the first American rock act in history to have performed in these areas. In 2014, Vai performed on the Chinese television station BTV's ''Spring Festival Global Gala,'' a program broadcast to over two billion viewers. With the broadcasting of this event on January 26, 2014, Vai became the first rock artist ever broadcast on a Chinese television program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spring Gala Event 2014, China - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/spring-gala-event-2014-china/|website = www.vai.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052629/http://www.vai.com/spring-gala-event-2014-china/|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BTV Spring Festival Global Gala 2014 (TV Movie 2014)|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501138/|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2016-01-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160208063159/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501138/|archivedate = February 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his endorsement with Ibanez, Vai was endorsed by [[Charvel]] guitars, most notably using a green and black San Dimas model. In addition, over the course of his career, Vai has used guitars made by various other companies, including [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], and Gavtone.  

===Guitar rig and signal flow===
Vai's 2016 live guitar rig utilizes his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier (now on its third version), the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL, and an MFC-101 foot controller.

Depending on the location and venue, Vai will use either his Legacy I or Legacy III heads, and Carvin Legacy 4x12 speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses EL-34 tubes by Groove Tubes in his Legacy amps.

Vai uses the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL as the only modulation effects unit in his guitar rig. Generally for live use he utilizes the unit for stereo effects such as [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], and [[phaser (effect)|phase]], with a separate preset for the parameters of each different song in his setlist. The Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller is set up in conjunction with the unit, allowing Vai to switch effects on and off in a fashion reminiscent to that of standard stompboxes.

Vai's pedalboard consists of a [[wah-wah pedal]] (either his Morley Bad Horsie signature pedal, or a [[Dunlop Cry Baby]] 95q), an Ibanez Jemini twin [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal, and [[DigiTech Whammy]] DT pitch shifting pedal. The centerpiece of the pedalboard is the Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller for the Axe-Fx II XL, which, as previously mentioned, controls the effects in a manner similar to switching on and off stompboxes. There are two expression pedals used for the Axe-Fx, one to act as a [[expression pedal|volume pedal]], and the other to control the [[pitch shift|harmonizer]] built into the Axe-Fx unit.

The signal from the guitar (usually one of the main guitars "EVO" or "FLO III") goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes directly into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the signal heads into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the signal heads directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the [[preamplifier|preamp]] stage completely and acting as a slave [[audio power amplifier|power amp]]. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the [[public address system|PA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rig Rundown - Steve Vai|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Steve_Vai|website=Premier Guitar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722172306/http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Steve_Vai|archivedate=July 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Vai began working with the [[Carvin Corporation]] to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 album ''[[The Ultra Zone]]''.&lt;ref name="musicradar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III model being released in 2012.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

'''Sudden unexplained death in childhood''' ('''SUDC''') is the death of a child over the age of 12 months which remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy. There has not been enough research to identify risk factors, common characteristics, or prevention strategies for SUDC.

SUDC is similar in concept to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS). Like SIDS, SUDC is a diagnosis of exclusion, the concrete symptom of both being death. However, SIDS is a diagnosis specifically for infants under the age of 12 months while SUDC is a diagnosis for children 12 months and older. As the causes of both are still unknown, it is not yet possible to determine whether or not they are caused by the same factors.

SUDC is rare, with a reported incidence in the United States of 1.2 deaths per 100,000 children, compared to 54 deaths per 100,000 live births for SIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet - Sudden Unexplained Death In Childhood (SUDC)|url=http://www.sudc.org/Advocacy/MediaEducation/FactSheet.aspx|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUDC deaths have occurred at the following sites:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood|url=http://children.webmd.com/sudden-unexplained-death-in-childhood|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Death at home, history provided: 79%
* [[Infant bed|Crib]] or bassinet: 54%
* Adult bed: 36%

The placed and found positions were as follows:

* Placed [[supine]], side, prone*: 10%, 2%, 3%
* Found [[Prone position|prone]]: 89%
* Found face position: down, side: 10%, 8%
* [[Co-sleeping]], sweating when found: 3%, 1%

&lt;sub&gt;*applies only to youngest children&lt;/sub&gt;

==History==
At the SIDS Alliance national convention in Atlanta, GA in 1999 Dr. Henry Krous gave a presentation titled "Post-Infancy SIDS: Is it on the rise?" This led to the beginning of the San Diego SUDC Research Project. The first definition of SUDC was published in 2005 in Pediatric and Developmental Pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood|url=http://www.sudc.org/AboutUs/History.aspx|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krous|first=Henry F.|author2=Chadwick, Amy E. |author3=Crandall, Laura |author4= Nadeau-Manning, Julie M. |title=Sudden Unexpected Death in Childhood:A Report of 50 Cases|journal=Pediatric and Developmental Pathology|date=14 July 2005|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1007/s10024-005-1155-8|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10024-005-1155-8|accessdate=27 February 2013|pmid=16010494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super Bowl LV''', the 55th [[Super Bowl]] and the 51st [[AFL–NFL merger|modern-era]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2020 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 7, 2021 in [[Tampa, Florida]] (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). This will be the fifth Super Bowl hosted by the Tampa area, with the last one being [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, and the third one held at [[Raymond James Stadium]]. The game will be televised nationally by [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]. It will be the third time that the Super Bowl is in the same state in back to back years with [[Super Bowl LIV]] taking place at [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in Miami Gardens, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/2/4/16897244/2019-super-bowl-53-liii-location-date|title=2019 Super Bowl LIII Location and Date|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host-selection process==
On May 19, 2015, the league announced the five finalists that will compete to host [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 and [[Super Bowl LIV]] in 2020. NFL owners voted on these cities in May 2016, with the first round of voting determining who will host Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding the site for Super Bowl LIV; and in a development not known in advance, a third round of voting was added to select a Super Bowl LV hosting site during the meetings.&lt;ref name="laconfirmed"&gt;Battista, Judy (May 23, 2016). [http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000664354/article/future-super-bowl-sites-las-vegas-among-topics-at-nfl-meeting Future Super Bowl sites, Las Vegas among topics at NFL meeting]. ''NFL.com''. Retrieved May 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; At the NFL owner meetings on May 24, 2016, Atlanta and Miami were awarded Super Bowls [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]] and [[Super Bowl LIV|LIV]] respectively, removing them from the running. Los Angeles was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII, as its stadium would not yet be finished; it was eligible for LIV and LV, opting to bid only on the latter.

The two candidates were as follows:

* [[Raymond James Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009.
* [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]], [[Inglewood, California]]: Los Angeles has hosted the Super Bowl seven times, most recently in 1993 with [[Super Bowl XXVII]]; that game, along with the four prior Super Bowls in the area, were held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] while first two Super Bowls in Los Angeles area were held at [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].

Los Angeles was originally chosen as the host site in a vote on May 24, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Gregg|title=Atlanta, South Florida, L.A. chosen to host Super Bowls|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000664704/article/atlanta-south-florida-la-chosen-to-host-super-bowls|website=NFL.com|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-0525-la-super-bowl-20160524-snap-story.html|title=NFL awards 2021 Super Bowl to Los Angeles|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/live-updates-nfl-announcing-sites-for-super-bowls-53-54-55|title=NFL awards future Super Bowls to Atlanta, South Florida and Los Angeles|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=May 24, 2016|date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to construction delays, authorities announced that the [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] would not be completed until the start of the 2020 NFL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-inglewood-stadium-delay-20170518-story.html|title=Inglewood football stadium's opening will be delayed a year because of record rainfall|last=Farmer|first=Sam|date=May 18, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 18, 2017|last2=Fenno|first2=Nathan|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners voted to move Super Bowl LV to Tampa.

'''''The Bankers of God: The Calvi Affair'''''  ({{lang-it|'''I banchieri di Dio'''}} also known as ''The God's Bankers'') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[drama film]] directed in 2002 by [[Giuseppe Ferrara]].

== Plot ==
The film tells the story of the scandal of [[Banco Ambrosiano]], mainly related to the figure of [[Roberto Calvi]]. The [[Clearstream scandal]] exploded as a case full of intricate affairs involving the [[financial]] world, the [[Holy See|Vatican]], the [[Masonic Lodge]] [[P2 lodge|P2]], the [[Secret service|Italian Secret Service]], the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], the Italian [[Political corruption|politics]], [[the Mafia]] and the [[Banda della Magliana]].

The movie narrates in detail all these connections, trying to reconstruct events and plots. The film ends with the death of Calvi under the [[Blackfriars Bridge]], in [[London]], openly supporting the murder-hypothesis.

== Cast ==
* [[Omero Antonutti]]: [[Roberto Calvi]]
* [[Giancarlo Giannini]]: [[Flavio Carboni]]
* [[Alessandro Gassman]]: [[Francesco Pazienza]]
* [[Rutger Hauer]]: Bishop [[Paul Marcinkus]]
* [[Pamela Villoresi]]: Clara Calvi
* [[Vincenzo Peluso]]: Silvano Vittor
* [[Pier Paolo Capponi]]: Roberto Rosone
* [[Franco Diogene]]: Luigi Mennini
* [[Camillo Milli]]: [[Licio Gelli]]
* [[Franco Olivero]]: [[Michele Sindona]]

== Production ==
The film had a very long and troubled gestation. According to the director Giuseppe Ferrara, he started the project in 1986, soon after''[[The Moro Affair]]'', and wanted [[Gian Maria Volontè]] in the main role of [[Roberto Calvi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calvi, in un film l'Italia dei misteri|url=http://www.centraldocinema.it/Recensioni/16/a/banchieri%20di%20dio.htm|publisher=Central do Cinema|accessdate=24 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420022603/http://www.centraldocinema.it/recensioni/16/a/banchieri%20di%20dio.htm|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a final rejection of the project in 1991 by producers [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori]], and with Ferrara's intention of throwing in the towel, the interest of [[Rai Cinema]] finally made the project possible 15 years later, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giuliano Gallo|title=I misteri del caso Calvi, la mia ossessione|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/febbraio/26/misteri_del_caso_Calvi_mia_co_0_0202264716.shtml|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=26 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great Music Experience''' was a concert starring Japanese and international musicians staged at the eighth century Buddhist temple of [[Tōdai-ji#Cultural references|Tōdai-ji]], in [[Nara, Japan]] in May 1994. The concert, held over three nights (May 20 - May 22) and partly backed by [[UNESCO]], took place in front of the world's largest wooden building, housing the largest Buddha statue in the world.

UNESCO hoped that the event would be the first of seven annual concerts that would take place at some of the world's architectural treasures - the sites it had in mind included the [[Pyramids of Egypt|Pyramids]], China's [[Forbidden City]] and the [[Taj Mahal]] &lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/arts/under-buddha-s-gaze-fellowship-harmony-and-rock-and-roll.html |title=Andrew Pollack, "Under Buddha's Gaze, Fellowship, harmony and Rock-and-Roll", '&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39;, May 21, 1994 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1994-05-21 |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - but nothing came of the idea. A concert earmarked for a Mexican pyramid was called off because of the collapse of the peso.&lt;ref&gt;The Business of Rock, BBC2, August 28, 1996, profiling concert producer Hollingsworth and showing clips of the Tōdai-ji concert.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Tōdai-ji concert brought together Japanese and Western musicians playing music showing the influences of both cultures. The musicians included [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[INXS]]. Dylan played in front of the Tokyo New Philharmonic orchestra, the first time he had played with an orchestra.

The priests of Tōdai-ji agreed to stage the concert only after talks lasting several months with British producer [[Tony Hollingsworth]]. Shinkai Shindō, the head priest, said that Buddhism aimed to make people happy and that the concert would make the religion more appealing to young people.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; UNESCO said that it would not have gone ahead if it was not convinced that the site would be respected in a physical, cultural and religious sense.

UNESCO hoped that a series of concerts would be able to use the appeal of rock musicians to widen the audience for the world's cultural heritage. The Tōdai-ji concert would also help to promote traditional Japanese music.  It was important for traditional musicians to stand on the same stage with Dylan and Bon Jovi.

Hollingsworth said that his aim was to create a "roller coaster of musical cultures", with Japanese and Western artists playing together after a week of rehearsals.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  The final night's concert on May 22 was broadcast to 50 countries but, with a breakdown of equipment, a tape recording of the second night was interwoven with the live concert for some of the time. Two documentaries were also broadcast, showing western artists watching Japanese cultural events and rehearsing with Japanese musicians.

The star of the show turned out to be Dylan who said as soon as he came off-stage that he had not sung so well for 15 years. Dylan opened with ''[[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]'' which ''Q'' magazine &lt;ref&gt;''Q'' magazine, August 1994, p60&lt;/ref&gt; said was "no ordinary version...[he] really opens his lungs and heart and sings, like he's not done for many a year...The only word for it majestic."

Hollingsworth's original idea for the concert was to help overcome western hostility towards Japan caused by the highly successful Japanese economy. The economic bubble, however, had burst by the time the concert took place.

Rights in the event are held by [[Tribute Inspirations|Tribute Inspirations Limited]].

A '''transcontinental flight''' commonly refers to a [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] passenger flight between an airport in the [[West Coast of the United States]] and an airport in the [[East Coast of the United States]].

==History==
The first transcontinental flight across the United States{{clarify|date=March 2013}} was made by [[Calbraith Perry Rodgers]] in an attempt to win the [[Hearst prize]] offered by publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Hearst offered a [[$US]] 50,000 prize to the first aviator to fly coast to coast, in either direction, in less than 30 days from start to finish. Previous attempts by [[James J. Ward]] and [[Henry Atwood]] had been unsuccessful.

Rodgers persuaded [[J. Ogden Armour]], of [[Armour and Company]], to sponsor the flight, and in return he named the plane after Armour's grape soft drink "Vin Fiz". Rodgers left from Sheepshead Bay, New York, on September 17, 1911, at 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm, carrying the first transcontinental mail pouch. He crossed the Rocky Mountains on November 5, 1911, and landed at Tournament Park in Pasadena, California, at 4:04&amp;nbsp;pm, in front of a crowd of 20,000 people. He had missed the prize deadline by 19 days. He was accompanied on the ground by a support crew that repaired and rebuilt the plane after each crash landing. The trip required 70 stops.

On December 10, 1911, he flew to Long Beach, California, and symbolically taxied his plane into the Pacific Ocean.

[[File:Jacco3.JPG|right|thumb|250px|''The Westminster-Pit: A Turn-up between a Dog and [[Jacco Macacco]], the Fighting Monkey'', by [[Henry Thomas Alken]]]]
[[File:Rat Killing Dog.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Billy, the celebrated rat-killing dog, circa 1823. Artist unknown.]]
The '''Westminster Pit''' was a well-known [[blood sport]] arena in nineteenth-century [[London]], [[England]]. It reached a zenith of popularity between 1820 and 1830, and hosted such spectacles as [[dog-fighting]], [[cock-fighting]], [[bear-baiting]], [[badger-baiting]], [[monkey-baiting]], and [[rat-baiting]]. A legal enterprise at the time, the Westminster Pit openly declared its activities,&lt;ref name=Lennox /&gt; ushering notoriety on the district in which it existed. 

The Westminster Pit was located on Duck Lane, Orchard Street (since renamed St. Matthew's Street), and its dimensions were approximately {{convert|20|ft}} by {{convert|18|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Lennox&gt;{{cite book|title=Pictures of sporting life and character, Volume 1|author=W. P. Lennox|page=164|publisher=Hurst|year=1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery was {{convert|3|ft}} above the arena and was capable of containing 200 people – or, by report of [[William Pitt Lennox]], "perhaps a greater number of less refractory persons, for the common run of spectators were so obstreperous and so agitated by various emotions, according to the amount of bets depending, and the various turns of the conflict, that a decent orderly person would feel himself much incommoded by a considerably less number."&lt;ref name=Lennox /&gt;

Prior to the beginning of matches, the stakes would be formalised and the dogs weighed. It was common in the Westminster Pit (and other venues like it) for cheating to occur, often by way of covering a dog with substances – such as acid or pepper – that would deter his opponent from biting him. For this reason, it was compulsory that all combatants be washed in water or milk, and a participant was permitted to lick his opponent's dog as a precaution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The book of the dog|author=B. S. Vesey-FitzGerald|publisher=Nicholson &amp; Watson|year=1948|pages=917–18|chapter=Staffords and Baiting Sports, by Phil Drabble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous dog to perform in the Westminster Pit was a [[Bull and Terrier]] named "Billy", whose fame was his rat-baiting ability. The October 1822 edition of ''[[The Sporting Magazine]]'' describes his feat of killing 100 rats in six minutes and twenty-five seconds: almost six minutes faster than what was wagered. Billy's best time ever is recorded as five minutes, or slightly over "by a very few seconds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London labour and the London poor|author=H. Mayhew|publisher=Griffin, Bohn, and Company|year=1861|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Billy's owner is not consistently documented: some sources refer to a Charles Dew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=96|title= Sporting magazine: or, monthly calendar of the transactions of the turf, the chase and every other diversion interesting to the man of pleasure, enterprize, and spirit, Volume 13|publisher=Rogerson &amp; Tuxford|year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; some to Charley Westropp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Noctes Ambrosianae, Volume 5|editor=R. S. Mackenzie|publisher=Redfield|year=1854|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others to Charley Aistrop.&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;{{cite book|title=Pierce Egan's book of sports, and mirror of life: embracing the turf, the chase, the ring, and the stage: interspersed with original memoirs of sporting men, etc|author=P. Egan|publisher=T.T. Tegg and J. Tegg|year=1832|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierce Egan]] gives Billy's date of death as 23 February 1829.&lt;ref name=Egan /&gt; Later commentators have questioned the legitimacy of Billy's success; in particular, James Rodwell, in his 1858 ''The rat: its history &amp; destructive character: With numerous anecdotes'', stated: "let it be borne in mind, and I assert it on the testimony of living witnesses, that numbers of the rats were dead before the dog commenced, and that the whole had been poisoned with [[Nux vomica (herbalism)|nux-vomica]] before being put into the pit . . . and when he did commence, several were thrown out as dead that were able to crawl away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The rat: its history &amp; destructive character: With numerous anecdotes|author=J. Rodwell|publisher=G. Routledge &amp; Co.|year=1858|pages=233–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, an indictment was lodged against the Westminster Pit by the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. The Society charged the proprietor, John King, with a [[nuisance]], while noting that it was "indebted to corporal Denny, of No. 17, Queen Square, Westminster, and to James Yewen, of No. 6, Horseferry Road, Westminster . . . for obtaining a sufficient number of witnesses, residing on the spot, to prove the case as a nuisance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Voice of humanity: for the communication and discussion of all subjects relative to the conduct of man towards the inferior animal creation, Volume 1|author=Association for Promoting Rational Humanity towards the Animal Creation|publisher=J. Nisbet|year=1830|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was convicted, and, according to ''The Cottager's monthly visitor'', "the prosecution completely suppressed that notorious sink of cruelty and vice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cottager's monthly visitor, Volume 29|publisher=Francis &amp; John Rivington|year=1842|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Festival of Sacred Music''' (Festival des Musiques Sacrées du Monde) is an annual [[music festival]] that is held for a week in [[Fes]], [[Morocco]]. It was first held in 1994.

==Los Angeles==
The '''World Festival of Sacred Music-Los Angeles''' a citywide festival that takes place in Los Angeles once every three years. A sixteen-day celebration of the rich sacred music and movement traditions of the people of Los Angeles, with events produced in diverse venues ranging from the city's major stages to intimate places of worship. The Festival was initiated by [[Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] in 1999 as part of an unprecedented celebration of the human spirit. The Festival is a largely volunteer and grassroots effort based on the intention to utilize the arts festival model to build genuine community cooperation and understanding. Building on the success of the "Americas" festival in 1999 the Los Angeles organizing partners — the UCLA Center for Intercultural Performance, the EarthWays Foundation and the Foundation for World Arts — committed to the creation of a new festival in 2002 and every three years thereafter. In 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2011.

The Aratani World Series is a project of the World Festival of Sacred Music-LA (Foundation of World Arts) in partnership with the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center.] The Aratani World Series is a trailblazing new annual series in Los Angeles featuring world-class artists meeting at the global crossroads of music and dance.

==Olympia==
The '''World Sacred Music Festival''' in [[Olympia, Washington]], USA began in 2005, inspired by the Fez Festival and other sacred music festivals. Sponsored by the non-profit organization Interfaith Works, the World Sacred Music Festival features regional and international artists from a wide variety of ethnicities and spiritual traditions. In 2005 it was a two-day festival and from 2006-2009 it was a single-day festival. In 2010 the festival began presenting quarterly sacred music events.

The '''World War I Victory Medal''' (originally known as the '''Victory Medal''') was a [[United States]] [[World War I]] [[service medal]] designed by [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]].&lt;ref name="WW1VM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15283&amp;CategoryId=4&amp;grp=4&amp;menu=Decorations%20and%20Medals&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0 |title=World War I Victory Medal |publisher=The Institute of Heraldry: Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the ARMY |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Award of a common [[Allies of World War I|allied]] service medal was recommended by an inter-allied committee in March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;The Type I Victory Medal 1914-19. Richard Flory. Orders &amp; Medals Research Society Journal, September 2009, page 145&lt;/ref&gt; Each allied nation would design a 'Victory Medal' for award to their military personnel, all issues having certain common features, including a winged figure of [[Nike (mythology)|victory]] on the obverse and the same ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin.|title=British Battles and Medals.|pages=230-1. Published Spink, London. 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victory Medal was originally intended to be established by an [[Act of Congress|act of Congress]]. The [[Bill (law)|bill]] authorizing the medal never passed, however, thus leaving the military departments to establish it through [[General order|general orders]]. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] published orders in April 1919, and the [[Department of the Navy|Navy]] in June of the same year.&lt;ref name="NVM"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/ww1vic.htm|title= World War I Victory Medal|publisher= Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The Victory Medal was awarded to military personnel for service between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, or with either of the following expeditions:
*[[American Expeditionary Force, North Russia|American Expeditionary Forces in European Russia]] between November 12, 1918, and August 5, 1919.
*[[American Expeditionary Force, Siberia|American Expeditionary Forces Siberia]] between November 23, 1918, and April 1, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/32cfr578.54.htm 578.54 World War I Victory Medal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The front of the bronze medal features a [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victory]] holding a shield and sword on the front. The back of the bronze medal features "The Great War For Civilization" in all capital letters curved along the top of the medal. Curved along the bottom of the back of the medal are six stars, three on either side of the center column of seven staffs wrapped in a cord. The top of the staff has a round ball on top and is winged on the side. The staff is on top of a shield that says "U" on the left side of the staff and "S" on the right side of the staff. On left side of the staff it lists one [[Allies of World War I|World War I Allied]] country per line: [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Serbia]], [[Japan]], [[Montenegro]], [[Russia]], and [[Greece]]. On the right side of the staff the Allied country names read: [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania|Rumania]] (spelled with a U instead of an O as it is spelled now), and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]].

==Devices==
To denote battle participation and campaign credit, the World War I Victory Medal was authorized with a large variety of devices to denote specific accomplishments. In order of seniority, the devices authorized to the World War I Victory Medal were as follows:

===Citation Star===
The [[Citation Star]] to the World War I Victory Medal was authorized by the United States Congress on February 4, 1919.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15241&amp;CategoryId=3&amp;grp=4&amp;menu=Decorations%20and%20Medals&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0 Institute of Heraldry, ''Silver Star''; ''Citation Star''] &lt;/ref&gt; A {{frac|3|16}} inch silver star was authorized to be worn on the ribbon of the Victory Medal for any member of the U.S. Army who had been cited for gallantry in action between 1917 and 1920. In 1932, the Citation Star ("Silver Star") was redesigned and renamed the [[Silver Star Medal]] and, upon application to the [[United States War Department]], any holder of the Silver Star Citation could have it converted to a Silver Star medal.

===Navy Commendation Star===
The [[Navy Commendation Star]] to the World War I Victory Medal was authorized to any person who had been commended by the Secretary of the Navy for performance of duty during the First World War. A {{frac|3|16}} inch silver star was worn on the World War I Victory Medal, identical in appearance to the Army's Citation Star. Unlike the Army's version, however, the Navy Commendation Star could not be upgraded to the Silver Star medal.&lt;ref name="NVM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, NAVPERS 15,790 Rev. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army Battle Clasps===

For general defense service, not involving a specific battle, the "Defensive Sector" Battle Clasp was authorized. The clasp was also awarded for any battle which was not already recognized by its own battle clasp.

The World War I Victory Medal bears the clasps of the battles the U.S. Army participated in across the ribbon. Not all battles are shown on the bar clasps. Only the battles designated as battles that would have bars issued were shown on the medal. The famous [[Battle of Chateau Thierry (1918)|Battle of Chateau Thierry]] to hold the Chateau and the bridge as a joint effort between the US Army and the US Marines against the German machine gunners did not get awarded clasps.

===Navy Battle Clasps===
Navy battle clasps were issued for naval service in support of Army operations and had identical names to the Army battle clasps. There was a slight variation of the criteria dates for the Navy battle clasps, as listed below.&lt;ref name="NVM"/&gt;

The Defensive Sector Clasp was also authorized for Navy personnel who had participated in naval combat but were not authorized a particular battle clasp.[[File:'Defensive Sector' clasp.jpg|right|thumb|Defensive Sector Clasp on Ribbon]]

===Navy Operational Clasps===
For sea-related war duty, the Navy issued the following [[Campaign clasp|operational clasps]], which were worn on the World War I Victory Medal and inscribed with the name of the duty type which had been performed:&lt;ref name="NVM"/&gt;

Unlike the army, the navy only allowed one clasp of any type to be worn on the ribbon.  Members of the marine or medical corps who served in France but was not eligible for a battle clasp would receive a bronze [[Maltese cross]] on their ribbons.&lt;ref name="NVM"/&gt;

===Army Service Clasps===
For non-combat service with the army during the First World War, the following [[Campaign clasp|service clasps]] were authorized to be worn with the World War I Victory Medal. Each service claps was inscribed with a country or region name where support service was performed. The U.S. Army issued the following service clasps:&lt;ref name="WW1VM"/&gt;

===Campaign Stars===
Since battle and service clasps could only be worn on the full-sized World War I Victory Medal, 3/16 inch bronze [[service stars]] were authorized for wear on the award ribbon. This was the common method of campaign and battle display when wearing the World War I Victory Medal as a ribbon on a military uniform.[[File:Maltese Cross device.jpg|right|thumb|Maltese Cross device on U.S. WWI Victory Medal]]

===Maltese Cross===
Medals issued to [[U.S. Marines]] were issued with a [[Maltese cross]] device affixed to the ribbon.

==Distribution==
The World War I Victory Medals were awarded after the end of World War I, so they were mailed to the servicemen instead of awarded in person. For example, the boxes containing the Victory Medals for [[United States Army]] World War I veterans were mailed out by the depot officer at the General Supply Depot, U.S. Army, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in April 1921. An outer light brown box with an address label glued to it and its postage area marked "OFFICIAL BUSINESS, Penalty for private use $300" contained an inner white box stamped with the bars the serviceman was supposed to receive on his medal. The inner white box contained the medal, which was wrapped in [[tissue paper]].&lt;br&gt;

Only after filling out the application form A.G.O. No. 740 with the help of an authorized officer could it be officially forwarded to the Philadelphia Quartermaster Intermediate Depot for the veteran then to receive his medal by mail. The Army started issuing Victory Medals on June 21, 1920, not April 1921 as listed above. The Navy had a late start due to production issues and started in August 1920.&lt;ref&gt;World War I, Victory Medals, By James P Michels Jr, Createspace/Amazon.com, 2014, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change==
In 1945, the "Victory Ribbon" was created as an award for those who served in [[World War II]]. Between 1945 and 1947, the World War I award continued to be known by its original name, the "Victory Medal", and the World War II award was known as the "Victory Ribbon". In 1947, the Victory Ribbon became a full-sized medal as the [[World War II Victory Medal]], at which point the World War I Victory Medal adopted its current name. However, some military records as late as the 1950s continued to annotate the World War I decoration by its previous name, and the medal was often referred to as "Victory Medal (WWI)".

==An international award==
Not only did the United States issue a Victory Medal, but so did a significant number of Allied and associated countries involved in the conflict against the Dual Alliance between Austria and Germany.

The proposition of such a common award was first made by French Maréchal [[Ferdinand Foch]] who was supreme commander of the Allied Forces during the First World War. Each medal in bronze has the same diameter (36&amp;nbsp;mm) and ribbon (double rainbow), but with a national design representing a winged victory.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=footnote1&gt;Except Japan and Siam where the concept of a winged victory was not culturally relevant.

'''Hajji Tarkhan'''  ({{lang-tt|Хаҗітархан|Xacitarxan}}), also known as '''Hashtar Khan''' /  '''Actarxan''' ({{lang-tt|ʌɕtʌrˈxan}}) or '''Astrakhan''',&lt;ref&gt;in Persian sources: حاجی‌ترخان Haji-Tarkhan; Russian sources: Астрахань Astrakhan'&lt;/ref&gt; was a medieval city at the right bank of [[Volga]], situated approximately 12&amp;nbsp;km north of the modern city of [[Astrakhan]]. The first mention of the town was recorded in 1333. In the 13th and 14th centuries it was one of the main trade and political centres of the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1395 the city was sacked by [[Timur]]. Astrakhan was rebuilt afterwards and became the capital of the [[Khanate of Astrakhan]] in 1459. In 1547 the city was seized by the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Sahib Giray]]. In 1556 Astrakhan was besieged and burned {{citation needed|date=June 2018}} by [[Ivan the Terrible]].

[[Image:LocationÅland.svg|thumb|Location of Åland Islands]]
[[Image:Åland map with borders.svg|thumb|Åland Islands &lt;small&gt;([[Media:Aland26571.png|larger map]])&lt;/small&gt;]]
The '''Åland Islands dispute''' was one of the first issues put up for arbitration by the [[League of Nations]] on its formation. The [[Åland Islands]]' population's demand for [[self-determination]] was not met and [[sovereignty]] over the islands was retained by [[Finland]], but international guarantees were given&lt;!-- to the population - nope, international guarantees are given between states! --&gt; to allow the population to pursue its own culture, relieving the threat of forced [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] by Finnish culture as perceived by the islanders.

==Background==
Prior to 1809, the [[Åland Islands]] were located within the boundaries of the Swedish realm. However, in the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] on September 17, 1809, Sweden had to give up control of the islands, along with Finland, to [[Imperial Russia]]. The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] became an autonomous entity, including the Åland Islands, within the Russian Empire. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] of April 18, 1856, which ended the [[Crimean War]], Britain required Russia to withhold the construction of any new [[fortification]]s on the islands. This stipulation was obeyed, despite unsuccessful attempts to change the status of the [[demilitarised]] islands in 1908. However, in 1914, at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Russian government turned the islands into a [[submarine base]] for the use of [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian submarines during the war.

In December 1917, fearing the effects of the Russian [[October Revolution]], the [[Finnish parliament]] proclaimed that [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland was now a sovereign state]], calling on the principles of [[self-determination|national self-determination]]. The very same autumn, Ålanders had organized for their own self-determination, fearing what they saw as excessive expressions of [[Fennoman|pro-Finnishness]] and anti-Swedishness in Finland. By this time, well above 90% of the islands' inhabitants considered themselves Swedish, stationed military personnel excluded, in contrast to [[Mainland Finland]], where less than 15% were [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking. Unlike in Åland, in the previous twenty years social tensions had also worsened considerably in Finland. The Ålanders' answer was a wish for secession from the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Russian Empire]], to which they felt little affiliation, and a request for annexation by Sweden.

Sweden's power elite was, however, preoccupied with Sweden's [[democratization]] that was recently commenced by a [[conservatism|conservative]] cabinet in order to quench the [[revolutionary]] currents among Swedish workers. To that effect, Sweden got a new [[Liberalism|liberal]] prime minister, and for the first time [[socialist]]s in the cabinet. Although [[nationalist activism|activist]] circles close to the royal court were enthusiastic towards the Ålanders' plea for Swedish support, the activists had lost their political influence in 1916, and ultimately also the ear of King [[Gustav V of Sweden|Gustav V]]. Representatives for the Ålanders were fed sympathetic words and empty phrases. Neither the Liberals nor the Socialists leading Sweden through the last year of World War I were the slightest bit interested in anything that had to do with activist adventurist policies; the king fully agreed with his cabinet on this point.

The [[Finnish Civil War]] starting in January 1918, initially did not change this situation. Sweden's [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] had the year before purged the revolutionaries from the party, and were sympathetic but unsupportive of the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|socialist republic]] in Finland. Their coalition partners in the cabinet, the Liberals, were rather inclined to sympathize with the White government in Finland, but they were traditionally [[neutralist]] and additionally rather suspicious of their Finnish counterparts. Those non-socialists in Finland who were not ardent [[fennoman]]s seemed to the Swedish Liberals more like the Conservatives they were used to viewing as their political enemies. 

Exaggerated reports of civilian apprehension concerning the approaching combatants of the civil war resulted, however, in the dispatch of a minor Swedish naval expedition, tasked with evacuating civilians who wished it. It turned out that no civilians wished evacuation, but the naval commander proudly brokered an end to hostilities and remained on the Main Island as a [[peace-keeping]] force. It is evident that the [[chain of command]] was considerably more inclined towards activism than the Socialist [[Minister for Defence (Sweden)|Minister of Defence]], who in turn was persuaded to be considerably more supportive of intervention than his cabinet colleagues. It is less clear to what degree other cabinet members were briefed in between cabinet meetings, or even whether they had a say. Stockholm did not perceive anything of moment, and anything that happened was unintended by the government and well-intentioned by the naval officer in charge.&lt;ref&gt;The recognition of states: law and practice in debate and evolution, Thomas D. Grant, illustrated, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96350-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-96350-7}}, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The White government in [[Vaasa]] saw it differently. They were bitter over the lack of support from Sweden against the socialist rebels, and well-informed about activist desires to re-acquire the Åland Islands, since many of the Swedish military officers who volunteered to come to White Finland's support were close to the leading activists. The White government was alarmed by the arrival of Swedish troops on Finnish soil, and suspicious of Sweden's Socialist Minister of Defence. A [[Germany|German]] naval force was urgently asked to remove the Swedish troops from Åland.

==Political crisis==
The leading Swedish Social Democrat, [[Hjalmar Branting]], opted for dealing with the issue purely from the standpoint of [[international law]]. The cabinet of Finland viewed this position as a purely tactical one, and a dispute over whether the islands rightfully belonged to Sweden or Finland ensued. In 1921, again despite the fact that 90 percent of the islands' population was Swedish—and that they expressed an almost unanimous desire of being incorporated into Sweden—the League of Nations determined that the Åland Islands should remain under Finnish sovereignty, which is often attributed to the skill of its Minister to Paris, [[Carl Enckell]], who also was envoy to the League of Nations in charge of Finland's presentation of the Åland question. 

Merit is also attributed to Finland's Envoy to Japan, professor [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G.J. Ramstedt]], who managed to point out to the Japanese delegation in the League of Nations that the Åland Islands are in fact a continuous archipelago that joins it with Finland, and furthermore, that deep sea waters separate them from Sweden. Japan's own interests in controlling Pacific islands would be aided by such a precedent, and it consequently gave important support to Finland.&lt;ref&gt;G.J.Ramstedt: Lähettiläänä Nipponissa, pages 57.-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The interrelated difficulties in the relations between Sweden and Finland were resolved by the mid-1930s, when the weakened authority of the League of Nations signalled a much harsher international mood. The fear of the Åland Islands' falling under the control of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Soviet Union]] was very real, and that is why Sweden's Foreign Minister Sandler proposed retaining the status of the islands despite [[Swedish neutrality|Sweden's longstanding policy of neutrality]]. Detailed defensive plans were made; however, in the end, Sweden opted not to participate in the defence of the islands.

==Autonomy of Åland Islands==

In 1920, Finland granted wide-reaching cultural and political autonomy to the Åland Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin W. Mikesell and Alexander B. Murphy, 1991 Dec, "A Framework for Comparative Study of Minority-Group Aspirations", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', Vol. 81, No. 4 pg 597&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations considered these measures as satisfying demands to protect the Swedish language and culture there.

During the course of the 20th century, Finnish sovereignty had been perceived as benevolent, and even beneficial, by increasing numbers of the islanders. Together with disappointment over insufficient support from Sweden in the League of Nations, Swedish disrespect for Åland's demilitarized status in the 1930s, and to some degree a feeling of shared destiny with Finland during and after World War II, this has resulted in a changed perception of Åland's relation to Finland: from "a Swedish province in Finnish possession" to "an autonomous part of Finland".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GAQ8vIJE8_QC&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=The%20recognition%20of%20states%3A%20law%20and%20practice%20in%20debate%20and%20evolution&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The recognition of states: law and practice in debate and evolution]'', Thomas D.
