The '''1959 Escuminac disaster''' (also to referred to as the '''Escuminac hurricane''') was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in [[New Brunswick]] in 100&amp;nbsp;years. It occurred due to the [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] remnants of an [[Atlantic hurricane]]. The storm was the third [[tropical cyclone]] and first hurricane of the [[1959 Atlantic hurricane season]], and developed from a tropical wave in the central [[Gulf of Mexico]] on June&amp;nbsp;18. It headed rapidly northeastward and struck [[Florida]] later that day. Shortly after entering the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June&amp;nbsp;18. By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. The remnants struck [[Atlantic Canada]], once in [[Nova Scotia]] and again in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] before dissipating on June&amp;nbsp;21.

In its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7&amp;nbsp;million (1959&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45&amp;nbsp;boats were in the [[Northumberland Strait]] between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49&amp;nbsp;ft (15&amp;nbsp;m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22&amp;nbsp;fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35&amp;nbsp;fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959&amp;nbsp;[[Canadian dollar|CAD]], $781,000 1959&amp;nbsp;USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.

==Early history==
[[Image:Escuminac 1959 rainfall.gif|thumb|right|Storm rainfall in the southeastern United States]]
On June&amp;nbsp;15, a [[tropical wave]] with associated [[Atmospheric instability|instability]] was observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June&amp;nbsp;16, and the next day developed a weak [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]] at the same time that [[1959 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Beulah|Tropical Storm Beulah]] was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast,&lt;ref name="mwr"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Monthly Weather Review|publisher=The Weather Bureau|author=Gordon E. Dunn|date=December 1959|accessdate=2013-03-02|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/mwr_pdf/1959.pdf|title=The Hurricane Season of 1959|format=PDF|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1959)087&lt;0441:thso&gt;2.0.co;2|volume=87|issue=12|pages=441–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a tropical depression by June&amp;nbsp;18 at 0000&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Tampa Bay]] and exiting near [[Cape Canaveral]].&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt;

As the depression struck western Florida, it produced {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal tides,&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; which damaged docks and caused beach erosion.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Storm Data|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena|volume=1|number=6|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|date=June 1959|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS-BEBB2C1C-AC55-4BD0-A9EC-274A55D46B0C.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-03-07}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind gusts near [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] reached about 49&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h). After previously wet conditions, the system dropped heavy rainfall across the state,&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; unofficially reaching {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} in some areas and causing flooding. Along the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], flooding damaged citrus crops, and statewide some roads were damaged due to flooding.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt; When the storm was first forming in the Gulf of Mexico, it spawned a tornado in Miami that lasted for over 20&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; The [[National Climatic Data Center]] considered it the worst tornado in the city since [[1925 Miami tornado|one in 1925]], and the overall path was about {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}}. A total of 77&amp;nbsp;people were injured due to the tornado, mostly due to cuts from broken glass,&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt; and damage from it was estimated at $1.5&amp;nbsp;million. Another tornado was reported north of [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], although it affected a sparsely populated area; total damage statewide totaled $1,656,000.&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt;

==Storm approach to Canada==
Late on June&amp;nbsp;18, it is estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} and that day the [[National Hurricane Center|Miami Hurricane Center]] issued its last advisory, warning ships of the potential for future strengthening.&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; The storm moved rapidly to the northeast, passing halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina early on June&amp;nbsp;19.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} At 0250&amp;nbsp;UTC that day, a ship reported a falling [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|993|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} with west-southwesterly winds of {{convert|92|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Although it was associated with a diffused [[Weather front|frontal zone]], the storm maintained a [[tropical cyclone#mechanics|warm core]] and initially remained largely tropical.&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; At 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC on June&amp;nbsp;19, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane about halfway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia, with a pressure of {{convert|974|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. By six hours later, it became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]], although the former hurricane intensified further to peak winds of 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h). On June&amp;nbsp;20, the storm slowed and turned sharply to the northwest.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} It weakened slightly before moving ashore near [[Canso, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="ec"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2010-09-14|title=1959-NN-1|accessdate=2013-03-03|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=331B21D2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossing the island, it struck [[Prince Edward Island]] before turning sharply to the east and crossing Nova Scotia again. By late on June&amp;nbsp;20, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to the east-northeast. The extratropical storm moved over southeastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and dissipated on June&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;

Before the storm reached Atlantic Canada, the [[Meteorological Service of Canada|Meteorological Branch]] of the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] provided notices for the advancing storm.&lt;ref name="mwr"/&gt; On the day of the storm, the forecast from the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat.&lt;ref name="gnb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicole Lang|publisher=Government of New Brunswick|title=The Escuminac Disaster|accessdate=2013-03-04|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0131/PDF/H/HW/EscuminacDisaster.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail.&lt;ref name="lpe"/&gt; As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the [[Northumberland Strait]] between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;

==Impact and aftermath==
[[File:Escuminac Disaster Monument.JPG|right|thumb|Escuminac Disaster Memorial at [[Escuminac, New Brunswick]] for the victims of the storm]]
Along the coast of New Brunswick, the storm produced 49&amp;nbsp;ft (15&amp;nbsp;m) waves that destroyed several boats, including 22 over open waters between [[Point Escuminac]] and [[Richibucto]]. Two bodies washed ashore in the latter city, and eleven bodies were eventually discovered. About one-third of the salmon boats in [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] were destroyed.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt; Across New Brunswick, the storm disrupted communications near the coast. Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate.&lt;ref name="re"&gt;{{cite news|agency=United Press International|date=1959-06-21|title=11 Perish in Wind, Rain Storm|accessdate=2013-03-05|newspaper=The Reading Eagle|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K7leAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j2QNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6994,1359997&amp;dq=new+brunswick+storm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region, peaking at 75&amp;nbsp;mph (120&amp;nbsp;km/h), and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.29&amp;nbsp;in (109&amp;nbsp;mm) in Nova Scotia. There, many lobster cages were destroyed, and boats were removed from their moorings. In Prince Edward Island, up to 50% of [[lobster trap]]s were destroyed or missing, including 5,000&amp;nbsp;destroyed traps near [[Souris, Prince Edward Island|Souris]]. As with New Brunswick, several boats were destroyed or washed ashore, and damage in the province was estimated at $750,000 (1959&amp;nbsp;CAD, $781,000 1959&amp;nbsp;USD).&lt;!--http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=750&amp;C1=CAD&amp;C2=USD&amp;DD=15&amp;MM=06&amp;YYYY=1959&amp;B=1&amp;P=&amp;I=1&amp;btnOK=Go%21--&gt; A total of 35&amp;nbsp;people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, mostly fishermen.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt; As a result, the Escuminac Disaster, as it came to be known, became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="gnb"/&gt; The [[Department of Fisheries (New Brunswick)|Minister of Fisheries]] considered the event as "the worst disaster to hit a Canadian fishing fleet in about 100&amp;nbsp;years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Canada Press|date=1959-07-18|title=$50,000 for Fishermen's Disaster Fund|newspaper=The Sun|accessdate=2013-03-05|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sZRlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G4oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2324,3693569&amp;dq=new+brunswick+storm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days after the storm, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] operated search and rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The [[Canadian Red Cross]] set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims.&lt;ref name="lpe"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Lunenburg Progress Enterprise |date=1959-06-24 |title=32 Fishermen Are Missing When Gales Hit New Brunswick Coast |accessdate=2013-03-05 |url=http://www.lostatsea.ca/escumina.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425030301/http://www.lostatsea.ca/escumina.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to storm fatalities, 24&amp;nbsp;adults became widows, and 83&amp;nbsp;children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as [[Pope John XXIII]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II]], the latter who was on a tour of the country at the time.&lt;ref name="gnb"/&gt;

In memory of the storm victims, artist [[Claude Roussel]] created a wood sculpture entitled "Les Pêcheurs – The Fishermen", which won first prize at [[New Brunswick Museum]] in 1962. Later, residents near Escuminac raised money to turn the work into a stone monument, which was dedicated on June&amp;nbsp;19, 1969. It was nearly 7&amp;nbsp;ft (2.3&amp;nbsp;m) in height, weighed about 10,000&amp;nbsp;lbs (5&amp;nbsp;tonnes), and depicted a group of fishermen working together, with the names of the deceased on a bronze plaque. In 2001, the government of New Brunswick declared the Escuminac Disaster Monument as a provincial historical site.&lt;ref name="gnb"/&gt;

[[Image:Unioncarbide.jpg|thumb|1987 [[lithium]] coin cell battery holder]]

A '''battery holder''' is one or more compartments or chambers for holding a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. For dry cells, the holder must also make electrical contact with the battery terminals. For wet cells, cables are often connected to the [[battery terminals]], as is found in automobiles or emergency lighting equipment.

A battery holder is either a plastic case with the shape of the housing moulded as a compartment or compartments that accepts a battery or batteries, or a separate plastic holder that is mounted with screws, eyelets, glue, double-sided tape, or other means. Battery holders may have a lid to retain and protect the batteries or may be sealed to prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage. Coiled spring wire or flat tabs that press against the battery terminals are the two most common methods of making the electrical connection inside a holder. External connections on battery holders are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, solder lugs, or wire leads.

Where the battery is expected to last over the life of the product, no holder is necessary, and a tab welded to the battery terminals can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Patent1439429.jpg|thumb|1922 [[Patent]] for battery holder with spring arms clips]] --&gt;
[[Image:AABatteriesEveready.jpg|thumb|Battery holders with pressure contacts]]

In the late 1800s patents were issued for consumer products like [[flashlight]]s; patent no. 617592 dated March 1898 is for an early metal flashlight that accepted [[D battery|D batteries.]]

Some early 1900s battery holders were often no more than a cardboard box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, battery holders used twin metal clips (like fuse holders) to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two spring arm clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.

The introduction of [[polypropylene]] in the 1950s and miniature batteries by [[Energizer Holdings|Eveready]] allowed for the use of small plastic battery holders. These are still common in toys, decorations, and lighted or blinking items. In 1957, electric wrist [[watch]]es gained popularity with the public.

Battery holders developed in parallel with batteries over time; as battery package sizes shrunk so did the holders. In the 1980s, the first circuit board mounting lithium coin cell battery holders appeared in the form of patent no. 4487820 by the battery holder manufacturer MPD.

The electronics industry now uses many surface mounted [[lithium]] battery holders or sockets. [[Lithium battery|CR2/3A, CR1/2AA and CR123A batteries]] began in camera applications, but expanded into new markets like alarm systems, hand held computers, and [[Keyfob|keyfobs.]]

== Design considerations ==
[[Image:AAbatteryholder.jpg|thumb|[[Energizer Holdings|Energizer batteries]] in twin cell holder with battery hold down strap]]

Design of the battery holder requires knowledge of how and where the larger product will be used. Human factors to be considered include ease of battery exchange, age range and physical condition of the intended user. These elements must be taken into account for a design to be successful and are part of the [[Product design|design process]]. A designer must select between a battery holder molded into the product case or made as a separate part. For many products regulations and product safety standards affect the battery holder selection.

Most current battery holders are made with [[polypropylene]] or [[nylon]] bodies rated for 80-100&amp;nbsp;°C. Lithium coin cell holders are made with high temperature PBT, nylon or LCP bodies because they normally are [[circuit board]] mounted and require [[wave soldering]] at 180-240&amp;nbsp;°C or [[reflow soldering]] at 260-300&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Contact resistance|Battery contacts]] are the most important part of the design and require serious consideration. Since batteries are nickel-plated, it is recommended the contacts be [[Electroless nickel plating|nickel-plated]] to prevent [[galvanic corrosion]]&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Contacts, Principles and Applications by Paul Slade page 89&lt;/ref&gt; between dissimilar metals. Battery contacts&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Contacts, Principles and Applications by Paul Slade page 155&lt;/ref&gt; may be fixed contacts, flexible contacts, or some combination of the two.

Fixed contacts&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Contacts, Principles and Applications by Paul Slade,page 751&lt;/ref&gt; are inexpensive but prone to loss of [[Electrical connector#Power connectors|electrical connection.]] Combination of fixed and flexible contacts are a better solution, but this is subject to an open circuit upon movement in the direction away from the fixed position; the spring contact compresses and allows the battery to move away from the fixed contact. A flexible contact allows for slight expansion of the cell on discharge, as internal chemicals increase in volume.  Flexible contacts with multiple fingers touching the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] allow for movement in multiple directions without losing electrical connection.

Features like polarity, or reverse battery, protection can be part of the design. The contact for the anode side can be recessed behind plastic and receive a battery nub common on Alkaline batteries. Another method is a plastic channel to receive a battery post or terminal. In July 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced its plans to partner with several other companies,&lt;ref&gt;Instaload Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; including Duracell and MPD, to utilize its patent no. 2007/0275299 A1, which is a new kind of polarity protection in which a battery can be inserted into a battery holder in either orientation and still operate properly. Although other technologies have existed which could do this, they were expensive or caused a passive energy drain on the battery, whereas this solution is purely mechanical and affordable to produce.

Battery types such as the 9-volt have snap-on contacts.

Battery holders for [[zinc-air battery|zinc-air batteries]] must not be completely air-tight since approximately 1 litre of air is required per ampere-hour of discharge per cell. The battery holder may include a valve integrated with the device power switch to allow air to be admitted when the device is switched on.&lt;ref&gt;Duracell "Zinc Air Tech Bulletin.pdf"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Frank''' (March 7, 1902 &amp;ndash; November 15, 1964) was an American forester and wilderness activist.  He is known for being one of the eight founding members of  [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]].

Frank was born in [[New York City]].  He studied at [[Cornell University]], receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees. In 1927, he joined the [[United States Forest Service]] in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. He worked for the Forest Service for more than 30 years, usually in positions in the Forest Service headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]].  He often worked with other agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority or committees of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on matters related to forestry and water.

In 1960, he became a professor of watershed management at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.

Aside from being a long-time member of The Wilderness Society, he was active in many other conservation-oriented organizations including the [[Society of American Foresters]], the [[Soil Conservation Society of America]], the [[National Audubon Society]], and the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].  He was a leader in organizing the Rock Creek Watershed Association which worked to restore and preserve the area around [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] in Washington, D.C. and [[Maryland]].  He participated with Justice [[William O. Douglas]] in the effort that lead to the creation of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park]].  He was honored for his work in this region with the naming of [[Lake Bernard Frank]] in [[Derwood, Maryland|Derwood]], Maryland.

Franks wrote numerous articles and two books, including 1950's ''Water, Land, and People'' and 1955's ''Our National Forests''.

The family seat is [[Birr Castle]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland, and the town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] was called Parsonstown, after the family, from 1620 to 1899.

With his three brothers, Parsons was educated at home in Ireland by private tutors&lt;ref name="Rosse1968" /&gt; (including [[John Purser (mathematician)|John Purser]]), all of whom were well versed in the sciences and also acted as practical assistants to the Earl in his astronomical work. One of them later became, as [[Sir Robert Ball]], [[Astronomer Royal for Ireland]]. Parsons then read mathematics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], graduating from the latter in 1877 with a first-class honours degree.&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|id=PRSS873CA|name=Parsons, the Hon. Charles Algernon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Newcastle Upon Tyne|Newcastle]]-based engineering firm of [[Armstrong Whitworth|W.G. Armstrong]] as an apprentice, an unusual step for the son of an earl; then moved to [[Kitson &amp; Co.|Kitsons]] in Leeds where he worked on rocket-powered [[torpedo]]es; and then in 1884 moved to [[Clarke Chapman|Clarke, Chapman and Co.]], ship engine manufacturers near Newcastle, where he was head of their electrical equipment development. He developed a turbine engine there in 1884 and immediately utilized the new engine to drive an electrical generator, which he also designed. Parsons' [[steam turbine]] made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionised marine transport and naval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |title=Charles Parsons (1854 – 1931) |accessdate=2005-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |archivedate=10 January 2008 |df=dmy-all|work=Profiles of Scientists from Irish Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parson's Compound Steam Turbine - 1887 - Project Gutenberg eText 17167.png|thumb|left|First compound steam turbine, built by Parsons in 1887]]

Another type of steam turbine at the time, invented by [[Gustaf de Laval]], was an impulse design that subjected the mechanism to huge centrifugal forces and so had limited output due to the weakness of the materials available.  Parsons explained that his appreciation of the scaling issue led to his 1884 breakthrough on the compound steam turbine in his 1911 [[Rede Lecture]]:

''"It seemed to me that moderate surface velocities and speeds of rotation were essential if the turbine motor was to receive general acceptance as a prime mover. I therefore decided to split up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series, so that the velocity of the steam nowhere should be great...I was also anxious to avoid the well-known cutting action on metal of steam at high velocity."''&lt;ref name=smil &gt;{{cite book|page= 62| title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867-1914 and Their Lasting Impact|first= Vaclav |last=Smil|isbn= 0-19-516874-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Transformer+coltman+1988|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, he founded [[C. A. Parsons and Company|C.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Parsons and Company]] in Newcastle to produce [[turbo generator]]s to his design.&lt;ref name=birr/&gt; In the same year he set up the [[Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company]] (DisCO). In 1890, DisCo opened [[Forth Banks Power Station]], the first power station in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators.&lt;ref name="Parsons1939"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Robert Hodson |title=The Early Days of the Power Station Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiIZAAAAIAAJ|year=1939|publisher=Universiy Press|location=Cambridge|page=171|chapter=Ch. X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1894 he regained certain patent rights from [[Clarke Chapman]]. Although his first turbine was only 1.6% efficient and generated a mere 7.5 kilowatts, rapid incremental improvements in a few years led to his first megawatt turbine built in 1899 for a generating plant at [[Elberfeld, Germany]].&lt;ref name=smil/&gt;

Parsons was also interested in marine applications and founded the [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company]] in Newcastle.  Famously, in June 1897, his turbine-powered [[yacht]], ''[[Turbinia]]'', was exhibited moving at speed at [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] [[Fleet Review]] off [[Portsmouth]], to demonstrate the great potential of the new technology. The ''Turbinia'' moved at {{Convert|34|knot|abbr=on}}. The fastest Royal Navy ships using other technologies reached {{Convert|27|knot|abbr=on}}. Part of the speed improvement was attributable to the slender hull of the ''Turbinia''.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Charles Algernon Parsons |last=Robertson |first=Paul |work=[[Cambridge University]] : 125 Years of Engineering Excellence |date=n.d. |access-date=6 September 2018 |url= http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/noflash/1875-1900/parsons2.html   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two years, the destroyers [[Viper class destroyer|HMS ''Viper'']] and {{HMS|Cobra|1899|2}} were launched with Parsons' turbines, soon followed by the first turbine powered passenger ship, [[Clyde steamer]] [[TS King Edward|TS ''King Edward'']] in 1901; the first turbine transatlantic liners [[RMS Victorian|RMS ''Victorian'']] and [[RMS Virginian|''Virginian'']] in 1905, and the first turbine powered battleship, {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906, all of which were driven by Parsons' turbine engines.&lt;ref name=birr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birrcastle.com/inventionsAndExperiments.asp |title=Chronology of Charles Parsons |publisher=Birr Castle Scientific and Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2009-01-03 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130458/http://www.birrcastle.com/inventionsAndExperiments.asp |archivedate=25 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, ''Turbinia'' is housed in a purpose-built gallery at the [[Discovery Museum]], Newcastle.&lt;ref name="DiscMus"&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728054722/http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discovery/collections.html|title=Collections at Discovery Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June 1898 and received their [[Rumford Medal]] in 1902, their [[Copley Medal]] in 1928 and delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007 |publisher=The Royal Society |accessdate=15 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324095152/http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the president of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] for 1916–1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofbritisha20adva#page/n83/mode/2up|title=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|chapter=President's Address|first=Charles A.|last=Parsons|date=1919|location= London |publisher= John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1924 at Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parsons, C.

The Parsons turbine company survives in the [[Heaton, Newcastle|Heaton]] area of Newcastle and is now part of [[Siemens]], a [[Germany|German]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. Sometimes referred to as Siemens Parsons, the company recently completed a major [[redevelopment]] programme, reducing the size of its site by around three quarters and installing the latest [[manufacturing]] technology. In 1925 Charles Parsons acquired the Grubb Telescope Company and renamed it [[Grubb Parsons]]. That company survived in the Newcastle area until 1985.

Parsons was also known for inventing the [[Auxetophone]], an early [[compressed air gramophone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reiss | first = Eric | title = The compleat talking machine: a collector's guide to antique phonographs | publisher = Sonoran Pub | location = Chandler, Ariz | year = 2007 | isbn = 1886606226 | page = 217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons' ancestral home at [[Birr Castle]] in Ireland houses a museum detailing the contribution the Parsons family have made to the fields of science and engineering, with part of the museum given over to marine engineering work of Charles Parsons.

== Personal life and death ==

In 1883 Parsons married Katharine Bethell, the daughter of William F. Bethell. They had two children: [[Rachel Parsons (engineer)|Rachel Mary Parsons]] (b. 1885), and Algernon George Parsons (b. 1886), who was killed in action during World War I in 1918, aged 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katherine Bethell|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1513.htm|publisher=The Peerage|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Algernon Parsons died on 11 February 1931, on board the steamship ''[[SS Duchess of Richmond (1928)|Duchess of Richmond]]'' while on a cruise with his wife. The cause of death was given as [[Peripheral neuropathy|neuritis]].&lt;ref name="Times45746"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times

'''Co-firing''' is the [[combustion]] of two (or more) different types of materials at the same time. One of the advantages of co-firing is that an existing plant can be used to burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For example, [[biomass]] is sometimes co-fired in existing [[coal]] plants instead of new biomass plants. Another example is that biomass primary fuel fractions can be cofired with waste-derived fuels in biomass plants leading to an environmentally friendly destruction of waste fractions and cost-effective heat and power production. Co-firing can also be used to improve the combustion of fuels with low energy content. For example, [[landfill gas]] contains a large amount of [[carbon dioxide]], which is non-combustible. If the [[landfill gas]] is burned without removing the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or emissions of pollutants may increase. Co-firing it with [[natural gas]] increases the [[heat content]] of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance. As long as the [[electricity]] or [[heat]] produced with the [[biomass]] and [[landfill gas]] was otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are essentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also, co-firing can be used to lower the emission of some [[pollutants]]. For example, co-firing biomass with coal results in less [[sulfur]] emissions than burning coal by itself.

== Origin of co-firing and meaning according to present technology framework ==
Co-firing (also referred to as complementary firing or co-combustion) is the [[combustion]] of two different [[fuels]] in the same combustion system. Fuels can be [[solid fuels]], [[liquid fuels]] or gaseous, and its source either [[fossil]] or [[renewable]]. Therefore, use of [[fuel oil|heavy fuel oil]] assisting coal power stations may technically be considered co-firing. However, the term co-firing is used in the present technological framework to designate combined combustion of two (or more) fuels sustained in time, as a normal daily practice.

The interest in co-firing and the use of this term sprung up in the 1980s in the U.S. and Europe, and referred specifically to the use of [[waste]] solid residues (paper, plastic, solvents, tars, etc.) or [[biomass]] in [[coal power station]]s that were designed only for the combustion of coal, and attempted, because of the existence of those new opportunity fuels, to carry out a combined combustion in order to increase benefit margins. This interest in co-firing has grown in the last decade mainly due to increasing social concern about [[global warming]] and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions. The consequences of this concern are new policies on energy and the environment aimed at reducing emissions. Co-firing is regarded as a great opportunity for replacing coal (solid [[fossil fuel]]) used for power generation with [[renewable]] fuels (biomass) with lower costs and a direct decrease in [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. During the last few decades research has provided very diverse solutions for co-firing biomass in coal power stations with a limited impact on efficiency, operation and lifespan.

In the present context the definition of co-firing could be: The use together of two (or more) fuels,  the primary being fossil and the secondary from another source (renewable or residual), in a boiler originally designed for [[fossil fuel]], either using the original combustion system or additional devices.

== Types of co-firing ==
The concept of co-firing is quite simple. It consists in the use of two or more fuels inside the same combustion device. It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation ([[pulverized fuel]], [[fluidized bed combustion]] and [[grate firing]]). Co-firing in [[cement kilns]] is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of [[waste]] materials mostly, as well as for [[biomass]]. The iron industry ([[blast furnace]]) and domestic sector (coal [[stoves]]) are also sectors where co-firing could be implemented.

The use of a secondary fuel ([[biomass]] or [[waste]]) replacing a share of the original fossil fuel may require trivial changes in the facility, or a complete [[retrofitting]] with important reforms. Modifications will depend on the characteristics of the fuels, the original combustion technology, the plant layout and the type and location of auxiliary systems. The percentage of original fuel replaced, also known as co-firing rate (either expressed in mass or in energy basis) is furthermore a definitive parameter limiting the technical solutions valid for a specific plant.

The co-firing systems, according to the current state of the art and the future perspectives, can be classified into '''direct''' and '''indirect''' co-firing technologies. The former refer to those systems where combustion of both fuels takes place at the same combustion device or into the same boiler simultaneously. The secondary fuel (biomass, waste) may be either mixed with coal before the combustion starts or fed by a separate device, e.g. specific biomass burners. Indirect co-firing, on the contrary, separates the combustion of both solid fuels, though [[Combustion Gas]]ses may be mixed afterwards.

'''Direct''' biomass co-firing''' systems entail advantages of simplicity and economics. However direct co-firing systems are also more sensitive to variations in fuel quality and heterogeneity. Additionally other problems limit the rate of secondary fuel replacing the original fossil fuels. In example ash deposition ([[fouling]] and slagging) and corrosion usually increase with the use of biomass and wastes replacing coal, what may shorten the lifespan of diverse devices in contact with [[Combustion Gas]]ses like [[superheaters]], [[heat exchangers]], [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR), etc. Direct co-firing systems include next technological solutions:
* ''Co-milling'' (in case of solid fuels): blending of primary (coal) and secondary (biomass or waste) fuel, combined milling (in original system) and injection through the coal burners (or feeding system)
* ''Co-feeding:'' separate treatment of primary and secondary fuels (milling in case of solid fuels), and incorporation of secondary fuel to the main flow. In case of solid fuels the mixture takes place downstream the coal mill.
* ''Combined burner:'' fuels are treated separately (milled in case of solid fuels) and transported to the burner, where primary fuel uses the original ports and secondary fuel uses new ports or unused ducts. In this case, though feeding does not involve fuel physical mixing, combustion stages takes place simultaneously and with similar aerodynamics to original design.
* ''New burners:'' fuels use independent feeding lines. Primary fuel uses original injection system, whereas secondary fuel is transported to specific dedicated burners or inlet ports penetrating into the combustion chamber. New burners (injection systems) may replace former burners of primary fossil fuel, or may be installed in new positions in the combustion chamber. This option may involve the use of different combustion systems. For example, in a pulverized coal power station a grate firing system may be installed at the bottom of the combustion chamber, though this solution is rare.

'''Indirect co-firing''' systems imply usually more complex and expensive solutions, but they reduce usually problems related with corrosion, fouling, slagging, etc. This, a priori, allows co-firing rates larger than direct systems, that is, larger percentages of coal substituted by biomass or waste. In addition, indirect co-firing systems are in general better for fuel mixtures where secondary fuel may include potential contaminants like heavy metals or other dangerous inorganic compounds.

Main indirect co-firing systems are listed next:
* ''Separated burning:'' burning of secondary fuel in a separate boiler or system and introduction of flue gases downstream the radiant section of the original boiler.
* ''Coupled plant:'' separate burning in a new boiler specially designed and built for firing the secondary fuel. Original and new system couple their heating fluid circuits. Combustion gases are not mixed and [[Exhaust gas]] must be treated separately.
* ''[[Gasification]] systems:'' the secondary fuel is transformed into gas (with [[heating value]]) by means of a [[gasifier]]. The resulting [[syngas]] is either directly or with a previous treatment, injected in the original combustion chamber or boiler through new dedicated ducts.
* ''[[Pyrolysis]]:'' biomass is transformed into a mixture of gas, bio-oils and char by means of [[pyrolysis]]. Fractions may be separated and introduced into the boiler in different sites.

== Advantages of co-firing ==
Use of biomass in co-firing incorporate additional environmental, socio-economic and strategy advantages regarding the use of biomass in dedicated biomass plants. In case of waste residues there are no additional benefits, however the combustion of waste may change the emissions regulations to satisfy more strict regulations. For example, limits in emissions from environmental regulations for large scale combustion facilities are more permissive than regulations for incineration plants. Except for the previous drawback related to waste co-firing, the following advantages are common for waste and biomass co-firing:

* ''Specific investment (per unit of installed power):'' reduced in comparison with conventional biomass facilities since plant using fossil fuel already exists and only diverse modifications are required
* ''Power generation with better efficiency:'' generally biomass power plants produce electricity with relative low efficiency (18 to 22%) compared with the huge coal units (32 to 38%) with optimised cycles given the [[economy of scale]]
* ''Flexible operation:'' original plant can operate still at 100% load with fossil fuel. Co-firing facility is less sensitive to seasonality in biomass production and to biomass availability and price
* ''Carrot for development of biomass markets:'' diverse European countries have proven the promotion of co-firing is a key for the development of biomass markets as well as for the creation of expertise on biomass handling and combustion

A '''compact newspaper''' is a [[broadsheet]]-quality newspaper printed in a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, especially one in the [[United Kingdom]].  The term as used for this size came into use after ''[[The Independent]]'' began producing a smaller format edition in 2003 for London's [[commuter]]s, designed to be easier to read when using [[mass transit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-launches-tabloid-version-to-give-readers-a-choice-581355.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=27 September 2003 | title='The Independent' launches tabloid version to give readers a choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers from other parts of the country liked the new format, and ''The Independent'' introduced it nationally. ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' copied the format as ''The Independent'' increased sales{{when?|date=August 2018}}. ''The Times'' and ''The Scotsman'' are now printed exclusively in compact format following trial periods during which both broadsheet and compact version were produced simultaneously. ''The Independent'' published its last paper edition on 20 March 2016 and now appears on-line only.

The term "compact" was coined in the 1970s by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' when that newspaper moved to a tabloid format, although the ''Mail'' now calls itself a tabloid.{{fact|date=September 2018}} "Compact" is used to differentiate newspapers with more traditional content from those with a [[Tabloid journalism|flamboyant or salacious publishing style]], even though they may share the same size. The functional opposite of ''compact'' is ''[[Red tops|red top]]'', as the [[Nameplate (publishing)|nameplates]] of British sensationalist tabloids tend to be red.

A '''contact explosive''' is a chemical substance that explodes violently when it is exposed to a relatively small amount of energy (friction, pressure, sound, light). Though different substances have varying amounts of energy sensitivity, they are all much more sensitive relative to other explosives. Contact explosives are a part of a group of explosives called [[primary explosives]] which are also very sensitive to stimuli but not to the degree of contact explosives. The extreme sensitivity of contact explosives is due to either its composition, bonds, or structure.

== Reasons for instability ==

=== Composition ===
[[File:NitrogenRencer.png|thumb|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule]]

==== Presence of nitrogen ====
Explosives that are nitrogen-based are incredibly volatile due to the stability of [[nitrogen]] in its diatomic state, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;"Nitro Compound." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nitroglycerin"&gt;Senese, Fred. "Why Is Nitroglycerin Explosive?" General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Redox Reactions:. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most organic explosives are explosive because they contain nitrogen. They are defined as [[nitro compound]]s.

Since nitrogen wants to escape the unstable bonds it has in a big compound so that it can form its highly stable N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form, it makes the compound sensitive to exploding. The presence of nitrogen in these explosives also makes them much more powerful. The [[triple bond]] that holds N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; together has an incredible amount of bond energy that when it forms it releases the nitrogen gas at high energies over a short period of time thus creating a huge explosion.

==== Oxidizer and fuel ====
Some contact explosives contain an [[oxidizer]] and a [[fuel]] in their composition.&lt;ref name="Nitroglycerin" /&gt; Chemicals like [[gasoline]], a fuel, burn instead of explode because they must come into contact with oxygen in the [[Combustion|combustion reaction]]. However, if the compound already contains both the oxidant and fuel, it produces a much faster and violent reaction.
[[File:Nitrogen-triiodide-3D-balls.png|thumb|Nitrogen triiodide atomic shape]]

=== Bonds and structure ===
The structures and bonds that make up a contact explosive contribute to its instability. Covalent compounds that have a large unequal sharing of electrons have the capability to fall apart very easily and explosively. Nitrogen triiodide is a perfect example of this property. The three huge iodine atoms try to attach themselves to one small nitrogen ion, which means that the atoms are holding on to each other through a very weak bond. The weak bond between each atom is like a thread just waiting to break. Therefore, any small amount of applied energy cuts this thread and releases the iodine and nitrogen atoms to react with the fuel, allowing the reaction to occur quickly and release a large amount of energy.&lt;ref name="triiodide"/&gt;

The shape of the contact explosive molecule plays a role in its instability as well. Using nitrogen triiodide as an example again, its pyramidal shape forces the three iodine atoms to be incredibly close to each other. The shape further strains the already weak bonds that holds together this molecule.

== Uses ==
Contact explosives are used in a variety of fields.
[[File:Picric acid.png|thumb|Picric acid molecule]]
[[File:M-84-Flash-Bang-Grenade.jpg|thumb|Stun grenade]]

=== Military ===
Militaries use a variety of contact explosives in combat. Some can be manufactured into different types of bombs, tactical grenades, and even explosive bullets. Dry picric acid, which is more powerful than TNT, was used in blasting charges and artillery shells. A lot of contact explosives are used in detonators. For explosives that use [[secondary explosives]], contact explosives are used in the detonators to set off an energy chain reaction that will eventually set off the secondary explosive.

Compounds like lead azide are used to manufacture bullets that explode into shrapnel on impact.

Flash powders are used in a variety of military and police tactical pyrotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;Cops, By. "Flash Bang 101." PoliceOne. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stun grenade]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[Flashbangs|flash bangs]], and flares all use flash powder to create bright flashing lights and loud noise that disorients the enemy.

On the other hand, many of these cheap, volatile contact explosives are also used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) created by terrorists and suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, Dave. "The Homemade Explosive Used in the Paris Attacks Is a Chemical Nightmare." Business Insider. Business Insider, Inc, 16 Nov. 2015. Web. 01 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, acetone peroxide passes through explosive detectors and is incredibly powerful, unstable, and deadly. Evidence for the instability of these IEDs lies in the multiple reports of premature or wrongful IED explosions. However, when these explosives are used correctly, they have devastating consequences. The July 7th 2005 London bombings, the 2015 Paris attacks, and the 2016 Brussels bombings all used explosives that contained acetone peroxide.

=== Medicine ===
[[Angina pectoris]], an unfortunate symptom of [[Ischaemic heart disease]], is treated with nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;"Nitroglycerin Sublingual: MedlinePlus Drug Information." Nitroglycerin Sublingual: MedlinePlus Drug Information. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitroglycerin is known as a [[Vasodilation|vasodilator]]. Vasodilators work by relaxing the heart's blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard. Picric acid specifically has been used for burn treatment and as an [[Antiseptic]].&lt;ref&gt;"Picric Acid for Severe Burns." Welcome. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatrical/fireworks ===
The same flash powder used for military tactical pyrotechnics can also be used for several theatrical special effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrefx.com/flash-powder.html&lt;/ref&gt;  They are used to produce loud, bright flashes of light for effect.  Though some flash powders are too volatile and dangerous to be safely used, there are milder compounds that are still incorporated into performances today.

Silver Fulminate is used to make noise-makers, small contact poppers, and several other novelty fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;Admin. "Bang-Snaps and Silver Fulminate." Bang-Snaps and Silver Fulminate. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most widely used in [[bang snaps]]. In these small explosives, a minuscule amount of silver fulminate is encased in gravel and cigarette paper. Even with this small amount of silver fulminate, it produces a loud, sharp bang.

'''''Crude''''' is a 2009 American [[documentary film]] directed and produced by [[Joe Berlinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1326204|title=Crude}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a two-year portion of an ongoing [[class action lawsuit]] against the [[Chevron Corporation]] in [[Ecuador]].

==Synopsis==
The film follows the progress during 2006 and 2007 of a $27 billion legal case brought against the [[Chevron Corporation]] following the drilling of the [[Lago Agrio oil field]], a case described by activists as an "Amazon [[Chernobyl]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/who-will-pay-for-amazons-chernobyl-1863284.html|last=McAvoy|first=Esme|title=Who will pay for Amazon's 'Chernobyl'?|work=[[The Independent]]|date=10 January 2010|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The plaintiffs of the [[class action lawsuit]] are 30,000 [[Ecuadorians]] living in the Amazonian [[rainforest]] who claim their ancestral homeland has been polluted by the oil industry. In addition to the legal struggle, ''Crude'' shows interviews from representatives of the plaintiffs and defendants of the class action lawsuit, and explores the influence of media support such as [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], celebrity activism including support from musical artist [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and his wife [[Trudie Styler]], the power of multinational corporations, the shifting power in Ecuadorian politics, and rapidly disappearing indigenous cultures explored in the movie.

The film ends with a prediction the lawsuit will not be resolved for another decade or so unless an out of court settlement is arranged.

* Pocho Alvarez
* [[Joe Berlinger]] (producer of ''Crude'')
* Michael Bonfiglio
* [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (activist, artist and co-founder of Rainforest Foundation Fund)
* [[Trudie Styler]] (activist, producer, and co-founder of Rainforest Foundation Fund with her husband Sting)

==Subpoena of footage==
Chevron noted that a scene in the film ''Crude'' presented at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], showed an environmental scientist present at a legal strategy meeting of plaintiffs' lawyers; that same scientist was later appointed by the Ecuadorian court as an ostensibly impartial expert to write a report on technical issues. However, the scene was cut from the theatrical release; Chevron lawyers wanted to know what other potentially compromising scenes were left out by Berlinger. On May 6, 2010 federal judge [[Lewis A. Kaplan|Lewis Kaplan]] sided with a petition submitted by Chevron and ruled that Berlinger turn over more than 600 hours of original footage created during the film's production. Chevron had sought to [[subpoena]] the footage as part of the ongoing lawsuit discussed in the film. Berlinger's legal team has maintained that the footage is protected by [[reporters' privilege]] and appealed the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=6 May 2010|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/judge-rules-that-filmmaker-must-give-footage-to-chevron/|title=Judge Rules that Filmmaker Must Give Footage to Chevron|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his appeal, Berlinger noted that he was a highly awarded and respected independent filmmaker, that he was independent of Donziger, and argued that he had in fact gone to great lengths to make ''Crude'' a balanced portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Berlinger|url=http://www.crudethemovie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Berlinger-II1.pdf|title=Declaration of Joe Berlinger|publisher=Crude Productions, LLC|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=17 March 2018|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811185315/http://www.crudethemovie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Berlinger-II1.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlinger acknowledged that he had "tweaked" some scenes at Donziger’s request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Folkenflik|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127410188|title=A 'Crude' awakening: Chevron Vs. The documentarian|work=All Things Considered|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene showing the environmental scientist at the legal strategy session had been cut from the theatrical release (but not the online version for [[Netflix]]) after one of the plaintiff lawyers objected to Berlinger that showing the scene was “so serious we could lose everything." The US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the scope slightly (Berlinger had to turn over 500 hours of outtakes, rather than 600), but in 2011 upheld the lower court ruling against Berlinger, Judge Pierre Leval writing for the court: "Those who do not retain independence as to what they will publish but are subservient to the objectives of others who have a stake in what will be published have either a weaker privilege or none at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Isler|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/4608-what-chevron-corp-v-donziger-continues-to-get/news/documentaries-news.php#sthash.msr1zfqJ.dpbs|title=What ‘Chevron Corp. v. Donziger’ Continues To Get Wrong about Documentary Filmmaking|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Law School]]|work=Documentaries and the Law Blog|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence provided by the film outtakes played an important role in Chevron obtaining a 2014 US court ruling that the American lawyers for the plaintiffs had used fraud and corruption in obtaining the $19 billion Ecuadorian court judgment against Chevron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Clifford|last=Krauss|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/federal-judge-rules-for-chevron-in-ecuadorean-pollution-case.html?_r=0|title=Big Victory for Chevron Over Claims in Ecuador|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patricia |last=Hurtado|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-08/chevron-wins-a-round-in-long-battle-over-pollution-in-ecuador|title=Chevron Wins Ruling Blocking $8.6 Billion Order in Ecuador Fight|work=[[Bloomberg Markets]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=8 August 2016|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totally Missed The True Plot==

The outtakes indicate the filmmakers were on notice that the plaintiffs were engaging in seriously shady tactics against Chevron--but failed to address it in their production.  On September 7, 2018 the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague unanimously issued an award in favor of Chevron and Texaco Petroleum Company. The decision concluded that the judgment in Ecuador was fraudulent, corrupt and “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.” The amount Ecuador must pay to Chevron to compensate for damages is yet to be determined. The award found that Ecuador violated its obligations under international treaties, investment agreements and international law. The Court of Arbitration’s findings of fraudulent activities included: 

-That the evidence placed before the Court is “the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal." 

-That the plaintiffs championed by the film actually were engaged in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.  Their efforts triggered an order to appoint an “expert” friendly to the plaintiffs. 

-That Ecuadorian government prosecutors “actively cooperated” with the plaintiffs. 

-That the plaintiffs bribed the “experts” and ghostwrote their report. 

-That the plaintiffs paid a retired judge to draft the acting judge’s orders—and that the same judge solicited bribes that Chevron refused to pay.

'''Direct reduced iron''' ('''DRI'''), also called '''sponge iron''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/direct-reduced-iron-DRI.html |title=What is direct reduced iron (DRI)? definition and meaning |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is produced from the direct [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of [[iron ore]] (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) to iron by a [[Reducing agent|reducing gas]] or elemental [[carbon]] produced from [[natural gas]] or [[coal]]. Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.

Reduced iron derives its name from the chemical change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at high temperatures in the presence of [[hydrocarbon]]-rich gases, [[carbon monoxide]], or elemental carbon. Direct reduction refers to processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting point of iron. The product of such solid state processes is called direct reduced iron.

The reducing gas is a mixture of gases, primarily [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The process temperature is typically 800 to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metallics.org.uk/dri/ |title=Direct reduced iron (DRI) |publisher=International Iron Metallics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to drive off the [[oxygen]] contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1200&amp;nbsp;°C).

The direct reduction process is comparatively energy efficient. [[Steel]] made using DRI requires significantly less fuel, in that a traditional blast furnace is not needed. DRI is most commonly made into steel using [[electric arc furnace]]s to take advantage of the heat produced by the DRI product.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Fruehan, et al. (2000). [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/resources/steel/pdfs/theoretical_minimum_energies.pdf Theoretical Minimum Energies to Produce Steel (for Selected Conditions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
In modern times, direct reduction processes have been developed to specifically overcome the difficulties of conventional [[Blast furnace|blast furnaces]]. DRI is successfully manufactured in various parts of the world. The initial investment and operating costs of direct reduction plants are low compared to integrated steel plants and are more suitable for developing countries where supplies of coking coal are limited.

Factors that help make DRI economical:

* Direct-reduced iron has about the same iron content as [[pig iron]], typically 90–94% total iron (depending on the quality of the raw ore) so it is an excellent feedstock for the electric furnaces used by [[Steel mill#Minimill|mini mill]]s, allowing them to use lower grades of scrap for the rest of the charge or to produce higher grades of steel.
* Hot-briquetted iron (HBI) is a compacted form of DRI designed for ease of shipping, handling and storage.
* Hot direct reduced iron (HDRI) is iron not cooled before discharge from the reduction furnace, that is immediately transported to a waiting electric arc furnace and charged, thereby saving energy.
* The direct reduction process uses pelletized iron ore or natural "lump" ore. One exception is the fluidized bed process which requires sized iron ore particles.
* The direct reduction process can use natural gas contaminated with inert gases, avoiding the need to remove these gases for other use. However, any inert gas contamination of the reducing gas lowers the effect (quality) of that gas stream and the thermal efficiency of the process.
* Supplies of powdered ore and raw natural gas are both available in areas such as Northern [[Australia]], avoiding transport costs for the gas. In most cases the DRI plant is located near natural gas source as it is more cost effective to ship the ore rather than the gas.
* This method produces 97% pure iron.
[[India]] is the world’s largest producer of direct-reduced iron, a vital constituent of the steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2017 World Direct Reduction Statistics |publisher=Midrex Technologies |date=2017 |url=http://www.midrex.com/assets/user/news/MidrexStatsBook2017.5_.24_.18_.pdf|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other countries use variants of the process, so providing iron for local engineering industries.

=== Problems ===

Direct reduced iron is highly susceptible to oxidation and rusting if left unprotected, and is normally quickly processed further to steel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The bulk iron can also catch fire since it is [[pyrophoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Hattwig |first = Martin |last2 = Steen |first2 = Henrikus |title = Handbook of explosion prevention and protection |pages = 269–270 |publisher = Wiley-VCH |year = 2004 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ws3q0zBGLV8C&amp;pg=PA269 |isbn = 978-3-527-30718-0 |postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[blast furnace]] [[pig iron]], which is almost pure metal, DRI contains some siliceous [[gangue]], which needs to be removed in the steel-making process.

== History ==
{{Main article|Bloomery}}

Producing sponge iron and then working it was the earliest method used to obtain iron in the [[Middle East]], [[Egypt]], and [[Europe]], where it remained in use until at least the 16th century. There is some evidence that the bloomery method was also used in [[China]], but China had developed [[blast furnace]]s to obtain pig iron by 500 [[BCE]].

The advantage of the bloomery technique is that iron can be obtained at a lower furnace temperature, only about 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C or so. The disadvantage, relative to a blast furnace, is that only small quantities can be made at a time.

== Chemistry ==
The following [[Carbothermic reaction|carbothermic reactions]] reduce [[iron ore]] to iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.midrex.com/assets/user/media/MIDREX_Process-Brochure.pdf|title=MIDREX|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[hematite]] becomes [[magnetite]] by reduction with [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]

&lt;chem&gt; 3 Fe2O3 + CO -&gt; 2 Fe3O4 + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt; 3 Fe2O3 + H2 -&gt; 2 Fe3O4 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

[[magnetite]] becomes [[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous oxide]] by reduction with [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]

&lt;chem&gt; Fe3O4 + CO -&gt; 3 FeO + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt; Fe3O4 + H2 -&gt; 3 FeO + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

[[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous oxide]] becomes sponge iron by reduction with [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]

&lt;chem&gt; FeO + CO -&gt; Fe + CO_2&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt; FeO + H2 -&gt; Fe + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

[[carburizing]] produces [[cementite]]

&lt;chem&gt; 3 Fe + CH4 -&gt; Fe3C + 2H2&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt; 3 Fe + 2CO -&gt; Fe3C + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt; 3 Fe + CO +H2 -&gt; Fe3C + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

== Uses ==
Sponge iron is not useful by itself, but can be processed to create [[wrought iron]]. The sponge is removed from the furnace, called a bloomery, and repeatedly beaten with heavy hammers and folded over to remove the slag, [[oxidise]] any carbon or carbide and [[welding|weld]] the iron together. This treatment usually creates wrought iron with about three percent slag and a fraction of a percent of other impurities. Further treatment may add controlled amounts of carbon, allowing various kinds of heat treatment (e.g. "steeling").

Today, sponge iron is created by reducing iron ore without melting it. This makes for an energy-efficient feedstock for specialty steel manufacturers which used to rely upon [[scrap metal]].

[[File:Dogsledatrest.jpg|thumb|Dogsled huskies at rest, Ottawa, Canada, 2011]]

A '''dog sled''' or '''dog sleigh'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/dog-sleigh|title=Collins 2012 digital dictionary|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sled]] pulled by one or more [[sled dog]]s used to travel over [[ice]] and through [[snow]]. Numerous types of sleds are used, depending on their function. They can be used for [[dog sled racing]]. In [[Greenland]] the dogs pull in a fan shape in front of the sled opposed to other regions where to dogs pull side by side in pairs.

==History==
Dog power has been used for hunting and travel for over a thousand years. As far back as the 10th century BCE these dogs have contributed to human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tworiversak.com/sleddoghx1.htm |title=Early Sled Dog History |last1=Swan | first1=Thom |website=Swanny's Place |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembling a dog sled team involves picking leader dogs, point dogs, swing dogs, and wheel dogs. The lead dog is crucial, so [[mushing|mushers]] take particular care of these dogs. Another important detail is to have powerful wheel dogs to pull the sled out from the snow. Point dogs (optional) are located behind the leader dogs, swing dogs between the point and wheel dogs, and team dogs are all other dogs in between the wheel and swing dogs and are selected for their endurance, strength, and speed as part of the team. In dog sledding, [[Siberian Huskies]] or [[Alaskan Malamutes]] are the main types of dogs that are used for recreational sledding because of their strength and speed and endurance as well as their ability to withstand the cold.  However, [[Alaskan husky|Alaskan Huskies]] (a mix between Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes) are also a popular dog for sled dog racing, because of their endurance, good eating habits, speed, and dedication to running even when tired.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Sometimes, for sprint races, mushers use short haired hounds that are faster than the average [[husky]]. These hounds are raised from a young age to pull. It is harder to train hounds than it is to train Siberian Huskies and Malamutes to pull a sled because it is not in their nature. Training should start at around six months of age by pulling a small log behind them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Overview==
{{Importance-section|date=April 2011}}

===Definition===
{{Main|Legal definition of motorcycle}}

While the normal [[legal definition of motorcycle]] is a two-wheeled vehicle, in the USA a motorcycle may also be three-wheeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=72Vmfd-q5v8C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=three-wheeled+vehicle+classified+as+a+motorcycle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wVebTc6sGIqdOt3g5PsG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Future drive: electric vehicles and sustainable transportation |author=Daniel Sperling|page=75 |publisher=Island Press, 1995 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification does not depend on whether the operator is fully enclosed by a "cage" or exposed to the elements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Configurations===
{{Main|Three-wheeler#Configurations}}

Three-wheeled vehicles with one front wheel and two rear wheels are known as a delta design or the traditional trike (tricycle) design, such as the Hase Kettwiesel.

Three-wheeled vehicles with two front wheels and one rear wheel are known as a tadpole design, such as the Odyssey Mk. 5 and Outrider 422 Alpha. Another example of an electric three-wheeled vehicle in this configuration is the [[Azkarra]], produced by Canadian company [[Girfalco]].

==Electric assisted velomobiles==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">'''Enercoop''' is a French [[electric utility]] cooperative company, which only uses [[renewable energy]]. It is the only one in France in the form of a [[cooperative]]. Its founding members include [[Greenpeace]] and other proponents of [[environmental protection]] and the ethical economy, such as ''La Nef'', a French [[cooperative bank]] and the [[Friends of the Earth]] association.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Enercoop]]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of mid-2014, Enercoop has {{formatnum:20000}} clients&lt;ref&gt;http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/aquitaine/2014/04/04/enercoop-fournisseur-d-electricite-verte-s-installe-en-aquitaine-453247.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Enercoop was created in 2005 and initially, as the French electricity market wasn't yet liberalized, Enercoop just had companies as clients. Later on, in 2007, as the market was liberalized, Enercoop started to grow and totalized more than {{formatnum:200}} clients.

In 2011, after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Enercoop went from {{formatnum:3000}} clients in 2009 to {{formatnum:10000}} in late 2011.

Nowadays, in 2014, Enercoop has {{formatnum:20000}} clients.

==Objectives==
Its aim is to create many regional cooperatives around France where the local members can be in charge of all parts of the energy process from production to consumption. In this way the group intends to make citizens responsible for the energy they consume. Actually, in 2014, it has 6 regional cooperatives.

Enercoop's [[articles of association]] impose that at least 57% of the profits must be reinvested in means of electricity production. The remaining profits can either be reinvested or can reward its investors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">The '''Fuel Freedom Foundation''' was officially launched in October 2012 by entrepreneurs Joseph Hollander&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuelfreedom.org/who-we-are/executive-leadership/&lt;/ref&gt; and Eyal Aronoff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuelfreedom.org/tag/eyal-aronoff/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, B.W. [http://www.dailypilot.com/entertainment/tn-dpt-1025-cook-20121024,0,5959135.story "The Crowd: Big names fighting fuel dependence"], [[Daily Pilot]], October 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has a mission to end the United States' dependence on oil by removing barriers to competition in the [[transportation]] fuel market. The founders believe that fuel prices could be permanently reduced to below $1 a gallon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuelfreedom.org/angry-rising-gas-prices-something/&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's Board of Advisors includes former CIA Director [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.]], former New Mexico Governor [[Bill Richardson]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130422-905286.html?mod=googlenews_wsj "Governor Bill Richardson Joins Fuel Freedom Foundation's Board of Advisors"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; former president of the Rockefeller Foundation Peter Goldmark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fuel-freedom-foundation-launches-campaign-to-end-americas-oil-addiction-2012-10-22 "Fuel Freedom Foundation Launches Campaign to End America's Oil Addiction"] [[MarketWatch]], October 22, 2012  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; former dean of the University of Colorado's Graduate School of Public Policy Marshall Kaplan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/marshallkaplan "C-SPAN Biographical History"], [[C-SPAN]]&lt;/ref&gt; former president of Shell Oil Company [[John Hofmeister]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hybridcars.com/john-hofmeister-joins-fuel-freedom-foundation/ "John Hofmeister Joins Fuel Freedom Foundation"], "Hybrid Cars", April 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security Gal Luft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iags.org/galluft.htm "Institute for the Analysis of Global Security"], [[Institute for the Analysis of Global Security]]&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO is [[Joseph A. Cannon]].

==Outlook and goals==
The foundation believes that high [[oil price]]s are a result of a systematic [[monopoly]]. Contrary to a more traditional monopoly, where one company has a large enough market share to control prices, the oil-market is believed to be a monopolistic market because oil is the primary, and in most cases the only, fuel for transportation. These monopolistic forces create a situation where oil expenditures in the U.S. top $780 billion per year, more than twenty times the amount spent on coal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKEtQ_zz4GA "Ending Our Oil Addiction: Yossie Hollander at TEDxChapmanU"], [[TEDx]], July 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Foundation, outdated regulations prevent drivers from making simple modifications to their engines that would enable their cars to run on alternatives fuels, hence threatening oil's monopoly over the transportation fuel market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/100617230 "Our Real Energy Problem, and How We Solve It"], [[CNBC]], April 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Updating these regulations to allow for current vehicles to modify their engines would allow for a near-term, widespread expansion of fuel choice for drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/08/alternative-fuels "Difference Engine: Competition At The Pump"], [[The Economist]], August 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]], [[natural gas]] and [[electric car]]s are seen as viable replacement fuels to compete against oil in an open market. No one fuel is explicitly favored over the others but most people believe methanol made from [[natural gas]] holds the most promise to break oil's monopoly.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;Tucker, William [http://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2012/11/19/can_two_softward_geeks_free_us_from_foreign_oil_106784.html "Can Two Software Geeks Save Us From Foreign Oil?"], "Real Clear Energy", November 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hidden Character Stone''' ({{zh|c=藏字石 / 救星石 |p=cángzì shí / jiùxīng shí}}) is a stone located in a scenic spot area in the town of [[Zhangbu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|[[:zh:掌布镇|掌布镇]]}}), [[Pingtang County]], [[Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Guizhou]].  The stone displays patterns on its surface that have been interpreted as [[Simplified Chinese characters]] and [[Traditional Chinese characters]], and have been read as "[[Communist Party of China]]" ({{lang|zh-hant|中國共產党}}), or alternatively as "Communist Party of China perish" ({{lang|zh-hant|中國共產党亡}}).&lt;ref name="s8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s8int.com/page28.html |title=Mysterious "Two-Hundred Million-Year-Old" Hidden Stone Bears the Words: "Chinese Communist Party Collapses" Page 28 |publisher=S8int.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
Hidden Character Stone is a main attraction along with a jade water basin (玉水金盆) that is part of the Qiannan Pingtang National Geological Park (黔南平塘地质公园).&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt;  The park has an area of about 201.6 square kilometers.&lt;ref name="lc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://life.chinatimes.com/2009Cti/Channel/Life/life-article/0,5047,11051801+112011060200077,00.html |title=新民晚報－貴州平塘 玉水金盆處處景 |publisher=Life.chinatimes.com |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone is in a narrow gap between two cliffs, just wide enough for two people.&lt;ref name="s8" /&gt;

==History==
{{Weasel words|date=February 2017}} 
In June 2002, the [[Duyun]] international photography exposition (都匀国际摄影博览会) recommended an area in Zhangbu as a photo spot.&lt;ref name="sohu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20060427/n243019837.shtml |title=贵州藏字石（神州搜奇）(组图)-搜狐新闻 |publisher=News.sohu.com |date=2007-04-02 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone was discovered during cleanup after the expo.  The area has been isolated, untouched by humans for a long time. &lt;ref name="s8" /&gt;  The person cleaning the area was staff member Wang Guo-fu (王国富), who discovered the characters written on the stone.&lt;ref name="xin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2003-12/08/content_1220053.htm |title=2.7亿年"中国共产党"字样地质奇观惊现贵州(图) |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2003-12-08 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 5–8, 2003 a Chinese scientific inspection group was formed to investigate the stone with about 15 scientists.&lt;ref name="s8" /&gt;  Some of the notables include Li Ting-dong (李廷栋) from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liu Bao-jun (刘宝君) from Chinese academy of Sciences and Li Feng-lin (李凤麟) from China University of Geosciences.&lt;ref name="dongt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dongtaiwang.com/dm/uGGc/o5.xNaMUBaTThb.pbz/abqr/402546 |title=看中國 - 《新看點》：懸疑！從貴州藏字石到太湖冤魂、安陽靈異案(圖) |publisher=Dongtaiwang.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone was analyzed to be about 270 million years old from the [[Permian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/v/2008-02/13/content_9675017.htm |title=2.7亿年前的藏字石谜_视频中国_中国网 |publisher=China.com.cn |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no traces of the characters being made by humans.&lt;ref name="s8" /&gt;  Other researchers included Li Feng-lin (李鳳麟) and Gu Jing-yi (賈精一).&lt;ref name="ATVfiles"&gt;ATV China's mystery files (中國神祕檔案) episode on save star stone&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Ting-dong further commented about the stone's contribution to science, and that there is nothing like it.  Liu Bao-jun further support additional research to be done and was interested in the natural formation of the characters on the stone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptjp.gov.cn/gzpt/wh/2010/56/10_5_6_10_28_12_65BE2_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Each character on the stone is about one square [[shaku (unit)|shaku]], which is about 1 square foot.&lt;ref name="sohu1" /&gt;

==Description==

===Five-character version===
The five-character version suggests the characters on the stone said "Communist Party of China" (中国共产党).  This is the version publicly accepted in the PRC.  Also when referring to this version, the stone has been called (救星石), literally "savior stone".  This name comes from people who are passionate in supporting and admire the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="xin1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sohu.com/20090915/n266743341.shtml |title="救星石" 两亿七千万年的神秘天书-搜狐新闻 |publisher=News.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of how the stone was discovered usually follows this version.&lt;ref name="sohu1" /&gt;  Zhang Dahua (张大华) of Zhangbu village once publicly gave an explanation of how the name "savior stone" was created.&lt;ref name="ATVfiles" /&gt;

===Six-character version===
The six-character version suggests the characters on the stone said "Communist Party of China perish" (中国共产党亡).&lt;ref name="s8" /&gt;  There has been criticism that the sixth and last character "perish" (亡) has been purposely neglected to turn a "Perish communist stone" (亡共石) into a "savior stone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=作者：华风 |url=http://renminbao.com/rmb/articles/2005/5/26/36082.html |title="亡共石"变"救星石"趣谈 (图) |publisher=Renminbao.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not a version accepted in the PRC, hence when mainland media reports it, it has to hide the perish character.&lt;ref name="dongt" /&gt;  Often when pictures are shown with the stone having six characters, the description still refers to it by the five-character version.&lt;ref name="sohu1" /&gt; In Chinese text the character "perish" (亡) is often used in association with the perish of a state like "[[Chu (state)|Chu]] perish" (楚亡), "[[Wei (state)|Wei]] perish" (魏亡).&lt;ref&gt;劉煒/著. [2002] (2002) Chinese civilization in a new light 中華文明傳真#3 春秋戰國. Publishing Company. {{ISBN|962-07-5311-9}}. Book end time line.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional and Simplified Chinese===
The characters on the stone are a mix of [[Traditional Chinese characters]] and [[Simplified Chinese characters]].  The first and third character ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|中}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|共}}}}) are identical in both versions.  The second character "country" ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|國}}}}) and fourth character "produce" ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|產}}}}) is in the traditional form.  The fifth character, "party" ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|党}}}}) is in the simplified form.&lt;ref name="sina1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2005-03-01/07135229255s.shtml |script-title=zh:惊看平塘"藏字石"(图)_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |date=2005-03-10 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth character "perish" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|亡}}}}) has no difference.  Some have analyzed all the odd characters as Simplified, while the even characters are Traditional.&lt;ref name="ATVfiles" /&gt;

* On the stone: {{lang|zh|中國共產党亡}}
* Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|中國共產黨亡}}
* Simplified Chinese: {{lang|zh-hans|中国共产党亡}}

===Analysis===
The origin of the characters remain a subject of dispute.&lt;ref name="scholar"&gt;{{cite journal| title=平塘掌布藏字石发现经历|url=http://www.xzbu.com/4/view-3821203.htm|author=Mao, Jianquan|journal=贵阳文史|volume=6|pages=25|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some early speculations that the characters were put there by the [[People's Liberation Army]], but according to the path of the [[Long March]], they never went to Pingtang.&lt;ref name="ATVfiles" /&gt;  The characters also read left to right, which was not practiced at the time.  The inclusion of a Simplified character before the CPC did any simplifications also ruled them out.&lt;ref name="ATVfiles" /&gt;  There were also some skeptics who suspected the village was creating a fraud to build their tourism industry at the time.&lt;ref name="ATVfiles" /&gt;Others think the Hidden Character Stone was made in the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gzczs.guiyangbus.com/gzczs/002.html 贵州藏字石-见解] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118023221/http://gzczs.guiyangbus.com/gzczs/002.html |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural reference==
The Hidden Character Stone has appeared as a topic on a number of shows such as [[China Central Television|CCTV]]'s "Approaching Science" (走近科学) and the [[Hong Kong]] [[Asia Television|ATV]] show "China's Mystery Files" (中國神祕檔案).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptjp.gov.cn/gzpt/wh/2010/510/10_5_10_11_37_2_76G39.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Both refer to the five-character version.

InMotion is a student team focused in electric racing and [[fast charging]]. InMotion is based in [[Helmond]] and is composed mostly of students from the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences]]. The team was founded in 2012 by Albert Maas under the guidance of [[Maarten Steinbuch]] &lt;ref&gt;InMotion,[ https://www.inmotion.tue.nl/en/ourstory "How it All Began"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In 2017, the Fusion, the team’s first car, was built&lt;ref&gt;InMotion,[ https://www.inmotion.tue.nl/en/ourstory "How it All Began"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Fusion is an electric formula car and holds the electric lap record in [[Circuit Zandvoort]] &lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.cursor.tue.nl/en/news/2017/juni/inmotion-smashes-electric-track-record-at-zandvoort/ Article in ''Cursor'']&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Circuit Zolder]] &lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.cursor.tue.nl/en/news/2017/juli/inmotion-adds-electric-record-in-zolder-to-its-haul/  Article in ''Cursor'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TT Circuit Assen]] &lt;ref&gt;[ https://ict.eu/2018/een-nieuw-ronderecord-voor-inmotion-op-ciruit-assen/   Article in ''ICT'']&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The team is currently developing an endurance race car, the Vision. The goal is to develop the first fully electric car to compete in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], in the Garage 56 class &lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.inmotion.tue.nl/en/cars2/vision   Article in ''InMotion'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.studio040.nl/inmotion-24-uur-van-le-mans-is-middel-oplossing-elektrisch-rijden-is-doel/content/item?1101258    Article in ''Studio 040'']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Cars of InMotion==
===Ignition===
In 2009, a group of students from the University of Applied Sciences of Utrecht presented their graduation project: an eco-friendly formula race car, the Formula Bio. Their dream was to participate in the [[Formula Student]], a race similar to Formula 1, only for students. The Formula Bio stood for environmentally friendly and inexpensive race cars.
After they graduated, one of the group members went to study at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. This student, Albert Maas, came into contact with [[Maarten Steinbuch]] &lt;ref&gt;InMotion,[ https://www.inmotion.tue.nl/en/ourstory "How it All Began"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Together they came up with the idea of participating in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with a fully electric car. In 2012, the InMotion student team was officially established.

===Fusion===
[[File:Beitske Visser in the InMotion IM-e 2017.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Fusion with [[Beitske Visser]] behind the wheel.]]
The Fusion is the fastest electric formula car in the world, with a top speed of 246 km/h.
The Fusion is built to break track records of circuits, and not to fit into a particular ranking, so the car does not have to meet certain restrictions. How is the car so fast? This is due to a combination of different techniques. The [[propulsion]] is important, and also the aerodynamics of the car. The small size of the car also plays a role. Below are some facts to get a better understanding of the Fusion.
* The car weighs 650 [[kilos]] in total, of which the monocoque weighs 60 kilos
* The Fusion has reached a maximum speed of 246 kilometers per hour
* The full power of the car is 400 [[kW]]

The InMotion team launched its first full electric racing car in 2016. The car was based on the former Formula Bio car has been built on a [[carbon fiber]] chassis. The full electric engine has a better power to weight ratio compared to a [[Formula E]] car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IM/e|url=http://inmotion.tue.nl/kpt-ime/|website=InMotion|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car made its track debut at [[Circuit Zandvoort]] during the [[2016 Masters of Formula 3]] event. Drivers [[Xavier Maassen]] and [[Jan Lammers]] gave the car a shakedown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InMotion|url=https://www.tue.nl/tue-campus/tue-innovation-lab/where-science-meets-business-innovatie-door-co-creatie/maak-kennis-met-de-studententeams/inmotion/#top|website=TU/e|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 [[USF2000]] driver [[Rinus van Kalmthout]] did a straight line test at the Automotive Campus [[Helmond]] test track (part of the [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|A270 motorway]]). During the year the team improved track records for electric cars at two tracks. [[Beitske Visser]] improved the record at Zandvoort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studententeam uit Eindhoven verbetert elektrisch ronderecord Circuit Zandvoort|url=https://nl.motorsport.com/general/news/studententeam-eindhoven-verbreekt-elektrisch-ronderecord-circuit-zandvoort-913954/|website=Motorsport.nl|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testdriver Maassen beat the track record for electric cars at [[Circuit Zolder]], previously held by Bert Longin in a [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IM/e verpulvert elektrisch ronderecord Circuit Zolder|url=https://www.autosport.be/news/im-e-verpulvert-elektrisch-ronderecord-circuit-zolder.html|website=Autosport.be|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerodynamics====
:Keeping the test platform on the road requires a lot of downward pressure. The most important parts of the car that generate this pressure are the [[Diffuser (automotive)|diffuser]], the [[front wing]] and the [[rear wing]]. The diffuser is the floor plate of the car, which is shaped so that it creates a lower pressure under the car and thus generates downforce. The rear wing consists of three elements, one of which is adjustable. The front wing is similar. Both wings can be removed from the car so that the aerodynamics specialists can test them and gain more insight into the air flows. This is mainly done with the program ANSYS Fluent, using simulations to investigate aerodynamics. Then the data is supplemented with results from our test drives.

====Monocoque==== 
:The [[monocoque]] is made of a composite with sandwich structure, which is also used in other open wheel race cars. The monocoque is not only made for drivers of average length, but even for drivers up to just under 2 meters. The total weight of the chassis is only 60 kilograms, including the bulkhead and the paint. The drivers all have her or his own pre-formed seat, making them comfortable and protected against unexpected movements.

====Propulsion==== 
:The [[propulsion]] is one of the main reasons why this car is so fast. Our battery pack is about 1/3 of the total weight of the car. The Fusion has rear-wheel drive, with two Yasa 750-series engines. At the [[Circuit Zandvoort]] the car achieved a maximum speed of 246 kilometers per hour. In addition, various safety measures have been taken to ensure safety. The battery pack is constantly monitored by the [[battery management system]], and at the smallest deviation the current is removed.

====Electronic control unit (ECU)====
:The car contains many sensors that measure parameters such as temperature and resistance, and which register data for the models. By connecting the ECU to our computer you can read these measurements. ICT Automatizing and InMotion have designed the ECUs for the Ignition together. ICT has given the access to their Motar platform, which consists of the hardware and software of the ECU. InMotion has created the control algorithms in MATLAB and Simulink. With the Motar-Toolbox they can generate production class software based on AUTOSAR of the model at the touch of a button.

===Vision===
The Vision is a fully electric [[Le Mans prototype]] under development. Unlike the Fusion, this car is also built for its [[endurance]]. The Vision will be unique because it will be the first fully electric race car to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the Garage 56 category, InMotion can use the innovative technological developments to make the race car as fast and environmentally friendly as possible.
Engineers of the team have already thought about the following topics for the Vision: fan system for downforce, suspension, electric powertrain, aerodynamics and the monocoque. The team has gained knowledge about most of these topics by building the Ignition and the Fusion. Furthermore, there have been several graduation projects on various topics regarding the Vision. The most important difference between these cars and the Vision is the focus on charging time.
The [[concept car]] is an embodiment of the future for [[electric driving]]. The ultimate goal of the team is thus literally visible and tangible. The aerodynamics of the concept car have already been carefully thought out and designed by the team.

The concept car is the embodiment of future electric mobility. The ultimate end goal of the team is now made attainable. The outline of the concept car has been carefully designed and engineered by the team. Making the end goal closer to reality, by our team tackling the primary technical challenge, charging times.

==Student team==
Passion and ambition are the great motivations of the student team. The team consists of full-time members, part-time members, and trainees. Together, from all kinds of different disciplines, they work on one mission. The uniqueness of the InMotion student team is the ultimate goal, not an annual project. Everyone who has worked with them is seen as part of the team.

In addition, the team receives regular advice from the 'technical advisory board' and 'supervisory board'. The Supervisory Board ensures that the project continues to follow a uniform line over the years. The technical advisory board consists of experienced members who meet weekly with the current engineers in order to guarantee the transfer of knowledge and to help with problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1998">The '''''Tasman Spirit''''' is a Greek registered [[oil tanker]].  The tanker was launched in February 1979 and was formerly called the ''Mabini'' and ''Kenko''.

On July 28, 2003 she ran aground near the city of [[Karachi]]. Over 33,000 tons of oil spilled into the [[Arabian Sea]] in what is considered by some to be the largest environmental disaster in [[Pakistan]]'s history. According to the [[IUCN]] 16 kilometres of coastline has been polluted.

The ship's insurer offered 10 million rupees (about $180,000 [[US dollar]]s in 2003) in compensation to the Karachi port authorities, and agreed to pay all cleaning expenses.

'''Marmara Ereğlisi LNG Storage Facility''' ({{lang-tr|Marmara Ereğlisi LNG Terminali}}) is an above-ground [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) [[LNG storage tank|tank]]s facility in [[Tekirdağ Province]], northwestern Turkey.

The LNG storage facility is located in [[Marmara Ereğlisi]], {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Tekirdağ]] and {{convert|95|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Istanbul]]. It is part of an LNG terminal operated by the  state-owned natural gas distributor [[BOTAŞ]],&lt;ref name="aae"/&gt; where [[LNG carrier]]s at a discharge port pump the imported cargo ashore. LNG is stored in tanks and [[regasification|regasified]] to convey to the main pipeline system as needed.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

The project for the construction of the LNG storage facility launched in 1984. The facility went into service in August 1994. In 2007, six filling platforms were added for [[tank trucks]] having {{convert|20|-|50|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} capacity. Three filling platforms are able to fill up daily 75 tanker trucks.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

With the completion of an additional fourth storage tank in 2019, country's LNG storage capacity will increase by 30%. The expansion will increase the total storage capacity of the facility about 50% up to {{convert|27000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} with extra {{convert|9000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="aae"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1625">The '''mean annual increment''' (MAI) or '''mean annual growth''' refers to the average growth per year a tree or stand of trees has exhibited/experienced to a specified age.  For example, a 20-year-old tree that has a [[diameter at breast height]] (dbh) of 10.0&amp;nbsp;inches has an MAI of 0.5&amp;nbsp;inches/year. MAI is calculated as &lt;math&gt;MAI=Y(t)/t&lt;/math&gt; where Y(t) = yield at time t. Because the typical growth patterns of most trees is [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]], the MAI starts out small, increases to a maximum value as the tree matures, then declines slowly over the remainder of the tree's life.  Throughout this, the MAI always remains positive. MAI differs from [[periodic annual increment]] (PAI) because the PAI is simply the growth for one specific year or any other specified length of time.  
[[Image:Sheet4 Chart 5.JPG|right|thumb|MAI vs PAI]]

The point where the MAI and PAI meet is typically referred to as the [[biological rotation age]].  This is the age at which the tree or stand would be harvested if the management objective is to maximize long-term yield.  The proof of this definition is shown by differentiating MAI(t) with respect to t, and is shown by Husch, Miller, and Beers &lt;ref&gt;Husch, B., Miller, C.I., and T.W. Beers. 1982. Forest Mensuration. Wiley. New York. 402 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercedes-Benz C-Class''' is a line of [[compact executive car]]s produced by [[Daimler AG]]. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the [[Mercedes-Benz W201|190 (W201)]] range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class#W168|W168 A-Class]] arrived in 1997. The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in [[Sindelfingen]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Germany as well as numerous satellite factories in other countries. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was produced on 1 June 1993, and the first of the second generation (W203) rolled off the assembly line on 18 July 2000. The C-Class has been available with a [[4Matic]] (i.e. [[four-wheel drive]]) option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007. The latest generation C-Class (W205) came out in 2014.

Though originally available as a sedan and a station wagon, the W203 series in 2000 debuted a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) version that, when facelifted, became the [[Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class]]. The CLC-Class remained in production until 2011 when it was replaced by a new W204 C-Class coupé for the 2012 model year.

In October 1986, three years into [[Mercedes-Benz W201]] (190)'s production run, work began on a successor. Design work began in 1987, with the final design by [[Murat Günak]] being selected in 1989 and the production design by [[Olivier Boulay]] delayed in January 1990, finally being patented on 19 December 1990.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=rh4nAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22bruno+sacco%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cnyzT_PvJIeq2QXN2OzpCA&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTiCAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bruno%20sacco%22&amp;f=false |title=Patent USD346570 – Automobile |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9008365-0001 |title=DPMAregister – Designs – Registerauskunft zum Design |work=dpma.de |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mercedes-benz-blog.blogspot.com/2008/07/mercedes-benz-blog-triviameeting-point.html |title=Mercedes-Benz-Blog TRIVIA: Meeting point Mercedes – 25 years of the C-Class |author=Adrian-Liviu Dorofte |work=mercedes-benz-blog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;europe.autonews.com/article/19970303/ANE/703030836/a-class-sets-new-record-for-mercedes&lt;/ref&gt; Rough prototypes went into testing in 1989, with first production design prototypes commencing testing in 1990. In May 1993, the first generation [[W202]] C-Class was introduced as a replacement for the 190. The C-Class sedan was the company's entry-level model up until 1997, when Mercedes launched the A-Class. Styling themes were carried over from the previous W201 series, but the new series had a smoother and rounder design than the previous generation of compact Mercedes, with styling cues from the W124 E-Class (short, high trunk and taller tail lights), W140 S-Class (front end), and R129 SL-Class (headlights).

During the {{F1|1996}} and {{F1|1997}} [[Formula 1]] seasons, the C36 AMG served as the sport's [[Safety Car#Formula One|Safety Car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsport-total.com/f1/news/2015/03/mercedes-amg-gt-s-bernd-maylaenders-neues-safety-car-15030912.html |title=Mercedes-AMG GT S: Bernd Mayländers neues Safety-Car |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, development began on the W203 C-Class. Design work commenced in mid-1994, with the final design being approved in December 1995 by the executive board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oocities.org/motorcity/speedway/5350/w203design.htm |title=W203 C-Class Design Studies |publisher=oocities.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design patents were filed on 20 April 1998 and 4 March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD433653?dq=%22peter+pfeiffer%22&amp;ei=0YWzT5C4DImA2gWYt8jpCA |title=Patent USD433653 – Exterior surface configuration of a motor vehicle |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=49902291-0001 |title=DPMAregister – Designs – Registerauskunft zum Design |work=dpma.de |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing began in 1997, with development concluding in 2000. The second generation C-Class was introduced in March 2000. The sedan debuted with a range of inline-four and V6 petrol engines and inline-four and -five diesels, later W203's received the V6 diesel. Most of the engines were carried over from the W202, but the C320 was exclusive, offering {{convert|160|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The diesels now featured [[common rail]] [[direct fuel injection]] and [[variable geometry turbocharger]]s. A six-speed manual gearbox was optional on some of the range, With exception to the C320 and C32 AMG.   
Notably (post 2005), for the first time, the number designations were no longer equivalent to the engine displacement, more specifically in the Mercedes C200 (1.8-litre), C240 (2.6-litre) and C200 CDI (2.2-litre).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16067">The '''multiple integrated laser engagement system''', or '''MILES''', is used by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] and other armed forces around the world for training purposes. It uses [[laser]]s and [[Blank (cartridge)|blank cartridge]]s to simulate actual battle.

Individual soldiers carry small laser [[sensor]]s scattered over their bodies, which detect when the soldier has been illuminated by a firearm's laser. Each laser transmitter is set to mimic the effective range of the weapon on which it is used. When a person is "hit", a medic can use the digital readout to determine which first aid method to practice.

Different versions of MILES systems are available to both US and international militaries. The capabilities of the individual systems can vary significantly but in general all modern systems carry information about the shooter, weapon and ammunition in the laser. When this information is received by the target, the target's MILES system uses a random number roll and a casualty probability [[lookup table]] to determine the outcome. For example, a MILES transmitter emulating an [[M16 rifle]] cannot harm an armored personnel carrier (APC), but could still "kill" a commander visible in the hatch of the vehicle.

Vehicles are typically outfitted with a belt of laser sensors or individual wireless detectors. Dismounted soldiers often wear a vest or harness with sensors as well as a "halo" of sensors on their helmets. MILES systems can be coupled with a real-time data link allowing position and event data to be transmitted back to a central site for data collection and display. More sophisticated systems for tanks and APCs exist that use various techniques (including scanning lasers and coupled radio systems) to allow more precise targeting of armored vehicles.

The standard is maintained by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] PEO-STRI branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MCC/|title=Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) Communication Code (MCC) Standard|work=United States Army|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==

MILES was introduced to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for direct-fire, force-on-force training capability at home stations and combat training centers during operational testing in 1978 and 1979 following the conclusion of the US Army's Engineering Development program awarded to Xerox Electro-Optical Systems. The goal of the program was to design and build a tactical training system that simulates the weapons, weapon characteristics and effects of a family of weapon systems including infantry, armor and aircraft, with an initial design of 11 systems including rifles, tank guns, and missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer Engineering Report for MILES, Vol. I, Xerox Electro-Optical Systems, Contract No. N61139-76-C-0060&lt;/ref&gt;

MILES systems used a laser module which was mounted to the barrel of a real weapon, a [[blank-firing adaptor]] for the weapon, and an integrated receiver consisting of sensors on the helmet and load-bearing vests of the soldiers. When a blank shot was fired by a weapon, it caused the laser to fire a coded burst in the direction that the weapon was aimed. If that burst was sensed by the receiver of another soldier, the "hit" soldier's gear beacon made a beeping noise to let them know they were "dead". MILES had serious problems—when hit, the receiver did not prevent the further firing of the weapon, and it was tempting and easy for soldiers to "cheat" by turning the receivers off and back on again, resetting the system and therefore "[[spawning (video gaming)|respawning]]" or "resurrecting" themselves. In addition, no data about the engagement was kept so it was impossible to positively identify who shot whom on the battlefield, a critical piece of information when attempting to develop new tactics. MILES was also very encumbering and soldiers sometimes experienced neck pain when using it.

In 1981, Simulaser Corporation was founded by two entrepreneur engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop "Advanced MILES" training systems&lt;ref&gt;"The New Entrepreneurs," Electronic Engineering Times, July 19, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;. Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as "Advanced MILES" devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit&lt;ref&gt;"Laser Battlefield Simulation Reaches New Levels of Sophistication", Military Electronics/Countermeasures, February 1983&lt;/ref&gt;. Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from "resurrecting" themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player's data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit at the conclusion of the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&amp;G Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Lasers &amp; Applications, January 1985&lt;/ref&gt;. Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser Locator Designator). 
[[File:HGSS1.jpg|thumb|Simulaser's HGSS/GVLLD Simlator]]
[[File:MITS1.jpg|thumb|Simulaser's MITS unit]]
Simulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (Shoot-through Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants&lt;ref&gt;"Battlefield Training in Impaired Visibility", SPIE Vol. 1419, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;.  Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 million&lt;ref&gt;Contract DAAA09-89-C-0752, HQ AMCCOM, 30 August 1989&lt;/ref&gt;, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;News release, Applied Solar Energy Corp., October 13, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Later versions==
Versions made after 1986 used a loud tone to signal when a soldier was "killed". In order to turn off the noise, the soldier had to remove a yellow key from the laser module on his rifle and insert it into the box on his harness. By removing the key from the laser, the weapon could no longer score hits using the MILES system. With some systems the hit soldier is required to lie on his back to stop the noise and signal others that he is "dead".

MILES 2 was released in 1991–92, and the SAWE (simulated area weapons effects) add-on was first fielded in 1992 using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and RF messages so that vehicles and individual soldiers can be killed from a central location due to artillery strikes, or nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons strikes. Implementation in the Summer and Fall of 1992 was at [[Hohenfels, Bavaria|Hohenfels]], Germany at the Combat Maneuver Training Center. In 1993, the range at [[Fort Polk]] was installed and tested. At the time, there were plans to add SAWE at the NTC at [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation|Fort Irwin]], although instead this was implemented by using SAWE-like features via the DCI radio network. This was superseded in aircraft by the implementation of the SMODIM or the [[smart onboard data interface module]] instrumented in 1998 at all three Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, and JMRC).

As of July 2006, the latest version of MILES was MILES XXI, provided by [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|title=Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training &amp; Support (LM STS) - Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) (United States), Land systems - Tactical engagement simulation |url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Simulation-and-Training-Systems/Lockheed-Martin-Simulation-Training--Support-LM-STS--Multiple-Integrated-Laser-Engagement-System-MILES-United-States.html |accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012 the most current version of fully fielded vehicle platform MILES was the Instrumentable multiple integrated laser engagement system combat vehicle tactical engagement simulation system I-MILES CVTESS). This is provided to the US Army by Saab Defense and Security Training and Simulations. It is manufactured at Saab Training in the company's office in Husqvarna, Sweden.  Saab's Main Battle Tank (MBT) Crew Trainer enables the warfighter to perform live precision gunnery and combat training. The MBT Crew Trainer strengthens the entire crew's accuracy and precision. The realism and experience with the tank trainer provides the confidence needed to win the engagement.

I-MILES CVTESS is a laser-based training device to be used on Abrams, Bradley, and opposing forces (OPFOR) tanks and fighting vehicles to provide real-time casualty effects. It is an evolutionary approach for replacing older I-MILES CVTESS equipment currently used in force-on-force training exercises with devices that provide better training fidelity for combat vehicle systems. It reinforces crew duties, reward proper engagement techniques and develop tactical maneuver skills of armor and mechanized infantry combined arms teams up to brigade level. It provides unit commanders an integrated training system in force-on-force and force-on-target training events at homestation training area through instrumented training. The system interfaces with instrumentation systems at maneuver combat training centers (MCTC).

One Shepherd employs the system to teach leadership through the military decision-making process (MDMP) inherent in tactical patrolling operations and small arms gun fighting. MILES provides immediate feedback to students in a safe-to-fail environment, and affords an experiential exploration of leadership.

* In late 2013 One Shepherd purchased MILES IWS (Universal Systems and Technology Inc.) and now employ both variants in their educational program.
* Numerous private training companies have purchased MILES through Homeland Security grant. The terms of the grant significantly restrict the use of MILES by civilian citizens. Nuclear security police contracted under the US Department of Energy represent the largest non-defense market for MILES.
* To date, One Shepherd is the only known private institution to make MILES technology available to American citizens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2219">The '''National Center for Appropriate Technology''' (NCAT) is an American organization headquartered in [[Butte, Montana]], that is dedicated to [[appropriate technology]] and [[sustainability]]. Projects specifically deal with [[sustainable energy]], [[sustainable agriculture]] and food, [[sustainable living]], farm energy, and [[climate change]].

It carries out projects within the [[United States]], especially in poor [[rural area]]s. It has regional offices in Davis, California; Fayetteville, Arkansas; San Antonio, Texas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Keene, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncat.org/offices/&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters is located in the former [[Silver Bow County Poor Farm Hospital]], which is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==ATTRA==
{{Distinguish|Attra}}
Since the farm crisis in the 1980s, NCAT has operated ATTRA ([https://attra.ncat.org attra.ncat.org]), the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service. The program goal is to provide technical assistance to farmers throughout the nation in succeeding with sustainable, organic and regenerative agriculture. The roughly two dozen specialists can assist farmers in everything from pest management and crop selection to farm business planning and marketing. Around 500 publications are available for download on the ATTRA website and the vast majority of them are free. They are based in the latest scientific research and are constantly updated. The website is also home to numerous tutorials, webinars and short videos.

ATTRA was originally an acronym for "Appropriate [[technology transfer|Technology Transfer]] for Rural Areas" which has since fallen out of use and is just "ATTRA".

The '''November Storm of 1995''' ({{lang-sv|Novemberstormen 1995}}) was a [[winter storm|snowstorm]], coming from the [[North Sea]] in mid November 1995. Beginning on Thursday  evening, 16 November 1995, the storm culminated on Friday morning, 17 November, striking against the southern and western parts of [[Sweden]]. The snowstorm decreased during the Friday afternoon, disappearing from Sweden. [[Gothenburg]] with neighbouring places as the strong winds destroyed what had been cleared, creating giant snowdrifts. It wasn't until Tuesday, 21 November 1995, traffic conditions were back to ordinary.

==Deep snow==
Since measurings begun in 1905, several November records for deep snow were broken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/5116.pdf sidan 9 - svenska''] (PDF; 2,7&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Traffic==
The winds broke [[tree]]s. [[Traffic]] was heavily affected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/gt/17-november-1995/ Expressen 17 November 2005, access date: 24 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and people ended up stuck inside their cars. Getting help took a long time ([[mobile telephone]]s had just become common at this time, but were still not in the hands of everyone). For many children, [[Education in Sweden|school]] was canceled, and many people could not get to work.

==Sports==
[[Sport]]s were heavily affected, postponing events to other days, because of problems for clubs traveling to and home from away games. [[Svenska basketligan]] games were moved from Friday to the upcoming days, and the 1995 edition of motorcycle event [[Novemberkåsan]] was moved from the upcoming Sunday until December.

The '''Nowruz''' oil field, in the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Iran]], was the site of several 1983 [[oil spill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Roger Vielvoye|  date=28 Mar 1983 | title =A messy reminder | journal = Oil &amp; Gas Journal| pages = 57| location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1983 oil spills ==
One spill was initially caused by a tanker hitting a platform.&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;{{cite web | author=Emergency Response Division,  Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service | title=Nowruz Oil Field | url=http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6262 | work=IncidentNews | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513003226/http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6262 | archivedate=13 May 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 1983, the platform was attacked by Iraqi helicopters and the spill caught fire. The [[Iran–Iraq War]] prevented technicians from capping the well until 18 September 1983. It was capped with cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Gulf War Blocks Effort to Stop Large Oil Spill| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]| last = Ottaway| first = David B.| page = A25| date = 30 Mar 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwz.cedre.fr/en/Our-resources/Spills/Spills/Nowruz|title=Nowruz - Cedre|website=wwz.cedre.fr|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven people were killed during the capping.

A separate spill occurred when Iraqi helicopters attacked a nearby platform in March 1983. The well was capped in May 1985. Nine men were killed during the capping. Approximately 733,000 barrels (100,000 [[tonne]]s) of oil were spilled because of this incident.&lt;ref name=noaa/&gt;

Overall, 80 million gallons (about 260,000 tonnes) of oil were spilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Oil Spills and Disasters| work= infoplease.com| url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001451.html| accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ouricury wax''' is a brown-colored [[wax]] obtained from the leaves of a Brazilian feather palm ''[[Syagrus coronata]]'' by scraping the leaf surface.

==Harvesting==
Harvesting ouricury wax is more difficult than harvesting [[carnauba wax]], as ouricury wax does not flake off the surface of the leaves.

==Properties and uses==
The physical properties of ouricury wax resemble [[carnauba wax]], so it can be used as a substitute where light color is not required, e.g. in [[carbon paper]] inks, [[molding (process)|molding]] lubricants and [[polishing|polishes]]. Its melting point is 81-84 °C.

The '''PS20 solar power plant''' ('''PS20''')  solar power plant is a [[solar thermal energy]] plant in [[Sanlucar la Mayor]] near [[Seville]] in [[Andalusia]], Spain. It was the world's most powerful solar power tower until the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] in California became operational in 2014. The 20&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[solar power tower]] produces electricity with large movable mirrors called [[heliostat]]s.&lt;ref name="First EU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2007/2007-03-30-02.asp |title= First EU Commercial Concentrating Solar Power Tower Opens in Spain |date= 30 March 2007 |publisher= Environment News Service |accessdate= 20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sev.prnewswire.com/oil-energy/20090427/DC0579027042009-1.html Abengoa Solar Begins Operation of World's Largest Solar Power Tower Plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618073353/http://sev.prnewswire.com/oil-energy/20090427/DC0579027042009-1.html |date=2009-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of PS20 was started in 2006 and it commenced operation in 2009. It features several significant technological improvements over the earlier [[PS10]]. These include a receiver with higher efficiency, various improvements in the control and operational systems, and a better thermal energy storage system.

"PS20 consists of a solar field of 1,255 mirrored heliostats designed by Abengoa Solar. Each heliostat, with a surface area of {{Convert|120|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, reflects the solar radiation it receives onto the receiver, located on the top of a {{Convert|165|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|0}} tower, producing steam which is converted into electricity by a turbine generator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spanishnews.es/20090428-abengoa-solar-puts-its-ps20-solar-tower-into-operation/id=352/ 
 |title= Abengoa Solar puts its PS20 solar tower into operation 
 |date= 28 April 2009 |work= Spanish News |publisher= 
 |accessdate= 20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The remaining power plants will be built over the next few years. They will include low- and high-concentration photovoltaic, tower thermoelectric, parabolic-trough collector and Stirling dish plants. Abengoa Solar's parabolic trough plants, [[Solnova Solar Power Station|Solnova]] 1, 3 and 4, which can generate 150&amp;nbsp;MW of power, are under construction at the [[Solar Platform]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.power-technology.com/projects/Seville-Solar-Tower/ 
 |title= Solar Tower, Seville, Spain
 |work= Power Technology |publisher= Net Resources International
 |accessdate= 20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resulting from cooperation between Ciemat, the IDEA, and the University of Seville, the whole plant is to be completed by 2013, when it will produce approximately 300&amp;nbsp;MW – energy for around 180,000 homes, equivalent to the needs of the city of Seville.
PS20 produces about 48,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt-hour]]s (MW·h) per year, for which it receives €271 (US$360) per MW·h under its [[power purchase agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Petroselinic acid''' is a [[fatty acid]] that occurs naturally in several [[animal fat|animal]] and [[vegetable fats and oils]]. It is a white powder and is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB5355794.htm ChemicalBook]&lt;/ref&gt;  In chemical terms, petroselinic acid is classified as a [[monounsaturated]] [[omega-12 fatty acid|omega-12]] [[fatty acid]], abbreviated with a [[lipid number]] of 18:1 [[cis–trans isomerism|cis]]-6.  It has the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. The term "petroselinic" means related to, or derived from, [[oil]] of ''[[Petroselinum]]'', [[parsley]]. Petroselinic acid is a positional [[isomer]] of [[oleic acid]].

==Occurrence==
Petroselinic was first isolated from parsley seed oil in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E. Vongerichten  |author2=A. Köhler  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Über Petroselinsäure, eine neue Ölsäure | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft| volume = 42 | year = 1909 | pages = 1638–1639 | doi = 10.1002/cber.19090420232 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroselinic acid occurs in high amounts in plants in [[Apiaceae]], [[Araliaceae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. C. Palazzo  |author2=A. Tamburello  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Sopra l'acido iso-oleico dei semi di edera | journal = Atti della Accademia Nazionale die Lincei. Rendiconti. Classe di Science Fisiche, Matematiche e Naturali | volume = 5 | issue = 23 | year = 1914 | pages = 352}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselinia]] (Griseliniaceae)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Breuer |author2=T. Stuhlfauth |author3=H. Fock |author4=H.

Kleiman  |author2=G. Spencer  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Search for new industrial oils | journal = Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society| volume = 59  | year = 1982 | pages = 29–38 | doi = 10.1007/BF02670064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Picramniaceae]], petroselinic acid is accompanied by [[tariric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Tsujimoto  |author2=H. Koyanagi  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = On Nigaki Oil | journal = Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan| volume = 8 | year = 1933 | pages = 161–167 | doi = 10.1246/bcsj.8.161 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, petroselinic acid has been found in minor amounts in several fats of plant and animal origin, including in human sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas Stuhlfauth | title = Chemosystematische Untersuchungen zur Fettsäurezusammensetzung von Frucht- und Samenölen der Pittosporaceen sowie einiger Arten der Rutales und Araliales, dissertation | publisher = University of Kaiserslautern, Germany | year = 1984 | pages = 52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of petroselinic acid as the major fatty acid is used in chemosystematics as a proof of a close relationship of several families within the [[Apiales]] as well as within the [[Garryales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Stuhlfauth |author2=H. Fock |author3=H. Huber |author4=. K. Klug | title = The distribution of fatty acids including petroselinic and tariric acids in the fruit and seed oils of the pittosporaceae, araliaceae, umbelliferae, simaroubaceae and rutaceae | journal = Biochemical Systematics and Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 4  | year = 1985 | pages = 447–453 | doi = 10.1016/0305-1978(85)90091-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides petroselinic acid, oleic acid has been shown to be present in all cases examined.

==Production and chemical behavior==
Fatty acids mostly occur as their [[ester]]s, commonly the [[triglyceride]]s, which are the greasy materials in many natural oils.  Via the process of [[saponification]], the fatty acids can be obtained.

The [[cis-trans isomerism|''trans'' isomer]] of petroselinic acid is called [[petroselaidic acid]].

In chemical analysis, petroselinic acid can be separated from other fatty acids by [[gas chromatography]] of methyl esters; additionally, a separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Breuer, T. Stuhlfauth  |author2=H. P. Fock  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Separation of fatty acids or methyl esters including positional and geometric isomers by alumina argentation thin-layer chromatography | journal = Journal of Chromatographic Science| volume = 25 | year = 1987 | pages = 302–306 | url = http://chromsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/7/302.abstract | doi = 10.1093/chromsci/25.7.302 | issue = 7 | pmid=3611285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Uses==
Petroselinic acid can be used in cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent-de.com/20100211/DE69927466T3.html Kosmetische Verwendung von Petroselinsäure], Patent DE69927466T3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Magnetic rope.svg|thumb|300px|The complex self-constricting magnetic field lines and current paths in a [[Birkeland current]] that may develop in a plasma (''[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch15.htm#250 Evolution of the Solar System]'', 1976) ]]

'''Plasma parameters''' define various characteristics of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], an electrically conductive collection of [[charged particle]]s that responds ''collectively'' to [[electromagnetic force]]s. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged [[ion beam]]s, but may also include dust and grains.&lt;ref&gt;Peratt, Anthony, ''Physics of the Plasma Universe'' (1992);&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviour of such particle systems can be studied statistically.&lt;ref&gt;Parks, George K., ''Physics of Space Plasmas'' (2004, 2nd Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental plasma parameters ==

All quantities are in [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]] ([[Centimetre-gram-second system of units|cgs]]) units except [[energy]] and [[temperature]] expressed in eV and ion mass expressed in units of the [[proton]] mass &lt;math&gt;\mu = m_i/m_p&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is charge state; &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]; &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is wavenumber; &lt;math&gt;\ln\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coulomb logarithm]].

*'''electron collision rate in completely ionized plasmas''':

*'''plasma [[skin depth]]''' (also called the electron [[inertial length]]), the depth in a plasma to which electromagnetic radiation can penetrate:

*'''[[Debye length]]''', the scale over which electric fields are screened out by a redistribution of the electrons:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_D = (kT_e/4\pi ne^2)^{1/2} = 7.43\times10^2\,T_e^{1/2}n^{-1/2}\,\mbox{cm}&lt;/math&gt;
*'''ion inertial length''', the scale at which ions decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma:
:&lt;math&gt;d_i = c/\omega_{pi} = 2.28\times10^7\,Z^{-1}(\mu/n_i)^{1/2}\,\mbox{cm}&lt;/math&gt;
*'''[[mean free path]]''', the average distance between two subsequent collisions of the electron (ion) with plasma components:

by "rays" of glowing plasma which appear to emanate from the gaps in the inner grid.]]
* number of particles in a Debye sphere
:&lt;math&gt;(4\pi/3)n\lambda_D^3 = 1.72\times10^9\,T^{3/2}n^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B^2/8\pi n_im_ic^2 = 26.5\,\mu^{-1}n_i^{-1}B^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Collisionality==
In the study of [[tokamak]]s, '''collisionality''' is a [[dimensionless parameter]] which expresses the ratio of the electron-ion [[collision frequency]] to the banana orbit frequency.

The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] collisionality &lt;math&gt;\nu^*&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Nucl. Fusion, Vol. 39, No. 12 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wenzel, K and Sigmar, D.. Nucl. Fusion 30, 1117 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu^* = \nu_\mathrm{ei}\,\sqrt{\frac{m_\mathrm{e}}{k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{e}}}\,\epsilon^{-3/2}\,qR,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu_\mathrm{ei}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the electron-ion [[collision frequency]], &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the major radius of the plasma, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse [[aspect-ratio]], and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[safety factor]].
The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] parameters &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; denote, respectively, the [[mass]] and [[temperature]] of the [[ions]], and &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Slum clearance''', '''slum eviction''' or '''slum removal''' is an [[urban renewal]] strategy used to transform low income settlements with poor reputation into another type of development or housing. The clearance of the [[slum]] destroys low income homes as well as [[Squatting|illegal squatting]] sites, displacing inhabitants into different housing areas with the intent of breaking up continuous zones of poverty.

This has long been a strategy for redeveloping urban communities; for example [[Slum Clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance plans were required in the United Kingdom]] in the [[Housing Act 1930]]. Similarly the [[Housing Act of 1937]] encouraged similar strategies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=William J. |last=Collins |first2=Katharine L. |last2=Shester |year=2013 |title=Slum Clearance and Urban Renewal in the United States |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=239–73 |doi=10.1257/app.5.1.239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, but not always, these programs were paired with public housing or other assistance programs for the displaced communities.

Critics argue that slum removal by force tends to ignore the social problems that cause slums. Poor families, often including children and working adults, need a place to live when adequate low income housing is not providing otherwise. Moreover, slums are frequently sites of informal economies that provide jobs, services, and livelihoods not otherwise available in the community. Slum clearance removes the slum, but it does not remove the causes that create and maintain the slum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen K. Mayo, Stephen Malpezzi and David J. Gross, Shelter Strategies for the Urban Poor in Developing Countries, The World Bank Research Observer, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Jul., 1986), pages 183–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mangin, Latin American Squatter Settlements: A Problem and a Solution, Latin American Research Review, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Summer, 1967), pages 65–98&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, plans to remove slums in a number of non-Western contexts have proven ineffective without sufficient housing and other support for the displaced communities; for example academics describing such strategies as detrimental in Nigeria, where the slum destruction puts further stress on already short housing stock, in some cases create new slums in other parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sule|first=R. A. Olu|title=Recent slum clearance exercise in Lagos (Nigeria): victims or beneficiaries? |journal=GeoJournal|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=81–91|doi=10.1007/BF02428541|issn=0343-2521|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities have opted for [[slum upgrading]], as an alternative solution: improving the quality of services and infrastructure to match the community developed in the slum.

Slum clearance is still practiced today in a number of different situations. During major international events like conferences and sporting competitions, governments have been known to forcefully clear low income housing areas, as a strategy to impress the international attention in an attempt to reduce the visibility of the host city's apparent poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Greene, Solomon|date=2014-01-01|title=Staged Cities: Mega-events, Slum Clearance, and Global Capital|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol6/iss1/6/|journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Journal|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1548-2596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts at slum clearance have been subject to other motivations, such as repressing political opposition or attempts to keep certain communities in check. For example, Zimbabwe's [[Operation Murambatsvina]] was widely criticized by the international community, including a scathing report from the UN which noted human rights abuses alongside poor design of the program, which was estimated to displace at least 700,000 slum dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6683619.stm|title=Zimbabwe slum evictions 'a crime'|date=2007-05-23|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar module]]s (or panels) are expected to have a long service life between 20 and 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickie |first=P.M. |year=1999 |title=Regional Workshop on Solar Power Generation Using Photovoltaic Technology |publisher=DIANE publishing |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsuwPTFHh8gC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=the+life+of+solar+panels&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8053TrKFPIPQ4QTSuLXFDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20life%20of%20solar%20panels&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must constantly and consistently deliver the power expected. In addition, modules are exposed to a wide array of [[weather conditions]] along with usage in differ [[climates]]. Therefore it is critical to determine if a module is capable of performing over many decades with exposure to differing conditions. Solar modules can be tested through a combination of [[Physical property|physical]] tests, [[laboratory]] studies, and [[numerical analysis|numerical]] [[analyses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hough |first=T.P. |year=2006 |title=Trends in solar energy research |publisher=Nova |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpD-M_ZYMVMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=how+to+test+solar+panel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KElvTrj2MfD04QTz0eTMCQsa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, solar modules need to be assessed throughout the different stages of their [[:wikt:life cycle|life cycle]]. Various companies such as [http://www.southernresearch.org/thermal-renewable-energy-systems/%20Southern%20Research%20Energy%20&amp;%20Environment%5D Southern Research Energy &amp; Environment], [[SGS Consumer Testing Services]], [[TÜV Rheinland]], [[CSA Solar]] International provide services in solar module quality assurance.

== Stages of testing ==
The lifecycle stages of testing solar modules can include: the [[Concept]]ual phase, [[manufacturing]] phase, [[transportation]] and installation, [[Project commissioning|commissioning]] phase, and the in-service phase.

=== Conceptual phase ===
The first stage can involves '''design verification''' where the expected output of the module is tested through computer simulation. Further, the modules ability to withstand natural environment conditions such as [[temperature]], [[rain]], [[hail]],
[[snow]], [[corrosion]], [[dust]], [[lightning]], [[horizon]] and near-shadow effects is tested. The layout for [[design]] and [[construction]] of the module and the quality of components and installation  can also be tested at this stage.

=== Manufacturing phase ===
Inspecting manufacturers of components is carried through visitation. The inspection can include assembly checks, material testing supervision and Non Destructive Testing (NDT). Certification is carried our according to ANSI/UL1703, IEC 17025, IEC 61215, IEC 61646, IEC 61701 and IEC 61730-1/-2.

=== Transportation and installation phase ===
Inspections include pre-dispatch inspection, dimensional control, visual control, and damage control. Documentation and certificates should also be reviewed.

=== Commissioning phase and in-service phase ===
Solar module specialists will ensure that the production has followed correct procedure and ensure there is a save start up.
The in-service phase involves regular inspections of the solar modules to confirm they are performing.

'''''Vanishing Point''''' is a 2012 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary film directed by [[Alberta]] filmmakers and environmental scientists Stephen A. Smith and Julia Szucs, chronicling life in the [[Arctic]] for two remote communities linked by a migration from [[Baffin Island]] to [[Greenland]]. The film is narrated in [[Inuktitut]] by Navarana K'avigak' Sørensen, a polyglot [[Inughuit]] linguist who is the great-great-great-niece of a Baffin Island shaman who had led the migration in 1860.&lt;ref name="Volmers"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/09/29/calgary-international-film-festival-national-film-board-documentary-vanishing-point-offers-environmental-message-with-a-subtle-touch/ | title=Calgary International Film Festival: National Film Board documentary, Vanishing Point, offers environmental message with a subtle touch | work=[[Calgary Herald]] | date=29 September 2012 | accessdate=10 March 2014 | author=Volmers, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the film took Smith and Szucs four years. The filmmakers accompanied Navarana on three hunting trips across the remote north for ''Vanishing Point'', which contrasts traditional life on the tundra with life in modern-day communities. The film also shows the impact of [[Arctic sea ice decline]] on families who still travel the north by dog teams. ''Vanishing Point ''was co-written by Alberta novelist [[Marina Endicott]] and produced by Szucs along with [[David Christensen]] for the NFB. The film premiered at the [[Calgary International Film Festival]] and was nominated for best feature documentary at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]].&lt;ref name="Volmers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CanGeo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=748 | title="Vanishing Point" documentary introduces audience to diverse northern cultures | work=[[Canadian Geographic]] | date=April 24, 2013 | accessdate=10 March 2014 | author=Cadieux-Shaw, Lillianne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20211">[[File:Inside Reading waggon.JPG|thumb| Interior of a Reading vardo, as used by the British Romani (Romanichal), donated to a museum by a family from [[Rhu]].]]

A '''vardo''' (also '''wag(g)on''', '''living wagon''', '''van''', and '''caravan''') is a traditional [[horse]]-drawn [[wagon]] used by British [[Romani people]] as their [[home]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward-Jackson&lt;/ref&gt; Possessing a chimney, it is commonly thought of as being highly decorated, intricately carved, brightly painted, and even gilded. The [[Romanichal|British Romani]] tradition of the vardo is seen as a high cultural point of both artistic design and a masterpiece of woodcrafters art.&lt;ref&gt;Travelling Art: Gypsy Caravans and Canal Barges by Gordon Thorburn and John Baxter 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
The heyday of the living wagon lasted for roughly 70 years, from the mid-1800s through the first two decades of the twentieth century. Not used for year-around living today, they are shown at the Romanichal (British Romani) horse fairs held throughout the year, the best known of which is [[Appleby Horse Fair]].

==Design==

A vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the [[eaves]]. Beyond this characteristic, the six types of caravans differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, where made, and maker.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson73"&gt;Ward-Jackson pp. 73-95&lt;/ref&gt; The roofs of the bow-top and open-lot types are canvas stretched over curved wooden frames; the others are roofed in wood.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson84"&gt;Ward-Jackson pp. 84,88&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1800s, the designs were almost entirely standardized, and some features are common to all types. The door is almost always in the front.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson41"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The small cast-iron cooking stove was invented in America and was available there and in Great Britain from about 1830 on and is a common fixture of the wagons.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson49"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A caravan's chimney is always on its left side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the left side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson75"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The stove rests in a wooden fireplace.

The wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, a chest of drawers, and a glass-fronted china cabinet.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson74"&gt;Ward-Jackson pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have [[clerestories]] which let in light and air.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson52"&gt;Ward-Jackson pp. 49-52&lt;/ref&gt; A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson75"/&gt;  Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colors, and sheathed in places with gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson168"&gt;Ward-Jackson pp. 168-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rumnichal Horse Trotting Cart.jpg|thumb|Romanichal-style trotting cart]]

The [[Romanichal]] had arrived in the [[British Isles]] by 1500 AD,&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson22"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; but they did not begin to live in vardos until around 1850.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson22"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, they traveled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson29"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Originally [[Romanichal]]s would travel on foot, or with light, horse-drawn carts, typical of other Romani groups or would build [[Bender tent|"bender" tents]] — so called because they were made from supple branches which they bent inwards to support a waterproof covering. The heyday of the Romani caravan was the latter part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson51"&gt;Ward-Jackson p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially using castoff horses and even mules to draw their chimneyed living wagons, the Romanichal gradually created a breed of horse known variously as the Gypsy Cob (UK, NZ), [[Gypsy horse|Gypsy Horse]] (US, UK, AU), Coloured Cob (UK, Ireland, parts of continental Europe), Gypsy Vanner (USA, CAN), Tinker Horse (parts of continental Europe), and Irish Cob (Ireland) to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagons were first used as a form of living accommodation (as opposed to carrying people or goods) in France in 1810 by non-Romani circus troupes.&lt;ref name="The New Gypsy Caravan"&gt;''The New Gypsy Caravan'', Timothy Lemke. Published by Lulu.com, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Large transport wagons combined storage space and living space into one vehicle, and were pulled by teams of horses. By the 19th century wagons became smaller, reducing the number of horses required, and around the mid-to-late-19th century (1840–1870), Romanichals in Britain started using wagons that incorporated living spaces on the inside, and added their own characteristic style of decoration. In [[The Old Curiosity Shop]] (ch. xxvii), [[Charles Dickens]] described Mrs. Jarley's well-appointed van:

:'One half of it...was carpeted, and so partitioned off at the further end as to accommodate a sleeping-place, constructed after the fashion of a berth on board ship, which was shaded, like the windows, with fair white curtains... The other half served for a kitchen, and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof. It also held a closet or larder, several chests, a great pitcher of water, and a few cooking-utensils and articles of crockery. These latter necessaries hung upon the walls, which in that portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan, were ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a couple of well-thumbed tambourines.'

These smaller wagons were called "vardo" in the Romani language (originating from the [[Ossetic language|Ossetic word]] ''vurdon'') for cart.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gypsies'', Angus M. Fraser, Blackwell Publishing, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romani ''vardo'' evolved into some of the most advanced forms of travelling wagon, and are prized for their practicality as well as aesthetic design and beauty. There is no more iconic or recognizable Romani symbol than a highly decorated Romanichal vardo, and the time of its use is often affectionately called "the wagon time" by Romanichal travellers. The vardos were typically commissioned by families or by a newlywed couple from specialist coach builders. Building the vardo took between six months to a year; a variety of woods including [[oak]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[elm]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], and [[pine]] were utilized in its construction. Prized by the Romani, and later by non-Romani, including other traveller groups, for their practicality as well as aesthetic beauty, vardos can be categorized into six main styles; these being the '''Brush wagon''', '''Reading''', '''Ledge''', '''Bow Top''', '''Open lot''', and '''Burton'''. The general design evolved over time and were named after the home's owners, for their traditional style (Ledge), for the town of its construction (Reading), or for the name of the builder.

===Burton wagon===
Popular with Romanis, as well as [[Funfair|Showmen]] families, and circus people, the Burton wagon is the oldest example of a wagon used as home in Britain. Originally undecorated, the Burton wagon evolved into an elaborate Romani vardo, but due to its smaller wheels it was not suited for off-road use.

===Brush wagon===
The Brush or ''fen wagon'' as it was also known, consists of a standard Romani vardo, with straight sides and the wheels located outside the body. The Brush was similar in construction to the Reading vardo, but unlike other styles, the brush wagon had two distinct features: a half-door with glazed shutters, located at the back of the vardo, with a set of steps, both set around the opposite way from other wagons &lt;ref&gt;''The English Gypsy Caravan'', C.H. Ward-Jackson &amp; Denis E. Harvey, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and lacked the mollycroft (skylight) on the roof. The exterior is equipped with racks and cases fitted on the outside frame and chase of the wagon allowing the owner to carry trade items like brushes, brooms, wicker chairs, and baskets. Additionally, three light iron rails ran around the entire roof, used for stowing bulkier goods, and sometimes trade-name boards. The wagons were elaborately and colorfully painted.

===Reading wagon===
[[Image:Romanichal wagon.JPG|thumb|Romanichal Reading vardo, early 20th century]]
The Reading or ''kite wagon'' is so named due to its straight sides that slope outwards towards the eaves, high arched wheels, and relative light weight; there is no other vardo that epitomizes the golden age of Romani horse travel. It dates from 1870 and is synonymous with the original builder [[Dunton and Sons of Reading]] from where the vardo takes its name. The wagon was highly prized by the Romanies for its aesthetic design, beauty and practicality to cross fords, pull off road and over rough ground, something smaller-wheeled wagons like the Burton were unable to do. The Reading wagon is 10 feet long, with a porch on the front and back. The rear wheels were 18&amp;nbsp;inches larger than the ones on the front. At the start of the 20th century the design incorporated raised skylights.

On either side of the bed space, quarter-inch thick bevelled mirrors were common, and were lavishly decorated. Cupboards and locker seats were built in to prevent movement whilst travelling. Side and back windows were decorated and shuttered, and the body of the vardo itself would have originally been made from beaded tongue-and-groove matchboard, painted red picked out in yellow and green. As with other vardo, the extent of the elaborate decoration reflected the wealth of the family, boasting carved lion heads and gargoyles; these would have been painted gold or extensively decorated with gold leaf.&lt;ref name="The New Gypsy Caravan" /&gt; Today, surviving Reading wagons are prized exhibits in museums or private collections.

===Ledge wagon===
[[File:Romnichal Wagon.jpg|thumb|Romnichal-style Ledge vardo]]
The characteristic design of the ledge or ''cottage shaped'' wagon incorporated a more robust frame and living area that extended over the large rear wheels of the wagon. Brass brackets supported the frame of the wagon and solid arched roof usually 12 feet high, extended over the length of the wagon to form porches at either end and panelled with tongue in groove boards. The porch roof was further supported by iron brackets, and the walls were highly decorated with ornate scrollwork and carvings across the length of the wagon.

===Bow Top===
Based on the design of the Ledge wagon, the Bow Top is significantly lighter, and less likely to turn over in a strong wind. The design incorporated a lightweight canvas top, supported by a wooden frame: a design reminiscent of the older “bender tents” used by the Romanichal.&lt;ref name="The New Gypsy Caravan" /&gt; Both back and front walls of the wagon were decorated in scrollwork and tongue and groove and the wagon was painted green to be less noticeable in woodland. The inside of the Bow Top also contained the same high scrollwork or [[Chenille fabric]], with a stove, table and double bed.

The bow-top is commonly thought of as being covered in teal-coloured canvas. This is said to now be a tradition which began before World War II when only cotton duck was available.&lt;ref&gt;Hockensmith p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open lot===
Almost identical in size and construction of the Bow Top wagon, the Open lot or ''Yorkshire Bow'' featured the same design but with a curtain instead of the door characteristic of other wagons. [http://gypsywaggons.co.uk/varsuk.htm] The wagon's entrance was covered by a curtain for privacy.

==Decoration and painting==
[[File:Waggon door carving.JPG|thumb|Door carving of a traditional Romanichal ''Chiriklo'' (bird). Reading vardo, early 20th century]]
Vardos were elaborately decorated, hand carved and ornately painted with traditional Romani symbols.  Examples of famous Wagon Artists responsible for the early development of vardo art are Jim Berry, John Pockett, Tom Stevens, Tommy Gaskin, John Pickett, modern contemporary decorators continuing to shape this colourful tradition included artists such as Yorkie Greenwood and Lol Thompson.

Much of the wealth of the vardo was on display in the carvings, which incorporated aspects of the Romani lifestyle such as [[horse]]s and [[dog]]s, as well as stock decorative designs of [[bird]]s, [[lion]]s, [[griffin]]s, flowers, vines and elaborate scrollwork. Carved details were often accented with gold, either painted or, in the most expensive wagons, the use of between 4-15 books of [[gold leaf]] applied as decoration.&lt;ref name="The New Gypsy Caravan" /&gt; Many individual makers were identified by their particular designs.

==Funeral rites==
The Romanichal [[funeral rite]] during the ''wagon time'' of the 19th and 20th century included burning the wagon and belongings after the owner's death.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Life of a Romany Gypsy'', Manfri Frederick Wood, et al. Routledge, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was that nothing whatsoever would have been sold, though some of the deceased's possessions, [[jewellery]], [[Bone china|china]] or money would be left to the family. The rest, including the wagon, was destroyed.

==Modern traditional use==
The Romani travellers in the 1920s proudly clung to their decorative vardos, although the economics of their way of life was in upheaval due to the contraction in the horse-trading industry and the changes from their traditional crafts.&lt;ref name="Gypsy caravans"&gt;''Gypsy caravans'' in ''Journal of the GLS'' (3rd series), 19 (4), pp 114-146, F.G. Huth, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, Romanichals are more likely to live in [[Travel trailer|caravans]]. The tradition does survive, primarily outside Romani culture. It was estimated that by 1940 only about 1% of Romani travellers still lived in the traditional horse-drawn vardo.&lt;ref name="Gypsy caravans" /&gt;

Today's Romanichal still attend horse fairs,&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the best known of which is [[Appleby Horse Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Capstick and Donoghue  2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some attendees of the fairs travel there in the traditional manner via horse-drawn vardos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applebyfair.org/stopping.html|title=Appleby Horse Fair|publisher=applebyfair.org|date=|accessdate=2013-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705021740/http://www.applebyfair.org/stopping.html|archive-date=2012-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American photographer John S. Hockensmith documented such a journey in 2004, travelling with and photographing the Harker family's 60-mile journey to Appleby in bow top living waggons.&lt;ref&gt;Hockensmith 2006 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The famous [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Roald Dahl]] acquired a traditional vardo in the 1960s which was used as a playhouse for his children; later he used the vardo as a writing room, in which he wrote ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vardos of the United Kingdom|url=http://gypsywaggons.co.uk/varsuk.htm|work=Gypsy waggons UK|publisher=ValleyStream Media|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Gilbert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|b|ər|t}}; 24 May 1544 – 30 November 1603),  also known as '''Gilberd''',&lt;ref&gt;While today he is generally referred to as William Gilbert, he also went under the name of William Gilberd. The latter was used in both his and his father's [[epitaph]]s and in the records of the town of Colchester. {{harv|Gilbert|1893|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English physician, physicist and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]]. He passionately rejected both the prevailing [[Aristotelian philosophy]] and the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] method of university teaching.  He is remembered today largely for his book ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600), and is credited as one of the originators of the term "electricity".  He is regarded by some as the father of [[electrical engineering]] or [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]] Collegiate Dictionary, 2000, CD-ROM, version 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A unit of [[magnetomotive force]], also known as [[magnetic potential]], was named the ''[[Gilbert (unit)|Gilbert]]'' in his honour.

Gilbert was born in Colchester to Jerome Gilberd, a borough [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]].  He was educated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GLBT558W|name=Gilbert, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After gaining his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from Cambridge in 1569, and a short spell as bursar of St John's College, he left to practice medicine in London and travelled on the continent.  In 1573, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. In 1600 he was elected President of the College.&lt;ref name=Mottelay&gt;Mottelay, P. Fleury (1893). "Biographical memoir". In {{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|pp=ix–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s own physician from 1601 until her death in 1603, and [[James I of England|James VI and I]] renewed his appointment.&lt;ref name=Pumfrey&gt;{{cite book |last=Pumfrey |first=Stephen |year=2002 |title=Latitude &amp; the Magnetic Earth |publisher=Icon Books |isbn=1-84046-486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

His primary scientific work—much inspired by earlier works of [[Robert Norman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zilsel |first=Edgar |title=The Origin of William Gilbert’s Scientific Method |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=2 |pages=1–32 |year=1941 |jstor=2707279 |url=http://philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/MaterialHS11/PSWissRev/Zilsel1941.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194058/http://philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/MaterialHS11/PSWissRev/Zilsel1941.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roller, Duane H D (1959) ''The De Magnete of William Gilbert'', Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;—was ''[[De Magnete|De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure]]'' (''On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth'') published in 1600. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the [[terrella]]. From these experiments, he concluded that the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]] was itself [[magnetic]] and that this was the reason [[compass]]es point north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star ([[Polaris]]) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass).  He was the first to argue, correctly, that the centre of the Earth was iron, and he considered an important and related property of magnets was that they can be cut, each forming a new magnet with north and south poles.

In [[De Magnete#Book 6, Chapter III: Of the Daily Magnetic Rotation of the Globes|Book 6, Chapter 3]], he argues in support of diurnal rotation, though he does not talk about heliocentrism, stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense  [[celestial spheres]] (doubting even that they exist) rotate daily, as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much smaller Earth. He also posits that the "fixed" stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere. He states that situated "in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity&amp;nbsp;– how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?"

The English word "electricity" was first used in 1646 by [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]], derived from Gilbert's 1600 [[New Latin]] ''electricus'', meaning "like [[amber]]".  The term had been in use since the 13th century, but Gilbert was the first to use it to mean "like amber in its attractive properties".  He recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called "effluvium", which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object, though he did not realize that this substance ([[electric charge]]) was universal to all materials.&lt;ref name="Heathcote"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heathcote |first=Niels H. de V. |doi=10.1080/00033796700203316 |volume=23 |issue=4 |page=261 |title=The early meaning of ''electricity'': Some ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' – I |journal=[[Annals of Science]] |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The electric effluvia differ much from air, and as air is the earth's effluvium, so electric bodies have their own distinctive effluvia; and each peculiar effluvium has its own individual power of leading to union, its own movement to its origin, to its fount, and to the body emitting the effluvium.|{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893}}}}

In his book, he also studied [[static electricity]] using [[amber]]; amber is called ''elektron'' in Greek, so Gilbert decided to call its effect the ''electric force''.  He invented the first electrical [[measuring instrument]], the [[electroscope]], in the form of a pivoted needle he called the ''[[versorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like others of his day, he believed that crystal ([[quartz]]) was an especially hard form of water, formed from compressed ice:

{{quote|Lucid gems are made of water; just as Crystal, which has been concreted from clear water, not always by a very great cold, as some used to judge, and by very hard frost, but sometimes by a less severe one, the nature of the soil fashioning it, the humour or juices being shut up in definite cavities, in the way in which spars are produced in mines.|[[De Magnete]], English translation by [[Silvanus Phillips Thompson]], 1900}}

Gilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing.  For evidence, he (incorrectly) pointed out that, while electrical attraction disappeared with heat, magnetic attraction did not (although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat). [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that both effects were aspects of a single force: electromagnetism. Maxwell surmised this in his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' after much analysis.

Gilbert's [[magnetism]] was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers, such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], seized upon, incorrectly, as governing the motions that they observed.  While not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars, Gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to earth's rotation, and not the rotation of the spheres, 20 years before [[Galileo]] (but 57 years after [[Copernicus]] who stated it openly in his work "[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]" published in 1543 ) (see external reference below). Gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the Moon in the 1590s. His chart, made without the use of a telescope, showed outlines of dark and light patches on the moon's face. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Gilbert believed that the light spots on the Moon were water, and the dark spots land.&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski, Leslie (April 1996) [http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html "A Short History of Lunar Cartography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803073221/http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/s-m/sm-apr-96.html |date=3 August 2010 }}. University of Illinois Astronomical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demundo.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the universe appearing on p202 of De Mundo]]
Besides Gilbert's ''De Magnete'', there appeared at Amsterdam in 1651 a quarto volume of 316 pages entitled ''De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova'' (New Philosophy about our Sublunary World), edited—some say by his brother William Gilbert Junior, and others say, by the eminent English scholar and critic John Gruter—from two manuscripts found in the library of Sir [[William Boswell]]. According to [[John Davy (chemist)|Dr. John Davy]], "this work of Gilbert's, which is so little known, is a very remarkable one both in style and matter; and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality. Possessed of a more minute and practical knowledge of natural philosophy than [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], his opposition to the philosophy of [[Scholasticism|the schools]] was more searching and particular, and at the same time probably little less efficient." In the opinion of [[John Robison (physicist)|Prof. John Robison]], ''De Mundo'' consists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy upon the ruins of the Aristotelian doctrine.&lt;ref name=Mottelay/&gt;

Dr. [[William Whewell]] says in his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1859):&lt;ref&gt;Whewell, William (1859) ''History of the Inductive Sciences''. D. Appleton.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vdQyAQAAMAAJ&amp; Vol. 1]. p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gilbert, in his work, ''De Magnete'' printed in 1600 has only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the earth in some way determines the direction of the earth's axis, the rate of its diurnal rotation, and that of the revolution of the moon about it.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, William ''De Magnete'', Book 6, Ch. 6,7&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert died in 1603, and in his posthumous work (''De Mundo nostro Sublunari Philosophia nova'', 1631) we have already a more distinct statement of the attraction of one body by another.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, William ''De Mundo'', Book 2, Ch. 19&lt;/ref&gt; "The force which emanates from the moon reaches to the earth, and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the earth pervades the region of the moon: both correspond and conspire by the joint action of both, according to a proportion and conformity of motions, but the earth has more effect in consequence of its superior mass; the earth attracts and repels, the moon, and the moon within certain limits, the earth; not so as to make the bodies come together, as magnetic bodies do, but so that they may go on in a continuous course." Though this phraseology is capable of representing a good deal of the truth, it does not appear to have been connected... with any very definite notions of mechanical action in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gilbert died on 30 November 1603 in London.  His cause of death is thought to have been the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/pioneers/gilbert.html William Gilbert] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426151912/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/pioneers/gilbert.html |date=26 April 2007 }}.

Gilbert was buried in his home town, in Holy Trinity Church, Colchester. His marble wall monument can still be seen in this Saxon church, now [[deconsecrated]] and used as a café and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=David|title=Colchester, Holy Trinity Church {{!}} Historic Essex Guide|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/essex/churches/colchester-holy-trinity.htm|website=Britain Express|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary on Gilbert ==
[[Francis Bacon]] never accepted [[Copernican heliocentrism]] and was critical of Gilbert's philosophical work in support of the diurnal motion of the earth. Bacon's criticism includes the following two statements. The first was repeated in three of his works—[[The works of Francis Bacon#Advancement of Learning .28Partition of Sciences.29|''In the Advancement of Learning'']] (1605), ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) and [[The works of Francis Bacon#Advancement of Learning .28Partition of Sciences.29|''De Augmentis'']] (1623). The more severe second statement is from ''History of Heavy and Light Bodies'' published after Bacon's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Park Benjamin, Jr.|Park Benjamin]], [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryelectri01benjgoog ''A History of Electricity''] J. Wiley &amp; Sons (1898) p.327-8&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Alchemists have made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace and Gilbert our countryman hath made a philosophy out of observations of the lodestone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Gilbert] has himself become a magnet; that is, he has ascribed too many things to that force and built a ship out of a shell. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]] writes in his ''History of the Royal Society'' (1812):&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Thomas (1812) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nqjjR4Qt9IgC&amp; ''History of the Royal Society: from its Institution to the End of the Eighteenth Century'']. R. Baldwin. p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magnetic laws were first generalized and explained by Dr. Gilbert, whose book on magnetism published in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the ''Novum Organum'' of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Whewell]] writes in his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1837/1859):&lt;ref&gt;Whewell, William (1859) ''History of the Inductive Sciences from the Earliest to the Present Time''. D. Appleton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNUyAQAAMAAJ&amp; Vol. 2], p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gilbert... repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science [of magnetism], so fully examined, indeed, that even at this day we have little to add to them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Henry Hallam]] wrote of Gilbert in his ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' (1848):&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, Henry (1854) ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the 15th, 16th, and 17th Centuries''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GuATAAAAYAAJ&amp; Vol.2]. Little, Brown, and Company. pp. 232–3&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The year 1600 was the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, ''nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia'' [our new and unprecedented view of the planet]... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a ''[[terrella]]'', or artificial spherical magnet.  ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walter William Bryant of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, wrote in his book [[wikiquote:Kepler|''Kepler'']] (1920):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Gilbert of Colchester, in his “New Philosophy,” founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that “subterranean spirits and humors, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers”. It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], who shared Galileo’s admiration for Gilbert’s work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Walter William (1920) {{ws | [[s: Kepler|''Kepler'']]}}. The Macmillan Company. {{ws | [[s: Kepler/Chapter 5#35|p. 35]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
