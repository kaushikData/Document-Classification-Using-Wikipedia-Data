The '''4–4–5 calendar''' is a method of managing [[accounting]] periods, and is a common calendar structure for some industries such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

The 4–4–5 calendar divides a year into four quarters of 13 weeks grouped into two 4-week "months" and one 5-week "month". The grouping of 13 weeks may also be set up as 5–4–4 weeks or 4–5–4.

When this type of calendar is in use, reports with month-by-month comparisons or [[Financial analysis|trends]] are flawed as one month is 25% longer than the other two. It could still compare a period to the same period in the prior year, or use week by week data comparisons.

Its major advantage over a regular calendar is that the end date of the period is always the same day of the week, which is useful for shift or manufacturing planning as every period is the same length.

A disadvantage of the 4–4–5 calendar is that it has only 364 days (7 days x 52 weeks), meaning a 53rd week will need to be added every five or six years: this can make year-on-year comparison difficult.

== 52–53-week fiscal year ==
The 52–53-week [[fiscal year]] is a variation on the 4–4–5 calendar.  It is used by companies that desire that their fiscal year always end on the same day of the week.  Any day of the week may be used, and Saturday and Sunday are common because the business may more easily be closed for counting inventory and other end-of-year accounting activities.  There are two methods in use:

=== Last Saturday of the month at fiscal year end  ===
Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the final Saturday (or other day selected) in the fiscal year end month.  For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 25 to August 31.  In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 25 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 1.  In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:

* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-5}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-4}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-3}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+0}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+2}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+4}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+5}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+6}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+7}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+8}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+9}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+10}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}

The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date seven days before the end of the month (August 24 in this case) or earlier.  At that point it resets to the end of the month (August 31) or earlier and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52.  In this example the fiscal years ending in 2013, 2019, and 2024 have 53 weeks.

=== Saturday nearest the end of month ===

Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the Saturday (or other day selected) that falls closest to the last day of the fiscal year end month.  For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 28 to September 3.  In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 28 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 4.  In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:

* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-5}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-4}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-3}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+0}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+2}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+4}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+5}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+6}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+7}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+8}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+9}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+10}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}

The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date four days before the end of the month (August 27 in this case) or earlier.  At that point the first Saturday in the following month (September 3 or earlier in this case) becomes the date closest to the end of August and it resets to that date and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52.  In this example the fiscal years ending in 2016, 2022, and 2028 have 53 weeks.

The 52–53 week method is permitted by [[generally accepted accounting principles]] in the United States, by US [[Internal Revenue Code]] Regulation 1.441-2 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 C.F.R. § 1.441-2|url=http://law.justia.com/cfr/title26/26-6.0.1.1.1.0.2.3.html|work=JUSTIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IRS Publication 538).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/ar02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The '''behavioral theory of the firm''' first appeared in the 1963 book ''A Behavioral Theory of the Firm'' by [[Richard Cyert|Richard M. Cyert]] and [[James G March|James G. March]].&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{harvnb|Ahuja|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work on the behavioral theory started in 1952 when March, a political scientist, joined [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where Cyert was an economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Week’s Citation Classic|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1979/A1979HS08700001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this model was formed, the existing theory of the firm had two main assumptions: profit maximization and perfect knowledge. Cyert and March questioned these two critical assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyert March Review |author=Zhang |url=http://www.faculty.som.yale.edu/shyamsunder/.../CyertMarchReviewZhang.doc }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''A behavioral model of rational choice'' by [[Herbert A. Simon]] paved the way for the behavioral model.&lt;ref name=hs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert |title=A behavioral model of rational choice |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=69 |issue=1 |date=February 1955 |url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/bounded.pdf |pages=99–118 |doi=10.2307/1884852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahuja|2007|p=938}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neo-classical economics|Neo-classical]] economists assumed that firms enjoyed perfect information. In addition the firm maximized profits and did not suffer from internal resource allocation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Nelson’s Dynamic Capabilities|url=http://professor-murmann.net/nelsonfest/teecerev.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the behavioral approach also challenged the omission of the element of uncertainty from the conventional theory. The behavioral model, like the managerial models of [[Oliver E. Williamson]] and Marris,
considers a large corporate business firm in which the ownership is separate from the management.&lt;ref name=a939&gt;{{harvnb|Ahuja|2007|p=939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyert and March===
These researchers offered four major research themes:&lt;ref name=mah&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavioral Theory of the Firm|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/5029_Mahoney_Chapter_1.pdf |last=Mahoney |first=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A small number of key economic decisions
*Development of a general theory, generalizing the results from studies of specific firms
*Linkage of empirical data to models
*Orientation towards process rather than outcomes

==Model framework==

===Theory construction===
The behavioral approach takes the firm as the basic unit of analysis. It attempts to predict behaviour with respect to price, output and resource allocation decisions. It emphasizes the decision making process.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;

===The firm as a coalition of groups===
The theory argues that while small firms may operate under the guidance of the [[entrepreneur]], such a simple model does not describe larger corporations. These larger firms are coalitions of individuals or groups, which may include managers, stockholders, workers, suppliers and so on.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;

According to Cyert and March, these groups participate in setting goals and making decisions. Priorities and information may vary by group, potentially creating conflicts. Cyert and March mentioned five goals which real world firms generally possess: production; inventory; market share; sales and profits.

According to the behavioral theory, all the goals must be satisfied, following an implicit order of priority among them.&lt;ref name=a939/&gt;

===Satisficing behaviour===
Cyert and March proposed that real firms aim at [[satisficing]] rather than maximizing their results. I.e., some groups may settle for "good enough"  achievements rather than striving for the best possible outcome. This came from a concept known as [[bounded rationality]], which was developed by Herbert Simon.&lt;ref name=hs/&gt;
Bounded rationality means prudent behaviour under a given set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BUSINESS ECONOMICS|isbn=978-81-87344-86-5|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model goals are not set to maximize relevant magnitudes such as profits,sales and market share. Instead, goals are compromises negotiated by the groups.&lt;ref name=cm942&gt;{{harvnb|Ahuja|2007|p=942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The process of decision making===
In the model, top management sets the goals of the organization. But these goals are implemented through decision making at two levels, one at the top and the second at lower management levels. During approval of proposals of various departments, two criteria are generally employed. A financial measure assesses the availability of the required funds given resources. An improvement measure assesses whether the proposal improves the health of the organization. According to Cyert and March, information is required to take the most appropriate decisions. However, information gathering itself is not costless and requires resources.&lt;ref name=cm942/&gt;

===Organizational slack===
To keep the various groups in the organization, payments had to be in excess of what was required for the efficient working of the firm. The difference between the total resources and the necessary payments is called the organizational slack. In conventional economic theory organizational slack is zero, at least at equilibrium. Cyert and March claim that organizational slack plays a stabilizing and adaptive role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cyert|march|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyert and March gave many examples of organizational slack such as high dividends paid to shareholders, prices set lower than necessary and wages paid in excess of those required.

==Critical evaluation==
The behavioral model made a great impact on the theory of the firm. It gave insights in the process of goal formation and fixation of aspiration levels and resource allocation. Its critics{{who|date=January 2012}} claim that the theory is unnecessarily complicated. The virtual assembly of the firm, with the decision making process as the unit, for the purpose of predicting their behaviour is highly questioned by critics. There has also been staunch support for profit maximization rather than satisficing behaviour, which is one of the core elements of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahuja|2007|p=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
The behavioral theory of the firm has become important for much later research in organization theory and management, and has led to empirical studies and simulation modeling in organizational learning, as well as work on the cognitive foundations of firm strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt and March 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavetti et al. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aberdeen International Business Park''' (AIBP) is a major commercial building project located on the south eastern edge of [[Aberdeen International Airport]], at [[Dyce]], with direct road links to the Scottish motorway network, and close to [[Dyce railway station]]. The park's 40 acres will eventually provide up to 92,000 sq m of development, including offices, shops, leisure facilities and at least one 4-star hotel.

AIBP's first phase set records in 2014 as Scotland's biggest single office-letting deal, after Norwegian oilfield services giant [[Aker Solutions]] leased 31,100 sq m of space, including its own purpose-built leisure facilities.

== Amenities ==
The current Phase 1 building includes:
* Coffee Shop
* Restaurant
* Juice Bar
* Nursery
* Gym
* Sports Hall
* Outdoor Sports Pitch
* Squash Courts

== History of the site ==
Plans for the [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route]] (AWPR) outlined in early 2013's [http://\www.aberdeenairport.com/about-us/master-plan/ Aberdeen Airport Master Plan], opened up access to 93 acres of farmland to the south east of the airport.

Also contained in the plan was the construction of a link road between Dyce Drive and the existing A96 as part of the expansion of [[Aberdeen Airport]] at Dyce, making this parcel more accessible both to the airport and the wider road network to the city of [[Aberdeen]] and beyond.

The [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route]] is now expected to be completed in Winter 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/project/aberdeen-western-peripheral-route-balmedie-tipperty |title=Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route / Balmedie to Tipperty |publisher=Transport Scotland |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117123025/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/project/aberdeen-western-peripheral-route-balmedie-tipperty |archive-date=17 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Craibstone and Dyce Junctions scheduled to open by Autumn 2016. The Balmedie to Tipperty section will follow by Spring 2017.

This dual carriageway should significantly reduce congestion and improve accessibility to the wider Dyce area. The City Council is also constructing a new six-lane Airport Link Road (ALR) connecting Aberdeen Airport and AIBP with the A96 and AWPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk/PlanningDetail.asp?ref=150563 |title=Planning and Sustainable Development |publisher=Planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen City Council's planning committee approved Aberdeen International Business Park’s first phase in June 2013, to include 27,400 sq m of office space and 3,700 sq m of leisure space, containing dining facilities, a day nursery, fitness amenities and a small shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/CouncilNews/ci_cns/pr_InternationallBusinessPark_130613.asp |title=Plans for first phase of Aberdeen International Business Park approved |publisher=Aberdeencity.gov.uk |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire 31,100 sq m was leased to Norwegian oilfield services giant [[Aker Solutions]] in August 2014 in what was Scotland's single largest office leasing deal. The initial rent, under the 20-year lease, was struck at almost £8 million per annum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCulloch |first=Scott |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-property/20-year-lease-agreement-take-three-4038759 |title=The 20-year lease agreement to take all three buildings in phase one believed to be the largest ever office lease deal concluded in Scotland |publisher=Daily Record |date=2014-08-12 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developer of AIBP is Abstract Group. The architect for Phase 1 was Keppie Design and the site contractors were Bowmer &amp; Kirkland.

In May 2015, plans to relocate the [[Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre]] from its current Bridge of Don site to a nearby plot at the junction of Dyce Drive and the main A96 trunk road, next to the [[Rowett Institute]], were presented to the city council. AECC is Aberdeen's largest Conference Centre and home to the biennial [[Offshore Europe]] exhibition, a major conference in the global oil and gas calendar.

The £333 million project is a joint venture between Aberdeen City Council and developer [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]]. Work is expected to start by mid-2016, with completion in late 2018.

'''Boris Mikšić''' (born 11 October 1948 in [[Zagreb]]) is a Croatian businessman and politician.

Mikšić was born in [[Zagreb]], then part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. He graduated from the [[University of Zagreb]] Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in 1973. He then emigrated to the United States of America, settling in [[Minnesota]] where he gradually began his business, [[Cortec Corporation]].&lt;ref name="izbori-dnevnik-hr"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the years he became one of the wealthiest Croatian Americans. He first ventured into the Croatian politics as an independent candidate in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary elections]].

In 2005, he ran as an independent candidate on the [[Croatian presidential elections, 2005|Croatian presidential elections]]. His campaign was partially based on his autobiography ''Američki san dečka s Trešnjevke'' (American dream of a kid from [[Trešnjevka]]) that he had published in 1994 - creating image of a simple Zagreb youth, who fulfilled the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref name="izbori-dnevnik-hr"/&gt; It was also based on his opposition to the [[ICTY]] and [[Eurosceptic]] views. His success story along with his self-funded American-style campaign brought a new perspective to many voters.

On 2 January, to the surprise of many, first election projections showed him as winning 2nd place, knocking the government's candidate [[Jadranka Kosor]] out of the race. Immediately, many commentators began to interpret his success as a protest vote against the Croatian political establishment, engulfed in corruption and being notoriously inefficient. As if Mikšić, already wealthy has been seen by voters as more decent and less corruptible candidate.

Few hours later, new projections, based on the votes cast by Croatian citizens in neighboring [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], brought Jadranka Kosor to the 2nd place. Mikšić was surprised as was the most of Croatian public. At first he refused to accept results and blamed the failure on alleged vote fraud, and "dead people voting".&lt;ref name="izbori-dnevnik-hr"/&gt;
He called supporters to demonstrate on streets over the alleged fraud, inspired by the, at the time current, [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine. He later called off planned demonstrations, citing his respect for the law and wanting to prevent incident and possible casualties brought on by the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the presidential elections, Mikšić continued to challenge the results, bringing allegations of voter fraud. He requested vote recounts from Croatia's Constitutional Court stating that many deceased people were not only registered to vote but also cast votes in the election; a problem that the Croatian government has faced multiple times.&lt;ref name="20 Percent Dead Voters on Voter Lists in Diaspora"&gt;{{cite web

He continued to pursue Croatian politics, announcing his candidacy in local elections, including those for Zagreb City Assembly. Mikšić's campaigning appeared to have effect within the [[Zagreb local elections, 2005|2005 local elections]]. His slate did enter the Zagreb City Assembly, but with only three seats, which was fewer than he expected.

Mikšić entered into the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009–2010]], but was eliminated in the first round with 2.1% of the vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55014">'''Business valuation''' is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the [[valuation (finance)|economic value]] of an owner's interest in a business.  [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is used by financial market participants 
to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business.  In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Benny K.

== Standard and premise of value ==
{{see also|Business valuation standard}}
Before the value of a business can be measured, the valuation assignment must specify the reason for and circumstances surrounding the [http://bvint.com/ business valuation]. These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F. Reilly |author3=Robert P. Schweihs   | title = Valuing a Business | publisher = McGraw Hill | series = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2000  | doi =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO6wd8O8dsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shannon+pratt&amp;ei=fcfUR6q-F4TCyQSrxfWABA&amp;sig=Fpqt8pGRjbLPZJ9e_QEQGFzQ7y0#PPA913,M1  | isbn = 0-07-135615-0 }} hmegrii
&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued.  The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).

== Standards of value ==

* Fair market value – a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.
* Investment value – a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.
* Intrinsic value – the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.

==Premises of value==

* Going Concern – Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.
* Assemblage of assets – value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.
* Orderly disposition – value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. 
* Liquidation – value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.

Premise of value for fair value Calculation

* In use – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.
* In Exchange – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. 
Business valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.

Note, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.

These assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.

== Elements of business valuation ==

=== Economic conditions ===

{{Globalize/US|date=March 2011}}

A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.
A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.

=== Financial analysis ===
The [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.

It is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.
Cash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.

=== Normalization of financial statements ===
The key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:
* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].
* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.
* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.
* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.

=== Income, asset and market approaches ===
Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.

In certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].

In determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.

== Income approach ==
The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows ("[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.

However, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.

=== Discount or capitalization rates ===
A [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.

* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected [[cash flow]]s. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.
* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate [[cash flow]]s, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.

There are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.

Capitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.

==== Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) ====
The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with "beta", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.

One of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.

===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====
With regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:

* Models of the Q theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fama–French three-factor model]]
* [[Carhart four-factor model]]
* Fama-French five-factor model

Nevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleißner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.

====Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model====
The Cost of Equity (Ke) is computed by using the Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model (Mod. CAPM)

&lt;math&gt;k_e  = R_f + \beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt;   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)

&lt;math&gt;k_e&lt;/math&gt;   =   Cost of Equity

&lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt;   =    Market Rate of Return

SCRP = Small Company Risk Premium

CSRP= Company specific Risk premium

==== Weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") ====
The [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net [[cash flow]] to total invested capital.

One of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.

Indeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.

Once the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax [[cash flow]], aftertax [[cash flow]], pretax [[net income]], after tax [[net income]], excess earnings, projected [[cash flow]], etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.

Careful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net [[cash flow]] is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.

==== Build-Up Method ====
The Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a "build-up" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.

Similarly, investors who invest in small cap stocks, which are riskier than blue-chip stocks, require a greater return, called the "size premium." Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] &amp; Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills &amp; Inflation and [[Duff &amp; Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.

By adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the "systematic risks." This type of investment risk cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.

In addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include "unsystematic risk" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns.

Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. One of those categories is the "industry risk premium". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.

The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as "company specific risk." Historically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:

Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta*equity risk premium
TCOE = risk-free rate + beta*equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium

The only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.

While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the following equation: TCOE = risk-free rate + Total beta*equity risk premium.

It is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.

It is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.

[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)

== Asset-based approaches ==
The value of asset-based analysis of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.
The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.
In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.

Adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a "sanity check" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...

== Market approaches ==
{{main|Valuation using multiples}}

The market approach to business valuation is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the "comparable sales" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.

The difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.

When there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.

=== Guideline Public Company method ===
Guideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a "multiple." If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.

However, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.

==Option pricing approaches==
[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"&gt;[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].&lt;/ref&gt; For general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|#"Valuing flexibility"]] under [[corporate finance]], and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; for detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|#"Limitations"]] under [[real options valuation]].

In general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637–654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]&lt;/ref&gt; and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.&lt;ref name="Damodaran2"&gt;Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].&lt;/ref&gt;  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"/&gt; Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principal–agent problem]]s;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; see [[Principal–agent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principal–agent problem]].)

Certain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|"Applications"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's "Real Options"?]&lt;/ref&gt; Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare [[Price–earnings ratio#PVGO|PVGO]].

A common application is to [[natural resource]] investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135–157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the [[underlying|underlying asset]] is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the [[Commodity market|price of the commodity in question]].  The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|developing the resource]]. Where positive ("[[in the money]]") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].  A [[:Category:Mining companies|resource firm]] may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].

Product [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents — typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors — can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alonso, V. Azofra, and G. de la Fuente. (2006).

[http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eurman/v20y2002i5p512-526.html Stock Market Valuation with Real Options: lessons from Netscape]&lt;/ref&gt;  As regards the option analysis, since the patent provides the firm with the right to develop the product, it will do so only if the [[present value]] of the expected cash flows from the product exceeds the cost of development, and the patent rights thus correspond to a [[call option]]. See [[Patent valuation#Option-based method|Patent valuation § Option-based method]]. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.

== Cultural valuation method ==
Besides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.

== Discounts and premiums ==
The valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.
Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the "levels of value". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.
The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies – small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.
Controlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.
Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less "liquid" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.
Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.
Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.

=== Discount for lack of control ===
The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:
MID = 1 – [1 / (1 + CP)]
The most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the "control premium" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&amp;A transaction.
While it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.

=== Discount for lack of marketability ===
A "discount for lack of marketability" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.&lt;ref name=IRSpub&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WillDLOM&gt;http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.&lt;ref&gt;Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: "Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Several empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. &lt;ref&gt;Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==== Restricted stock studies ====
Restricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.
The underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.

==== Option pricing ====
In addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.
Studies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.

==== Pre-IPO studies ====
Another approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

=== Applying the studies ===
The studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.
The referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).

== Estimates of business value ==
The evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are "publicly traded," meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated "market capitalization" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded "over the counter" or in "pink sheets"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.

A number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, &amp; Moore, "Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., "Value of Private Businesses in the United States," Business Economics (2009) 44, 87–108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.

'''Chua Cheng Bok''' ({{zh|t=|s=蔡正木|p=Cài Zhèng Mù}}) was one of Malaysia’s most prominent businessmen in the first half of the 20th century, and opened the region’s first cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=At the Coliseum Theatre|journal=The Straits Times|date=14 May 1932|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Malacca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Chua-Cheng-Bokmr-Chua-Cheng-Bok-64111672.html|title=Chua Cheng BokMr Chua Cheng Bok Essay - 393 Words|work=StudyMode|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1880 as the second son of an immigrant family coming from [[Fujian|Fukien]], ([[Fujian]] Province). His father Mr. Chua Toh started his life as nutmeg dealer in his young age. He had five sons: Chua Cheng Tuan (the eldest), Chua Cheng Bok, Chua Cheng Hee, Chua Cheng Hock and Chua Cheng Liat. Chua Toh died in 1908 and was buried in [[Bukit Cina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Librarian|first1=Rojak|title=Chua Cheng Hock (Bukit Brown)|url=http://mymindisrojak.blogspot.com/2012/04/chua-cheng-hock-bukit-brown.html|website=mymindisrojak.blogspot|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his older brother, Chua Cheng Tuan, Chua Cheng Bok worked for Riley, Hargreaves and Co and Federated Engineering for a few years. They started their first business, [[Federal Stores]], before forming the [[Cycle and Carriage]] in Kuala Lumpur on July 15, 1899. In the early 1900s, the Cycle and Carriage business was successful. It opened a branch under the name of C&amp;C Co in Singapore in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon|first1=Eli|title=Motoring Archives - Cycle &amp; Carriage Co.|url=http://www.currypotproductions.com/CNCLtd-History.htm|website=currypotproductions.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chua Cheng Bok was a [[philanthropist]]. Some famous buildings built by him are the oldest cinema in Malaysia, the [[Coliseum Theatre (Kuala Lumpur)|Coliseum Theater]] and Café in Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, the Chua Cheng Bok Building in Ipoh, and [[Bok House]] in Jalan Ampang (demolished in 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Commercial bribery''' is a form of [[bribery]] which involves corrupt dealing with the agents or employees of potential buyers to secure an advantage over business competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] 7th. ed. 1999, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[corruption]] which does not necessarily involve government personnel or facilities.

One common type of commercial bribery is the [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]]. For example, a seller of goods or services from "Company A" who offers the [[purchasing manager]] of "Company B" a payment to his own account to help him secure a contract for Company B's continued business is engaging in a form of commercial bribery.

Other related offenses are [[payola]] in the [[entertainment industry]], [[match fixing]] in sports, corruption of [[labor union]] officials, and [[bid rigging]] in non-governmental contracts.

==United States law==
There is no [[United States Code|federal statute]] that by its terms expressly prohibits commercial bribery, though it is mentioned as part of the definition of [[aggravated felony]] for the purposes of [[List of United States immigration laws|United States immigration law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|8|1101}}(a)(43)&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually punishable as a [[felony]] under [[State law (United States)|state law]], depending on circumstances, but only 36 U.S. states have laws specifically prohibiting commercial bribery. Among them are [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/PEN/3/1/15/2/s641.3|title=California Penal Code - PEN § 641.3 - FindLaw|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delaware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/decode/11/5/III/881|title=DEL CODE § 881  : Delaware Code - Section 881: BRIBERY; CLASS A MISDEMEANOR|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter271/Section39|title=General Laws|work=malegislature.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]],{{Cite NJSA |title=2C|chapter=21|section=10|citeonly=true}} [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/PE/7/32/D/32.43|title=TEX PE. CODE ANN. § 32.43  : Texas Statutes - Section 32.43: COMMERCIAL BRIBERY|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the federal [[mail and wire fraud]] statutes &lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|1341}} and {{usc|18|1343}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to prosecute commercial bribery as a "scheme or artifice to defraud" if the mail or interstate wire facilities are used.  In addition, use of the mails or interstate travel or communication in furtherance of a violation of state commercial bribery laws may be prosecutable in [[United States district courts|Federal court]] under the [[Travel Act]].&lt;ref name=Emmick&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmick |first=Mike |title=The Travel Act – The FCPA's red-haired stepchild |url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/Insight/2012/02_-_February/The_Travel_Act_%E2%80%93_The_FCPA_s_red-haired_stepchild/ |work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209010519/http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/Insight/2012/02_-_February/The_Travel_Act_%E2%80%93_The_FCPA_s_red-haired_stepchild/ |archivedate=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the penalties under the federal statutes may exceed the state penalties, and the federal investigative and enforcement agencies may have superior resources, often federal prosecution is favored.

New York's law against commercial bribery is contained in Article 180 of the state's penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/K/180|title=NY Code - Article 180: BRIBERY NOT INVOLVING PUBLIC SERVANTS, AND RELATED OFFENSES|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most extensive state laws against commercial bribery in the United States, and includes prohibitions against bribing labor officials, fixing sports contests, and rent gouging.

'''Contract failure''' describes a situation in which the consumer of a good or service is unable to evaluate its quality, thus incentivizing the producer to produce a lower quality good or service.&lt;ref name="(W.)Steinberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Powell (W.)|author2=Richard Steinberg|title=The nonprofit sector: a research handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ligvL-cLFIEC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10903-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such behavior creates suboptimal economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Benson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Benson|title=The Theory of Contract Law: New Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GSf6QGASEoC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=5 February 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64038-1|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contract failure is one explanation for the existence of [[non-profit organization]]s,&lt;ref name="Anheier2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmut K.

== Information Asymmetry ==
The known cause of contract failure is called [[information asymmetry]]; when one party (the producer) has more information than the other party (the consumer) about a product or service.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=D|title=Contract Failure. In The Nature of the Nonprofit Sector|date=1998|publisher=West View|location=Philadelphia|pages=154–157|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is information inequality between the two parties.&lt;ref name=Arrow&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrow|first1=J.K.|title=Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care.|journal=The American Economic Review|date=1963|pages=941–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Young, there are three causes in which situations dealing with asymmetric information arise from, to include the following, 1) the quality of a product or service is too complex to be judged such as medical care or higher education; 2) the end consumer of the product or service cannot evaluate it him or herself such as a child in daycare or an elderly individual in a nursing home; and 3) the product or service is not consumed by the individual who purchased it, therefore the purchaser would never know if the producer delivered what was promised.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

== Nonprofit Existence ==
When contract failure occurs, there is a suboptimal provision of public goods, which results in market failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisbrod|first1=B.A.|title=Economics of Institutional Choice|journal=Working Paper|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow argues that nonprofits will step in and provide the necessary good or service in response to market failure.&lt;ref name="Arrow"/&gt; When markets potentially take advantage of the information asymmetry situation, nonprofits must protect the consumer.&lt;ref name=ihlan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ihlan|first1=H.|title=Nonprofit Organizations as Providers of Public Goods.|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Economics|date=2013|volume=20|issue=1|pages=95–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Distribution Constraint ==
According to Hansmann, the “non-distribution constraint - prohibits the distribution of residual earnings to individuals who exercise control over the firm”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansmann|first1=H.B.|title=The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise.|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1980|volume=5|page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prohibits those who have a vested interest in the organization from receiving the organization’s profit for personal gain. This constraint is a common characteristic of nonprofits, which creates less of an incentive for the organization to take advantage of the consumer’s lack of knowledge. The nonprofit has no reason to cheat the consumer out of quality or service delivery because the organization's individuals cannot benefit directly. Therefore, the consumer is more likely to trust a nonprofit organization providing services than to trust a for-profit organization because of the nonprofit’s non-distribution constraint.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; According to Easley and O'Hara, state law stipulates that the organizations day-to-day costs should be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easley|first1=D.|last2=O'Hara|first2=M.|title=The Economic Role of the Nonprofit Firm|journal=The Bell Journal of Economics|date=1983|pages=531–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DNAinfo''''' was an [[online newspaper]] that focused on neighborhood news in [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]]. It was closed down by CEO and owner [[Joe Ricketts]] in November 2017 after writers in its New York branch voted to [[labor unions in the United States|unionize]], a move to which Ricketts was opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/nyregion/dnainfo-gothamist-shutting-down.html|title=DNAinfo and Gothamist Are Shut Down After Vote to Unionize|first1=Andy|last1=Newman|first2=John|last2=Leland|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=2 November 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by [[Joe Ricketts]] in November 2009 as "Digital Network Associates",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/|title=Digital Network Associates (DNA)|date=23 February 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223143530/http://www.dnainfo.com/|archivedate=23 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNAinfo.com began by offering online, hyperlocal coverage for New York City and online coverage for Chicago launched in November 2012.&lt;ref name="CrainsNY 2010 Dec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYObserver 2010 May" /&gt;&lt;ref name="POLITICOMedia beta 2012 Nov 26" /&gt; In December 2013, ''DNAinfo'' launched a print version coverage by the name, ''DNAinfo.com.''&lt;ref name="Lazare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lazare|first1=Lewis|title=DNAinfo reaching out with a very traditional approach|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2013/12/09/dnainfo-tries-to-extend-it-reach-via.html|website=[[Chicago Business Journal]]|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operational and editorial offices for ''DNAinfo'' were in New York and Chicago. ''DNAinfo'' is also a registered trademark.&lt;ref name="USPO SN 85965526" /&gt;

In March 2017, DNAinfo purchased the New York media company [[Gothamist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/dnainfo-is-buying-gothamist/|title=DNAinfo Is Buying Gothamist|website=Adweek.com|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2017, Ricketts posted to both DNAinfo and the "-ist" network sites that both websites would immediately cease operations, a week after Gothamist writers voted to unionize with the [[Writers Guild of America, East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2017/11/02/ricketts-shuts-dnainfo/|title=Ricketts shuts down DNAinfo|last=Feder|first=Robert|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All content from all DNAinfo sites and all subsidiary sites were taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/nyregion/dnainfo-gothamist-shutting-down.html|title=DNAinfo and Gothamist Are Shutting Down|last=Newman|first=Andy|date=November 2, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 2, 2017|last2=Leland|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, archives of the sites were returned to functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1119220/the-archives-of-dnainfo-gothamist-chicagoist-laist-and-shanghaiist-are-not-deleted/|title=DNAInfo’s and Gothamist’s archives still exist and are likely to be resurrected|last=Yanofsky|first=David|date=2017-11-03|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts's shutdown was criticized as being an act of retaliation after the two companies' workers had joined a union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/dnainfo-gothamist-ricketts-union.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Billionaire Destroyed His Newsrooms Out of Spite|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|date=2017-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto''''' written by [[Benedetto Cotrugli]] around 1400 was the first [[bookkeeping]] [[manuscript]] and trade manual.&lt;ref name="item 1441"&gt;[[#Anzovin|Anzovin, 2000]], p. 36, item 1441&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been translated in English by the alternate names of ''Of commerce and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="item 1441"/&gt; ''On merchantry and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html History of Croatian Science, 15th-19th centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On trade and the perfect dealer.''&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"&gt;[http://www.oxbridgewriters.com/essays/accounting/financial-accounting-accountants.php Essay title - Financial Accounting And Accountants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several historians show that, since the manuscript was written in 1458, it is the oldest known manuscript on the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], and, as such, predates [[Luca Pacioli]]'s book by at least 36 years.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"&gt;[http://www.promonegocios.net/contabilidad/historia-contabilidad.html Accounting History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html SIESC 2007 in CROATIA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"&gt;''In Chapter XIII of the 1st book is called "order to keep " the records marketable '. There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: "..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, "that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa" rare. " However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping.'' [[#Alfieri|Alfieri, 1891]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445–1517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/evolucion-historica-de-la-contabilidad.html Historical evolution of accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paciolicode.com/ 3.

The first English translation of the Libro de l'arte de la mercatura (The Book of the Art of Trade) edited by Carlo Carraro and Giovanni Favero, with a foreword by Niall Ferguson, Professor of History at Harvard University, has been published by Palgrave Mcmillan in 2017, based on the critical edition of the original manuscripts made by Vera Ribaudo, University of Venice, published on May 2016 by Edizioni Cà Foscari, Venice. 

== Manuscript content ==
The manuscript contains four books. The first is of the origin, form, and essence of being a [[merchant]]. The second talks of a merchant's religious commitment. The third is of moral virtues and policies. The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hangers|Hangers, 1803]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The "Perfect Merchant" or "Perfect Dealer" was a man of culture motivated  
to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljević wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a [[bookkeeper]]-[[accountant]], but that he must also be a good writer, a [[rhetorician]] and a [[Intellectual#Men of letters|man of letters]] being diplomatic all the while.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/30/id/123/ Markets of the Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contrasted the "Perfect Merchant" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had [[grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] and were not very diplomatic.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7862">'''Deoxidization''' is a method used in [[metallurgy]] to remove the [[oxygen]] content during steel manufacturing.  In contrast, [[antioxidant]]s are used for stabilization, such as in the storage of food.  Deoxidation is important in the [[steelmaking]] process as oxygen is often detrimental to the quality of steel produced.  Deoxidization is mainly achieved by adding a separate chemical species to neutralize the  effects of oxygen or by directly removing the oxygen.

== Oxidation ==
[[Redox|Oxidation]] is the process of an element losing electrons.  For example, iron will transfer two of its electrons to oxygen, forming an oxide.  This occurs all throughout as an unintended part of the steelmaking process.

[[Basic oxygen steelmaking|Oxygen blowing]] is a method of steelmaking where oxygen is blown through [[pig iron]] to lower the carbon content.  Oxygen forms oxides with the unwanted elements, such as [[carbon]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and [[manganese]], which appear from various states of the manufacturing process.  These oxides will float to the top of the steel pool and remove themselves from the pig iron.  However, some of the oxygen will also react with the iron itself.

Due to the high temperatures involved in smelting itself, oxygen in the air may dissolve into the molten iron while it is being poured.  [[Slag]], a byproduct left over after the smelting process, is used to further absorb impurities such as [[sulfur]] or oxides and protect steel from further oxidation. However, it can still be responsible for some oxidation.

Some processes, while still able to lead to oxidation, are not relevant to the oxygen content of steel during its manufacture.  For example, [[rust]] is a red iron oxide that forms when the iron in steel reacts with the oxygen or water in the air.  This usually only occurs once the steel has been in use for varying degrees of time.  Some physical components of the steelmaking process itself, such as the [[electric arc furnace]], may also wear down and oxidize.  This issue is typically dealt with by the use of [[refractory metals]], which are resistant to change.&lt;ref name=Sub&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopeliovich|first1=Dmitri|title=Deoxidation of steel|url=http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=deoxidation_of_steel|website=Subtech|accessdate=23 October 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If steel is not properly deoxidized, it will have reduced various properties such as tensile strength, [[ductility]], toughness, weldability, polishability, and machinability.  This is due to forming [[non-metallic inclusions]] and gas pores, bubbles of gas that get trapped during the solidification process of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopeliovich|first1=Dmitri|title=Non-metallic inclusions|url=http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=non-metallic_inclusions_in_steel&amp;DokuWiki=1ae1e5767238ac97694a5511732ebe9d|website=Subtech|accessdate=24 October 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of deoxidizers ==

=== Metallic deoxidizers ===
This method of deoxidization involves adding specific metals into the steel.  These metals will react with the unwanted oxygen, forming a strong oxide that, compared to pure oxygen, will reduce the steel's strength and qualities by a lesser amount.

The chemical equation for deoxidization is represented by:

&lt;math&gt;nD + mO \longrightarrow D_ nO_m&lt;/math&gt;

where n and m are coefficients, D is the deoxidizing agent, and O is oxygen.

Thus, the [[chemical equilibrium]] equation involved is:

&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = a_{ox} / (a_D^n * a_O^m )&lt;/math&gt;

where a&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]], or concentration, of the oxide in the steel,
a&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the activity of the deoxidizing agent,
and a&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; is the activity of the oxygen.

An increase in the [[equilibrium constant]] K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; will cause an increase in a&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus more of the oxide product.

K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; can be manipulated by the steel temperature via the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;log K_{eq} = A_D / T - B_D &lt;/math&gt;

where A&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; are parameters specific to different deoxidizers and T is the temperature in K°.  Below are the values for certain deoxidizers at a temperature of 1873 K°.&lt;ref name=Sub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steel Deoxidation: Part One|url=http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=216|website=Total Materia|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Below is a list of commonly used metallic deoxidizers:
* [[Ferrosilicon]], [[ferromanganese]], [[Calcium disilicide|calcium silicide]] - used in steelmaking in production of [[carbon steels]], [[stainless steel]]s, and other ferrous alloys
* Manganese - used in steelmaking
* [[Silicon carbide]], [[calcium carbide]] - used as [[ladle (metallurgy)|ladle]] deoxidizer in steel production
* Aluminum [[dross]] - used to deoxidize [[slag]] in secondary steelmaking
* [[Calcium]] - used as a deoxidizer, desulfurizer, or decarbonizer for ferrous and nonferrous alloys
* [[Titanium]] - used as a deoxidizer for steels
* Phosphorus, [[copper(I) phosphide]] - used in production of [[oxygen-free copper]]
* [[Calcium hexaboride]] - used in production of [[oxygen-free copper]], yields higher conductivity copper than phosphorus-deoxidized
* [[Yttrium]] - used to deoxidize [[vanadium]] and other non-ferrous metals
* [[Zirconium]]
* [[Magnesium]]
* Carbon
* [[Tungsten]]

=== Vacuum deoxidation ===
Vacuum deoxidation is a method which involves using a [[vacuum]] to remove impurities.  A portion of the carbon and oxygen in steel will react, forming [[carbon monoxide]].  CO gas will float up to the top of the liquid steel and be removed by a vacuum system.

As the chemical reaction involved in vacuum deoxidation is:

&lt;math&gt;C + O \longrightarrow CO&lt;/math&gt;

the reaction between carbon and oxygen is represented by the following chemical equilibrium equation:

&lt;math&gt;K_{CO} = P_{CO}/(a_C * a_O)&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[partial pressure]] of the carbon monoxide formed.

Decreasing the oxygen activity(a&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) will result in a higher equilibrium constant, thus more product, CO.  To achieve this, subjecting the pool of steel to vacuum treatment decreases the value of P&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;, allowing for more CO gas to be produced.&lt;ref name=Sub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusion Formation and Removal|url=http://neon.mems.cmu.edu/afs/afs2/form.html|website=neom.mems.cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=26 October 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diffusion deoxidation ===
This method relies on the idea that deoxidation of slag will lead to the deoxidation of steel.

The chemical equilibrium equation used for this process is:

&lt;math&gt;K_{FeO} = a_{[O]} / a_{(O)}&lt;/math&gt;

where a&lt;sub&gt;[O]&lt;/sub&gt; is the activity of the oxygen in the slag, and a&lt;sub&gt;(O)&lt;/sub&gt; is the activity of oxygen in the steel.

Reducing the activity in the slag (a&lt;sub&gt;[O]&lt;/sub&gt;) will lower the oxygen levels in the slag.  Afterwards, oxygen will [[diffusion|diffuse]] from the steel into the lesser concentrated slag.  This method is done by using deoxidizing agents on the slag, such as [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] or silicon.  As these agents do not come into direct contact with the steel, non-metallic inclusions will not form in the steel itself.&lt;ref name=Sub/&gt;

'''Edith Rockefeller McCormick''' (August 31, 1872 – August 25, 1932) was an American socialite and opera patron.

==Biography==
She was born on August 31, 1872, the fourth daughter of schoolteacher [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman]] (1839&amp;ndash;1915) and [[Standard Oil]] co-founder [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller]]. Her brother was [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] (1874&amp;ndash;1960). Her three elder sisters were [[Elizabeth Rockefeller Strong|Elizabeth (Bessie)]] (1866&amp;ndash;1906), Alice (1869&amp;ndash;1870), and [[Alta Rockefeller Prentice|Alta]] (1871&amp;ndash;1962).

Edith and her father had an often stormy relationship, where her extravagance would often conflict with his frugality.

She married [[Harold Fowler McCormick]], a son of Chicago's mechanical [[reaper]] inventor [[Cyrus McCormick|Cyrus Hall McCormick]] and [[Nancy Fowler McCormick|Nancy Fowler]], in 1895. The married couple spent their first two years living in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. They later moved to [[Chicago]]. Her country estate, located directly on [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Illinois]] and named [http://www.villaturicum.com Villa Turicum], was designed by Charles A. Platt and had extensive architecturally landscaped gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villaturicum.com/ Villa Turicum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous story about McCormick involves an evening in 1901 during a party. News arrived that Edith and Harold's elder son, John Rockefeller McCormick, had died of [[scarlet fever]]. It was rumored that when this was whispered to her at the dinner table, she proceeded to merely nod her head and allowed the party to continue without incident. A biographer of her father, however, makes it clear that this could not have been true: at the time of her son's death, Edith was with him at the family estate, [[Kykuit]], at [[Pocantico Hills, New York]]. A year later, she and her husband established the John McCormick Institution of Infectious Diseases in Chicago, a source of funding for the [[Gladys Dick|researchers]] who later isolated the bacterium responsible for the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |title=Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr. |year=1998 |isbn=0-679-43808-4 |page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 she travelled to [[Zurich]] to be treated for [[Clinical depression|depression]] by [[Carl Gustav Jung]], and contributed generously to the Zürich Psychological Society.&lt;ref&gt;''The Aryan Christ: The Secret Life of Carl Jung'' (Chapter 10)|https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273128542_The_Aryan_Christ_The_Secret_Life_of_Carl_Jung&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919. McCormick donated land she had received from her father as a wedding gift to the Forest Preserve of Cook County, to be developed as a zoological garden, later to become Chicago's [[Brookfield Zoo]]. She returned to America in 1921 after an eight&amp;nbsp;year stay.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/timeline2.html Rockefellers timeline, PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith and Harold were divorced in December 1921. He was given custody of their youngest daughter Mathilde so that she could marry Max Oser, a Swiss riding instructor. Mathilde and Max were married in London in April 1923. Meanwhile, Harold married [[Ganna Walska]], a famous Polish opera singer in August 1922. Within days of Harold's remarriage, Edith announced plans to marry Edward Krenn, a 28 year old Austrian architect. The plan fell through for undisclosed reasons in December 1922. In 1927, she was mentioned in a newspaper article about Chicago's wealthy unmarried, divorced, and widowed wealthy women. The article noted that she was "glad to be rid of the gay Harold McCormick, but hasn't succeeded in convincing her friends she will never marry again."&lt;ref&gt;"MYSTERY OF CHICAGO'S 110 UNWED MILLION-HEIRESSES" Youngstown Vindicator, June 5, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, Edith and Harold frequently found themselves in court in lawsuits over the divorce agreement.

In February 1923 she received some minor press for claiming to be the reincarnation of the wife of [[King Tutankhamen]], whose tomb had just been explored and was a popular topic. She was quoted as saying, "I married King Tutankhamen when I was only sixteen years old. I was his first wife. Only the other day, while glancing through an illustrated paper, I saw a picture of a chair removed from the King's chamber. Like a flash I recognized that chair. I had sat in it many times."&lt;ref&gt;"MRS. M'CORMICK SAYS TUTANKHAMEN WED HER", The Hartford Courant, Mar 1, 1923. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; She followed up in [[Time magazine]] by stating "My interest in reincarnation is of many years' standing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881394-2,00.html | work=Time | title=Imaginary Interviews: Mar. 3, 1923 | date=March 3, 1923 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also said to be interested in [[astrology]] and to celebrate Christmas on December 15.

== Woman's World's Fair ==
{{main|Woman's World's Fair}}
In 1925, she and other wealthy Chicago women including Miss Helen M. Bennett, Mrs. John V. Farwell, Mrs. Silas Strawn, Mrs. John Alden Carpenter, Mrs. B.F. Langworthy, Mrs. [[Florence Fifer Bohrer]], and Mrs. Medill McCormick sponsored an international exposition to celebrate the progress and achievements of American women&amp;nbsp;– The first [[Woman's World's Fair]], which was held at the [[680 N Lake Shore Drive|American Exposition Palace]] on Lake Michigan in April 1925, and was held again each year in Chicago in April or May from 1926 to 1928. A local paper noted, of the first fair, that "One feature of the exhibit will be a collection of newspaper and magazine clippings, from various countries during the last 200 years emphasizing the storm of protest which greeted every suggestion for a freer social status for women."&lt;ref&gt;"WOMEN TO UNITE TO DISPLAY RECORDS OF ACHIEVEMENT OF MODERN ENTERPRISE", Lawrence Daily Journal-World, Feb. 19, 1925 at p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper articles mention organizing troubles that caused it to be cancelled in 1929. It was not held thereafter.

==Death==
In 1930 Edith had a growth removed from her breast and died of cancer two years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744274-3,00.html End of a Princess, Time magazine&lt;/ref&gt; She and two of her children, John and Editha, are buried in [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.

[[File:DXB on 23 September 2007 Pict 5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Emirates aircraft parked at [[Dubai International Airport]]]]
The so-called "'''[[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[business model]]'''" is the business model that lies at the heart of Emirates's commercial success.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/10/01/8359251/index.htm Rise of the Emirates Empire] [[CNN|CNN Money]], 1 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Its main ingredients are a lean [[workforce]] comparable to a [[low-cost carrier]] and a [[flat organization|flat organisational structure]] that allows the airline to maintain low [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs.&lt;ref name="easy_oz"&gt;''The Economist (Easy Oz - Emirates, Low cost is coming to long haul flights, next could be low fares''), pp. 82/3, The Economist Newspaper Ltd., London, 29 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industry analysts believe the airline is second only to [[Ryanair]] on a cash cost per seat basis due to lower [[operating cost]]s at its [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] base.&lt;ref name="easy_oz"/&gt; This enables it to serve secondary destinations profitably by connecting these via its global [[Airline hub|hub]] in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist (Flights of fancy''), www.economist.com, 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates has not joined any global [[airline alliance]] (although they planned to join Star Alliance in 2000, they remained independent), stating that unless an airline is the lead participant in such an alliance – e.g. [[Lufthansa]] in the [[Star Alliance]] or [[Air France]] in [[SkyTeam]] – individual alliance members' freedom of action is compromised by the imposition of common alliance goals that mainly serve the interests of the alliance leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/competition.aspx Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates operates an all-[[wide-body aircraft|widebody]] fleet, largely composed of [[Airbus A380]]s and [[Boeing 777]]s. This results in lower [[unit cost]]s compared to other large airlines operating a mix of [[narrow-body aircraft|narrow]]- and widebody fleets and allows the airline to use the aircraft's cargo capacity to increase its revenues and total [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]s. Since [[Dubai International Airport]] does not have any night flying restrictions, Emirates achieves a higher utilisation of its aircraft than competitors. It also has lower staff costs than longer established rivals, because in [[Dubai]] there are no unions and there is an abundance of cheap labour from India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="easy_oz"/&gt;

==Accusations of unfair competition==
[[File:Emirates.a330-200.a6-eks.arp.jpg|thumb|Emirates [[Airbus A330-200]] (A6-EKS) landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]]]]
The established network carriers in [[Europe]], [[Canada]] and [[Australasia]], i.e. [[Air France–KLM]], [[Lufthansa]], [[British Airways]], [[Air Canada]], [[Qantas]] and [[Air New Zealand]], perceive Emirates' strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it allows air travellers to bypass traditional [[airline hub]]s such as [[London Heathrow Airport|London–Heathrow]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris–Charles-de-Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam Schiphol]] on their way between Europe/[[North America]] and [[Asia]]/Australia by changing flights at Dubai instead.

Some of these carriers, notably [[Air France]] and Qantas, have accused Emirates of receiving hidden state subsidies and of maintaining too cozy a relationship with Dubai's airport authority and its aviation authority, both of which are also wholly state-owned entities that share the same government owner with the airline. They also allege that Emirates is able to reduce its borrowing costs below market rates by taking advantage of its government shareholders' sovereign borrower status. They claim that this government support [[cross subsidization|cross-subsidises]] the airline, masking its true financial performance.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2204/html/ieconomy.htm#42033 Emirates Accused of Unfair Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times (Row erupts between Qantas and Emirates), UK Edition, London, 9 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ownership"&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 5-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel subsidies===
Many airlines have accused Emirates of receiving fuel subsidies from the Government of Dubai. The airline has denied these accusations, stating that it purchases its fuel at the same price, as well as on the same terms and conditions, as every other commercial airline at all airports at which it operates. In [[fiscal year|FY]] 2007/08, fuel accounted for more than 30% of Emirates total expenditure, comparable with other international long-haul carriers such as [[British Airways]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Qantas]] or [[Singapore Airlines]].&lt;ref name="myth"&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airport user charges===
Emirates has also defended itself against competitor accusations claiming it pays discounted airport user charges at its home base. The airline rejected these claims, stating that it paid the same user charges at Dubai as everyone else, which were similar to those prevailing at other comparable airports in the region, including [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Doha]], and [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="myth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/16/emirates-tim-clark-interview Guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local taxes===
Many airlines have accused Emirates of having an unfair advantage, since it does not have to pay local taxes. The airline rejects these claims as misleading by clarifying that in the absence of [[income tax|income]] or [[corporate tax]]es in the UAE all airlines operating to and from Dubai benefit from this tax-free environment. In this context, Emirates also stresses that it has paid the Government of Dubai [[share (finance)|dividend]]s to the tune of [[US dollar|US$]]776 million, in return for US$10 million in [[seed money|seed capital]] gifted to the airline at its inception in 1985.&lt;ref name="myth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4241 Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth freedom traffic===
Emirates robustly defends itself against recurring claims accusing it of stealing other airlines' transfer passengers. It points out that its detractors have carried international passenger traffic between different third country points on their networks via their hub airports for decades, and that Emirates is entitled to do the same. Emirates furthermore points out that this enables it to offer regional passengers based in or near important secondary cities such as [[Glasgow]], [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Hamburg]], [[Nice]], [[Venice]], [[Brisbane]] or [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] convenient, worldwide one-stop connections via its global hub in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meed.com/transport/features/_tim_clark_president_emirates_airline.html Meed.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 4, 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between Emirates and the Government of Dubai===
Emirates has countered rivals' frequent accusations that its ownership by the Government of Dubai amounted to a direct subsidy, representing an [[unfair competitive advantage (business)|unfair competitive advantage]] not enjoyed by most other airlines, by stating that it was a fully fledged commercial enterprise run at [[arm's length principle|arm's length]] from the Dubai government, despite being wholly owned by it.&lt;ref name="ownership"/&gt;

===Labour cost advantages===
Some airlines have claimed that being based in Dubai gives Emirates an unfair labour cost advantage over other airlines. Emirates has countered this by stating that it faces the same costs to attract and retain staff recruited from around the world on expatriate terms and conditions as other airlines. The airline points out that the total cost of expatriate employee benefits amounts to more than US$400 million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/q_a.aspx# Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canadian expansion====
[[File:Emirates A345 A6-ERA.jpg|thumb|right|Emirates [[Airbus A340-500]]]]
Emirates started flying to Canada on 29 October 2007, operating three weekly non-stop services on the [[Dubai]]–[[Toronto]] route.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS132698+16-Mar-2009+MW20090316 Reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates has experienced very high capacity factors on its [[Canada|Canadian]] services, averaging 90% since the start of operations between Toronto and Dubai. This has already resulted in substitution of an [[Airbus A380]]-800 "[[superjumbo]]" for the smaller [[Boeing 777]]-300ER widebody originally used on this route. However, the current [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral agreement]] between the UAE and Canada restricts Emirates to only three flights per week between Dubai and Canada. In addition to operating daily between Dubai and Toronto to give business and leisure passengers greater flexibility, the airline would like to add other cities such as [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]] to its UAE–Canada schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/canada/background.aspx Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] has stated it does not see the need for more services in response to these requests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/emirates-rejects-blame-for-air-canada-woes/article1167407 Theglobeandmail.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Government has claimed that [[Air Canada]] might be adversely affected by increased competition from Emirates and that this could undermine its viability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/emirates-air-canada-clash-over-access/article1166252/ Theglobeandmail.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, p. 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Emirates has refuted these claims, stating that there was no direct competitive overlap between it and Air Canada, since the latter (before 2015) did not operate services to the UAE or to any points in the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]] or the [[Indian subcontinent]], places where Emirates' flights are always busy. Emirates also stated that this would benefit Air Canada as many of Emirates' Canadian passengers were transferring to/from points on Air Canada's extensive North American network through its Toronto hub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/canada/would_air_canada_be_impacted.aspx Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German expansion====
[[File:Airbus A330-200 Emirates A6-EAL.jpg|thumb|A330-200 taking off at [[Düsseldorf Airport]]]]
Emirates commenced flights to Germany in July 1987 with the launch of scheduled services on the Dubai–[[Frankfurt]] route. As of 2009, Emirates operates 49 weekly passenger flights from Dubai to Germany, serving Frankfurt, [[Munich]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamburg]]. Emirates also operates eleven weekly all-cargo flights from Dubai to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0905/S00512.htm Scoop.co.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; Germany is Emirates' second-biggest market in Europe (after the United Kingdom), carrying over one million passengers between Dubai and Germany during the 2007/08 [[fiscal year|financial year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/emirates_and_europe/a_trade_based_relationship.aspx Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 2007, Emirates wanted to fly to additional German cities, specifically [[Berlin]] and [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelindustrydeals.com/news/4442 Travelindustrydeals.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glgroup.com/News/A-test-case-for-Germany-pits-consumer-interests-against-EC-airlines-14543.html Gerson Lehrman Group - Intelligently Connecting Institutions and Expertise. Energy &amp; Industrials: A test case for Germany pits consumer interests against EC airlines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/btn20070727085126956/?opattr=Emirates_may_be_capped_to_protect_Lufthansa Breaking travel news [!BTN] - Emirates may be capped to protect Lufthansa, 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[Lufthansa]] said that it saw a competitive imbalance between Emirates and itself in the Germany–Dubai air travel market, effectively accusing the UAE carrier of stealing its transfer passengers between North America, the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], India and the [[Far East]]. It also alleged that there were material differences in [[aircraft ground handling|handling fees]] at [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai Airport]] and unequal opportunities for the two airlines in each other's home markets. The latter relates to Emirates' heavy reliance on so-called "[[freedoms of the air|sixth freedom]]" traffic rights that enable it to carry passengers, cargo and mail between Germany and third countries via its hub in Dubai to fill most of the space on its Germany–Dubai flights, as a result of there being insufficient origin and destination traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airflights.to/Airlines/Asia/UAE/Emirates-flights/Emirates-flights.php5 Airflights.to]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090326/BUSINESS/37258667&amp;SearchID=73350640756106 Thenational.ae]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates has countered Lufthansa's claims by pointing out that its proposed German expansion would result in a "[[win-win game|win-win]]" situation for both sides that would actually grow the [[German economy]] through additional economic activity generated, as a result of stimulating the air transport market between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/english/about/public_affairs/emirates_and_europe/berlin_stuttgart.aspx Emirates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

An order of Germany's Federal Office for Goods Transport to Emirates to desist from price leadership on routes leaving Germany for non–[[European Union|European-Union]] (EU) destinations and forcing it to raise relevant [[business class]] fares by up to 20% has been the focus of the latest disagreement between the UAE carrier on one hand and the German government and Lufthansa on the other. Despite the Federal Office for Goods Transport's insistence that it has not singled out Emirates unfairly by demanding similar remedial action of other airlines regarding fares charged on non-EU routes out of Germany, Andrew Parker, Emirates' Senior Vice-President, denied any knowledge of this being the case. He termed the German Federal Office for Goods Transport's decision "anti-consumer" and "commercially nonsensical". He also threatened to seek redress from the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessandleadership.com/news/article/17737/leadership/germany-forces-emirates-to-raise-business-fares Business &amp; Leadership, Leadership: Germany forces Emirates to raise business fares, 20.11.2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.airwise.com/story/view/1258661136.html AIRwise (Hub Page &gt; Airwise News &gt; Airline News &gt; Germany tells non-EU airlines to raise prices, 19 November 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates.com/uk/english/images/12_tcm275-523298.pdf Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 15/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">'''Foresight''' is the ability to predict, or the action of predicting, what will happen or what is needed in the future. Studies suggest that much of [[human]] daily thought is directed towards potential future events. Because of this and its role in human control on the planet, the nature and evolution of foresight is an important topic in [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Suddendorf &amp; [[Michael Corballis|Corballis]] (2007). "The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel and is it uniquely human". ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'', 30, 299-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]], [[Developmental psychology|developmental]], and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] studies have identified many commonalities to the human ability to recall past [[Episodic memory|episodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Addis DR, Wong AT, Schacter DL. "Remembering the Past and Imagining the Future: Common and Distinct Neural Substrates During Event Construction and Elaboration". ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' 2007; 45:1363-1377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassabis D, Kumaran D, Vann SD, Maguire EA. "Patients with Hippocampal Amnesia Cannot Imagine New Experiences". ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' 2007; 104:1726-1731.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine selected new evidence for such commonalities one of the top ten scientific breakthroughs of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= 21 December 2007|title= BREAKTHROUGH OF THE YEAR: The Runners-Up|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5858/1844.1.full|journal= Science|publisher= American Academy for the Advancement of Science|volume= 318|issue= 5848|pages= 1844-1849 |doi= 10.1126/science.318.5858.1844a |accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are fundamental differences between mentally travelling through time into the future (i.e., foresight) versus mentally travelling through time into the past (i.e., episodic memory).&lt;ref&gt;Suddendorf T. "Episodic Memory Versus Episodic Foresight: Similarities and Differences". ''Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science'', 1, 99-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In management ==
Foresight has been classified as a [[behaviour]] (covert and/or overt) in management, a review, [[analysis]], and [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of past definitions and usages of the foresight concept into a generic definition, in order to make the concept measurable.&lt;ref name="Amsteus"&gt;Amsteus, M. (2008) "Managerial foresight: concept and measurement". ''Foresight: the journal for future studies, strategic thinking and policy'', Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spe
"Degree of analyzing present contingencies and degree of moving the analysis of present contingencies across time, and degree of analyzing a desired future state or states a degree ahead in time with regard to contingencies under control, as well as degree of analyzing courses of action a degree ahead in time to arrive at the desired future state."&lt;ref name="Amsteus"/&gt;

[[Prediction market]] are exchange-traded markets created for the purpose of trading the outcome of events. This economic theory is credited to economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Prediction Market gives the ability  to aggregate information and make accurate predictions based on the [[Efficient-market hypothesis|Efficient Market Hypothesis]], which states that assets prices are fully reflecting all available information. For instance, existing share prices always include all the relevant related information for the stock market to make accurate predictions.

'''Frank Bunker Gilbreth''' (July 7, 1868&amp;nbsp;– June 14, 1924) was an American engineer, consultant and author, known as early advocate of [[scientific management]] and a pioneer of [[time and motion study]], and is perhaps best known as the father and central figure of ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.

Both he and his wife [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] were industrial engineers and efficiency experts who contributed to the study of [[industrial engineering]] in fields such as motion study and human factors.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Gilbreth was born in [[Fairfield, Maine]] on July 7, 1868. He was the third child and only son of John Hiram Gilbreth and Martha Bunker Gilbreth. His mother had been a schoolteacher. His father owned a hardware store and was a stockbreeder. When Gilbreth was three and a half years old his father died suddenly from pneumonia.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Jane |title=Making Time: Lillian Moller Gilbreth, a Life Beyond "Cheaper by the Dozen" |year=2004 |publisher=Northeastern University Press |isbn=978-1-55553-612-1}}--&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004"&gt;{{cite Q|Q28474683}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

After his father's death his mother moved the family to [[Andover, Massachusetts]] to find better schools for her children. The substantial estate left by her husband was managed by her husband's family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth had to find a way to make a living. She moved the family to [[Boston]] where there were good public schools. She opened a boarding house since the salary of a schoolteacher would not support the family.&lt;ref name=Lancaster2004 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

Gilbreth was not a good student. He attended Rice Grammar School, but his mother was concerned enough to teach him at home for a year. He attended Boston's [[The English High School|English High School]] and his grades improved when he became interested in his science and math classes. He took the entrance examinations for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but wanted his mother to be able to give up the boarding house. He decided to go to work rather than to college.&lt;ref name=Lancaster2004 /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

===Widden Construction Company===
Renton Widden, Gilbreth's old Sunday School teacher, hired him for his building company. He was to start as a laborer, learn the various building trades, and work his way up in the firm. In July 1885 at age 17 he started as a [[bricklayer]]'s helper.&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004" /&gt;{{rp|78}} As he learned [[Brickwork|bricklaying]] he noticed the many variations in the bricklayers' methods and efficiency.

Using his observations of workmen laying brick, Gilbreth developed a multilevel [[Scaffolding|scaffold]] that kept the bricks within easy reach of the bricklayer.&lt;ref name="UrwickBrech1949"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Urwick |first1=L.F.|author2=E.F.L.

===Further career===
Gilbreth then became a building contractor, then an inventor with several patents, and finally a management engineer. He eventually became an occasional lecturer at [[Purdue University]], which houses his papers.

Gilbreth discovered his vocation as a young building contractor when he sought ways to make [[Brickwork|bricklaying]] faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]], who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, [[Gilbreth, Inc.]], focusing on such endeavors.

They were involved in the development of the design for the [[Simmons Hardware Company]]'s [[Simmons Hardware Company Warehouse|Sioux City Warehouse]]. The architects had specified that hundreds of {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} hardened concrete piles were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of two million bricks required to construct the building. The "Time and Motion" approach could be applied to the bricklaying and the transportation. The building was also required to support efficient input and output of deliveries via its own railroad switching facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simmons Hardware Company Warehouse - National Register of Historic Places Registration Form |url=http://focus.nps.gov/nrhp/GetAsset?assetID=ac2d7bc1-3846-40e4-b2c6-af0aff75b771 |publisher=National Park Service |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family ===
Gilbreth married [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Evelyn Moller]] on October 19, 1904, in [[Oakland, California]]; they had 12 children. Their names were Anne Moller Gilbreth Barney (1905-1987), Mary Elizabeth Gilbreth (1906–1912), [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey|Ernestine Moller Gilbreth Carey]] (1908-2006), Martha Bunker Gilbreth Tallman (1909-1968), [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr.]] (1911-2001), William Moller Gilbreth (1912-1990), Lillian Gilbreth Johnson (1914-2001), Frederick Moller Gilbreth (1916-2015), Daniel Bunker Gilbreth (1917-2006), John Moller Gilbreth (1919-2002), [[Robert Moller Gilbreth]] (1920-2007), and Jane Moller Gilbreth Heppes (1922-2006); there was also a stillborn daughter (1915) who was not named.

=== Death ===
Gilbreth died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 14, 1924, at age 55. He was at the Lackawanna railway station in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], talking with his wife by telephone. Lillian outlived him by 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Maj. Frank B.

== Work ==
=== Motion studies ===
{{Main|Time and motion study|Gilbreth, Inc.}}[[File:Frank Bunker Gilbreth ca1916.jpg|thumb|Gilbreth in about 1916]]
[[File:Original Films Of Frank B Gilbreth (Part I).ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|''Original Films Of Frank B. Gilbreth (Part I)'']]
Gilbreth served in the U.S. Army during [[World War I]]. His assignment was to find quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms. According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold. Gilbreth named the motions [[therblig]]s&amp;nbsp;— "Gilbreth" spelled backwards with letters ''th'' transposed to their original order. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers.

Their emphasis on the "one best way" and therbligs predates the development of [[Continual improvement process|continuous quality improvement]] (CQI),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|George|1968| p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late 20th century understanding that repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries.

Gilbreth was the first to propose the position of "caddy" (Gilbreth's term) to a surgeon, who handed surgical instruments to the surgeon as needed. Gilbreth also devised the standard techniques used by armies around the world to teach recruits how to rapidly disassemble and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness.&lt;!-- These innovations have arguably helped save millions of lives. --&gt;

=== Scientific management ===
The work of the Gilbreths is often associated with that of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of Taylorism was the [[stopwatch]]; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers' welfare than Taylorism, which workers themselves often perceived as concerned mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor's death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor's followers. After Frank's death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift;&lt;ref name=Price1992&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Brian |editor=Daniel Nelson |title=A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=93ydxDfb-RAC&amp;pg=PA58 |year=1992 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=978-0-8142-0567-9 |pages=58–76 |chapter=Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Motion Study Controversy, 1907-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com/qv1n2.html The Gilbreth Network&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatigue study ===
In conducting their Motion Study method to work, they found that the key to improving work efficiency was in reducing unnecessary motions.  Not only were some motions unnecessary, but they caused employee fatigue.  Their efforts to reduce fatigue included reduced motions, tool redesign, parts placement, and bench and seating height, for which they began to develop workplace standards. The Gilbreths' work broke ground for contemporary understanding of ergonomics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com/qv1n2.html The Gilbreth Network&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Frank and Lillian Gilbreth often used their large family (and Frank himself) as [[Guinea pig#Guinea pigs in scientific research|guinea pigs]] in experiments. Their family exploits are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine ([[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]). The book inspired two films of the same name. The first, in 1950, starred [[Clifton Webb]] and [[Myrna Loy]].&lt;ref name=Saxon2001 /&gt; The second, in 2003, starred [[comedian]]s [[Steve Martin]] and [[Bonnie Hunt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0349205|Cheaper by the Dozen (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife's maiden name is Gilbreth. A 1952 sequel titled ''[[Belles on Their Toes]]'' chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank's 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, ''Time Out For Happiness,'' was written by Frank Jr. alone in 1962.&lt;ref name=Saxon2001&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |title=Frank Gilbreth Jr., 89, Author Of 'Cheaper by the Dozen' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/20/arts/frank-gilbreth-jr-89-author-of-cheaper-by-the-dozen.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idahosa''' ('''Hosa''') '''Wells Okunbo''' (born 7 January 1958) is a Nigerian business magnate, investor, philanthropist and trained commercial pilot. He serves as either chairman or director on numerous company boards in Nigeria, spanning multiple business sectors such as the agro-allied, petroleum, telecommunications, power, real estate and banking industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://encomium.ng/south-south-season-of-blessings-for-capt-hosa-okunbor/|title=Season of blessings for Capt Hosa Okunbo|date=7 November 2014|newspaper=Encomium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and education ==
Hosa Okunbo is a native of [[Edo State]] in the southern part of [[Nigeria]]. He was born in [[Benin City]] to the family of Reverend Robert Amos Okunbo, a clergyman, teacher and community leader. Okunbo had his primary education at Government Primary in Benin City, old Bendel State, now Edo State. He proceeded to Federal Government College, [[Warri]], in 1971, where he sat for [[West African Senior School Certificate Examination]]. Okunbo is a native speaker of the Edo language, and a fluent speaker of English.

Okunbo pursued a desire to become a pilot by studying at the Nigerian Civil Aviation Training Centre, Zaria, Kaduna State, and became a professional commercial pilot at the age of 21. He also attended ACME School of Aeronautics, Fort Worth Texas in 1983, where he obtained an [[Airline Transport Pilot License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://issuu.com/vanguardngr/docs/06012013/16|title=Hosa, a Humble Achiever at 55|date=6 January 2013|newspaper=Vanguard|author=Sufuyan Ojeifo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
{{example farm|section|date=July 2017}}
Upon graduation, Okunbo became a professional commercial pilot, and was made a captain in 1983 at the age of 25. He was a flight captain with [[Intercontinental de Aviación|Intercontinental Airlines]] for about two years, then was employed by [[Okada Air]]lines for three years.  In 1988, he retired from piloting at the age of 30, having logged over 7,000 hours of flight time, and ventured into private business.

Okunbo established Hoslyn Ventures Nigeria {{abbr|Ltd.|Limited}}, a company that was involved with procurement in the Nigerian petroleum sector. Hoslyn Ventures was an indigenous oilfield service company that was responsible for the Early Production Facility (EPF) project at [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC) between 1998 and 2001.

Okunbo is the founder and chairman of the following Nigerian companies:

==Death==
Pavlov was shot outside his office with a single bullet to the heart by a sniper and died instantly.&lt;ref name=novinite1&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=20098&lt;/ref&gt; The day before his death, he had testified in the trial of the accused murderers of [[Andrey Lukanov]], Bulgaria's first prime minister after the fall of communism who died in 1996. Pavlov had claimed that he had no conflict with Lukanov.

No one has been charged in Pavlov's murder and while several possible theories have been put forth the motive is unknown.&lt;ref name=novinite1 /&gt; A previous attempt on Pavlov's life was made in 1997 when a bomb destroyed his car.

In 2010 Pavlov's sister, Slavka Naydenova, and her 8-year-old son were murdered in [[Dale City, Virginia]]. A Russian-American woman who was the wife of Naydenova's ex-husband pleaded guilty to the murders. The motive was jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=137307&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
In [[accountancy|accounting]], the '''Inventory turnover''' is a measure of the number of times inventory is sold or used in a time period such as a year. It is calculated to see if a business has an excessive inventory in comparison to its sales level. The [[equation]] for inventory turnover equals the [[cost of goods sold]] divided by the average [[inventory]].  Inventory turnover is also known as '''inventory turns''', '''merchandise turnover''', '''stockturn''', '''stock turns''', '''turns''', and '''stock turnover'''.

==Inventory Turnover Formulas==
The formula for inventory turnover:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Net Sales}}{\mbox{Average Inventory}} &lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\mbox{Average Inventory}} &lt;/math&gt;

or

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Cost of Material − Change in inventories (of 1/2 and 1/1 goods)}}{\mbox{Inventories}} &lt;/math&gt;

The ''most basic'' formula for average inventory:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average Inventory}=\frac{\mbox{Beginning inventory+Ending inventory}}{\mbox{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

or just

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average Inventory}=\mbox{Ending inventory} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiple data points, for example the average of the monthly averages, will provide a much more representative turn figure.


The average days to sell the inventory is calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Weygandt, J. J., Kieso, D. E., &amp; Kell, W. G. (1996). ''Accounting Principles'' (4th ed.). New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.  p. 802.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average days to sell the inventory}=\frac{\mbox{365 days}}{\mbox{Inventory Turnover Ratio}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Application in Business ==
A low turnover rate may point to overstocking,&lt;ref&gt;Commercial Loan Analysis: principles and techniques for credit analysts and lenders By Kenneth R. Pirok
 {{ISBN|1-55738-716-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; obsolescence, or deficiencies in the product line or marketing effort. However, in some instances a low rate may be appropriate, such as where higher inventory levels occur in anticipation of rapidly rising prices or expected market shortages.

Conversely a high turnover rate may indicate inadequate inventory levels, which may lead to a loss in business as the inventory is too low. This often can result in stock shortages.

Some compilers of industry data (e.g., [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]) use sales as the numerator instead of cost of sales. [[Cost of sales]] yields a more realistic turnover ratio, but it is often necessary to use sales for purposes of comparative analysis. Cost of sales is considered to be more realistic because of the difference in which sales and the cost of sales are recorded.  Sales are generally recorded at market value, i.e. the value at which the marketplace paid for the good or service provided by the firm.  In the event that the firm had an exceptional year and the market paid a premium for the firm's goods and services then the numerator may be an inaccurate measure.  However, cost of sales is recorded by the firm at what the firm actually paid for the materials available for sale.  Additionally, firms may reduce prices to generate sales in an effort to cycle inventory.  In this article, the terms "cost of sales" and "cost of goods sold" are synonymous.

An item whose inventory is sold (turns over) once a year has higher holding cost than one that turns over twice, or three times, or more in that time. Stock turnover also indicates the briskness of the business. The purpose of increasing inventory turns is to reduce inventory for three reasons.
* Increasing inventory turns reduces [[holding cost]]. The organization spends less money on rent, utilities, insurance, theft and other costs of maintaining a stock of good to be sold.
* Reducing [[holding cost]] increases [[net income]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] as long as the [[revenue]] from selling the item remains constant.
* Items that turn over more quickly increase responsiveness to changes in customer requirements while allowing the replacement of obsolete items.  This is a major concern in fashion  industries.
* When making comparison between firms, it's important to take note of the industry, or the comparison will be distorted. Making comparison between a supermarket and a car dealer, will not be appropriate, as supermarket sells fast-moving goods such as sweets, chocolates, soft drinks so the stock turnover will be higher. However, a car dealer will have a low turnover due to the item being a slow moving item. As such only intra-industry comparison will be appropriate.

==Note==
Some computer programs measure the stock turns of an item using the actual number sold.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory  Turn} = \frac{\text{Number  of  Units  Sold  (Over  a  given  period)}}{\text{Average  Number of  Units  (For  the  period)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The important issue is that any organization should be consistent in the formula that it uses.

'''Justin Berkmann''' (born December 1963), is a DJ and nightclub owner. He is the second son of Joseph Berkmann and his second wife, Jean Berkmann (née Barwis) and younger brother of [[Marcus Berkmann]], an author. They were both educated at [[Highgate School]] in [[North London]].&lt;ref&gt;Highgate School Register 7th Edn 1833-1988, Ed. Patrick Hughes &amp; Ian F Davies 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkmann is the co-founder of the nightclub and brand, [[Ministry of Sound]]&lt;ref name="Pilcher2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilcher|first=Tim|title=E, the Incredibly Strange History of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fbXEVQcuU8C&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=26 June 2011|date=2008-04-07|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-3184-7|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now MSHK Group). Since its conception in 1991, the company has grown from a nightclub in [[London]]’s [[Elephant and Castle]] to a multi-media business. Berkmann's initial involvement was from January 1990 until May 1994, and he was resident DJ and Artistic Director during that period. He then rejoined in 2006 to build their franchise clubs in [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]].

It was found out in August 2018 that Berkmann is 4th cousin once removed to [[Coronation Street]] actor Liam Bairstow who plays Alex Warner.

== Professional career ==
Berkmann was introduced to house music by a friend, who recommended [[Farley "Jackmaster" Funk]]'s track "Funkin With the Drums Again" to him. Berkmann soon started to DJ, and in 1986 he moved to New York City, where he visited the [[Paradise Garage]], which he described as "an amazing club. It had lights, darkness, music, quiet – everything you wanted. I thought it was the perfect template, so I came back to London in 1988, determined to do something similar". He then spent a year looking for a suitable site, finding a car park in [[Elephant and Castle]] "with a roof covered in pigeon poo". He joined forces with entrepreneur [[James Palumbo]] and Humphrey Waterhouse at the end of 1989 and 21 months later they opened [[Ministry of Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/13/how-we-made-ministry-sound-london |title=How we made: Ministry of Sound |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=13 November 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkmann was in charge of booking the talent and being resident DJ until mid-1994. Berkmann sourced American DJ talent like [[Tony Humphries (musician)|Tony Humphries]] from the New York and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] scenes (which centred on [[Club Zanzibar]] and the [[Paradise Garage]]).
Following this, Berkmann continued to DJ. He rejoined Ministry of Sound in 2006 to assist with the design and sound installation in the Ministry of Sound, Singapore, later to become Venues Development Manager for MoS International, and co-creating the concept and design for their club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with [[Austen Derek]].

In 2011, one of his older Ministry of Sound mixes was released in ''[[Live &amp; Remastered]]''.

He is the son of Karl and Karin Scheufele, German entrepreneurs who acquired Chopard in 1963&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;.

In 2005, he established the [[Geneva seal|Fleurier Quality Foundation]], an independent Swiss watch certification body, and founded the L.U.C.EUM watch museum in [[Fleurier]] a year later&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/fashion/watches-archives-chopard.html|title=Watch Archives Prove Their Worth|date=March 23, 2017|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

He set up a wine sales company, La Galerie des Arts du Vin, at the end of the 1990s and acquired a number of Caveaux de Bacchus boutiques in [[Switzerland]]. In 2012, he bought the Château Monestier-la-Tour wine estate&lt;ref name="luxuo.com"/&gt;, which produces 150,000 bottles per year in a variety of AOPs in [[France]].

== Childhood ==
Karl-Friedrich Scheufele was born in 1958&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; in Pforzheim in Germany, and grew up in the city of [[Pforzheim]], where he lived until the age of 15. His parents were at the head of watchmaking company Eszeha, based in Pforzheim&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;.

In 1963, his father, Karl, took over the Geneva-based watch manufacture Chopard&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2014/04/15/chopards-karl-scheufele-joins-luxury-billionaire-ranks/#4103decd3eeb|title=Chopard's Karl Scheufele Joins Luxury Billionaire Ranks|date=April 15, 2014|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/karl-scheufele-iii/#4eab95e42148|title=Karl Scheufele, III. &amp; family|date=September 14, 2018|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since that time, the family has split its time between [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].

At the age of 15, Karl-Friedrich left Germany for Switzerland and enrolled in the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) along with his sister Caroline. In 1973, he served an apprenticeship with a jeweler in Geneva, before studying at the Faculty of Business and Economics ([[HEC Lausanne]]).

== Directorship ==
Karl-Friedrich Scheufele joined Chopard in the 80s&lt;ref name="thejackalmagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thejackalmagazine.com/karl-friedrich-scheufeles-interview/|title=How to build a luxury brand: Karl-Friedrich Scheufele on Chopard|date=August 20, 2018|website=The Jackal Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;, spending successive periods in all departments. Caroline also went to work for the family business. 

At the age of 22, he designed the company’s first sports watch. The St. Moritz is also the first model conceived by Karl-Friedrich. From that time, Karl-Friedrich built the Chopard business around watch making&lt;ref name="thejackalmagazine.com"/&gt;. 

Later, he founded a manufacture exclusively dedicated to the production of high precision [[Movement (clockwork)#Mechanical movements|mechanical movements]]&lt;ref name="thejackalmagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wallpaper.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hautetime.com"/&gt;. Chopard Manufacture was inaugurated in 1996 in Fleurier in the [[Val-de-Travers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/fashion/08iht-acaw-fleurier08.html?pagewanted=all Fleurier - A Village Regains Past Splendor], Published March 8, 2012 The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watchprosite.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luxuo.com1"/&gt;.

In 2001, Karl-Friedrich and his sister became Co-Presidents of the company. 

Karl-Friedrich Scheufele and Michel Parmigiani jointly set up the Fleurier Quality Foundation, an independent watch certification body. The Fleurier Quality label, which particularly certifies 100% Swiss manufacture, was established in 2005. 

In 2006, Karl-Friedrich Scheufele inaugurated the L.U.CEUM watchmaking museum in Fleurier&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;. 

Today, Karl-Friedrich is in charge of the Chopard Manufacture, the men's watches division&lt;ref name="luxury-insider.com"/&gt; and all business management aspects, including marketing, advertising and communication&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxury-insider.com/features/2012/interview-karl-friedrich-scheufele-for-chopard Karl-Friedrich Scheufele for Chopard], Published on May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hautetime.com"/&gt;.

== Revival of Ferdinand Berthoud == 
While seeking to enrich the collection at the L.U.C.EUM watchmaking museum&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;, Karl-Friedrich uncovered the history of watchmaker [[Ferdinand Berthoud]] (1727-1807)&lt;ref name="luxuo.com1"/&gt;. In 2006, Karl-Friedrich acquired the Ferdinand Berthoud brand&lt;ref name="watchprosite.com"/&gt;. He registered the trade name under Chronométrie Ferdinand Berthoud in 2013 and launched it in 2015&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;. 

In 2016, Karl-Friedrich was awarded with the Aiguille d’Or prize ("Golden Hand"), the highest distinction awarded by Grand Prix de l’Horlogerie in [[Geneva]], for a Ferdinand Berthoud watch. In November 2017, he won the same prize for Chopard's L.U.C Full Strike watch&lt;ref name="luxuo.com"/&gt;.

== His interests ==
=== Winemaking ===
As a wine lover, alongside his work for Chopard, Karl-Friedrich established a wine sales company, La Galerie des Arts du Vin, in 1996. Three years later, he acquired the Caveau de Bacchus boutique and opened several boutiques across Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;[http://robbreport.com/Watches/The-Robb-Reader-Karl-Friedrich-Scheufele The Robb Reader Interview with Karl-Friedrich Scheufele], Retrieved May 01, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Karl-Friedrich Scheufele acquired the Château Monestier-la-Tour in [[France]], a wine estate in the region of [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://elitechoice.org/2012/01/20/karl-friedrich-scheufele-of-chopard-buys-bergerac-wine-estate/ Karl-Friedrich Scheufele of Chopard buys Bergerac Wine Estate], - elitechoice.org&lt;/ref&gt; that comprises over 100 hectares including 30 hectares of vineyards of the [[Bergerac AOC|Bergerac]] AOC appellation. In 2017, after having completed the renovation of its buildings and the restructuring of the vineyard, the estate obtained [[organic certification]]&lt;ref name="luxuo.com"/&gt;. It now produces 150,000 bottles in [[Bergerac wine|AOP Bergerac]], Côtes de Bergerac and [[Saussignac AOC|AOP Saussignac]].

=== Car racing ===
Karl-Friedrich also collects vintage cars&lt;ref name="luxuo.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hautetime.com"/&gt;, a passion he shares with his father&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luxuo.com1"/&gt;. In 1987, Karl-Friedrich discovered the [[Mille Miglia]], a classic car rally that runs from [[Brescia]] to [[Rome]]. He completed this 1,600 km race with his father. The following year, he set up a partnership between Chopard and Mille Miglia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoursandminutes.co/ethical-conversations-with-karl-friedrich-scheufele-co-president-of-chopard/|title=Ethical Conversations with Karl-Friedrich Scheufele, Co-President of Chopard|date=May 31, 2018|website=Hours and Minutes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thejackalmagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wallpaper.com"/&gt;, and the company became the official race sponsor&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luxury-insider.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hautetime.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://luxury-savour.com/magazine/individuals/302-karl-friedrich-scheufele.html Exclusive interview with Karl-Friedrich Scheufele], Published on 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. Since that time, he has taken part in each edition, often with racing driver [[Jacky Ickx]]&lt;ref name="luxury-insider.com"/&gt;. A few years later, he created further partnerships with the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique and with [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche Motorsport]]&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thejackalmagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luxuo.com1"/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">The phrase '''milk run''' originated in World War II, when [[United States Army Air Corps|US Army Air Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircrews used it to describe any mission where minimal resistance from the enemy was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ammer |first= Christine |date= 1989 |title= Fighting Words from War, Rebellion, and Other Combative Capers |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XKVYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149 |location= |publisher= BookBaby |page= 14 |isbn= 1626759669 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[United States|American]] culture, a milk run was literally the distribution of [[milk bottle]]s by the [[milkman]]. On his daily route, the milkman simultaneously distributed the full bottles and collected the empty bottles from a previous delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Hartmut (2008): Supply Chain Management. Grundlagen Strategien Instrumente und Controlling /// Grundlagen, Strategien, Instrumente und Controlling. 3., vollständig überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage. Wiesbaden: [[Betriebswirtschaftlicher Verlag Dr. Th. Gabler]] | GWV Fachverlage GmbH Wiesbaden&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of round trip, he returned with the empty bottles back to the starting point.

In the context of [[logistics]], according to Winfrid Meusel, milk runs were any routes that originated by identifying potential circular tours, whereby the utilization of trucks could be increased and logistics costs could be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Meusel, Winfrid (1995): Realisierung eines Logistikberater-Arbeitsplatzes für das Frachtkostencontrolling mit wissensbasierten Elementen. Nürnberg, Univ., Diss.--Erlangen, 1995. Frankfurt am Main, Berlin: Lang (Europäische Hoch-schulschriftenReihe 5, Volks- und Betriebswirtschaft, 1755).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airline routes==

In the commercial airline industry, "milk run" has been used to describe multi-stop, regularly-scheduled flights performed by a single aircraft. Examples of such routes include:

The '''Morehead-Cain Scholarship''' (originally the '''Morehead Scholarship''') was the first merit scholarship program established in the United States, founded at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. It is named for its benefactors, [[John Motley Morehead III]] and the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation. Modeled after the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], the Morehead-Cain provides a full four-year scholarship covering tuition, books, room and board, a laptop computer, and four summer experiences known as the Morehead-Cain's Summer Enrichment Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moreheadcain.org/about/ Morehead-Cain Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228171247/http://moreheadcain.org/about/ |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominees must be a competitive applicant to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and unmarried with no children.

==History==
The Morehead Scholarship was created in 1951 by the Morehead Foundation, when [[John Motley Morehead III]], bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million, commissioned the University's planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. The Foundation and scholarship was renamed the Morehead-Cain in 2007 after the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation contributed $100 million to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topics: Morehead-Cain Scholarship|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/section/moreheadcain_scholarship|publisher=''The Daily Tarheel''|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer Enrichment Program==
The Summer Enrichment Program was established in 1974. It fully funds activities for students in four areas (Outdoor Leadership, Civic Collaboration, Global Perspective, and Professional Experience) which occur in the summers before their respective class year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Summer Enrichment Program|url=http://moreheadcain.org/about/the_summer_enrichment_program|publisher=The Morehead-Cain Foundation|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Leadership===
The summer before students enter the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, they participate in an [[National Outdoor Leadership School|NOLS]] or an [[Outward Bound]] course throughout the country in order to push themselves physically and mentally through a number of individual and group challenges.

===Civic Collaboration===
A relatively recent addition to the program is the development of the Civic Collaboration summer, in which teams of rising sophomores are placed in mid-sized US cities to partner with a governmental or community organization to help develop solutions to local and regional challenges. Previous placements have taken place in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. 

===Global Perspective===
Before the student's Junior year they have an opportunity to design a summer that will bring them into contact with a global perspective or work environment. While many students travel abroad for this summer, other elect to remain in the United States to pursue global-minded work domestically. Students may pursue study abroad programs, traditional internships, purposeful travel, or other avenues for this summer

===Professional Experience===
The final summer program encourages students to work in a professional capacity. Projects have ranged from policy work with the [[World Health Organization]] to investment banking and industry research with [[Goldman Sachs]]. This may be swapped with the Global Perspective option in the sequence of a student's summers in accordance with their individual four-year plan.

==Selection process==
The selection process for the Morehead-Cain is extremely rigorous, with only three percent of each year's nominees selected as Morehead-Cain Scholars. High school seniors demonstrating exceptional impact and academic achievement from North Carolina and from select schools across the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and various other countries are eligible for the prestigious scholarship. Criteria for selection are:

* Moral Force of Character
* Leadership
* Physical Vigor
* Scholarship

The '''Metaphysics of Quality''' ('''MoQ''') is a [[theory]] of [[reality]] introduced in [[Robert M. Pirsig|Robert Pirsig]]'s [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]], ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' (1974) and expanded in ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals]]'' (1991). The MoQ incorporates facets of [[Sophism]], [[East Asian philosophy]], [[pragmatism]], the work of [[F. S. C. Northrop]], and indigenous American philosophy. Pirsig argues that the MoQ is a better lens through which to view reality than the [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]]/[[object (philosophy)|objective]] mindset that Pirsig attributes to [[Aristotle]]. The book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' references the Sanskrit doctrine of [[Tat Tvam Asi]] or "Thou art that" which asserts an existential monism as opposed to the subject–object dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Pirsig, Robert M. ''Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance: An inquiry into values''. Random House, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Metaphysics of Quality originated with Pirsig's college studies as a [[biochemistry]] student at the [[University of Minnesota]].  He describes in ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'' that as he studied, he found the number of rational hypotheses for any given phenomenon appeared to be unlimited. It seemed to him this would seriously undermine the validity of the scientific method. His studies began to suffer as he pondered the question and eventually he was expelled from the university.

After spending some time in Korea as a soldier, Pirsig concluded that Oriental [[philosophy]] was a better place to search for ultimate answers. On his return home from Korea, Pirsig read [[F. S. C. Northrop]]'s book ''The Meeting of East and West'' which related Western culture to the [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of East Asia]] in a systematic way.  In 1950, Pirsig continued his philosophical studies at [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he came across the [[Sanskrit]] doctrine of ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]''&amp;nbsp;—in his words, "Thou art that, which asserts that everything you think you are (Subjective), and everything you think you perceive (Objective), are undivided. To fully realize this lack of division is to become enlightened." The nature of mystical experience plays an underlying role throughout his work.

In the late 1950s, Pirsig taught [[rhetoric]] at [[Montana State University|Montana State College&amp;nbsp;– Bozeman]] and, with the encouragement of an older colleague, decided to explore what exactly was meant by the term ''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]]''. He assigned his students the task of defining the word. This, coupled with a [[Native American Church]] [[peyote]] ceremony he attended with an anthropologist friend, [[James Verne Dusenberry]], led Pirsig into what he called "a mushroom cloud of thought."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Pirsig began developing his ideas about quality in his first book, ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', and expanded and codified his ideas into the MoQ in ''Lila''.

== Quality ==

"Quality," or "value," as described by Pirsig, cannot be defined because it [[empiricism|empirically]] precedes any intellectual construction of it, namely due to the fact that quality (as Pirsig explicitly defines it) exists always as a [[perceptual]] [[experience]] before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically. Quality is the "knife-edge" of experience, found only in the present, known or at least potentially accessible to all of "us" (cf. Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', 258d). Equating it with the [[Tao]], Pirsig postulates that Quality is the fundamental force in the universe stimulating everything from atoms to animals to evolve and incorporate ever greater levels of Quality. According to the MoQ, everything (including [[idea]]s, and [[matter]]) is a product and a result of Quality.

=== Static quality patterns and dynamic quality ===
The MoQ maintains that quality itself is undefinable ([[Tao]]), but to better understand it, Pirsig breaks quality down into two ("knife-edge") forms: static quality patterns (patterned) and dynamic quality (unpatterned). The four patterns of static value as well as dynamic quality account exhaustively for all of ("knife-edged") reality. As the initial (cutting edge) dynamic quality becomes habituated, it turns into static patterns (viz. [[data]], expectations). It is important to note that Pirsig is not proposing a duality: quality is one, "every last bit of it", yet [[wikt:manifestation|manifests]] itself differently. Rather than dualism, this manifestation of quality in terms of dynamic and static aspects represents a [[dialectical monism]].

==== Dynamic quality ====
Dynamic quality cannot be defined.  It can only be understood intellectually through the use of analogy.  It can be described as the force of change in the universe; when an aspect of quality becomes habitual or customary, it becomes static. Pirsig calls dynamic quality "the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality" because it can be recognized before it can be conceptualized. This is why the dynamic beauty of a piece of music can be recognized before a static analysis explaining why the music is beautiful can be constructed.

==== Static quality patterns ====
Pirsig defines static quality as everything which can be defined. Everything found in a dictionary, for instance, is static quality. These static forms, if they have enough high or low quality, are given names and are interchanged with other "people", building the base of knowledge for a culture. So some cultures divide between things other cultures perceive as equal (Pirsig gave as example the sounds of the Indian syllables "dha" and "da," which are absolutely equal to western ears), and some cultures haven't any words for a specific meaning at all (for example, Spanish has no word for "accountability"). Pirsig divides static quality into inorganic, biological, social, and intellectual patterns, in ascending order of morality. 
 
*[[Inorganic]] patterns: non-living things 
*[[biology|Biological]] patterns: living things 
*[[society|Social]] patterns: behaviors, habits, rituals, institutions. 
*[[Intellect]]ual patterns: ideas 
 
Pirsig describes [[evolution]] as the moral progression of these patterns of [[Value theory|value]]. For example, a biological pattern overcoming an inorganic pattern (e.g. bird flight which overcomes gravity) is a moral thing because a biological pattern is a higher form of evolution. Likewise, an intellectual pattern of value overcoming a social one (e.g. [[civil rights]]) is a moral development because [[intellect]] is a higher form of evolution than society. Therefore, decisions about one's conduct during any given day can be made using the Metaphysics of Quality.  It is important to note that Pirsig is not proposing criticism or responsibility, but acceptance, and pure absorption: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When he wrote it he felt momentary fright and was about to strike out the words "All of it. Every last bit of it." Madness there. I think he saw it. But he couldn’t see any logical reason to strike these words out and it was too late now for faintheartedness. He ignored his warning and let the words stand."-ZMM, Ch.20 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Good is a noun. That was it. That was what Phaedrus had been looking for. That was the homer, over the fence, that ended the ball game. Good as a noun rather than as an adjective is all the Metaphysics of Quality is about. Of course, the ultimate Quality isn't a noun or an adjective or anything else definable, but if you had to reduce the whole Metaphysics of Quality to a single sentence, that would be it."-Lila, The End&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The language we've inherited confuses this. We say "my" body and "your" body and "his" body and "her" body, but it isn't that way. … This Cartesian "Me," this autonomous little [[homunculus]] who sits behind our eyeballs looking out through them in order to pass judgment on the affairs of the world, is just completely ridiculous. This self-appointed little editor of reality is just an impossible fiction that collapses the moment one examines it."-ZMM, Ch.15&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another immoral way of killing the static patterns is to pass the patterns to someone else, in what Phaedrus called a 'karma dump.' ... If you take all this karmic garbage and make yourself feel better by passing it on to others that's normal. That's the way the world works. But if you manage to absorb it '''and not pass''' [editor's emboldening] it on, that's the highest moral conduct of all."-Lila, Ch.32&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Profit from the Core: Growth Strategy in an Era of Turbulence''''' is a non-fiction book on business strategy by American business consultant [[Chris Zook]] with James Allen. This is the first book in his ''Profit from the Core'' trilogy. The book is followed by ''[[Beyond the Core]]'' released in 2004 and ''[[Unstoppable (book)|Unstoppable]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1578512301|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title = Profit from the Core: Growth Strategy in an Era of Turbulence by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/281110.Profit_from_the_Core|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Profit from the Core: Growth Strategy in an Era of Turbulence by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The authors posit that nowadays many companies try too hard to adapt themselves to the new rules of strategy. What these companies should be doing, instead, is to opt for a course based on an honest and unbiased assessment of their core businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/2062.html|publisher=[[hbs.edu]]|title=Profit from the Core|date=2001-03-05|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zook and Allen base the book on studying some 2,000 companies and conclude that there are three factors differentiating growth strategies that work from those that don't: (1) managers have to make sure to get everything possible out of the core business, (2) expand into related businesses, and (3) redefine the business before competitors do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57851-230-0|publisher=[[publishersweekly.com]]|title=PROFIT FROM THE CORE: Growth Strategy in an Era of Turbulence|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote|At the heart of Zook's growth strategy is what he calls "adjacency expansion from the core." This is a company's movement into businesses that relate directly to the company's core that can use its strength and reinforce its power. Zook writes that a rich adjacency expansion program can help a company avoid mistakes made by companies such as [[Gucci]], which eroded its high-end brand and bottom line by expanding into lower-priced canvas goods sold through mass retailers. Zook points out that when the company finally "pruned the new, unprofitable growth," it was able to return to its core and increase profits.

Unfortunately, since Profit from the Core was published in early 2001, Zook offers [[Enron]] as an example of an energy company that sustained growth through the ideas he presents. Although Enron's shenanigans drove the company into bankruptcy by the end of the same year, the many other case studies Zook describes in his book offer an abundance of solid role models to follow when seeking growth strategies that work.}}

'''''Providence Business News''''', nicknamed '''''PBN''''', is a weekly business newspaper focusing on the economy in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts]].

The newspaper was founded in March 1986 by Robert C. Bergenheim, who at the time was also publisher of the ''[[American City Business Journals|Boston Business Journal]]'', and published its first issue that May. His son, Roger C. Bergenheim, has been the paper’s publisher for much of its history.

At the time it began, ''Providence Business News'' was one of three business publications in Rhode Island, the other two being ''Business Fortnightly of Rhode Island'' and ''Ocean State Business'', both biweekly magazines. ''Business Fortnightly'' ceased publication in June 1986, and ''Ocean State Business'' closed up shop in 1990.

In 1987, Bergenheim sold his company, P&amp;L Publications Inc., to MCP Inc. of Minneapolis, but retained part ownership in ''Providence Business News''. Roger Bergenheim succeeded him as publisher of the Boston paper in 1988 and for a time David C. Dunbar, an advertising executive at ''Providence Business News'', took over as that newspaper’s publisher, before Bergenheim returned to the post.

The paper was redesigned in 2004 by Creative Circle Media Consulting of Providence, which later redesigned and now hosts the paper’s website.

'''Robert Morris Morgenthau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr|ɡ|ən|θ|ɔː}} {{respell|MORG|ən-thaw}}; born July 31, 1919) is an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]]. From 1975 until his retirement in 2009, he was the [[District Attorney]] for [[New York County]], the borough of [[Manhattan]], having previously served as [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] throughout much of the 1960s on the appointment of [[John F. Kennedy]]. At retirement, Morgenthau was the longest-serving district attorney in the history of the [[State of New York]], although William V. Grady of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] surpassed this record at the midway point of his ninth term on January 1, 2018.

==Early life==
Morgenthau was born in 1919 in New York City into a prominent [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] family that had emigrated from [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] in 1866. He is the son of [[Elinor Morgenthau|Elinor (née Fatman)]] and long-time [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] His maternal great grandfather was [[Mayer Lehman]], a co-founder of [[Lehman Brothers]]. His grandfather, [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], was [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States Ambassador]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]]. Before going into diplomatic service, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., had made a fortune in [[real estate]], and then became a strong financial backer of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. His paternal grandmother was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau testimony to Senate Judiciary Committee, July 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From his earliest days, the Morgenthau family was well-connected politically. The family home was near [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood Estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]], and he grew up knowing Roosevelt.

After graduating from the [[New Lincoln School]], [[Deerfield Academy]], and [[Amherst College]], he enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], serving for four and a half years during World War II. He attained the final rank of [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]], and served as the executive officer of both the [[USS Lansdale (DD-426)|USS ''Lansdale'']] and the [[USS Harry F.

==Career==

===U.S. Attorney===
In 1961, after 12 years of practicing [[corporate law]], Morgenthau accepted an appointment from President [[John F. Kennedy]] as [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]]. In [[New York state election, 1962|1962]], he was the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nominee for [[Governor of New York]], and resigned his federal office. After his defeat by the incumbent Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], Morgenthau was reappointed U.S. Attorney and served for the remainder of the Kennedy and [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nypdconfidential.com/columns/2008/081201.html Aborn For Manhattan DA or Morgenthau Forever?], ''NYPD Confidential'' (December 1, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As a United States Attorney, Morgenthau established a special unit to investigate [[securities fraud]] and prosecuted highly publicized bribery cases against city officials and IRS attorneys and accountants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 1969, following the election of President [[Richard M. Nixon]], Morgenthau remained in office, and for months resisted increasingly public pressures from the Nixon Administration to resign. He retained support from New York's liberal Republican U.S. Senators [[Jacob K. Javits]] and [[Charles Goodell]]. Morgenthau and his supporters claimed that replacing him would disrupt his work on vital cases, and that Nixon might be seeking to prevent Morgenthau from pursuing investigations that would prove embarrassing to the President or his friends. Nonetheless, Morgenthau's position became increasingly untenable. While well-regarded, he was after all a Democrat thought to harbor political aspirations; thus, Morgenthau's insistence on remaining in office seemed increasingly unreasonable to even some who initially had thought the Nixon administration should not show him the door so quickly. He was eventually forced out of office at the end of 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Perez-Pena, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDA1738F930A35751C1A964958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/U/United%20States%20Attorneys U.S. Attorney Leaving Post In Manhattan] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (December 3, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded as U.S. Attorney by Republican [[Whitney North Seymour, Jr.]]

===Return to politics===
Afterwards, Morgenthau served briefly in the reformist administration of Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] as a deputy mayor, before resigning to seek the Democratic nomination for governor in [[New York state election, 1970|1970]]. Morgenthau was less successful in raising funds and developing support than were two other candidates, [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[Howard J. Samuels|Howard Samuels]], and within weeks, he withdrew from the race. Goldberg won the nomination, and was subsequently defeated by Rockefeller.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Stebenne, ''Arthur J. Goldberg, New Deal Liberal'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 375-378. {{ISBN|0-19-507105-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===District Attorney of New York County===
Morgenthau returned to private life until 1974, when he was elected to the office of District Attorney of New York County. This was a special election caused by the death of [[Frank Hogan]], who had served as DA for more than 30 years. Morgenthau defeated Hogan's interim successor, [[Richard Kuh]]. He was elected to a full term in 1977, and was re-elected seven times. He was not opposed in a general election from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29435444/ MSNBC report on Morgenthau]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau was subjected to criticism in the press for his conduct in the wake of a major police corruption scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/nyregion/koch-pledges-inquiry-on-arrests-by-transit-police.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Levine | title=Koch Pledges Inquiry on Arrests by Transit Police | date=November 25, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight men who were falsely arrested by transit police officers in the scandal that shook the department were awarded more than $1 million in damages by a federal judge. One plaintiff, Ronald Yeadon, was a police officer. He was arrested twice while off duty and accused of sexually abusing a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/12/opinion/the-even-sadder-new-york-police-saga.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Richard | last1=Emery | title=The Even Sadder New York Police Saga | date=December 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau retained a national profile while serving in what was technically a local office, in part because of his dogged pursuit of [[white-collar crime]]. According to [[Gary Naftalis]], a prominent Manhattan defense attorney who had been an assistant to Morgenthau in the 1960s, Morgenthau believed that prosecuting "crime in the suites" was every bit as important as prosecuting "crime in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Kevin. [https://www.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-06-24-morgenthau.htm Feared D.A. relishes taking down hotshots]. [[USA Today]], 2002-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau announced in 2005, aged 85, that he would run for a ninth full term as district attorney. For the first time in decades, he encountered a vigorous primary opponent - former state court judge [[Leslie Crocker Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Gray]], [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15008/ Morgenthau Gets Witchy About Leslie Crocker Snyder], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' (November 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Eaton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/nyregion/metrocampaigns/09morgy.html Snyder Faults Morgenthau on Drug Laws],
''[[The New York Times]]'' (September 9, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
Snyder won the endorsement of the ''[[New York Times]]'', which, like virtually all of the city's establishment, had long been supportive of Morgenthau.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E7DB1631F933A0575BC0A9639C8B63 When to End an Era], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 30, 2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau won the Democratic primary with 59% of the vote, to Snyder's 41%. In the general election, he was once again the candidate for all political parties in the election, having been nominated by the Democrats, Republicans, and the [[Working Families Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialaccountability.org/articles/judgessnyderandda.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau won re-election with more than 99% of the vote.

===Retirement===
On February 27, 2009, Morgenthau announced that he would not seek re-election in 2009, saying: "I never expected to be here this long ... [R]ecently, I figured that I'd served 25 years beyond the normal retirement age."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Freifeld, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ah2vfA7BieNI Morgenthau, Manhattan Prosecutor Since 1961, Won't Run Again], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' (February 29, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/saturday/news/ny-nymorg286052675feb28,0,6367166.story&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]], a prosecutor under Morgenthau and the son of former President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] [[Cyrus Vance]]. Morgenthau officially endorsed Vance on June 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26vance.html | title = Manhattan District Attorney Endorses a Candidate to Succeed Him | first = John | last = Elingon | date = June 25, 2009 | work = [[New York Times|NYTimes.com]] | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vance went on to win the primary election on September 15, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cy_vance_wins_manhattan_da_race_klECEXoy4qLaf20XLBx4iO | work=New York Post | title=Cy Vance wins Manhattan DA race | first=Clemente | last=Lisi | date=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent general election on November 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement and Return Report for Certification General Election 2009 – 11/03/2009 New York County – All Parties and Independent Bodies – District Attorney – New York|url=http://vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/results/2009/General/4.13NewYorkDistrictAttorneyRecap.pdf|website=vote.nyc.ny.us|publisher=Board Elections in the City of New York|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2010, Morgenthau joined the law firm [[Wachtell|Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=11850679&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/01/20/morganthau-90-lands-at-hard-charging-wachtell-lipton/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Morgenthau, 90, Lands at Hard-Charging Wachtell Lipton | first=Ashby | last=Jones | date=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank was seized by federal regulators shortly before Morgenthau indicted it for what he described as "the largest bank fraud in world financial history".&lt;ref name="FalseProfits"&gt;Peter Truell, Larry Gurwin, False Profits.

==Television character==
The character of District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law &amp; Order)|Adam Schiff]] (played by actor [[Steven Hill]]), the New York district attorney in the long-running TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', was loosely based on Morgenthau. Morgenthau reportedly was a fan of the character.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kolker, [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/newyork/features/9546/index1.html Happy 85th Birthday, Bob Morgenthau], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' (July 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Morgenthau's other principal civic activities were the [[Police Athletic League of New York City]], which he served since 1962, first as president and then chairman, and the [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]], of which he was chairman.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Award==
In 2005, Morgenthau received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York". Morgenthau also received the Association Medal of the [[New York City Bar Association]] for exceptional contributions to the honor and standing of the bar in the city of New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The '''Robert and Anne Dickey House''', also referred to as the '''Robert Dickey House'''&lt;ref name="NYTimes-HiddenCorners-Sep1991"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David W.|title=Hidden Corners of Lower Manhattan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/travel/hidden-corners-of-lower-manhattan.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 15, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by its address '''67 Greenwich Street''', is a [[Federal architecture|Federal]]-style building in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of Manhattan in New York City. The site is bounded by Edgar Street to the south, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Trinity Place]] to the east. It is named after Robert Dickey, a 19th-century New York merchant, and his wife Anne, who both resided in the house.&lt;ref name="NYLC-67Greenwich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-HiddenCorners-Sep1991"/&gt; Erected circa 1810, it is one of the few remaining Federal-style buildings in the city,&lt;ref name="NYLC-67Greenwich"/&gt; and was designated a New York City Landmark in 2005. Currently in disrepair, the building is slated for renovation and conversion into a school as part of the construction of the adjacent [[77 Greenwich Street]].

==Description==
The Dickey House is located at the south end of a block bounded by Edgar Street to the south, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and [[Trinity Place]] to the east, with Rector Street at the north end of the block.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="42Trinity-67Greenwich-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROBERT AND ANNE DICKEY HOUSE: 67 GREENWICH STREET|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/presentation-materials/02_16_16/67%20Greenwich%20Street.pdf|website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher=Trinity Place Holdings, [[FXFOWLE]],|accessdate=January 30, 2018|date=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to the north of the building was a former [[Syms Corporation]] store, demolished in 2017. This is the site of the future [[77 Greenwich Street]] tower.&lt;ref name="42Trinity-67Greenwich-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yimby-77Gren-Excavation-Oct2017"/&gt; Located to the south across Edgar Street is [[Elizabeth H. Berger Plaza]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; Also immediately to the south are the approaches to the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MTAmaps/&gt;

The building was designed by an unknown architect in [[Federal architecture]] style.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamonstein-Spielvogel2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-FederalEra-Jun2003" /&gt; The design has been erroneously attributed to [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]].&lt;ref name="NYLC-67Greenwich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-HiddenCorners-Sep1991"/&gt; As originally constructed the house was 3 {{frac|1|2}} stories tall, with the top {{frac|1|2}} story occupied by a [[gable|peaked]] roof.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamonstein-Spielvogel2011"/&gt; An 1872 alteration by architect [[Detlef Lienau]] replaced the peaked roof with a fourth story capped by a flat roof with a metal [[cornice]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamonstein-Spielvogel2011"/&gt; The front face of the building on Greenwich Street is flat and four-windows wide.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; The bottom floor is utilized for retail space.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;

The rear face of the building on Trinity Street is five bays wide. It features an "[[elliptical]]" or "[[Bow and arrow|bow]]-shaped" facade, which occupies the northernmost three windows and extends outward towards the street. This was an original design feature, and the 1872 remodeling maintained this element for the fourth floor.&lt;ref name="NYLC-67Greenwich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-HiddenCorners-Sep1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamonstein-Spielvogel2011"&gt;{{cite landmarks|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elliptical design has been compared to that of buildings in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="Villager-Landmarks-Aug2003"/&gt; The ellipse originally faced a garden on the property.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-CurvedFacade-Jul2003"/&gt;

The south facade on Edgar Street contains a chimney and no windows.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; It was originally adjacent to another building, until that building was demolished and Edgar Street was relocated north to front the building during the construction of the Battery Tunnel in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RizekRizek2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara Rizek|author2=Martin Rizek|author3=Joanne Medvecky|title=The Financial District's Lost Neighborhood: 1900-1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP7NMO878sEC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=January 30, 2018|year=2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-3511-1|pages=2, 12–13, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows may have existed on this face in the past.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-CurvedFacade-Jul2003"/&gt; The south face was later used as a billboard.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-FederalEra-Jun2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Villager-67Green-Jul2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Villager-Landmarks-Aug2003"/&gt; The outer facade of the house consists of red brick, but the front (Greenwich) and rear (Trinity) faces have been painted gray.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-FederalEra-Jun2003"/&gt; A one-story "commercial addition" was constructed in 1922 on the Trinity Place side of the building.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="42Trinity-67Greenwich-2016"/&gt; This addition was most recently used as a [[tavern]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-FederalEra-Jun2003" /&gt;

As of 2011, the Dickey House is one of only seven surviving pre-1810 houses located south of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamonstein-Spielvogel2011"/&gt; The building, however, has been in disrepair since the turn of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="NYLC-67Greenwich" /&gt; Currently, the house is hollowed out, with its roof and chimney removed to facilitate construction of 77 Greenwich (see below). Only three outer faces (Greenwich, Edgar, Trinity) currently make up the building.&lt;ref name="Yimby-77Gren-Excavation-Oct2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Michael|title=Excavation Begins For FXFOWLE-Designed 77 Greenwich Street, Financial District|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2017/10/excavation-begins-for-fxfowle-designed-77-greenwich-street-financial-district.html|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=New York Yimby|date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous historical landmarks are located in the vicinity of the house. To the west and north at Greenwich and Rector Streets is [[88 Greenwich Street]]. One block north of the site on Trinity Place are the [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] and the [[American Stock Exchange Building]]. To the immediate southwest across the Battery Tunnel approaches is [[21 West Street]].&lt;ref name=MTAmaps&gt;{{Cite NYCS map|neighborhood|Lower Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
As part of the construction of 77 Greenwich Street, the Dickey House will be renovated and converted for use as a public elementary school building. The school will occupy both the house and portions of the lower floors of the tower. The exterior will be restored to its 19th-century condition. The 1922-built retail addition, considered non-historical, will be removed to create a new entrance to the building. Part of the new tower will [[cantilever]] over the house. The project was designed by [[FXFOWLE]]. The house will be renovated by the [[New York City School Construction Authority]].&lt;ref name="42Trinity-67Greenwich-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yimby-77Gren-Excavation-Oct2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPost-42Trinity-NewName-Jan2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Lois|title=Trinity Place complex gets a new look — and a new name|url=https://nypost.com/2016/01/27/trinity-place-complex-gets-a-new-look-and-a-new-name/|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=[[New York Post]]|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower ends of Greenwich Street and Trinity Place were created circa 1790, when a "[[beach ridge|bluff]]" created by the [[Hudson River]] tides was leveled and filled in order to be developed.&lt;ref name="NYHerald-Battery-Swallow-Ap1946"/&gt; In 1809, Robert Dickey purchased three lots at the south end of Greenwich Street. Two of the lots were originally owned by [[Comfort Sands]] and given to his daughters in 1796. One of his daughters was the wife of New York banker and broker [[Nathaniel Prime]].&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; Dickey proceeded to construct two houses on the site, addressed 69 and 71 Greenwich Street (later 65 and 67). Stables and a storehouse fronting Trinity Place (then called Lumber Street) were also built on adjacent lots.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=House 67 Greenwich Street|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%25201831-1832%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%25201831-1832%2520-%25200577.pdf%23xml%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D66148b25%26DocId%3D7177115%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D2b4a%2B2b4b%2B2b4c%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%25201831-1832%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Advertiser%25201831-1832%2520-%25200577.pdf&amp;xml=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D66148b25%26DocId%3D7177115%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D2b4a%2B2b4b%2B2b4c%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;openFirstHlPage=false|accessdate=January 31, 2018|work=[[New York Daily Advertiser]]|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|date=January 23, 1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Greenwich Street was known as "Millionaire's Row" and later called the "Original [[Park Avenue]]", and the two houses were among numerous other Federal-style rowhouses on the street.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYHerald-Battery-Swallow-Ap1946"/&gt; Dickey acquired the adjacent 73 Greenwich Street (future 69 Greenwich) in 1816, while selling 69 Greenwich.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; He operated his business ventures from the rear of the property on Lumber Street.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; In 1821, Dickey sold the two remaining houses.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; In 1822, the [[New York City Common Council]] established the modern building addresses on Greenwich Street; 71 Greenwich Street was renamed 67 Greenwich Street.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt;

The house was transferred to Peter Schermerhorn&lt;!--, Jr.--&gt; (brother of [[Abraham Schermerhorn]]) in 1823, and the Schermerhorn family owned the building through the 19th century.&lt;ref name="DICKEY2005" /&gt; During this time, the house was rented out to prominent New Yorkers. These included [[William Bayard Jr.]], [[Nicholas Low]], and Ezra Ludlow (father of [[William H.

In the late 1860s, construction began on the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|Ninth Avenue Elevated]] railroad along Greenwich Street in front of the house. The elevated line opened in 1868. Shortly afterwards, the [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue Line]] was erected along Trinity Place (then called New Church Street), with the two lines merging at Morris Street.

===Redevelopment===
In 2008, it was revealed that the [[Syms Corporation]], who owned and operated a store in the adjacent building (42 Trinity Place), planned to develop a multi-story tower on the shop site. To do this, they would need to purchase [[air rights]] from adjacent buildings including the Dickey House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Covert|first1=James|title=Flagship Makeover|url=https://nypost.com/2008/04/29/flagship-makeover/|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=[[New York Post]]|date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Syms purchased the Dickey House.&lt;ref name="AMNY-Eyesores-Jul2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chatelain|first1=Ryan|title=10 historic New York buildings now eyesores|url=https://www.amny.com/10-historic-new-york-buildings-now-eyesores-1.883914|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=[[AM New York]]|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Syms filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its locations in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Ashley|last2=Dominguez|first2=Robert|title=Syms and Filene’s Basement file for bankruptcy and will close all stores by January|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/discount-retailers-syms-filene-basement-file-bankruptcy-close-stores-january-article-1.971141|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late 2014, Syms (now reorganized as Trinity Place Holdings) planned to construct a residential and retail tower on the former store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dailey|first1=Jessica|title=Trinity Place Development Site Could Sprout This Tower|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2014/12/17/10010872/trinity-place-development-site-could-sprout-this-tower|accessdate=January 31, 2018|work=[[Curbed]]|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the project was named 77 Greenwich Street. The plan would incorporate the Dickey House into the development, renovating the house for use as an elementary school.&lt;ref name="42Trinity-67Greenwich-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yimby-77Gren-Excavation-Oct2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPost-42Trinity-NewName-Jan2016" /&gt; Demolition of the Syms building was complete in October 2017. At this time, the chimney and north face of 67 Greenwich were removed, and metal support beams were installed to maintain the house's structural integrity.&lt;ref name="Yimby-77Gren-Excavation-Oct2017" /&gt;

'''''Street Signs''''' is a television business program that originally aired on [[CNBC]], and currently airs on [[CNBC Asia]] and [[CNBC Europe]].  Before the Asian version debuted on March 31, 2014 (see "CNBC Asia" further down this page for more information), it was broadcast on [[CNBC]] at 2:00pm ET.  The CNBC United States version's final episode aired on February 6, 2015, due to ''Power Lunch'' returning to a two-hour format.  The European version of ''Street Signs'', which is aired in a one-hour format on [[CNBC Europe]], debuted January 4, 2016 (see "CNBC Europe" further down this page for more information).

==About the show==
This program focuses on the day's market action.  In addition, prominent analysts, investors and executives regularly appear on the program to offer their perspective.

===CNBC===
[[Image:111807j.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The former set of ''Street Signs'' (2006-2010-04)]]
''Street Signs'' was originally a two-hour programme that aired on CNBC from 1996 to February 1, 2002.  It was cancelled effective February 4, 2002 and ''Power Lunch'' occupied its vacated slot as a result of CNBC's revamped programming line-up.  On December 8, 2003, former ''[[Business Center]]'' co-anchor and original host [[Ron Insana]] revived ''Street Signs''.   And in March 2006, ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'' co-anchor [[Erin Burnett]] replaced Insana as the programme's new host.  Burnett left CNBC on May 6, 2011. After Erin Burnett's departure [[Amanda Drury]] (late of CNBC Asia) and [[Brian Sullivan (news anchor)|Brian Sullivan]] (late of the Fox Business Network) became this program's new anchor team and were to be the show's final anchors.

On October 13, 2014, ''Street Signs'' was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation.

One notable segment of the programme, which aired at 2:40pm ET, the "Stop Trading!" segment, was presented by [[Jim Cramer]] (host of another CNBC program, ''[[Mad Money]]'').  In this segment, which formerly aired on ''[[Closing Bell]]'' prior to 2006-09-11, the co-anchors asked Cramer about the stocks making news, and also asked him for his take on the day's markets.  After the segment, a full-screen disclaimer was shown as ''Street Signs'' go to a commercial break. Cramer's "Stop Trading!" segment was moved to the end of the first hour of ''Squawk on the Street'' on February 9, 2015. Jim Cramer's on-air tirade about the weakening economy, which was seen during the "Stop Trading!" segment of this program on 2007-08-03, garnered widespread attention and helped galvanise the [[Federal Reserve Board]] to cut [[interest rates]].

As of January 4, 2016, the European version of ''Street Signs'' is the only CNBC Europe program that is aired on CNBC's United States channel.  Coincidentally (as previously mentioned), CNBC's own version of ''Street Signs'' aired its last show 11 months earlier, on February 6, 2015.

===CNBC Asia===
[[CNBC Asia]]'s version of ''Street Signs'' debuted March 31, 2014, with [[Martin Soong]] and [[Oriel Morrison]] as co-anchors.  Soong was previously a longtime co-anchor of ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' and Morrison was anchor of the now-cancelled ''[[Cash Flow (CNBC Asia)|Cash Flow]]''.  The background music for both the Asian and European versions is the same as CNBC Asia's ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' and CNBC United States' ''[[Squawk Alley]]''.

This programme originally aired in a two-hour format until October 29, 2018, when it was expanded to three hours (9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. SIN/HK) due to the cancellation of ''The Rundown''.

===CNBC Europe===
[[CNBC Europe]]'s version of ''Street Signs'' debuted January 4, 2016.  Airing in a one-hour format from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. CET, it replaced the first hour of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'', which itself had its airtime halved to one hour. However, the programme is occasionally extended to two hours on American bank holidays.  The CNBC Europe version of ''Street Signs'' was originally co-anchored by [[Louisa Bojesen]] and [[Carolin Roth]].  Bojesen was previously anchor of the now-cancelled ''[[European Closing Bell]]'' and Roth, who became the solo anchor of ''Street Signs'' following Bojesen's departure from CNBC Europe on April 28, 2017, was previously co-anchor of ''Worldwide Exchange''.  ''Street Signs'' is also broadcast on CNBC's United States channel from 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61270">This '''timeline of the 2007 pet food recalls''' documents how events related to the [[2007 pet food recalls]] unfolded. Several contaminated Chinese vegetable proteins were used by pet food makers in North America, Europe and South Africa, leading to [[renal failure]] in animals fed the contaminated food. Both the centralization of the pet food industry and the speed and manner of the industry and government response became the subjects of critical discussion.

==Contaminated goods are imported==

===November 6, 2006===
Tainted [[Wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]] in bags from Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company in [[People's Republic of China|China]] is imported to the [[United States]] by [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]-based [[ChemNutra|ChemNutra, Inc.]] from a Chinese textile company.

===November 2006===
[[Canada]]-based company [[Menu Foods]] begins to use the tainted wheat gluten at its plants in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Kansas]] and [[New Jersey]].

==Early reports of pet deaths==

===December 2006===
Unconfirmed reports indicate that Menu Foods receives word of a possible problem with some of its products as early as December 2006.&lt;ref name=CNN7&gt;{{cite news |first=Katy |last=Byron |title=Officials say 38 Oregon pet deaths could be tied to recall |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/04/pet.deaths/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 20, 2007===
Menu Foods acknowledges receiving the first complaints of sick pets on February 20.

===February 26, 2007===
The Chief Financial Officer of Menu Foods, Mark Wiens, sells roughly half of his Menu Foods stock on February 26 and 27.  He has referred to the timing as a "horrible coincidence."&lt;ref name=MenuCFO&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Wade McCormick |title=Menu Foods Executive Sold Shares Weeks Before Pet Food Recall |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/04/pet_food_recall21.html |publisher=Consumer Affairs |date=April 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422082448/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/04/pet_food_recall21.html |archivedate=April 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The initial recall==

===March 16, 2007===
On March 16, Menu Foods issues a U.S. nationwide recall for dog and cat foods produced at two of its facilities between December 3, 2006, and March 6, 2007.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/petfood.html |title= FDA Pet Food Recall page |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MF1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.menufoods.com/recall/Press_Recall_03162007.htm |title=Menu Foods' initial recall press release |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411185923/http://www.menufoods.com/recall/Press_Recall_03162007.htm |archivedate=2007-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial recall comprises sixty million units of cuts and gravy-style food in pouches sold under nearly 100 brand names, including premium brands like [[Iams]] and private-label brands sold at nationwide chains such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kroger]], and other large retailers.&lt;ref name=AP4&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=[[Associated Press]] |title= Owners watching pets closely after food recall - At least 16 pet deaths tied to tainted food; vets flooded with worried calls

===March 21, 2007===
Menu Foods confirms the problem was with the [[Wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]] used to thicken and enrich the gravy in the canned and pouched wet food products, and that the medical problems exhibited in test subjects include [[renal failure]].  At the time it is unknown why the renal failure occurs.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Zezima |title=Toll From Tainted Pet Food Is 14; F.D.A.

===Late March, 2007===
Following the first word of a recall, reports of pet sicknesses and deaths began to come in from throughout the United States and Canada.  Although Menu Foods products are also sold in [[Mexico]], little information is published regarding the situation in that country.

Some independent sources, such as petconnection.com, begin collecting several hundred reports of animal deaths per day.&lt;ref name=PetConnection&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.petconnection.com/recall/index.php |title=Pet Connection Food Recall Index |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==“Rat poison” alleged to be contaminant==

===March 23, 2007===
The New York State Food Laboratory reported that [[aminopterin]] was found in samples sent to them by Cornell.&lt;ref name=AP3/&gt;  Aminopterin is widely described in news reports as a "[[rat poison]]" though that assertion may be based upon a hypothetical use listed in the 1951 patent application and not upon the actual use of the chemical.&lt;ref name=notpoison&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==The recall expands==

===March 24, 2007===
Menu Foods expands the recall to include dozens of more cat and dog food products, including all varieties of 'cuts and gravy' type wet pet food in cans and pouches, not just specific [[Universal Product Code|UPCs]], as before, in order to ensure pet stores removed any chance of contaminated batches reaching consumers.&lt;ref name=MF2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://menufoods.com/recall/PRESS%20RELEASE03241409.htm |title=Press Release: Menu Foods Initiates Market Withdrawal of All Varieties of Recalled Wet Pet Food to Ensure Consumer Protection |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406195830/http://www.menufoods.com/recall/PRESS%20RELEASE03241409.htm |archivedate=2007-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wheat gluten contaminated with melamine==

===March 27, 2007===
The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] first reports that symptoms described in affected animals are not "fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin."&lt;ref name=ASPCA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_032707_2 |title=ASPCA Press Release: ASPCA Advises Caution As Pet Food Recall Crisis Grows - Other Contaminants May Be Involved in the Menu Foods Recall |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513205638/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_032707_2 |archivedate=2007-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 30, 2007===
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announces a possible source of the sicknesses, indicated by the presence of [[melamine]], an industrial chemical, in wheat gluten imported from China.  The FDA prohibits the import of wheat gluten from a specific Chinese company, Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company (徐州安营生物技术开发有限公司),&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070410102133/http://www.xzay.com/english/index.asp website]&lt;/sup&gt;, and says that the contamination may be in dry pet foods as well.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise |title=Nestlé Purina, Hills join pet food recall

Late that Friday, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc.,&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]],&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=Press release |title=Del Monte Pet Products Voluntarily Withdraws Specific Product Codes of Pet Treats and Wet Dog Food Products |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070331/20070331005023.html?.v=1 |publisher=[[Business Wire]]/[[Yahoo.com]] |date=March 31, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nestlé]] [[Nestlé Purina PetCare Company|Purina]]&lt;ref name=PRNW&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=Press Release |title=ALPO(R) Brand Prime Cuts in Gravy Canned Dog Food Voluntary Nationwide Recall - No Dry Purina Products Involved |url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/food-beverages/20070330/CLF27831032007-1.html |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=March 31, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409072546/http://sev.prnewswire.com/food-beverages/20070330/CLF27831032007-1.html |archivedate=April 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recall several brands of wet and dry pet foods.

===April 3, 2007===
Concerns are first voiced in the news media that the imported gluten may have been used in products intended for human consumption,&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news |first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Was human food tainted too? - Suspect gluten went to plants that make products for people, FDA says |url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/04/03/was_human_food_tainted_too/ |publisher=[[Boston Globe]]/[[Boston.com]] |date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) assures consumers that all of the suspect gluten was used exclusively in pet foods and there is "no evidence to suggest that any of the imported Wheat Gluten from the suspect firm has entered the human food supply."&lt;ref name=FDAFAQ/&gt;

===April 4, 2007===
The contaminated wheat gluten is determined to have come directly from China or through [[the Netherlands]] to the U.S. through ChemNutra, a Las Vegas-based supply company for pet food manufacturers.  ChemNutra orders a recall of all of the suspected wheat gluten batches.&lt;ref name=FDA2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/chemnutra04_07.html |title=FDA hosted Press Release: ChemNutra Announces Nationwide Wheat Gluten Recall |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407123242/http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/chemnutra04_07.html |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government refuses FDA requests to inspect facilities suspected of producing contaminated products.&lt;ref name="durbinletter"&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 5, 2007===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] categorically denies any connection to the North American food poisonings to the ''[[New York Times]]'', claiming they had no record of exporting any agricultural products that could have tainted the recalled pet foods, including the wheat gluten that has been the focus of the investigation.  The general manager of the Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company also denied that they had exported any wheat gluten to [[North America]].&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Barboza |title=China Says It Had Nothing to Do With Tainted Pet Foods |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/business/worldbusiness/06petfood.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login
|publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 6, 2007===
The Chinese government tells the [[Associated Press]] that they will investigate the source of the wheat gluten. The [[Xinhua News Agency]] states that "sampling and examination" of wheat gluten was underway across China, centering on the presence of melamine.&lt;ref name=AP5&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=[[Associated Press]] |title=China Looking Into Tainted Wheat Gluten Claim Over U.S. Pet Deaths |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=alerts_recalls&amp;id=5191150 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=April 8, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further recalls and possibly thousands of animals dead==

===April 9, 2007===
News breaks that scientists at a [[University of California, Davis]] animal health laboratory confirmed that a "popular brand of pet food" submitted for testing by area veterinarians was contaminated with melamine, even though it is not on the list of recalled cat and dog foods.&lt;ref name=Marin&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Staats |title=Marin case confirms new tainted pet food |url=http://www.marinij.com/marin/ci_5630208 |publisher=[[Marin Independent Journal]] |date=April 9, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 10, 2007===
On April 10, Menu Foods announces that the recall will be expanded to include foods manufactured at Menu Foods' plant in [[Streetsville, Ontario|Streetsville]], [[Ontario]].  Menu Foods officials had believed that the plant did not have the same problems as their New Jersey and Kansas plants, but tests revealed that contaminated wheat gluten had made it into Canada.&lt;ref name=AP10&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=[[Associated Press]] |title=Canadian Pet Food Added to Recall List |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-pet-food-recall,0,3756442.story?coll=chi-news-hed |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 10, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320145458/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-pet-food-recall,0,3756442.story?coll=chi-news-hed |archivedate=March 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 10 Menu Foods had only confirmed 16 deaths outside of its test subjects, comprising 15 cats and one dog.  This number is frequently cited in news reports as there is no equivalent of the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to verify the cause of other reported pet deaths.&lt;ref name="USAToday430"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/2007-04-30-chinese-imports-usat_N.htm FDA limits Chinese food additive imports], Elizabeth Weise and Julie Schmit, April 30, 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'', Accessed: 2007-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 11, 2007===
One self-reported on-line data base reaches more than 3600 deaths allegedly connected to the recall.&lt;ref name=PetConnection/&gt;  The FDA acknowledges receiving more than 15,000 complaints from consumers related to the recall, but will not comment on the possible amount of pet sicknesses or deaths.&lt;ref name=FDAFAQ&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cvm/MenuFoodRecallFAQ.htm |title=FDA Pet Food Recall Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2007-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407113721/http://www.fda.gov/cvm/MenuFoodRecallFAQ.htm |archivedate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tragic"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, a distributor of agricultural and industrial products, [[Wilbur-Ellis Company]], discovers a single pink, one-ton bag labeled "melamine" among 145 other white bags of imported rice protein concentrate from Binzhou Futian Biology Technology in China.  Wilbur-Ellis immediately quarantines the shipment.&lt;ref name="binzhou"&gt;{{cite news

By April 11 there are more than 130 brands of dog and cat foods from five companies recalled.  Most of the foods are wet, though there are some dry foods and dog biscuits as part of the recall as a precautionary measure even though no cases of poisoning from dry foods have yet been reported.

==Senate hearings==

===April 12, 2007===
Hearings are held by [[United States Senator]] [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]] in front of the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies]].  FDA officials admit that contaminated food was likely still on store shelves throughout the country, and urge consumers to re-check the food they have in their possession.&lt;ref name=NYT12&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Abruzzese |title=Tainted Pet Food Is Said to Be Still on Shelves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/us/13pets.html |publisher=New York Times |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on the 12th, Menu Foods admits that a "clerical error" allowed more tainted product to be released to the public after the recall had begun.&lt;ref name=MFPR12&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6553604,00.html April 12 Menu Foods Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recalls in South Africa==
[[Royal Canin]] dog food was recalled in [[South Africa]] on April 12 after 19 dogs were confirmed to be suffering "acute renal failure" related to eating recalled dog food.&lt;ref name="SArecall"&gt;{{cite news |first = Andrea |last = Botha |url = http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2097608,00.html |title = SA faces pet food shock |accessdate = 2007-04-15 |publisher = News24 |date = April 12, 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415072132/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2097608,00.html |archivedate = April 15, 2007 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That week Hill's Pet Nutrition also recalled a batch of food for diabetic cats in South Africa.&lt;ref name="SAimportban"/&gt;

==A second contaminated food source==

===April 15, 2007===
Wilbur-Ellis notifies the FDA that it had found a bag labelled melamine mixed in with a shipment of rice protein concentrate.&lt;ref name=binzhou /&gt;

===April 17, 2007===
On April 17 a product not containing wheat-gluten is recalled due to the  presence of [[Melamine#Toxicity|melamine]] in pet food.  Natural Balance Pet Foods has found melamine in two products containing rice protein from a then-unnamed supplier (Wilbur-Ellis).  Eleven dogs and "three or four" cats are reported as known to be suffering kidney problems as a result of eating the food.&lt;ref name="ricetoo"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 18, 2007===
The contaminated rice protein is publicly identified as having come from Wilbur-Ellis, who had by then distributed the contaminated protein to five different pet food manufacturers in Utah, New York, Kansas and Missouri.  Since pet food recalls are voluntary, the FDA refuses to name the companies involved.&lt;ref name="binzhou"/&gt;

On April 19, 2007 researchers announce that they have identified three additional chemicals in the melamine-contaminated rice protein and animals that had consumed it.  The chemicals include [[cyanuric acid]], a chemical used in chlorinated pools.  All three chemicals are derivatives of melamine.&lt;ref name=newcontam&gt;{{cite news

It is not clear whether the FDA checked samples of the same brands of food in which acetaminophen was allegedly found because the initial laboratory could not initiate contact with the FDA or publicly identify the manufacturer because of client confidentiality.  Only if the FDA contacted the lab could information be shared, and the FDA did not do this until June 12.&lt;ref name=noacetaminophen/&gt;

Most of the offending manufacturers were unlicensed food plants with fewer than 10 employees.  It is estimated that three-fourths of China's one million food processing plants are small and privately owned.

The '''United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods''' ('''CISG'''; the '''Vienna Convention''')&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Vienna, 11 April 1980, S.Treaty Document Number 98-9 (1984), UN Document Number A/CONF 97/19, 1489 UNTS 3. The full text of the CISG is available in pdf format at http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG.html at 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[treaty]] that is a uniform international sales [[law]]. It has been [[ratified]] by 89 states that account for a significant proportion of [[international trade|world trade]], making it one of the most successful international uniform laws. [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is the most recent state to ratify the Convention, having acceded to it on 29 December 2017.

The CISG was developed by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] ([[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]]), and was signed in Vienna in 1980. The CISG is sometimes referred to as the '''Vienna Convention''' (but is not to be confused with [[Vienna Convention (disambiguation)|other treaties signed in Vienna]]). It came into force as a [[multilateral treaty]] on 1 January 1988, after being ratified by 11 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Argentina, China, Egypt, France, Hungary, Italy, Lesotho, Syria, the United States, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG allows [[exporter]]s to avoid [[choice of law]] issues, as the CISG offers "accepted substantive rules on which contracting parties, courts, and [[arbitrator]]s may rely".&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Commerce, 'The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods' {{cite web|url=http://www.osec.doc.gov/ogc/occic/cisg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505032243/http://www.osec.doc.gov/ogc/occic/cisg.htm |archivedate=May 5, 2007 }} at 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless excluded by the [[express term]]s of a [[contract]],&lt;ref&gt;Standard clauses in English and in German (opt-in/opt-out): See Verweyen, [[Foerster+Rutow|Foerster]], Toufar [http://fr-lawfirm.de/de/veroeffentlichungen.html ''Handbuch des Internationalen Warenkaufs UN-Kaufrecht (CISG)''] 2. Auflage, 2008 pg. 64 {{en icon}} and {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CISG is deemed to be incorporated into (and supplant) any otherwise applicable [[domestic law]](s) with respect to a transaction in goods between parties from different Contracting States.&lt;ref&gt;This statement is only applicable for the US, The Czech Republic, and China, ''See'' Article 1,1B/95 Verweyen, Foerster, Toufar [http://fr-lawfirm.de/de/veroeffentlichungen.html ''Handbuch des Internationalen Warenkaufs UN-Kaufrecht (CISG)''] 2. Auflage, 2008 pt. 21.2 pg 248 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG has been regarded as a success for the UNCITRAL, as the Convention has been accepted by states from "every geographical region, every stage of economic development and every major legal, social and economic system".&lt;ref name="interpretation2000"&gt;John Felemegas, 'The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods: Article 7 and Uniform Interpretation (2000)' [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/felemegas.html ''Pace Review of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)''] 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries that have ratified the CISG are referred to within the treaty as "Contracting States".  Of the uniform law conventions, the CISG has been described as having "the greatest influence on the law of worldwide trans-border commerce".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schlechtriem, 'Requirements of Application and Sphere of Applicability of the CISG' (2005) 36 ''Victoria University of Wellington Law Review''  781.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as a great legislative achievement,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph  Lookofsky, 'Loose Ends and Contorts in International Sales: Problems in the Harmonization of Private Law Rules' (1991) 39 ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' 403.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "most successful international document so far" in unified international sales law,&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Zeller, ''CISG and the Unification of International Trade Law'' (1st ed, 2007) 94.&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to its flexibility in allowing Contracting States the option of taking exception to certain specified articles. This flexibility was instrumental in convincing states with disparate legal traditions to subscribe to an otherwise uniform code. While certain State parties to the CISG have lodged declarations,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' list of signatories and their declarations at http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG_status.html .&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority{{spaced ndash}}68 of the current 89 Contracting States{{spaced ndash}}have chosen to accede to the Convention without any declaration.

The CISG is the basis of the annual [[Willem C. Vis Moot|Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot]] held in Vienna in the week before [[Easter]] (and now also in Hong Kong). Teams from law schools around the world take part. The Moot is organised by [[Pace University]], which keeps a definitive source of information on the CISG.

==Reservations==
The CISG allows contracting States to lodge reservations (called "declarations" in the CISG own language). About one fourth of the CISG contracting States have done so.

Declarations may refer to:

*opting out of article 1(1)(b) CISG, which allows for the application of the CISG in cases when the rules of private international law point at the law of a contracting State as the law applicable to the contract for sale of goods (article 95 CISG);
*mandatory written form of the contract for sale of goods (articles 11, 12 and 96 CISG);
*opting out of the application of Part II or Part III CISG (article 92 CISG);
*not applying the CISG to contracts concluded between parties with place of business in "which have the same or closely related legal rules on matters governed" by the CISG (article 94 CISG).

Some existing declarations have been reviewed and withdrawn by States. [[Nordic countries]] (''i.e.'', members of the [[Nordic Council]]) (except Iceland) had originally opted out of the application of Part II under article 92 CISG. However, they recently withdrew their Article 92 CISG reservations and became a party to Part II CISG, except for trade among themselves, to which the CISG is not applied as a whole due to a declaration lodged under article 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2014/unisl198.html|title=Norway Becomes a Party to Part II (Formation of the Contract) of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, China,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2013/unisl180.html|title=China Withdraws “Written Form” Declaration Under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latvia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2012/unisl177.html|title=Latvia Withdraws “Written Form” Declaration Under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2013/unisl192.html|title=Lithuania Withdraws "Written Form" Declaration Under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hungary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2015/unisl219.html|title=Hungary Withdraws "Written Form" Declaration Under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; withdrew their written form declaration, and the Czech Republic withdrew its declaration preventing the application of article 1(1)(b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2017/unisl256.html|title=Czech Republic Withdraws Declarations under the CISG and the Limitation Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have expanded rather than restricted CISG application by removing one of the cumulative conditions for application within the CISG. For example, Israeli law stipulates that the CISG will apply equally to a party whose place of business is in a State that is not a Contracting State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/countries/cntries-Israel.html|title=CISG: participating countries - Israel|last=|first=|date=2003-07-08|website=Pace Law School Institute of International Commercial Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major absentees==
[[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/countries/cntries-China.html|title=CISG: participating countries - China (PRC)|last=|first=|date=2014-10-10|website=Pace Law School Institute of International Commercial Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/cisgintro.html|title=Electronic Library on International Commercial Law and the CISG|last=|first=|date=|website=Pace Law School Institute of International Commercial Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]] are the only major trading countries that have not yet ratified the CISG.

The absence of the United Kingdom, a leading jurisdiction for the [[choice of law]] in international commercial contracts, has been attributed variously to: the government not viewing its ratification as a legislative priority, a lack of interest from business in supporting  ratification, opposition from a number of large and influential organisations, a lack of public service resources, and a danger that London would lose its edge in international arbitration and litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=Sally|date=June 2005|title=Why the United Kingdom Has Not Ratified the CISG|url=https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/CISG25/Moss.pdf|journal=Journal of Law and Commerce|volume=25|pages=483-485|via=UNCITRAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan currently may not become a party to treaties deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Rwanda&lt;ref&gt;Law N°68/2013 of 30/08/2013 Authorising the Accession to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods Adopted in Vienna in 1980
Official Gazette nº51 of 23 December 2013
&lt;/ref&gt; and Guatemala&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=64990939-16f3-42c2-a7f0-03c2765daa7a|title=Guatemala aprueba la adhesión a la Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Contratos de Compraventa Internacional de Mercaderías (CISG) {{!}} Lexology|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded the domestic procedure of consideration of the CISG and adopted laws authorising its adoption; the CISG will enter into force for it once the instrument of accession is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. A number of other countries, including Kazakhstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economy.gov.kz/ru/pages/o-proekte-zakona-respubliki-kazahstan-o-ratifikacii-konvencii-organizacii-obedinennyh-naciy-o|title=О проекте Закона Республики Казахстан  «О ратификации Конвенции Организации Объединенных Наций  о договорах международной купли-продажи товаров» {{!}} Министерство национальной экономики Республики Казахстан|website=economy.gov.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made progress in the adoption process.

==Language, structure, and content==
The CISG is written using "[[plain language]] that refers to things and events for which there are words of common content".&lt;ref&gt;John Honnold, ''Uniform Law for International Sales under the 1980 United Nations Convention'' (3rd ed. 1999) 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a conscious intent to allow national legal systems to be transcended through the use of a common legal ''[[lingua franca]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hellner, 'The UN Convention on International Sales of Goods – An Outsider's View' in Erik Jayme (ed) ''Ius Inter Nationes: Festschrift fur Stefan Riesenfeld'' (1983) 72, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and avoids the "words associated with specific domestic legal nuances".&lt;ref name="interpretation2000"/&gt;  Further, it facilitated the translation{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} into the UN's six official languages.&lt;ref&gt;Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish / non-official translations of the CISG See: http://www.fr-lawfirm.de/links/pages/UN-Kaufrecht/Texte_Uebersetzungen/.&lt;/ref&gt; As is customary in UN conventions all 6 languages are equally authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Article 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG is divided into four parts:

===Part I: Sphere of Application and General Provisions (Articles 1–13)===

The CISG applies to contracts of the sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States, when the States are Contracting States (Article 1(1)(a)). Given the significant number of Contracting States, this is the usual path to the CISG's applicability.

The CISG also applies if the parties are situated in different countries (which need not be Contracting States) and the conflict of law rules lead to the application of the law of a Contracting State.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 (b).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a contract between a Japanese trader and a Brazilian trader may contain a clause that arbitration will be in Sydney under Australian law&lt;ref&gt;More correctly, the law of [[New South Wales]] as mandated in Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention) Act 1986 (NSW).&lt;/ref&gt; with the consequence that the CISG would apply.  A number of States have declared they will not be bound by this condition.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, China, Germany, Czech Republic, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Singapore, Slovakia, and the United States of America.  ''See'' http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG_status.html at 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG is intended to apply to commercial goods and products only.  With some limited exceptions, the CISG does not apply to personal, family, or household goods, nor does it apply to auctions, ships, aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or intangibles&lt;ref&gt;From Article 2 (d) and (f), intangibles such as [[stock]]s, [[share (finance)|share]]s, [[investment securities]], [[negotiable instruments]] or money, and electricity.&lt;/ref&gt; and services.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3- However, Sale of Goods contracts under the CISG may include services (''e.g.'', transport, erection, supervision, training) up to 50% of the agreed contract price at the date of the signature of the contract (''See'' Verweyen/Foerster/Toufar Handbuch des Internationalen Warenkaufs UN-Kaufrechts (CISG) 2. Auflage, 2008 2.1.1 p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;  The position of computer software is 'controversial'&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Peter Schlechtriem, 'Requirements of Application and Sphere of Applicability of the CISG' (2005) 36 ''Victoria University of Wellington Law Review'' 781.&lt;/ref&gt; and will depend upon various conditions and situations.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Diedrich, 'Maintaining Uniformity in International Uniform Law Via Autonomous Interpretation: Software Contracts and the CISG' (1996) 8 ''Pace International Law Review'' 303, 321, 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, parties to a contract may exclude or vary the application of the CISG.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 6, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Interpretation of the CISG is to take account of the 'international character' of the Convention, the need for uniform application, and the need for [[good faith]] in international trade.  Disputes over interpretation of the CISG are to be resolved by applying the 'general principles' of the CISG, or where there are no such principles but the matters are governed by the CISG (a gap ''[[praeter legem]]'') by applying the rules of [[private international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key point of controversy was whether or not a contract requires a written memorial to be binding. The CISG allows for a sale to be oral or unsigned,&lt;ref&gt;Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but in some countries, contracts are not valid unless written.  In many nations, however, [[oral contract]]s are accepted, and those States had no objection to signing, so States with a strict written requirement exercised their ability to exclude those articles relating to oral contracts, enabling them to sign as well.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, Argentina, Belarus, Chile, China, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Paraguay, Russian Federation, and Ukraine are not bound by Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG is not a complete qualification by its own definition.&lt;ref&gt;Article 5,1–78&lt;/ref&gt; These gaps must be filled in by the applicable [[national law]] under due consideration of the conflict of law rules applicable at the place of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;In the toolbox (CD-Rom, which is attached to the Verweyen, Foerster, Toufar [http://fr-lawfirm.de/de/veroeffentlichungen.html ''Handbuch des Internationalen Warenkaufs UN-Kaufrecht (CISG)''] 2. Auflage, 2008, the parties can easily identify the gaps and how they will be filled under the assumption of Swiss or German applicable law. This toolbox also comprises a software to determine the application of the CISG&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Formation of the Contract (Articles 14–24)===

An offer to contract must be addressed to a person, be sufficiently definite – that is, describe the goods, quantity, and price – and indicate an intention for the offeror to be bound on acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Article 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The CISG does not appear to recognise [[common law]] unilateral contracts&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company'' (1892) 2 QB 484.&lt;/ref&gt; but, subject to clear indication by the offeror, treats any proposal not addressed to a specific person as only an invitation to make an offer.&lt;ref&gt;Article 14 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, where there is no explicit price or procedure to implicitly determine price, then the parties are assumed to have agreed upon a price based upon that 'generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, an offer may be revoked provided the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer, or before the offeree has sent an acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 15, 16 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some offers may not be revoked; for example when the offeree reasonably relied upon the offer as being irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;Article 16 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; The CISG requires a positive act to indicate acceptance; silence or inactivity are not an acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Article 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG attempts to resolve the common situation where an offeree's reply to an offer accepts the original offer, but attempts to change the conditions. The CISG says that any change to the original conditions is a rejection of the offer—it is a [[counter-offer]]—unless the modified terms do not materially alter the terms of the offer. Changes to price, payment, quality, quantity, delivery, liability of the parties, and [[arbitration]] conditions may all materially alter the terms of the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Sale of Goods (Articles 25–88)===

Articles 25–88; sale of goods, obligations of the seller, obligations of the buyer, passing of risk, obligations common to both buyer and seller.

The CISG defines the duty of the seller, 'stating the obvious',&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;Jacob Ziegel and Claude Samson 'Report to the Uniform Law Conference of Canada on Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods' (1981) Toronto 168–305.&lt;/ref&gt; as the seller must deliver the goods, hand over any documents relating to them, and transfer the property in the goods, as required by the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Article 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the duty of the buyer is to take all steps 'which could reasonably be expected'&lt;ref&gt;Article 60.&lt;/ref&gt; to take delivery of the goods, and to pay for them.&lt;ref&gt;Article 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the goods must be of the quality, quantity, and description required by the contract, be suitably packaged and fit for purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Article 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  The seller is obliged to deliver goods that are not subject to claims from a [[Third-party beneficiary|third party]] for infringement of industrial or [[intellectual property]] rights in the State where the goods are to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 41, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  The buyer is obliged to promptly examine the goods and, subject to some qualifications, must advise the seller of any lack of conformity within 'a reasonable time' and no later than within two years of receipt.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 38, 39, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISG describes when the risk passes from the seller to the buyer&lt;ref&gt;Articles 66, 67, 68, 69, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been observed that in practice most contracts define the 'seller's delivery obligations quite precisely by adopting an established shipment term,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; such as [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] and [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' International Commercial Terms ([[Incoterms]]) in External Links.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedies of the buyer and seller depend upon the character of a breach of the contract.  If the breach is fundamental, then the other party is substantially deprived of what it expected to receive under the contract.  Provided that an objective test shows that the breach could not have been foreseen,&lt;ref&gt;Article 25.&lt;/ref&gt; then the contract may be avoided&lt;ref&gt;Article 49, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the aggrieved party may claim damages.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 74, 75, 76, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Where part performance of a contract has occurred, then the performing party may recover any payment made or good supplied;&lt;ref&gt;Article 81.&lt;/ref&gt; this contrasts with the common law where there is generally no right to recover a good supplied unless title has been retained or damages are inadequate, only a right to claim the value of the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf ''Doulton Potteries v Bronotte'' (1971) 1 NSWLR 591 for example of damages as inadequate.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the breach is not fundamental, then the contract is not avoided and remedies may be sought including claiming damages, specific performance, and adjustment of price.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 61, 62, 63, 65, 74, 75, 76, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Damages that may be awarded conform to the common law rules in ''Hadley v Baxendale''&lt;ref&gt;''Hadley v Baxendale'' (1854) 9 Exch 341.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been argued the test of foreseeability is substantially broader&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; and consequently more generous to the aggrieved party.

The CISG excuses a party from liability to a claim of damages where a failure to perform is attributable to an impediment beyond the party's, or a third party sub-contractor's, control that could not have been reasonably expected.&lt;ref&gt;Article 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an extraneous event might elsewhere be referred to as ''[[force majeure]]'', and frustration of the contract.

Where a seller has to refund the price paid, then the seller must also pay interest to the buyer from the date of payment.&lt;ref&gt;Article 84 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been said the interest rate is based on rates current in the seller's State '[s]ince the obligation to pay interest partakes of the seller's obligation to make restitution and not of the buyer's right to claim damages',&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Draft Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Prepared by the Secretariat, UN Doc. A/CONF.97/5 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; though this has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schlechtriem, ''Uniform Sales Law – The UN-Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods'' (1st ed, 1986) 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a mirror of the seller's obligations, where a buyer has to return goods the buyer is accountable for any benefits received.&lt;ref&gt;Article 84 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IV: Final Provisions (Articles 89–101)===
Articles 89–101 (final provisions) include how and when the Convention comes into force, permitted reservations and declarations, and the application of the Convention to international sales where both States concerned have the same or similar law on the subject.

The Part IV Articles, along with the Preamble, are sometime characterized as being addressed 'primarily to States',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Winship, 'Commentary on Professor Kastely's ''Rhetorical Analysis''' (1988) 8 ''Northwestern Journal of Law &amp; Business'' 623, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; not to business people attempting to use the Convention for international trade. They may, however, have a significant impact upon the CISG's practical applicability,&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich G. Schroeter, 'Backbone or Backyard of the Convention? The CISG's Final Provisions', in: C.B. Andersen &amp; U.G. Schroeter (eds.), ''Sharing International Commercial Law across National Boundaries: Festschrift for Albert H. Kritzer on the Occasion of his Eightieth Birthday,'' London: Wildy, Simmonds &amp; Hill (2008), 425 at 426.&lt;/ref&gt; thus requiring careful scrutiny when determining each particular case.

==Commentary on the Convention==
It has been remarked that the CISG expresses a practice-based, flexible and "relational" character. It places no or very few restrictions of form on formation or adjustment of contracts; in case of non-performance (or over-performance) it offers a wide array of interim measures before the aggrieved party must resort to avoiding the contract (e.g. unilateral pro-rated price reduction (Art. 50); suspension of performance (art. 71); the availability of cure as a matter of right of the defaulting party (subject to some reservations, Art. 48); choice between expectation and market-based damages, etc.); additionally, the CISG does not operate under a "perfect tender" rule and its criteria for conformity are functional rather than formal (art. 35).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=951020 Jonathan Yovel, The Buyer's Right to Avoid the Contract in International Sales, in John Felemegas, ed., AN INTERNATIONAL APPROACH TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF GOODS (Cambridge University Press, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, its rules of interpretation rely heavily on custom as well as on manifest acts rather than on intent (Art. 8). The CISG does include a so-called Nachlass rule, but its scope is relatively limited. On the other hand, its good faith obligation may seem relatively limited and in any case obscure (Art. 7). All communications require "reasonable time."

Although the Convention has been accepted by a large number of States, it has been the subject of some criticism.  For example, the drafting nations have been accused of being incapable of agreement on a code that "concisely and clearly states universal principles of sales law", and through the Convention's invitation to interpret taking regard of the Convention's "international character"&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; gives judges the opportunity to develop "diverse meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Rosett, 'CSIG laid Bare: A Lucid Guide to a Muddy Code' (1988) 21 ''Cornell International Law Journal'' 575.&lt;/ref&gt;  Put more bluntly, the CISG has been described as "a variety of vague standards and compromises that appear inconsistent with commercial interests".&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Gillette and Robert Scott, 'The Political Economy of International Sales Law' (2005) 25 ''International Review of Law and Economics'' 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrary view is that the CISG is "written in plain business language," which allows judges the opportunity to make the Convention workable in a range of sales situations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Nicholas Whittington, 'Comment on Professor Schwenzer's Paper' (2005) 36 ''Victoria University of Wellington Law Review'' 809.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been said "the drafting style is lucid and the wording simple and uncluttered by complicated subordinating clauses", and the "general sense" can be grasped on the first reading without the need to be a sales expert.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ziegel, 'The Future of the International Sales Convention from a Common Law Perspective' (2000) 6 ''New Zealand Business Law Quarterly'' 336, 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniform application of the CISG is problematic because of the reluctance of courts to use "solutions adopted on the same point by courts in other countries",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Joachim Bonell and Fabio Liguori, 'The U.N. Convention on the International Sale of Goods: A Critical Analysis of Current International Case Law' (1997) 2 ''Revue de Droit Uniforme'' 385.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in inconsistent decisions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Article 7 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in a case involving the export to Germany by a Swiss company of New Zealand [[mussel]]s with a level of [[cadmium]] in excess of German standards, the [[Federal Court of Justice|German Supreme Court]] held that it is ''not'' the duty of the seller to ensure that goods meet German public health regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesgerichtshof VIII ZR 159/94.  English language abstract available at http://www.uncitral.org/clout/showDocument.do?documentUid=1326 at 22 December 2007. ).  Full translation available at http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cases/950308g3.html#ta at 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasted with a later decision in which an Italian cheese exporter failed to meet French packaging regulations, and the French court decided it was the duty of the seller to ensure compliance with French regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Caiato Roger v La Société française de factoring'' international factor France (SA) (1995) 93/4126.  English language abstract available at http://www.uncitral.org/clout/showDocument.do?documentUid=1425 at 22 December 2007.  Full translation available at http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cases/950913f1.html at 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two cases were held by one commentator to be an example of contradictory [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Another commentator, however, saw the cases as not contradictory, as the German case could be distinguished on a number of points.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Charters, 'Fitting the Situation: The CISG and the Regulated Market' (2005) 4 ''Washington University Global Studies Law Review'' 1, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The French court chose not to consider the German court's decision, in its published decision.  (Precedent, foreign or not, is not legally binding in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]].)

CISG advocates are also concerned that the natural inclination of judges is to interpret the CISG using the methods familiar to them from their own State&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Whittington, 'Comment on Professor Schwenzer's Paper' (2005) 36 Victoria University of Wellington Law Review 809.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than attempting to apply the general principles of the Convention or the rules of private international law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  This is despite the comment from one highly respected academic that 'it should be a rare, or non-existent, case where there are no relevant general principles to which a court might have recourse' under the CISG.&lt;ref&gt;John Felemegas, 'The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods: Article 7 and Uniform Interpretation (2000)' ''Pace Review of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)'' 115, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concern was supported by research of the CISG Advisory Council which said, in the context of the interpretation of Articles 38 and 39,&lt;ref&gt;Articles 38 and 39 discuss the notice to be given by the buyer to the seller of non-conforming goods.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a tendency for courts to interpret the articles in the light of their own State's law, and some States have 'struggled to apply [the articles] appropriately'.&lt;ref&gt;CISG-AC Opinion No 2, Examination of the Goods and Notice of Non-Conformity – Articles 38 and 39, 7 June 2004. Rapporteur: Professor Eric Bergsten, Emeritus, Pace University New York 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of a number of criticisms&lt;ref&gt;''See also'' for example, Antonin Pribetic, 'The (CISG) Road Less Travelled: GreCon Dimter Inc. v. J.R. Normand Inc.' (2006) 44 (1) ''Canadian Business Law Journal'' 92.&lt;/ref&gt; of Canadian court decisions to use local legislation to interpret the CISG, one commentator said the CISG was designed to 'replace existing domestic laws and [[caselaw]],' and attempts to resolve gaps should not be by 'reference to relevant provisions of [local] sales law'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mazzacano, 'Canadian Jurisprudence and the Uniform Application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods' (2006) 18 (1) ''Pace International Law Review'' 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the multiple language versions of the CISG assert it is inevitable the versions will not be totally consistent because of translation errors and the untranslatability of 'subtle nuances' of language.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Rossett, 'Critical Reflections on the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods' (1984) 45 ''Ohio State Law Journal'' 265, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument, though with some validity, would not seem peculiar to the CISG but common to any and all treaties that exist in multiple languages.  The ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' would seem to be that all international treaties should exist in only a single language, something which is clearly neither practical nor desirable.

Other criticisms of the Convention are that it is incomplete, there is no mechanism for updating the provisions, and no international panel to resolve interpretation issues.  For example, the CISG does not govern the validity of the contract, nor does it consider electronic contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ziegel, 'The Future of the International Sales Convention from a Common Law Perspective' (2000) 6 ''New Zealand Business Law Quarterly'' 336, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal matters relating to the use of electronic communications in relation to contracts for international sale of goods have been eventually dealt with in a comprehensive manner in the [[United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts]]. Moreover, it is not to be forgotten that the CISG is complemented by the [[Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods]] with respect to the limitation of actions due to passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;Luca G. Castellani, The Contribution of UNCITRAL to the Harmonization of International Sale of Goods Law Besides the CISG, Belgrade Law Review, Year LIX (2011) no. 3 pp. 28-38, at 28-33, available online at http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/castellani3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the critics, a supporter has said '[t]he fact that the costly ignorance of the early days, when many lawyers ignored the CISG entirely, has been replaced by too much enthusiasm that leads to ... oversimplification, cannot be blamed on the CISG'.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Ferrari, 'What Sources of Law for Contracts for the International Sale of Goods?  Why One Has to Look Beyond the CISG' (2005) 25 ''International Review of Law and Economics'' 314, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
Greater acceptance of the CISG will come from three directions.  Firstly, it is likely that within the global legal profession, as the numbers of new lawyers educated in the CISG increases, the existing Contracting States will embrace the CISG, appropriately interpret the articles, and demonstrate a greater willingness to accept precedents from other Contracting States.

Secondly, business people will increasingly pressure both lawyers and governments to make sales of goods disputes less expensive, and reduce the risk of being forced to use a legal system that may be completely alien to their own.  Both of these objectives can be achieved through use of the CISG.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

Finally, UNCITRAL will arguably need to develop a mechanism to further develop the Convention and to resolve conflicting interpretation issues.&lt;ref&gt;See John Felemegas, 'The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods: Article 7 and Uniform Interpretation (2000)' ''Pace Review of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)'' Chapter 3 for a discussion on how this could be achieved.&lt;/ref&gt;  This will make it more attractive to both business people and potential Contracting States.

==Differences with country legislation relating to the sale of goods==

Depending on the country, the CISG can represent a small or significant departure from local legislation relating to the sale of goods, and in this can provide important benefits to companies from one contracting state that import goods into other states that have ratified the CISG.

===Differences with US legislation (the UCC)===
[[File:Uniform Commercial Code.jpg|thumb|right|The official 2007 edition of the UCC.]]
In the U.S., all 50 states have, to varying degrees, [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] common legislation referred to as the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] ("UCC").  UCC Articles 1 (General Provisions) and 2 (Sales) are generally similar to the CISG.  However, the UCC differs from the CISG in some respects, such as the following areas that tend to reflect more general aspects of the U.S. legal system:

:Terms of Acceptance – Under the CISG, acceptance occurs when it is received by the offeror, a rule similar to many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions which contemplate for service to be effective upon receipt.  By contrast, the U.S. legal system often applies the so-called "[[mailbox rule]]" by which, acceptance, like service, can occur at the time the offeree transmits it to the offeror.

{{quote|Battle of the Forms" – Under the CISG, a reply to an offer that purports to be an acceptance, but has additions, limitations, or other modifications, is generally considered a rejection and counteroffer.  The UCC, on the other hand, tries to avoid the "battle of the forms" that can result from such a rule, and allows an expression of acceptance to be operative, unless the acceptance states that it is conditioned on the offeror consenting to the additional or different terms contained in the acceptance.

Writing Requirement – Unless otherwise specified by a ratifying State, the CISG does not require that a sales contract be reduced to a writing.  Under the UCC's [[statute of frauds]] (inherited from the common law), contracts selling goods for a price of $500 or more are generally not enforceable unless in writing.}}

Nevertheless, because the U.S. has ratified the CISG, the CISG in the U.S. has the force of [[federal law]] and supersedes UCC-based state law under the [[Supremacy Clause]]. Among the U.S. [[reservation (law)|reservations]] to the CISG is the provision that the CISG will apply only as to contracts with parties located in other CISG Contracting States, a reservation permitted by the CISG in Article 95. Therefore, in ''international'' contracts for the sale of goods between a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]] and an entity of a Contracting State, the CISG will apply unless the contract's [[choice of law]] clause specifically excludes CISG terms. Conversely, in "international" contracts for the sale of goods between a U.S. entity and an entity of a non-Contracting State, to be adjudicated by a U.S. court, the CISG will not apply, and the contract will be governed by the domestic law applicable according to private international law rules.

'''Wrexham Town Centre''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Wrexham]], in [[North Wales]] and is the area enclosed by the inner ring road of the town. It is the largest shopping area in north and mid [[Wales]], and the administrative centre of [[Wrexham County Borough]]. Many of its streets are pedestrianised.

== Geography ==
The area encompassed by the inner ring road is Grosvenor Road, Powell Road, Bodhyfryd, St. Georges Crescent (The Beast Market), Smithfield Road, Eagles Meadow, Salop Road, St. Giles Way, Pen-Y-Bryn, Ruthin Road, Bradley Road and Watery Road. It is primarily urban in nature, with the exception of the town centre's largest green space at [[Belle Vue Park, Wrexham|Belle-Vue Park]]. The area is predominately non-residential, notable exceptions being Eagles Meadow and around Parciau.

== History ==
{{main|History of Wrexham}}
The town centre is Wrexham's medieval core, and as such contains most of its history. The town centre expands outwards from the hill top [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham|St. Giles Church]], which itself is surrounded by a number of small medieval streets and alleyways.

== Areas ==
Whilst the term 'Town Centre' can be used quite liberally in Wrexham, it can be split into a number of smaller distinct areas, which have their own character and purpose within the town. Some of these are officially recognised by Wrexham Council, others are more a description of distinct areas.

=== The High Street and St. Giles ===
[[Image:Zzdti121085.jpg|thumb|250px|right|St. Giles Church Steeple - One of the Seven Wonders of Wales]]
This is Wrexham's original town centre, beginning at the church of St. Giles. This area was once the traditional High Street of the town containing most of its traditional shops and markets. It is now home to most of Wrexham's night-life including clubs, bars and restaurants. During the day the main attractions are the area's cafes and the historic 'Butchers Market' hall situated on High Street. The church of St. Giles is one of the [[Seven Wonders of Wales]] and often noted as the finest example of [[Gothic architecture]] in [[Wales]]. It is also home to the tomb of [[Elihu Yale]].

=== Eagles Meadow ===
{{main|Eagles Meadow}}
Eagle's Meadow is an open-air shopping centre in the south-east of the town centre. Opened in 2008, the complex is situated between Yorke Street and the inner ring road at Smithfield. The area incorporates a number of new buildings and public spaces, and includes a bridge to Yorke Street and an entrance in the style of the 'Spanish Steps' in Rome. Eagle's Meadow holds many top highstreet chain stores over two levels, alongside an 8-screen cinema and 24-lane [[10 pin bowling]] [[bowling alley|alley]]. It occupies the site of a former car-park and [[Asda]] superstore.

=== Civic Centre ===
Formerly known as the [[Civic Centre]] this quarter of the town centre can be thought of as everything north of Holt and Lampbit Street and east of Rhosddu Road. The area is bisected north to south by Chester Street. The area consists almost entirely of public services, arts and media centres. It is home to [[Wrexham County Borough]] Council HQ, [[North Wales Police]] (Eastern Division) HQ, [[BBC Wales]] (Wrexham) Studios, [[ITV Wales]] (Wrexham Bureau), Library and Arts Centre, Yale College of Wrexham, Wrexham Waterworld and a number of criminal and civil law courts. The area is also home to Llwyn Isaf, one of the town centre's largest green areas.

=== Island Green ===
Formerly an industrial area the location was home to the Island Green Brewery and [[Wrexham Central railway station]]. It is now a shopping area, developed in the late 1990s. The old oast houses used in the Brewery are now converted into apartments aside the [[River Gwenfro]], which cuts through the shopping area. During re-development the railway station was moved 500 yards west, and the station now sits inside the shopping area. Trains run from Wrexham Central to local suburban stations, [[Deeside]], the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and [[Wrexham General railway station|Wrexham General]] for connections onto inter-city services.

=== Main Shopping Area ===
The main arteries of the town centre link all previous areas. Running in an easterly direction from Grosvenor Road, Regent Street and Hope Street are the main shopping streets within the town, terminating at the base of St. Giles' Church on High Street. Leading off these streets are a number of other streets, including Queen Street. The majority of this area is pedestrianised, and contains a number of notable landmarks including the thatched 'Horse &amp; Jockey' pub and mock Tudor architecture at Hope St/Queen St.

=== Queens Square ===
The square is the focal point in the town centre. It plays host to daily events, Christmas celebrations and weekly markets. The square merges with Llwyn Isaf.

=== Parciau (Including Pen-y-Bryn) ===
{{main|Belle Vue Park, Wrexham}}
Parciau is the name given to the southernmost area of the town centre. Much of the area is covered by [[Belle Vue Park, Wrexham]], a substantial [[Victorian era|Victorian]] park built to commemorate the Jubilee of Wrexham's charter. The park is known for its bowl, which holds many summer musical events. Bridge Street, Pen-y-Bryn and Ruthin road all come under the Parciau area.
