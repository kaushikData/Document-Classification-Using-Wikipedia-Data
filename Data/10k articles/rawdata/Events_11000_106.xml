The '''1915 to 1918 English cricket seasons''' were all but wiped out by the [[First World War]].

The [[1914 English cricket season]] ended prematurely after the outbreak of the war and it was not until the [[1919 English cricket season|1919 season]] that normal first-class fixtures could resume.

However, cricket did not fade away during the war: it was played in schools and universities, on the streets and by the soldiers and airmen on active service, whilst ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|John Wisden’s Cricketers’ Almanac]]'' continued to publish every spring.

==1915==
The 1915 [[County Championship]] was not officially abandoned until January. [[Surrey CCC]], despite [[The Oval]] having been commandeered by the military, issued a statement that spring which “hoped that some matches may be played in July and August”.  It was a [[forlorn hope]].

==1916==
Club cricket in the south of England went into serious decline and many clubs closed down indefinitely.  In the north, efforts were made to keep the leagues alive and the Bradford League did very well indeed, with large crowds reported, especially after the Saltaire club signed the great bowler [[Sydney Barnes]].

==1917==
[[Plum Warner]], at home on sick leave, had an idea to stage services charity matches at [[Lord's]].  These would involve Dominions teams against English servicemen. [[Colin Blythe]] played in one shortly before he was killed.

The number of games increased as cricket began to be viewed as a morale booster.  Birley records that "as many as 119 services and schools games were played at Canterbury in 1917”.

A Yorkshire County XII played two-day matches against teams representing the Bradford League and the Yorkshire Council league.

When the 1918 ''Wisden'' was published, it honoured the ''School Bowlers of the Year'' - [[Harry Calder]], [[John Firth (cricketer)|John Firth]], [[Clement Gibson]], [[Gerard Rotherham]] and [[Greville Stevens]].

==1918==
The charity and holiday games continued in 1918.  This was a second successive warm summer&lt;ref&gt;[http://climexp.knmi.nl//data/tstcet.txt Hadley Centre Central England Temperature]&lt;/ref&gt; and games were again well attended, especially league games with former county or Test professionals in action.

The 1919 ''Wisden'' honoured ''Five Public School Cricketers of the Year'' - [[Percy Adams (cricketer)|Percy Adams]], [[Percy Chapman]], [[Adrian Gore (cricketer)|Adrian Gore]], [[Lionel Hedges]] and [[Norman Partridge (cricketer)|Norman Partridge]]. Chapman went on to captain England.

The '''1971 Miller High Life 500''' was a [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) event that took place at [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]].&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=1971-05&amp;series=W| title = 1971 Miller High Life 500 information | publisher = Racing Reference | date = | accessdate = 2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race car drivers still had to commute to the races using the same stock cars that competed in a typical weekend's race through a policy of [[homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] (and under their own power). This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power any more.

==Summary==
Two hundred laps were taken on a paved [[oval track racing|oval track]] spanning {{convert|2.500|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; The total time of the race was three hours, forty-three minutes, and thirty-six seconds.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; This would be the first event to ever take place at Ontario Speedway. The day of the race was February 28, 1971.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt;

Average speed was {{convert|134.168|mi/h}} and the pole position speed was {{convert|151.711|mi/h}}.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; There were five cautions for 21 laps and the margin of victory was 8½ seconds.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; With an attendance of nearly seventy-nine thousand people, the race was well attended even by modern standards.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fantasyracingcheatsheet.com/nascar/races/results/1971/ontario-motor-speedway/miller-high-life-500/1216| title = 1971 Miller High Life 500 information (third reference) | publisher = Fantasy Racing Cheat Sheet | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven notable crew chiefs were recorded as being a part of this event; including [[Paul Goldsmith]], [[Richard Elder]], [[Harry Hyde]], [[Dale Inman]], Lee Gordon and [[Paul Burchard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racing-reference.info/entrylist/1971-05/W/C| title = 1971 Miller High Life 500 crew chief information | publisher = Racing Reference | date = | accessdate = 2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 51-man entire racing grid, there were 50 [[United States|American]]s and only one [[Mexico|Mexican]] (by the name of [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]] who finished in 47th due to an electrical fault).&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; It was the 1000th race ever to be accomplished in NASCAR history. Rodríguez would retire from the NASCAR Winston Cup Series after his race here. [[Dean Dalton]] would finish in last place due to being black flagged and disqualified on lap 2. The only car in the same league with Foyt was Freddie Lorenzen until Lorenzen's engine blew and he crashed on the front straight with a fire. At the end, Petty had a chance to win, but he missed his pit under the green flag and had to come back in and finished third. Foyt won the first two Ontario races.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt;

The total winnings of the race were considered to be $180,200 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|180200|1971|r=2}}}} when adjusted for inflation) - making it the biggest non-[[Daytona 500|Daytona]] purse during that era.&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; Manufacturers involved in the event included [[Chevrolet]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]], [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]], and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; Other notable drivers included [[Elmo Langley]], [[Fred Lorenzen]], and [[Ron Hornaday, Sr.]] (whose [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.|son]] is a four-time [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] champion).&lt;ref name="1971mhl500"/&gt; [[Marty Kinerk]] would also retire after this race along with Jim McElreath, Pedro Rodríguez and Johnny Steele.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.race-database.com/results/results.php?year=1971&amp;race=5&amp;series_id=2 Drivers who retired after this race] at Race Database&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">On February 1, 2005, the [[Emergency Alert System]] was activated in portions of [[Connecticut]] calling for the immediate evacuation of the entire state. The activation was in error.  Later studies showed that residents did not evacuate, and that the most common response was to 'change the channel' or seek other confirmation.

==Background==
The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a public warning system in the [[United States]] that allows designated government authorities to suspend and preempt terrestrial radio and television broadcasts when needed to issue urgent public safety alerts. The highest priority alert that can be issued is an Emergency Action Notification (EAN), sometimes called a "presidential alert". An EAN sets into motion a series of events that causes all of the United States' television and radio stations to become networked together to simulcast the [[President of the United States]], or another federal official. An Emergency Action Notification has never been used for an actual event. However, local and state-level activations of the EAS routinely occur for emergencies such as [[tornado]]es, [[9-1-1|911]] system outages, and other, localized, exigent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Alert System (EAS) Plan for Connecticut |url=http://www.ctba.org/docs/CT_EAS_State_Plan_Final_Feb_2017.pdf|website=CTBA|publisher=Connecticut Broadcasters Association|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/september-28-2016-nationwide-eas-test|title=September 28, 2016 Nationwide EAS Test|date=2017-04-21|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
At 2:10 p.m. on Tuesday, February 1, 2005, a state-level activation of the EAS occurred in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="courant"/&gt; A scheduled, unannounced test of the system had been planned for that day. However, the system instead informed television and radio stations that an evacuation of the state was underway. Both the Connecticut Office of Emergency Management and Governor [[Jodi Rell]] issued statements shortly after the broadcast confirming the activation had been in error and there was no evacuation underway, though clarifications were not issued until more than an hour after the transmission.&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt;

Officials initially blamed [[hacker]]s for the misactivation, though an employee of the state's Office of Emergency Management later said they had accidentally registered the incorrect code prior to what should have been an EAS test, prompting the broadcast of the evacuation notification instead of the test message.&lt;ref name="courant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pazinokas|first1=Mark|title=Connecticut Evacuation: False Alarm|url=http://articles.courant.com/2005-02-02/news/0502020861_1_evacuation-order-false-alarm-emergency-alert-system|accessdate=February 15, 2017|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=February 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to media reports, the message broadcast began, "civil authorities have issued an immediate evacuation order for all of Connecticut, beginning at 2:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. and ending at 3:10&amp;nbsp;p.m".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=False alarm in Connecticut evacuation order|url=http://www.upi.com/False-alarm-in-Connecticut-evacuation-order/19241107352381/|accessdate=February 15, 2017|work=[[UPI]]|date=February 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Despite the critical nature of the message, officials from the [[Connecticut State Police]] reported they received no calls from the public inquiring as to its authenticity or the circumstances that would require the evacuation of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Evacuate! Evacuate! Oh ... nevermind|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6895811/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/evacuate-evacuate-oh-never-mind/#.WKQTUW8rKM8|accessdate=February 15, 2017|work=[[NBC News]]|date=February 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some local police reportedly received calls from members of the public, the message "failed to set off a noticeable exodus into Massachusetts, Rhode Island or New York".&lt;ref name="courant"/&gt;

A study conducted after the activation discovered that 11 percent of the state's residents had received the warning while it was being broadcast. Of those persons, 63 percent reported they were "a little or not at all concerned" when receiving it. The most common reaction reported by residents was to seek confirmation of the emergency by changing channels; other common reactions were looking outside or consulting neighbors, and only one percent of persons surveyed who heard the broadcast actually attempted to flee Connecticut.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Reaction to the Erroneous Statewide Broadcast of February 1st, 2005 |url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~icdrm/publications/CT%20Emergency%20Broadcast%20Final%20Report.pdf|website=[[George Washington University]]|publisher=Center for Survey Research and Analysis|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common reasons given by people for not following the evacuation orders were because no specific threat was described in the broadcast, because no specific area was mentioned other than "the entire state of Connecticut", and because there was no observable activity indicative of an emergency.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

[[File:ATHF LED in Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|An LED display resembling the cartoon character [[Ignignokt]] from ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' giving [[the finger]] as seen in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Identical devices throughout the community were removed by the [[Boston Police Department]] and the [[Boston Fire Department]] on January 31, 2007.|260px]]

The '''2007 Boston Mooninite panic''' occurred on Wednesday, January 31, 2007, after the [[Boston Police Department]] and the [[Boston Fire Department]] mistakenly identified battery-powered [[LED]] placards depicting [[the Mooninites]], characters from the [[Adult Swim]] animated television series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as [[improvised explosive devices]].&lt;ref name="CNNMONEY"&gt;{{cite news|author=Byron, Katy |author2=Kelley, Rob |title=Cartoon Network boss quits over bomb scare |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/ |work=CNNMoney.com |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msUTGSR1?url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite news|author=Smalley, Suzanne |author2=Mishra, Raja |title=Froth, fear, and fury |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/02/01/froth_fear_and_fury/?page=full |work=The Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIQAJx7?url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/02/01/froth_fear_and_fury/?page=full |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed throughout [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and the surrounding cities of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], these devices were part of a [[guerrilla marketing]] [[advertising campaign]] for ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]'', a film based on ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;

The incident led to controversy and criticism from a number of media sources, including ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Fox News]], ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[CNN]] and ''[[The Boston Herald]]'', some of which ridiculed the city's response to the devices as disproportionate and indicative of a [[generation gap]] between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a younger staffer at Mayor [[Thomas Menino]]'s office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures as cartoon characters from the TV show.

After the devices were removed, the Boston Police Department stated in their defense that the ad devices shared "some characteristics with improvised explosive devices," which they said included an "identifiable power source, a [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] with exposed wiring, and electrical tape." Investigators were not mollified by the discovery that the devices were not explosive in nature, stating they still intended to determine "if this event was a [[hoax]] or something else entirely." Although city [[prosecutors]] eventually concluded there was no [[mens rea|ill intent]] involved in the placing of the ads, the city continues to refer to the event as a "bomb hoax" (implying intent) rather than a "bomb scare."&lt;ref name="suspicious object removed"&gt;{{cite news |first=John R.|last=Ellement |first2=Andrew|last2=Ryan | title=Bomb squad removes suspicious object that closed I-93 north | date=&lt;!-- 11:15&amp;nbsp;AM  --&gt; January 31, 2007 |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FeooQCvkYXkJ:www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/01/bomb_squad_remo.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203164442/http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FeooQCvkYXkJ:www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/01/bomb_squad_remo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 3, 2012 | work =Posted by the Boston Globe City &amp; Region Desk | accessdate =February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not a Bomb"&gt;{{cite news | title='Suspicious' Package Not Bomb, Police Say WCVB-TV | date=&lt;!-- 10:58&amp;nbsp;am EST --&gt; January 31, 2007 | publisher=wyff4.com | url =http://google.com/search?q=cache:PLqt7oH-XqoJ:www.wyff4.com/news/10888268/detail.html | work =WCVB-TV | accessdate =February 6, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="$2million"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Turner, 2nd firm to pay $2 million over scare |date=February 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/ |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=December 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIRWJV7?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/ |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting back on the incident years later, various academics and media sources have characterized the reaction to the marketing campaign as a form of [[social panic]].&lt;ref name="jeremypacker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic" /&gt; Author Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book ''BizzWords'' that the devices were basically a self-made form of the children's toy [[Lite-Brite]].&lt;ref name="gregorybergman" /&gt;  [[Computer security]] expert [[Bruce Schneier]] wrote in his 2009 book ''Schneier on Security'' that Boston officials were "ridiculed" for their overreaction to the incident.&lt;ref name="schneieronsecurity" /&gt; In his 2009 book ''Secret Agents'', historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a phenomenon in culture called the "panic discourse" and described the incident as a "spectacular instance of this panic".&lt;ref name="jeremypacker" /&gt; In a 2012 article ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'' called the incident the "Great Mooninite Panic of 2007".&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic" /&gt; A 2013 publication by [[WGBH Educational Foundation|WGBH]] News wrote that the majority of Boston youth thought that the arrests of two men who placed devices, Peter "Zebbler" Berdovsky and Sean Stevens, were not warranted.&lt;ref name="sixyears" /&gt;

== Planning ==
In November 2006, [[Boston]] area artist [[Zebbler]] (aka Peter Berdovsky) met John{{who|date=April 2016}} (aka VJ Aiwaz) in [[New York City]]. John worked for a marketing organization named [[Interference, Inc.]], and asked Berdovsky if he would be interested in working on a promotional project.  Berdovsky agreed and enlisted the help of Sean Stevens for the project. Interference shipped Berdovsky 40 electronic signs. Adrienne Yee of Interference e-mailed him a list of suggested locations and a list of things not to do. According to police, the suggested locations for the devices included "train stations, overpasses, hip/trendy areas and high traffic/high visibility areas." The signs were to be put up discreetly overnight. They were to be paid $300 each for their assistance.

Berdovsky, Stevens, and Dana Seaver put up 20 magnetic lights in the middle of January. They dubbed the activity "Boston Mission 1." While Stevens and Berdovsky put up the lights, Seaver recorded the activity on video and sent a copy to Interference. On the night of January 29, 2007, in what was called "Boston Mission 2," 18 more magnetic lights were put in place.  This included one under [[Interstate 93]] at [[Sullivan Square (Boston)|Sullivan Square]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].&lt;ref name="BGTB"&gt;{{cite news|author=Levenson, Michael |author2=Mishra, Raja |title=Turner Broadcasting accepts blame, promises restitution |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/02/turner_broadcasting_accepts_blame_promises_restitution/?page=full |work=The Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=February 2, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIS3keF?url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/02/turner_broadcasting_accepts_blame_promises_restitution/?page=full |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BGTB2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Levenson, Michael |author2=Mishra, Raja |author3=Cramer, Maria |title=Turner Broadcasting accepts full responsibility for scare |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/02/guerrilla_ad_ag.html |work=The Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whISJNcT?url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/02/guerrilla_ad_ag.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devices ===
[[File:Mooninite5.jpg|thumb|The devices were not lit until the afternoon.]]
The devices closely resembled the Night Writer promoted by the [[Graffiti Research Lab]] in early 2006.&lt;ref name="grl"&gt;[http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=19 Night Writer]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5whITNbVM?url=http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=19 |date=February 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices were promotional electronic placards for the forthcoming ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]''.  Each device, measuring about 1 by 1.5&amp;nbsp;feet,&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt; consisted of a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) with black [[soldermask]], [[light-emitting diode]]s, and other electronic components soldered to it, including numerous [[resistor]]s, a few [[capacitor]]s, and at least one [[integrated circuit]] package.  At the bottom was a pack of four [[Publix]] brand [[List of battery sizes|D-cell batteries]], with magnets attached to the back so the devices could be easily mounted on any [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] surface. The batteries were originally covered in black tape to blend in with the black PCB.

The [[LED lights]] were arranged to represent the [[The Mooninites|Mooninite]] characters displaying [[the middle finger]].&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite news| date=January 31, 2007|title=Arrest Made In Boston's Hoax Device Incident|publisher=CBS Corporation|url=http://cbs4boston.com/topstories/local_story_031135507.html |accessdate=January 31, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101001/http://cbs4boston.com/topstories/local_story_031135507.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/10890113/detail.html |author=Jamy Pombo |title=TV Network Takes Responsibility For 'Hoax Devices' |publisher=ABC |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=January 31, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whITSQbC?url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/10890113/detail.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two variants were manufactured with the LEDs arranged in [[Pixelization|pixelated]] likenesses of Ignignokt and Err, Mooninite characters from ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''. [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]] said the device "had a very sinister appearance. It had a battery behind it, and wires."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | last = Lothian | first = Dan |author2=Fran Fifis|author3=Deborah Feyerick | title = Two plead not guilty to Boston hoax charges | publisher = CNN | date = February 1, 2007 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/ | accessdate =February 2, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050621/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/01/boston.bombscare/ |archivedate = February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others compared the displays to the [[Lite-Brite]] electric toy in appearance.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

== Subsequent scare ==
On January 31, 2007, at 8:05&amp;nbsp;a.m., a passenger spotted one of the devices on a [[stanchion]] that supports an elevated section of Interstate 93 (I-93), above [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan Station]] and told a policeman with the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) of its presence.&lt;ref name="suspicious object removed" /&gt; At 9&amp;nbsp;a.m., the [[Boston Police Department]] bomb squad received a phone call from the MBTA requesting assistance in identifying the device.&lt;ref name="BPD"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bpdnews.com/2007/02/message_from_the_police_commis_2.html | title = Message From The Police Commissioner | accessdate =February 3, 2007 | last = Davis | first = Ed | date = February 2, 2007 | work = BPDNews.com | publisher = Boston Police Department |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203120922/http://www.bpdnews.com/2007/02/message_from_the_police_commis_2.html |archivedate = February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities responded with what the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' described as "[an] army of emergency vehicles" at the scene, including police cruisers, fire trucks, ambulances, and the Boston Police Department bomb squad. Also present were live TV crews, large crowd of onlookers, and helicopters circling overhead.&lt;ref name="suspicious object removed"/&gt; Peter Berdovsky, who had placed the device, went to the scene and video recorded the situation. Berdovsky recognized the device with which the police were dealing, but made no attempt to inform the police at the scene.  Berdovsky returned to his apartment and contacted Interference, the company who had hired him to place the lights. He was told by Interference that they would handle informing the police and that he should personally say nothing about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/06/ap/national/mainD8N4BOQG0.shtml Man in Boston Scare Videotaped Police: Defendant in Boston marketing stunt scare videotaped police response, attorney says] Feb. 6, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315022602/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/06/ap/national/mainD8N4BOQG0.shtml |date=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the preliminary investigation at the site, police found that the device shared "some characteristics with [[improvised explosive devices]]." These characteristics included an identifiable power source, circuit board with exposed wiring, and electrical tape. After the initial assessment, Boston police shut down the northbound side of I-93 and parts of the public transportation system. Just after 10&amp;nbsp;a.m., the bomb squad used a small explosive filled with water to destroy the device as a precaution. MBTA Transit police Lieutenant Salvatore Venturelli told the media at the scene, "This is a perfect example of our passengers taking part in [[homeland security]]." He refused to describe the object in detail because of the ongoing investigation, responding only that "It's not consistent with equipment that would be there normally."  Investigators were trying to determine "if it was a hoax or something else entirely," according to Venturelli.&lt;ref name="suspicious object removed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Not a Bomb" /&gt; Northbound I-93 reopened to traffic at about 10:05&amp;nbsp;a.m.  By 10:21&amp;nbsp;a.m. it was determined to be "some sort of hoax device," according to a police timeline of the events.&lt;ref name="BPD" /&gt;

At 12:54&amp;nbsp;p.m., Boston police received a call identifying another device located at the intersection of Stuart and [[Charles Street (Boston)|Charles Street]].&lt;ref name="BPD" /&gt; At 1:11&amp;nbsp;p.m. the [[Massachusetts State Police]] requested assistance from the bomb squad with devices found under the [[Longfellow Bridge|Longfellow]] and [[Boston University Bridge|Boston University]] bridges.&lt;ref name="BPD" /&gt;  Both bridges were closed as a precaution, and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] closed the river to boat traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/index.html |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIUE7B8?url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/index.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Security alert shuts Boston's Charles River |date=January 31, 2007 | publisher= Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 1:26&amp;nbsp;p.m., friends of Peter Berdovsky received an e-mail from him, which alleged that five hours into the scare, an Interference Inc. executive requested Berdovsky "keep everything on the [[wiktionary:down low|dl]]."&lt;ref name="BGTB" /&gt; Travis Vautour, a friend of Berdovsky, stated: "We received an e-mail in the early afternoon from Peter that asked the community that he's a part of to keep any information we had on the down low and that was instructed to him by whoever his boss was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2841646&amp;page=1 |title=As Boston Reeled, Was Artist Asked to Keep Quiet? |last=Silverstein |first=Jonathan |publisher=ABC News |date=February 2, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIV4m7Q?url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2841646&amp;page=1 |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hours later, Interference notified their client, [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;ref name="BGTB" /&gt; Between 2 and 3&amp;nbsp;p.m., a police analyst identified the image on the devices as an ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' cartoon character, and police concluded the incident was a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt; [[Turner Broadcasting System]] issued a statement concerning the event at around 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt; Portions of the Turner statement read:

Some devices had been up for two weeks in the cities listed before the Boston incident occurred, although no permits were ever secured for the devices' installation.&lt;ref name="TBS1" /&gt; The marketing company responsible for the campaign, Interference, Inc., made no comment on the situation and their website was down (restored as of February 3, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie News&amp;nbsp;– "Hunger Force" Ad Campaign Causes Boston Bomb Scare |url=http://www.filmfodder.com/mt-weblog/archives/003544.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIVdlBb?url=http://www.filmfodder.com/mt-weblog/archives/003544.shtml |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berdovsky and Stevens, the individuals hired by Interference to install the signs, were arrested by Boston police during the evening of January 31, and charged with violating Chapter 266: Section 102A½ of the [[General Laws of Massachusetts]], which states that it is illegal to display a "hoax device" with the motive to cause citizens to feel threatened, unsafe, and concerned.&lt;ref name="arrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoax law"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Possession, transportation, use or placement of hoax devices |journal=The General Laws of Massachusetts |issue=Chapter 266: Section 102A1/2 |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-102a.5.htm |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIWovEZ?url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-102a.5.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were held at the State Police South Boston barracks overnight and were released on $2,500 bail from the Charlestown Division of [[Boston Municipal Court]] the following morning.

''The Boston Globe'' stated that the "marketing gambit exposes a wide generation gap," quoting one 29-year-old blogger as writing "Repeat after me, authorities. L-E-D.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorials derided the reaction of Boston's officials, remarking, "Emergency personnel and anti-terrorism squads shut down more than a dozen highways, transit stations and other locations across the city Wednesday after receiving reports about multiple suspicious devices. The slender, placemat-sized items had dozens of colored lights, exposed wires and circuitry, and were powered by a row of D batteries wrapped in black tape. In other words, they looked like an upscale version of [[Hasbro]]'s Lite-Brite, a toy for artistic grade schoolers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-boston03feb03,0,5379741.story?coll=la-opinion-leftrail |title=Full of beans|accessdate=August 24, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Schneier]], a computer security expert and writer on contemporary security issues, summed up the incident as a "non-terrorist embarrassment in Boston".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/02/nonterrorist_em.html Schneier on Security: Non-Terrorist Embarrassment in Boston] February 1, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHV4TyF?url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/02/nonterrorist_em.html |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Boston Herald]]'' stated that part of the reaction in the response could be blamed on two packages that did not blink. According to Boston Police Commissioner [[Edward F. Davis|Ed Davis]], phony pipe bombs were also discovered that day, one inside [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts-New England Medical Center]] at 1&amp;nbsp;p.m. A security guard described "an agitated white male" fleeing saying, "God is warning you that today is going to be a sad day."  The ''Herald'' went on to characterize the placement of the devices as a "coordinated hoax." Davis also mentioned other incidents of the day that may have influenced the reaction, including a [[Washington Metro|Washington, D.C. metro]] stop being shut down due to a suspected package, and fumes emanating from a package at a post office in New York City, resulting in four people being treated there. "It was almost like we had a kind of [[perfect storm]] of circumstances falling into place," Davis said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/1209646381.html?dids=1209646381:1209646381&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+2%2C+2007&amp;author=PETER+GELZINIS&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=4&amp;desc=PRANKS+A+LOT!+%3B+Phony+threat+escalated+real+danger+in+hoax |title=PRANKS A LOT! ; Phony threat escalated real danger in hoax (Archives) |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Boston Herald]] |first=Peter |last=Gelzinis |date=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314003903/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/1209646381.html?dids=1209646381%3A1209646381&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS%3AFT&amp;date=Feb%2B2%2C%2B2007&amp;author=PETER%2BGELZINIS&amp;pub=Boston%2BHerald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=4&amp;desc=PRANKS%2BA%2BLOT%21%2B%3B%2BPhony%2Bthreat%2Bescalated%2Breal%2Bdanger%2Bin%2Bhoax |archivedate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising magazine ''[[Brandweek]]'' said that the incident, which it labeled a fiasco, would cause marketers to "steer clear of [[Guerrilla marketing|guerrilla]] tactics until the controversy around the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' stunt-turned-bomb-scare in Boston dies down." It further said the incident "will no doubt be followed by a reassessment of the potential price of what used to be known as a low-cost method to generate buzz."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003541692|title=Guerrilla Marketing Arena Soiled By 'Aqua Teen' Fiasco|accessdate=August 24, 2011 |publisher=Brandweek | date=February 5, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070515064238/http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003541692 |archivedate=May 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fox News]], fans of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' mocked Boston officials during the press conference of Berdovsky and Stevens, calling the arrests an overreaction, while holding signs supporting the actions of the two. These signs had slogans such as "Free Peter" and "1-31-07 Never Forget," satirizing Mayor [[Thomas Menino|Tom Menino]]'s mentions of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249241,00.html Suspects Refuse to Answer Questions on Botched 'Aqua Teen' Marketing Scheme] February 2, 2007  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHVifAs?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249241,00.html |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local Boston residents were quoted by local papers. "We all thought it was pretty funny," said one student.

Karl Carter of Atlanta-based Guerrilla Tactics Media said fans of the show ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' would recognize the character and think it was funny, but other people who saw the signs wouldn't get the joke. "This is probably better set up for nightclubs and other sorts of scenarios where the people that are receiving the message, one, would know what it's about, but also two, wouldn't be frightened," he said. "You know, if you put these in certain environments, like public spaces in this post-9/11 sensitivity, then of course you're going to wind up in trouble." ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'' magazine editor Phillip Torrone said the advertisers should have used better judgment, but called the Mooninite board a "neat electronic project."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/02/02/buzz.marketing/ Boston stunt creates PR buzz saw instead of buzz]  February 5, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHb5oBc?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/02/02/buzz.marketing/ |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by ''[[Boing Boing]]'', the media and the State of Massachusetts insisted on maintaining the use of the words "bomb hoax" when describing the event, despite Turner Broadcasting Systems' firm contentions that the devices were not intended to resemble bombs and the company had no intent to arouse suspicion or panic in approving the advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2007/02/02/state_of_massachuset.html State of Massachusetts insists on calling ATHF ads "hoax devices"] February 2, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHbc4GN?url=http://boingboing.net/2007/02/02/state_of_massachuset.html |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Bax and O'Brien on the Western Massachusetts radio station [[WAQY]] weighed in, with John O'Brien saying, "and they [the devices] were also placed in Boston over two weeks ago. I don't think the terrorism officials in Boston are very observant ... Good thing September 11 didn't happen here.  We wouldn't have found it until September 20."

On February 27, 2007, just a month after the incident, the Boston police bomb squad responded and detonated another object that they believed to be a bomb, which turned out to be a city-owned [[traffic counter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbztv.com/local/local_story_059122735.html|title=Police Blow Up Suspicious Device In Boston|publisher=[[WBZ-TV]]|date=February 28, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704223643/http://wbztv.com/local/local_story_059122735.html |archivedate = July 4, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/28/boston_police_blow_u.html |title=Boston police blow up traffic counter chained to lightpost |date=February 28, 2007 |publisher=[[Boing Boing]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHjMWdJ?url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/28/boston_police_blow_u.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the months following the scare, stickers reading, "Don't Panic!

On March 18, 2007, at the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] Breakfast in [[South Boston]], jokes were made about the incident by Massachusetts politicians. Tom Menino said it was a good way to obtain a local aid package for the city (referring to the $1 million in "good faith money for homeland security" that Cartoon Network paid the city of Boston to avoid a lawsuit). Congressman [[Stephen Lynch (politician)|Stephen Lynch]] joked that the Mooninites were part of a sleeper cell that also included [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] and [[Scrappy-Doo]]. State Treasurer [[Timothy P. Cahill]] held up a picture of a Mooninite with [[Mitt Romney]]'s face on it, saying "We had to blur out his real feelings about Massachusetts."&lt;ref&gt;live CW56 broadcast of the St. Patrick's Day Breakfast, March 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
[[File:MARTA ATHF.jpg|thumb|right|''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' promotional devices were displayed in 10 different cities. This is one of them, identified at the entrance to [[Peachtree Center (MARTA station)|Peachtree Center]] [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] station in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].]]

On February 5, 2007 state and local agencies came to an agreement with both Turner Broadcasting and Interference, Inc., to pay for costs incurred in the incident. As part of the settlement, which resolves any potential civil or criminal claims against the companies, Turner and Interference agreed to pay $2 million: $1 million to go to the Boston Police Department and $1 million to the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. This was in addition to the companies' apologies, which local authorities deemed too little as announced by [[Dan Conley]], [[district attorney]] for [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts]], in a speech on [[NECN]], saying the people who are responsible for this "[[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] stunt", are [[liable]] for the havoc it caused to both the city and the region.&lt;ref name="$2million"/&gt;

On February 9, 2007, the week after this occurred, Cartoon Network's general manager and executive vice president, [[Jim Samples]], resigned "in recognition of the gravity of the situation that occurred under my watch", and with the "hope that my decision allows us to put this chapter behind us and get back to our mission of delivering unrivaled original animated entertainment for consumers of all ages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Harry R. | last=Weber | title=Cartoon Network Head Resigns After Scare | date=February 10, 2007 | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647 | work =ABC News|archivedate =April 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403040220/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647 | accessdate =August 24, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Samples's resignation, Stuart Snyder was named his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php|title=Stuart Snyder: The Perfect Combination|first=Allison|last=Romano|date=October 21, 2007|publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, ten cities were involved in the marketing campaign, which began two to three weeks before the incident in Boston. The [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] contacted Interference, Inc., to request a list of 41 locations where the devices were installed.&lt;ref name="APNY"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nathal |last=Toosi |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/493858p-415985c.html |title=Boston publicity stunt sets off activity in New York |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |date=February 1, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHrtrxS?url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/493858p-415985c.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |work=Daily News |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers were able to locate and remove only two devices, both located near 33rd Street and [[West Side Highway]] at the [[High Line]] overpass.&lt;ref name="APNY" /&gt; The NYPD did not receive any complaints about the devices, according to police spokesman Paul Brown.&lt;ref name="APNY" /&gt; At 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the evening of January 31, the [[Chicago Police Department]] received a list of installation locations from Interference, Inc.&lt;ref name="Chi"&gt;{{cite news  | first = Emma Graves | last = Fitzsimmons | title = Cops not laughing at signs | work = Chicago Tribune | publisher = Tribune Company | date = February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police recovered and disposed of 20 of the 35 devices. Police Superintendent Philip Cline admonished those responsible for the campaign, stating, "one of the devices could have easily been mistaken for a bomb and set off enough panic to alarm the entire city."&lt;ref name="Chi" /&gt; Cline went on to say that, on February 1, he asked Turner Broadcasting to reimburse the city for funds spent on locating and disposing of the devices.&lt;ref name="Chi" /&gt; Two men were briefly held in connection to the incident.

Fewer than twenty devices were found in Seattle and neither the [[Seattle Police Department]] nor the [[King County]] Sheriff's Office received [[9-1-1]] calls regarding them.&lt;ref name="SPI"&gt;{{cite news|first=Debera |last=Harrell |title=Cartoon Network publicity stunt sparks panic in Boston – but not here |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/302011_devices01.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHsAgVL?url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/302011_devices01.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; King County Sheriff's spokesman [[John Urquhart (sheriff)|John Urquhart]] stated, "To us, they're so obviously not suspicious ...

Joe Grace, spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor [[John F. Street]], was quoted as saying, "We think it was a stupid, regrettable, irresponsible stunt by Turner.

He added, "At this point, we wouldn't even begin an investigation, because there's no reason to believe a crime has occurred."&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; A device was placed in inside 11th Ave. Liquor on Hawthorne Boulevard in Portland, where it remains.

On March 1, 2007, Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], D-MA, introduced S.735, "The Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007." It would amend
{{quote|the federal criminal code to: (1) extend the prohibition against conveying false information and hoaxes to any federal crime of terrorism; (2) increase maximum prison terms for hoaxes involving a member of the Armed Forces during war; (3) allow a civil remedy for damages resulting from hoaxes perpetrated by an individual who later fails to provide accurate information to investigating authorities about the actual nature of the incident; and (4) extend the prohibition against mailing threatening communications to include corporations or governmental entities (as well as individuals).&lt;ref&gt;THOMAS, [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.735: Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007], United States Senate, S.735 2007, retrieved May 8, 2007{{cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.735 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHui7Ud?url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110%3AS.735 |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Jaqui, [https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070508-mooninites-meet-the-terrorist-hoax-improvements-act.html Mooninites, meet the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHv0izT?url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070508-mooninites-meet-the-terrorist-hoax-improvements-act.html |date=2011-02-23 }}, ars technica, May 8, 2007, retrieved May 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}} The bill never came to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-735 S. 735 [110th&amp;#93;: Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007 (GovTrack.us)]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHv84Yi?url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-735 |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2007, prosecutors decided not to pursue criminal charges against Berdovsky and Stevens, in exchange for community service and a public apology. Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]] cited the difficulty in proving intent to incite panic on the part of the two men and called the deal "an appropriate and fair resolution." Berdovsky and Stevens completed 80 and 60 hours of community service at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= Associated Press | title=Pair Charged In Marketing Stunt Reach Plea Deal | date=May 11, 2007 | publisher=CBS Broadcasting | url =http://wbztv.com/topstories/Peter.Berdovsky.Sean.2.587093.html | work =WBZTV.com | accessdate =December 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224143841/http://wbztv.com/topstories/Peter.Berdovsky.Sean.2.587093.html |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted opportunists to acquire the promotional devices from other cities and auction them on [[eBay]], with prices ranging from $500 to over $5,000 USD.&lt;ref name="ebay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/010023.html |title=Bids for Boston bomb scare promo top $5,000 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |last=Roberts |first=Paul |date=February 1, 2007 |work=InfoWorld Tech Watch |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210222848/http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/010023.html |archivedate=February 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other eBay users created merchandise commemorating the event, including T-shirts, stickers, and custom LED signs.&lt;ref name="ebay2"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mooninite moneymaker: T-shirts, LED displays hit eBay | last = Marotta | first = Michael | date = February 2, 2007 | work = [[Boston Herald]] | publisher = [[GateHouse Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' episode from [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|season five]] entitled "Boston" was produced as the series creators' response to the bomb scare, but Adult Swim pulled it to avoid further controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Dee_Doyle/2008/12/15/starpulse_com_exclusive_interview_with_d |title=Exclusive Interview With Meatwad, Er, Dave Willis, Of 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force' |date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=Starpulse.com |accessdate=December 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHvLqcL?url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Dee_Doyle/2008/12/15/starpulse_com_exclusive_interview_with_d |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode has never aired, and has never been formally released to the public legally in any format.

==Historical legacy==
Author Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book ''BizzWords'' that the devices in question were "essentially homemade Lite-Brites".&lt;ref name="gregorybergman" /&gt; Bergman concluded: "That this occurred in Boston, home to Harvard, MIT, and other famous schools of learning, is embarrassing."&lt;ref name="gregorybergman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory|last=Bergman|year=2008|title=BizzWords|page=163|isbn= 1598694723|publisher=Adams Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer security]] expert [[Bruce Schneier]] wrote in his 2009 book ''Schneier on Security'' that Boston officials were "ridiculed" for their overreaction to the incident.&lt;ref name="schneieronsecurity"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|title=Schneier on Security|publisher=Wiley Publishing|isbn=978-0470505625|year=2009|chapter=CYA Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneier wrote, "Almost no one looked beyond the finger pointing and jeering to discuss exactly why the Boston authorities overreacted so badly. They overreacted because the signs were weird."&lt;ref name="schneieronsecurity" /&gt; Schneier characterized this as a form of "Cover Your Ass" security.&lt;ref name="schneieronsecurity" /&gt;

In his 2009 book ''Secret Agents'', historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a phenomenon in culture called the "panic discourse" and described the incident as a "spectacular instance of this panic".&lt;ref name="jeremypacker" /&gt; Packer stated the discovery of the lightboards prompted "a city government and media panic".&lt;ref name="jeremypacker"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeremy|last=Packer|pages=144–145, 158|title=Secret Agents|year=2009|isbn=978-0820486697|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'' published an article in 2012 looking back on the incident and interviewed Zebbler for his thoughts on its place in history.&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|title=Remembering the Great Mooninite Panic of 2007|accessdate=September 20, 2015|date=January 31, 2012|url=http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/phlog/archive/2012/01/31/five-years-after-the-mooninites-invaded-boston-zebbler-looks-back.aspx|archivedate=March 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317211451/http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/phlog/archive/2012/01/31/five-years-after-the-mooninites-invaded-boston-zebbler-looks-back.aspx|first=Barry|last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boston Phoenix'' called the incident the "Great Mooninite Panic of 2007".&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic" /&gt; The publication concluded that the city of Boston was impacted due to the fact that it was "oblivious" to the Mooninite character from [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic" /&gt; Zebbler thought that history would not be likely to repeat itself with a similar event, and surmised that marketing agencies would instead be more apt to first contact law enforcement to get permission for such an event.&lt;ref name="mooninitepanic" /&gt;

Six years after the incident, ''[[WGBH (FM)|WGBH News]]'' published an article reflecting on law enforcement reaction to the marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="sixyears"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wgbhnews.org/post/mooninite-invasion-boston-6-years-later|accessdate=September 20, 2015|date=January 31, 2013|title=The Mooninite Invasion of Boston, 6 Years Later|work=WGBH News|agency=[[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]]|first=Kinne|last=Chapin|archivedate=July 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731012118/http://wgbhnews.org/post/mooninite-invasion-boston-6-years-later}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGBH summarized that the overall assessment of the government's response to the incident was critical, observing: "What was the fallout from the scare? Both local and national media outlets derided Boston Law enforcement for failing to recognize a PR stunt gone wrong. Many young Bostonians felt the arrest of Zebbler and Stevens was an overreaction."&lt;ref name="sixyears" /&gt; The article quoted a student who pointed out the vast proportion of individuals were successfully able to determine the difference between a Lite-Brite children's toy and a bomb.&lt;ref name="sixyears" /&gt;

WGBH requested a comment in 2013 from Zebbler to reflect back on the incident, and he stated he thought the overreaction by the government was a greater symptom of the American culture during that time period.&lt;ref name="sixyears" /&gt; Zebbler said he would take part in a subsequent [[guerilla marketing]] event if there was a benevolent motivation behind it.&lt;ref name="sixyears" /&gt;

The city of Boston hired Zebbler for its 2014 New Year's celebrations to create a light show—and paid him [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000 for his services.&lt;ref name="morganrousseau"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.us/local/zebbler-mooninite-scare-artist-selected-to-stage-50-000-first-night-centerpiece-metro-us/tmWmkt---8fBbhJad1ps/|accessdate=September 20, 2015|date=November 20, 2013|work=Metro.us|title=Zebbler: Mooninite scare artist selected to stage $50,000 First Night centerpiece|first=Morgan|last=Rousseau|archivedate=September 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920010858/http://www.metro.us/local/zebbler-mooninite-scare-artist-selected-to-stage-50-000-first-night-centerpiece-metro-us/tmWmkt---8fBbhJad1ps/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zebbler said he felt it was an honor to be selected and help bring unity to the city.&lt;ref name="morganrousseau" /&gt; Zebbler's light show production was the centerpiece of the 2014 Boston First Night event held in [[Copley Square]].&lt;ref name="tenleywoodman"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tenley|last=Woodman|work=[[Boston Herald]]|title=Artist from 2007 bomb scare headlining First Night|accessdate=September 20, 2015|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/11/artist_from_2007_bomb_scare_headlining_first_night|date=November 20, 2013|archivedate=November 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122164406/http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/11/artist_from_2007_bomb_scare_headlining_first_night}}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' about the choice of Zebbler for the 2014 First Night, Boston Mayor [[Thomas M.

Those two young men had been hired by a company to do some guerrilla advertising. At the time, particularly in its proximity to 9/11, I think the City and Boston Police were very concerned. I think we responded appropriately at the time, but I think we also saw the company immediately make compensation to the City of Boston and to the Boston Police for the efforts involved."&lt;ref name="meninodefends" /&gt;

The group submitted more than $163 million in claims and received $35 million of that before they were caught.

Due to declining interest and viewership in recent ceremonies, the Academy hired a new production team in an attempt to improve ratings and revive interest in the ceremony. Reports surfaced that Academy then-president [[Tom Sherak]] approached television producer [[Lorne Michaels]] for producing duties with actor and comedian [[Jimmy Fallon]] as host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sperling |first=Nicole |title=Jimmy Fallon in talks to host 2013 Oscars, but ABC said to object |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/02/entertainment/la-et-mn-jimmy-fallon-in-talks-to-host-2013-oscars-lorne-michaels-to-produce-20120802 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 2, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227211817/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/02/entertainment/la-et-mn-jimmy-fallon-in-talks-to-host-2013-oscars-lorne-michaels-to-produce-20120802 |archivedate=February 27, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the telecast's broadcaster [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] objected to these selections, and both men declined afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newcomb |first=Tim |title=Jimmy Fallon as Oscar Host?

Two months later, the Academy announced that actor, director, animator, singer, and comedian [[Seth MacFarlane]] would host the telecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shoard |first=Catherine |title=Seth MacFarlane to host Oscars |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/01/seth-macfarlane-host-oscars-2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |date=October 1, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022083359/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/01/seth-macfarlane-host-oscars-2013 |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane expressed that it was truly an honor and a thrill to be asked to host Academy Awards commenting, "It's truly an overwhelming privilege to be asked to host the Oscars.

Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) (Captain Kirk set in the next day) about how he was going to ruin the telecast, Captain Kirk then shows him a video where MacFarlane sings a song about actresses in the movies in which they were disrobed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/24/entertainment/la-et-ms-oscars-2013-celebration-music-starts-we-saw-your-boobs-201302243|title=Oscars 2013: Celebration of music starts with 'We Saw Your Boobs'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 28, 2016|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the segment, California assemblywoman [[Bonnie Lowenthal]] and state senator [[Hannah-Beth Jackson]] expressed their disappointment at MacFarlane, ABC, and AMPAS in a press release reading, "[T]here was a disturbing theme about violence against women being acceptable and funny. From topical jabs about domestic violence to singing about 'boobs' during a film's rape scene, Seth MacFarlane crossed the line from humor to misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seth MacFarlane's Oscars performance condemned by two California state lawmakers |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-macfarlanes-oscars-performance-condemned-by-two-california-state-lawmakers/ |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amy Davidson (author)|Amy Davidson]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' interpreted the song as hostile to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/seth-macfarlane-and-the-oscars-hostile-ugly-sexist-night |title=Seth MacFarlane and the Oscars' Hostile, Ugly, Sexist Night |work=[[The New Yorker]] |author=Davidson, Amy |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803130001/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/seth-macfarlane-and-the-oscars-hostile-ugly-sexist-night |archivedate=August 3, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses [[Lena Dunham]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Geena Davis]], and [[Jane Fonda]] also commented on the jokes, with Fonda stating: "What I really didn’t like was the song and dance number about seeing actresses' boobs. I agree with someone who said, if they want to stoop to that, why not list all the penises we’ve seen? Better yet, remember that this is a telecast seen around the world watched by families with their children and to many this is neither appropriate or funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/jane-fonda-seth-macfarlane-boobs_n_2783839.html|title=Jane Fonda On Seth MacFarlane's 'We Saw Your Boobs': 'Why Not List All The Penises We've Seen?'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release statement, the Academy defended MacFarlane for expressing his artistic freedom, "If the Oscars are about anything, they’re about creative freedom. We think the show's producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and host Seth MacFarlane did a great job and we hope our worldwide audience found the show entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Academy Defends Seth MacFarlane Despite Charges of Sexism |url=https://www.thewrap.com/academy-defends-seth-macfarlane-despite-charges-sexism-79641/ |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |work=TheWrap |date=February 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723211403/https://www.thewrap.com/academy-defends-seth-macfarlane-despite-charges-sexism-79641/ |archivedate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical reviews ===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Columnist [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented "By calling constant attention to the naughty factor", MacFarlane created "an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=This year's Academy Awards: a lively, occasionally uneasy mixture of snark and sincerity |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/25/this-years-oscars-snark-meets-sincerity/ |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190014/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/25/this-years-oscars-snark-meets-sincerity/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' television critic [[Hank Stuever]] bemoaned, "There was nothing notably terrible about the show, and nothing particularly enthralling." Regarding MacFarlane's performance as host, Stuever noted, "What you got was a combination of sicko and retro, an Oscar show hosted by someone who waited until Oscar night to discover that he's only so-so at stand-up comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stuever |first=Hank |title=TV review: At the Oscars, the same old song and dance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-review-at-the-oscars-the-same-old-song-and-dance/2013/02/24/27de5b76-7ed9-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302015647/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-review-at-the-oscars-the-same-old-song-and-dance/2013/02/24/27de5b76-7ed9-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television editor [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] lamented that the ceremony made for a "frequently messy, but occasionally surprising and/or entertaining evening." He added that MacFarlane "had some funny moments here and there, but he missed way more than he hit, and Frat Boy Seth quickly assumed dominance as the evening went along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=Review: Seth MacFarlane emcees a conflicted, bloated, song-heavy Oscar-cast |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-seth-macfarlane-emcees-a-conflicted-bloated-song-heavy-oscar-cast |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=[[HitFix]] |date=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515121648/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-seth-macfarlane-emcees-a-conflicted-bloated-song-heavy-oscar-cast |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other media outlets received the broadcast and more positively. Tim Goodman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did "impressively better than one would have wagered." He also noted that he added "plenty of niceties with a little bit of the [[Ricky Gervais]] bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Tim |title=TV Review: Seth MacFarlane Wins at Oscar Hosting Against Odds |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/tv-review-seth-macfarlane-wins-424058 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306005134/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/tv-review-seth-macfarlane-wins-424058 |archivedate=March 6, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' television critic Nina Metz lauded MacFarlane for keeping "a solid handle on the proceedings." She also remarked that the host "opened with a series of jokes that were bona fide winners, landing on just the right tone: confident but not cocksure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz |first=Nina |title=MacFarlane relaxed, confident as Oscars host |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-25/entertainment/chi-oscars-live-20130224_1_oscars-host-tommy-lee-jones-laugh-85th-academy-awards |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227000209/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-25/entertainment/chi-oscars-live-20130224_1_oscars-host-tommy-lee-jones-laugh-85th-academy-awards |archivedate=February 27, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] critic [[Frazier Moore]] extolled MacFarlane observing that he "seized the camera Sunday as host of ABC's Oscarcast and proved to its vast audience that he's a ridiculously versatile entertainer, a guy who can be as charming as he is famously irreverent, even polarizing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore |first=Frazier |title=Oscars Review: MacFarlane Proves He's An Oscar Guy In Hosting Gig |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/25/oscars-review_n_2756931.html |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=The Huffington Post |date=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523175954/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/25/oscars-review_n_2756931.html |archivedate=May 23, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Battles involving Assyria}}

The '''Battle of Nineveh''' is conventionally dated between 613 and 611 BC, with 612 BC being the most supported date. An allied army composed of [[Medes]] and the Babylonian, rebelling against the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], together with [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], besieged it and sacked 750 [[hectares]] of what was at that time, the greatest city in the world. This led to the destruction of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] over the next three years&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p 376&lt;/ref&gt; as the dominant state in the [[Ancient Near East]].  After this battle, the archeological record shows that the capital of the once mighty Assyrian Empire was extensively de-urbanized and depopulated.

Babylon became the imperial center of [[Mesopotamia]] for the first time in over a thousand years, leading to the [[Neo-Babylonian]] Empire, claiming imperial continuity as a new dynasty.

== Background ==

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] arose in the 10th century BC and reached its peak in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, succeeding the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1366-1074 BC) as the largest empire the world had yet seen. 
By the reign of [[Ashurbanipal]], it controlled or held in vassalage most of the nations and city-states from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]] and [[Nubia]] in the south, and central [[Iran]]/[[Persia]] in the east to [[Cyprus]] and the [[Hellene|Hellenic]] and [[Phoenicia]]n  [[Mediterranean]] coasts of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]] in the west.

However, after the death of [[Ashurbanipal]] in 627 BC, the once mighty empire of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] was becoming increasingly volatile, with [[Assyria]] proper erupting into a series of internal civil wars. This led many of the subject states, many of which had their own political dynasties, to become restive, whereas neighbouring states and groups, such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] became increasingly hostile under the Assyrian hegemony.

The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] had, by the accounts of their own records, been brutal even by the standards of the time, and thus had accumulated many hitherto impotent enemies. It had been weakened by a three front struggle to maintain power in [[Egypt]], a costly but victorious war against the [[Elamites]], and put down rebellions amongst their southern Mesopotamian [[Babylonia]]n kinsmen, even though the core of the empire had been largely at peace. The [[Assyria]]n monarchs wrote constantly of internal danger, fear of palace intrigue, and feared a rebellion.

Upon the death of [[Ashurbanipal]], a series of bitter and bloody wars of succession occurred, weakening the empire – from 625 BC onwards, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]'s domination over the [[Middle East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]] and [[East Mediterranean]] gradually began to fade.

An alliance grew up of external states, such as the Chaldeans, who took advantage of the upheavals in [[Assyria]] to take control of much of [[Babylonia]] with the aid of the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonians]] themselves. They were building Babylonia into a power that is termed [[Neo-Babylonian]]. The goal was the overthrow of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The taking of the capital, [[Nineveh]] and the transferral of the seat of Mesopotamian power to [[Babylon]]. [[Nineveh]] was not only a political capital, but home to one of the great libraries of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] tablets and a recipient of tribute from across the near east. (See [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]).

== Sources of the Fall and Battle ==

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] chronicles break off in 639 BC after the destruction of [[Susa]], the capital of [[Elam]], and the subjugation of a rebellious Babylon ruled by [[Ashurbanipal]]'s own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]. Business records are missing after 631 BC. The primary sources are written afterwards by a victorious Neo-Babylonian from the reign of [[Nabopolassar]]. The primary chronicle is numbered 21901, was translated by  [[C. J. Gadd]] in 1923, and can be found in the [[British Museum]]. By the Babylonian tradition set down by [[Herodotus]] much later, a Hebrew tradition attributed to [[Nahum]], and by reference in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] chronicles, all were hostile to Assyria. There are also legends that have grown up the centuries afterwards, among peoples  who descend from one of the involved nationalities, including the still [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]] speaking and [[Christian]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]].

The [[Medes]] were ruled by [[Cyaxares]]. Although initially defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], he rebuilt his army and attacked Nineveh in conjunction with other peoples.

The best recounting of the actual battle is taken from the excerpts of Persica written by [[Ctesias]], preserved in [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Photius]], whose account may have been embroidered with accounts of other battles.

== Account of the Battle ==

According to the [[Babylonian Chronicles]], there was a bitter 12-year struggle between [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]], as well as civil wars in [[Assyria]] itself. They describe that in the tenth year of [[Nabopolassar]] (616 BC) the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] army and marched up the river sacking [[Mane, Mesopotamia|Mane]], [[Sahiri]] and [[Bali-hu]].

The conflict renewed the next year, with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] mustering their army and throwing the Babylonians back to [[Takritain]]. [[Nabopolassar]] stationed his army in the fortress of Takritain, and the two armies did battle there the next year. The Assyrians were beaten and retreated to [[Assyria]].

The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] then allied with the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]]. The [[Medes|Median]] army took [[Tarbisu]], near Nineveh and encamped nearby, and then attacked the city of [[Assur]], with the Babylonian text recounting how in 614 BC their Median ally destroyed Assur's temples and sacked the city, but their army did not reach the city until after the plundering had been done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GXv9WjYvo5&amp;sig=TrdBe6iJy6DgKZ-D3XfEfi2oues&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifm5eU1dbaAhUQYVAKHSobBbcQ6AEIdDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&amp;f=true/ The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah Under Babylonian Rule] : page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 612 BC, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Bablyonians]] mustered the army again and joined with Cyaxares encamping against Nineveh. They laid siege to the city for three months and in August, finally broke the defenses, and plundered the city, burning it behind. The major part in the city’s downfall was played by the Medes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/media/ Encyclopedia Iranica] "Finally, after three months of siege, in August of 612, the joined forces of the Medes and Babylonians stormed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, and took it. The major part in the city’s downfall was played by the Medes."&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian King [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] was killed in the siege. His brother [[Ashur-uballit II]] was made King of Assyria. He refused to submit, however, and successfully fought his way out of Nineveh, founding a final capital at [[Harran]].

According to the tradition laid out in Diodorus, the Tigris river was flooded, entering into the city. While his account is often suspect, this aspect has been given attention. The allied armies entered the area of the outer wall and there fought to enter the palace. Temples were sacked and finally the palace was burned, though this did not destroy the city, and may have aided the preservation of clay texts. According to the account in Nahum, one of the Old Testament prophets, if read as history rather than prophecy (conservative Bible scholars regard Nahum as prophecy), the battle went on for months, and fighting was in each house and street.

There would be several more campaigns against Assyria by the Neo-Bablyonians and their allies, including one against an allied Egyptian-Assyrian army. Thus while the Battle of Nineveh was a turning point in the war, Ashur-uballit II would fight on for several more years. His ultimate fate is not known or recorded - he may have been killed at the [[fall of Harran]] in 609 BC (which ended the Assyrian Empire) or at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]] in 605 BC (where Egypt along with remnants of the army of the former Assyrian Empire were defeated); or simply disappeared into obscurity.

'''Bombings of Switzerland in World War II''' consisted of initially sporadic bombing events that became more frequent during the later stage of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="helmreich"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj00/sum00/helmreich.html | title=Diplomacy of Apology | author=Helmreich JE |accessdate=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Switzerland]] was a [[neutral country]] during [[World War II]], but adjacent to and at times almost completely surrounded by [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]], or Axis occupied, countries. On several occasions, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[bombing raid]]s hit targets in Switzerland resulting in fatalities and property damage. Such events led to diplomatic exchanges. While Allied forces explained the causes of violations as [[navigation]] errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and pilots' errors, in Switzerland fear was expressed that some neutrality violations were intended to exert pressure on the country to end its economic cooperation with Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="helmreich"/&gt; In addition to bombing raids, air attacks by individual [[fighter plane]]s strafed Swiss targets toward the end of the war. The Swiss military, in turn, attacked Allied aircraft overflying Switzerland with fighters and anti-aircraft cannons.

==Allied use of Swiss air space==
During World War II, Swiss airspace was violated by both sides. During the [[Battle of France]], the [[Swiss Air Force]] shot down eleven German planes violating Swiss airspace for the loss of three planes in return. This resulted in a German threat of sanctions and retaliation, and the Swiss government decided to order an end to interceptions of foreign aircraft in Swiss airspace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of-war/switzerland-in-world-war-ii-the-hypocrisy-and-bloodshed-behind-armed-neutrality/&lt;/ref&gt;

With Allied and Axis aircraft freely overflying Switzerland, over 7,000 siren alarms were initiated in Switzerland during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschichte-schweiz.ch/zweiter-weltkrieg-1939-1945.html Swiss History, World War II (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Allied bombers took advantage of this situation by using Swiss airspace as a safer route than enemy air space on their bombing runs to and from targets in Germany, but more often, [[bomber]]s in distress preferred to descend to neutral Switzerland for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] rather than in German territory. As a result, Switzerland ultimately interned 1,700 American airmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tanner, Stephen | title=Refuge from the Reich: American Airmen and Switzerland During World War II 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1941 to 1942, Allied bombers very rarely flew over Switzerland, because the Swiss authorities, under German pressure, prescribed black-outs in order to complicate navigation for the U.S. and British air crews. As the neutral Swiss territory was safe for Allied bombers, Germany also pressured the Swiss into forcing the Allied air crews to land in Switzerland, instead of letting them continue bombing runs.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Kurz: "Die Schweiz im Zweiten Weltkrieg" (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the Swiss military began attacking Allied aircraft breaching Swiss airspace. Six Allied aircraft were shot down by Swiss Air Force fighters and four by anti-aircraft cannons, killing 36 Allied airmen. The first Allied aircraft to be shot down over were two British bombers flying low over Swiss territory on the night of July 12–13, 1943, which were shot down by Swiss anti-aircraft fire over [[Valais]]. The first American bomber shot down over Switzerland was downed near [[Bad Ragaz]] on October 1, 1943, and only three of its crew survived.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srf.ch/kultur/im-fokus/der-archivar/abgeschossen-von-der-neutralen-schweiz&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 1944, American [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] escorting a damaged [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber crossed into Swiss airspace and were confronted by Swiss [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s. Not realizing they were over Switzerland, the P-51s attacked the Swiss Messerschmitts, shooting down one and killing its pilot, and damaging another one.&lt;ref&gt;Forsgren, Jan: ''Messerschmitt Bf 109: The Design and Operational History''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombings==
American and British planes bombed Switzerland about seventy times during World War II, killing 84 people. Although these bombings were attributed to error, some historians have suspected that the Allies wanted to send a warning to Switzerland for having cooperated with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/warbirdsadd-the-underlinemayday--when-bombers-crashed-in-switzerland/37577434&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schaffhausen===
The daylight bombing of [[Schaffhausen]] on 1 April 1944 by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) was the most serious of all incidents. Approximately 50 [[B-24 Liberator]]s of a larger force misidentified Schaffhausen as their target [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] near Mannheim (about 235&amp;nbsp;km north of Schaffhausen), and dropped sixty tons of bombs on the town. Although an air raid alarm sounded in Schaffhausen, air raid sirens had been set off so many times without any attack that the locals felt safe, and many failed to take cover. A total of 40 people were killed and about 270 injured, and large parts of the town were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/during-world-war-ii-america-accidently-bombed-switzerland-20077&lt;/ref&gt; At the insistence of the Swiss government for an explanation, Allied investigations into the incident found that bad weather broke up the American formation over France, and that high winds that nearly doubled the [[ground speed]] of the bombers confused the navigators. (Two other widely scattered cities in Germany and France were also mistakenly bombed during the same mission.) As Schaffhausen is situated on the right bank (north side) of the [[Rhine]] river, it was apparently assumed to be the German city. By October 1944, US$4,000,000 had been paid in restitution.

===Stein am Rhein===
On 22 February 1945, thirteen USAAF air attacks on Switzerland took place with [[Stein am Rhein]] receiving the most damage. Other places included [[Taegerwilen]], [[Rafz]], and [[Vals, Switzerland|Vals]]. Overall, 21 people were killed in these attacks.

===Zurich and Basel===
On 4 March 1945, six USAAF B-24H bombers hit [[Zurich]] with 12.5 [[Short ton|tons]] of high explosives and 12 tons of incendiaries, killing five people. The intended target had been [[Aschaffenburg]] near [[Frankfurt am Main]] (290&amp;nbsp;km north). The six bombers had gone off course, and their crews believed they were bombing [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. At virtually the same time, other bombers dropped 12.5 tons of high explosives and five tons of incendiaries on [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="helmreich"/&gt;

===Other attacks===
During 1940, minor attacks on [[Geneva]], [[Renens]], [[Basel]], and Zurich were conducted by the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="helmreich"/&gt;

On 1 October 1943, bombs were released by the USAAF over [[Samedan]] leading to property damage. 1944 saw attacks that included [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz]], [[Cornol]], [[Niederweningen]], and [[Thayngen]]. Attacks in 1945 included [[Chiasso]] twice. Basel was bombed on 4 March 1945. The last air attack occurred in [[Brusio]] on 16 April 1945.

==Court-martial proceedings==
Regarding the Zurich bombing, a court-martial proceeding took place in England on 1 June 1945. Col. [[James Stewart|James M. Stewart]], the famous actor and wartime B-24 pilot, was the presiding officer of the trial.&lt;ref name="Zurich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj00/sum00/helmreich1.htm |author=Helmreich JE |title=The Bombing of Zurich |publisher=Aerospace Power Journal |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accused were the lead pilot Lieutenant William R. Sincock and one of his navigators, Lieutenant Theodore Q. Balides, for violating the 96th [[Articles of War#United States of America|Article of War]], Sincock specifically for having "wrongfully and negligently caused bombs to be dropped in friendly territory". Weather conditions and equipment failure were found to be at fault; the defendants were found not guilty of criminal culpability.&lt;ref name="Zurich"/&gt;

==Reparations==
In addition to the US$4&amp;nbsp;million paid by October 1944, the United States government agreed to pay 62,176,433.06 [[Swiss franc]]s (then equivalent to ${{Formatprice|14392692.82}}, or ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|14392692.82|1944}}}}{{Inflation-fn|US}} at current prices) to the Swiss government as full and final payment for damage to persons and property during World War II on 21 October 1949.&lt;ref name="helmreich"/&gt;

'''Cali Underground''' is an annual rock music festival celebrated in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]. Bands as [[Angelcorpus]], [[Ultimos Romanticos]], Astreas Domains, Desdenia, Deadline and Orus have played at this festival.

== History ==

The first running of this festival was in 2004 with the presence of only a few hundred visitors before a few relatively unknown bands, but at the following year the number of visitors increased to several thousands. After obtaining the support of the [http://www.cali.gov.co/index.php?servicio=Noticias&amp;funcion=ver&amp;id=6674 Secretaria de Cultura y Turismo de Santiago de Cali] and private enterprises like [[Parquesoft]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parquesoft.org/informacion/producto.php?seleccion=104 Parquesoft]&lt;/ref&gt; and Deeplunar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deeplunar.org Deeplunar]&lt;/ref&gt; the festival drew more visitors.

The '''Celtic Media Festival''', formerly known as the '''Celtic Film and Television Festival''', aims to promote the languages and cultures of the [[Celtic nations]] in film, on television, radio and new media. The festival is an annual three-day celebration of broadcasting and film from [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]]. The festival has existed for nearly forty years.
==History==
The festival was first held in 1980, on the Scottish islands of [[South Uist]] and [[Benbecula]]. The 30th festival was held in March 2009 in [[Caernarfon]], Wales. The festival presents the Torc Awards to the winners of 22 different categories.

The festival also presents a Gold Torc to the winner of Spirit of the Festival Award - a film or television programme wholly or substantially in a Celtic language that encapsulates the spirit of the Celtic Media Festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9208">A '''collaborative working environment''' ('''CWE''') supports people, such as [[e-professional]]s, in their individual and cooperative work. Research in CWE involves focusing on organizational, technical, and social issues.

==Background==
Working practices in a collaborative working environment evolved from the traditional or geographical co-location paradigm. In a CWE, professionals work together regardless of their geographical location. In this context, [[e-professional]]s use a collaborative working environment to provide and share information&lt;ref&gt;Collaboration@Work Experts Group, May 1994, [http://www.ami-communities.eu/bscw/wiki.cgi/d26842/Report_on_Visions_04.05.04_IR.pdf Towards a middleware for collaborative work environments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720153146/http://www.ami-communities.eu/bscw/wiki.cgi/d26842/Report_on_Visions_04.05.04_IR.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and exchange views in order to reach a common understanding. Such practices enable an effective and efficient collaboration among different proficiencies.

==Description==
The following applications or services are considered elements of a CWE:
* [[E-mail]]
* [[Instant messaging]]
* [[Application sharing]]
* [[Video conferencing]]
* [[Collaborative workspace]], [[document management]] and [[version control system]]
* Task and [[workflow]] management
* [[Wiki]] group or community effort to edit wiki pages. (e.g. wiki pages describing concepts to enable a common understanding within a group or community)
* [[Blogging]] where entries are categorized by groups or communities or other concepts supporting collaboration

==Overview==
The concept of CWE is derived from the idea of virtual work-spaces,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schaffers, Torsten Brodt, Marc Pallot, Wolfgang Prinz (editors), March 2006, [http://www.ami-communities.eu/pub/wiki.cgi/d163187/The%20Future%20Workspace.pdf The Future Workspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708085630/http://www.ami-communities.eu/pub/wiki.cgi/d163187/The%20Future%20Workspace.pdf |date=2006-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, W.; Loh, H.; Pallot, M.; Schaffers, H.; Skarmeta, A.; Decker, S. [http://www.cwe-projects.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/d300733/ECOSPACE-OverviewPaper.pdf ECOSPACE: Towards an Integrated Collaboration Space for e-Professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720155128/http://www.cwe-projects.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/d300733/ECOSPACE-OverviewPaper.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to the concept of [[e-work]]. It extends the traditional concept of the [[professional]] to include any type of [[knowledge worker]] who intensively uses [[information technology|information and communications technology]] (ICT) environments and tools&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Martinez Carreras, A.F. Gomez Skarmeta,2006, [http://www.cwe-projects.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/d300879/Towards%20Interoperability%20in%20Collaborative%20Environments.pdf Towards Interoperability in Collaborative Environments]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their working practices. Typically, a group of e-professionals conduct their collaborative work through the use of collaborative working environments (CWE).&lt;ref&gt;Collaboration@Work Experts Group, February 2006, [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/atwork/hot_news/publications/documents/new_collab_environments_2020.pdf New Collaborative Working Environments 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWE refers to online [[collaboration]] (such as [[virtual team]]s,&lt;ref&gt;J. Lipnack and J. Stamps, 1997, "Virtual Teams: Reaching Across Space, Time, and Organizations with Technology", Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-16553-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mass collaboration]],&lt;ref&gt;Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, December 2006, [[Wikinomics| Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[massively distributed collaboration]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/about/events/dls11092005 Kapor presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719133040/http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/about/events/dls11092005 |date=2006-07-19 }}, UC Berkeley, 2005-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; online [[community of practice|communities of practice]] (such as the [[open source]] community); and [[open innovation]] principles.

==Collaborative work systems== &lt;!-- Anchor from redirect: [Collaborative working system]. --&gt;
A collaborative working system (CWS) is an organizational unit that emerges any time when collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional.&lt;ref name=Beyerlein2002&gt;Beyerlein, M; Freedman, S.; McGee, G.; Moran, L. (2002). ''Beyond Teams: Building the Collaborative Organization''. The Collaborative Work Systems series. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative work systems are those in which conscious efforts have been made to create strategies, policies, and structures in order to institutionalize values, behaviors, and practices that promote cooperation among different parties in an organization so as to achieve organizational goals. A high level of collaborative capacity will enable more effective work both at the local and daily levels, and at the global and long-term levels.

Beyerlein, et al. (2002)&lt;ref name=Beyerlein2002/&gt; define collaboration as the collective work of two or more individuals where the work is undertaken with a sense of shared purpose and direction, that is attentive and responsive to the environment. In most organizations collaboration occurs naturally, but ill-defined work practices may create barriers to natural collaboration. The result is a loss of both decision-making quality and valuable time. Well-designed collaborative working systems not only overcome these natural barriers to communication, they also establish a cooperative work culture that becomes an integral part of the organization's structure.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson, G; Martin, K.; Powers, E. (June 2008). "The secrets to successful strategy execution". ''Harvard Business Review'' '''86''' (6): 60–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from CWS==
A collaborative work system is related to the collaborative working environment. The latter notion is more focused on technology and was issued from the concept of [[collaborative workspace]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schaffers, Torsten Brodt, Marc Pallot, Wolfgang Prinz (ed.) (March 2006). [http://www.ami-communities.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/d163187/The%20Future%20Workspace.pdf ''The Future Workspace: Perspectives on Mobile and Collaborative Working''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225053054/http://www.ami-communities.eu/pub/bscw.cgi/d163187/The%20Future%20Workspace.pdf |date=2012-02-25 }}; AMI Communities at The Netherlands: Telematica Instituut.; retrieved ?&lt;/ref&gt; driven from research within the MOSAIC Project.

The concept of 'system' in 'collaborative work system' has a self-explanatory power that is different from '[[Environment (systems)|environment]]'. The former pertains to an integrated whole, including collaborative work conceived as a purposeful activity, whilst the later stresses the surroundings of an object – the collaborative working practices – that include a diversified number of tools and software applications mostly for remote collaboration, including video-conferencing, documents and workflow management among other technologies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A collaborative work system generally includes a collaborative working environment, but it should be conceived primarily as a set of human activities, intentional or not, that emerge every time a collaboration occurs. This enables focus on the work practices that are necessary for human collaboration and draws attention to important behavioral variables such as [[leadership]] and [[motivation]] that are not considered within the CWE definition.

=== CWS and collaborative software (or groupware) ===
Besides participatory leadership, another key element of a successful collaborative work system is the availability of group collaboration technology or [[groupware]] – hardware and software tools that help groups to access and share  the information the professionals need to meet, train or teach.

However, a collaborative work system (CWS) does not necessarily require groupware support. A simple way to conceptualize the relation between the two concepts is to consider [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) as a whole consisting of a collaborative work system (CWS) supported by [[collaborative software]] or groupware.

On the other hand, a collaborative working environment which supports people in both their ''individual'' and ''cooperative'' work, whatever their geographical location transcends the notion of CSCW which deals specifically with cooperative work.

'''Cybersonica''' is an annual multimedia festival for electronic music, sound, art and technology in [[London]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/eventseducation/lateattatebritain/lateattatebritain2007april.htm Late at Tate Britain: April] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705135517/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/eventseducation/lateattatebritain/lateattatebritain2007april.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}, Tate Britain, April 2007. Retrieved Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was established around 2002, supported by the [[Arts Council England]] and other sponsors.

It invites sonic and digital artists to submit new pieces for commissioning, with four new pieces to be selected in 2007. In 2007 Cybersonica kicked off the festival at [[Tate Britain]]'s Late at Tate evening on 6 April, bringing numerous live performances, sonic artworks, audiovisual artists, DJs and short films to the venue. Among its participants are Brian Duffy's [[Modified Toy Orchestra]], The Sancho Plan, [[Martyn Ware]], the founding member of [[Heaven 17]] and [[The Human League]], with his 3D sound system from The Illustrious Company, which he runs with [[Vince Clarke]], body&gt;data&gt;space, Future Shorts and others. In Spring 2007 Cybersonica hosts Soundwaves, a six-week exhibition at Kinetica Museum in [[Old Spitalfields Market]]. Throughout the years, the Cybersonica festival has attracted headline artists and witnessed the debut of [[Guitar Hero II]] during its 2006 gathering.

The '''Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush''',  also known as '''''Aardakh''''' ({{lang-ce|Aardax}}), '''Operation Lentil''' ({{lang-ru|Чечевица}}, ''Chechevitsa''; {{lang-ce|'''Вайнах махкахбахар'''}} ''Vaynax Maxkaxbaxar'') was the Soviet [[forced transfer]] of the whole of the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] ([[Chechen people|Chechen]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]) populations of the [[North Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] on February 23, 1944, during [[World War II]]. The expulsion, preceded by the [[1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya]], was ordered by [[NKVD]] chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]] after approval by [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]], as a part of a [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlement program]] and [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfer]] that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s.

The deportation was prepared since at least from October 1943 and 19,000 officers as well as 100,000 [[NKVD]] soldiers from all over the USSR participated in this operation. The deportation encompassed their entire nations, as well as the complete liquidation of the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The demographic consequences of this eviction were catastrophic and far reaching: of the 496,000 Chechens and Ingush who were deported, at least a quarter perished. In total, the archive records show that over a hundred thousand people died or were killed during the round-ups and transportation, and during their early years in exile in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz SSR]] as well as [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] where they were sent to the many [[labor camps]] in the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced settlements]]. They were under administrative supervision of the NKVD officials during that entire time.

The exile lasted for 13 years and the survivors would not return to their native lands until 1957, after the new Soviet authorities under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reversed many of Stalin's policies, including the deportations of nations. A local report indicated that some 432,000 Vainakhs had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1961, though they faced many obstacles while trying to settle back to the Caucasus, including unemployment, lack of accommodation and ethnic clashes with the local Russian population. Eventually, the Chechens and Ingush recovered and regained the majority of the population. This eviction left a permanent scar in the memory of the survivors and their descendants. February 23 is today remembered as a day of tragedy by most of Ingushs and Chechens. Many in Chechnya and Ingushetia classify it as an act of [[genocide]], as did the [[European Parliament]] in 2004.

==Historical background==
{{see|Chechen-Russian conflict|Russian irredentism|Caucasus War}}

The Chechens and the [[Ingush people|Ingush]] speak languages that are closely related and have a degree of passive intelligibility, both being [[Vainakh languages]].{{Sfn|Bugay|Gonov|2002|p=43}} The [[Chechen-Russian conflict]] is one of the [[List of longest wars|longest and most protracted conflicts]] in modern history, spanning three centuries.{{Sfn|Russell|2007|p=33}} Its origins date back to 1785,&lt;ref name="Refworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology for Chechens in Russia|publisher=Minorities at Risk|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38d12.html|author=Refworld|date=2004|accessdate=September 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001401/http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38d12.html|archivedate=September 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Chechens]] fought against Russian expansionism into the [[Caucasus]]. The [[Caucasus War]] was fought between 1817 and 1864. The [[Russian Empire]] succeeded to annex and subjugate the people of the area,&lt;ref name="Refworld"/&gt; but also killed or deported numerous non-Russian peoples and was responsible for the [[Circassian genocide]].{{Sfn|Richmond|2013|p=17, 166}} The [[Circassians]], the [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] and the [[Abazins|Abaza]] were subsequently resettled to the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{Sfn|Gutsche|1979|p=226}} However, other Caucasus people were affected as well. There were up to 1.5 million Chechens in the Caucasus in 1847, but as a result of this war and ensuing expulsions, their number dropped to 140,000 in 1861, and then further to 116,000 in 1867.{{Sfn|Jaimoukha|2005|p=14}} In 1865, at least 39,000 Chechens were exiled to the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="Refworld"/&gt;
[[File:Народы Кавказа 19 век.JPG|thumb|A painting depicting the Chechen, Ossetian, Circassian and Kabardinian people from Caucasus in the 19th century|left]]
In spite of this, the Chechens intermittently demanded a restoration of their independence and rebelled again against the Russian Empire in 1878.{{Sfn|Reynolds|2014|p=211}} During the era of the [[USSR]], throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Chechens rejected the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] and [[Sovietization]] policies of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. This social resistance was nicknamed the 'Chechen problem'.{{sfn|Werth|2006|p=347}} During this time, [[Moscow]] constantly changed their territory, until the [[Chechen Autonomous Oblast|Chechen]] and [[Ingush Autonomous Oblast]]s were merged into a single [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="Refworld"/&gt;

In 1940, [[1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya|another Chechen insurgency]], led by [[Khasan Israilov]], started in Galanchozh. It was partly inspired by the resistance of [[Finns]] against the invading Soviets in the [[Winter War]] in 1939.{{sfn|Cornell|2005|p=188}} In February 1942, [[Mairbek Sheripov]]'s group rebelled in [[Shatoysky District|Shatoysky]] and [[Itum-Kalinsky District|Itum-Kalinsky]] Districts. They united with Israilov's army to rebel against the Soviet system. The [[Soviet Air Force]] bombarded the Chechen-Ingush republic in the spring of 1942 to suppress the rebellion.{{Sfn|Cornell|2005|p=188}} During [[World War II]], the Soviet government accused Chechens and Ingush of cooperating with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invaders.{{sfn|Bryan|1984|p=99}} The Nazis wanted to reach the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], whose [[oil reserves]] were the goal of [[Case Blue]] (Fall Blau). On August 25, 1942, a group of German paratroopers, led by saboteur Osman Gube, landed near the village of Berezhki in the Galashkinsky district in order to organize anti-Soviet actions{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=100}} yet managed to only recruit 13 people in the area.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=101}}

The key period of the Chechen guerilla war started in August–September 1942, when German troops approached Ingushetia, and ended in the summer-autumn of 1943, with the Soviet [[Battle of Caucasus|counter-offensive]] that drove the [[Wehrmacht]] from the North Caucasus.{{sfn|Burds|2007|p=16–26}} There were some 20 million Muslims in the USSR, and the Soviet government feared that a Muslim revolt could spread from Caucasus to the whole of Central Asia. In August 1942, the ''Wehrmacht'' entered North Caucasus, seizing the [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] and [[Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]s. It also encouraged [[anti-Sovietism]] among the local populace. However, the Nazis never reached [[Grozny]]{{sfn|Motadel|2014|p=135}} and the only town in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR they briefly occupied was [[Malgobek]], which was inhabited by Russians.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=59}}

Various historians, including Moshe Gammer, Ben Fowkes and Tony Wood, refute the Chechens' ties with the Germans,{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1y=2007|1p=36|2a1=Gammer|2y=2006|2p=161–165|3a1=Fowkes|3y=1996|3p=71}} some pointing out that the Nazis stopped at the northwest outskirts of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, near [[Mozdok]], in Northern Ossetia, and that a majority of the Vainakh never even came with a direct contact with the German army.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2015|1p=47|2a1=Porter|2y=1997|2p=146}} While there were secret negotiations with the Germans near this border, the Chechen rebels pointed out that they did not favor a rule from [[Berlin]] nor from Moscow.{{Sfn|Williams|2015|p=47}} Sheripov reportedly gave the [[Ostministerium]] a sharp warning that "if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this... only a new stage in the national liberation war".{{Sfn|Wood|2007|p=36}} In October 1942, Chechens assisted other volunteers to help erect a defensive barrier around Grozny. Between December 1942 and March 1943, Chechens and Ingush contributed 12 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] to the Soviet defensive war.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=60}} 17,413 Chechens joined the [[Red Army]] and were awarded 44 decorations{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=60–61}} while a further 13,363 joined the Chechen-Ingush ASSR [[People's Militia (Soviet Union)|People's Militia]], ready to defend the area from an invasion.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=46}} By contrast, Babak Rezvani points out that only about a 100 Chechens collaborated with the [[Axis powers]].{{sfn|Rezvani|2014|p=218}}

On orders from [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the head of the [[NKVD]], the entire Chechen and Ingush population of the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] were to be deported by freight trains to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The operation was called "Chechevitsa" (Operation Lentil),{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=36}} its first two syllables pointing at its intended targets. The operation is referred to by Chechens often as "Aardakh" (the Exodus). This operation was being prepared and planned since at least October 1943, and included Beria's two most trusted NKVD officers, [[Ivan Serov]] and [[Bogdan Kobulov]].{{Sfn|Werth|2008|p=412}} Beria complained to Stalin about the "low level of labour discipline" among Chechens, the "prevalence of banditry and terrorism", the "failure of Chechens to join the communist party" and the "confession of a German agent that he found a lot of support among the local Ingush".{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} Beria then ordered to implement the operation. When Supian Kagirovich Mollaev, the leader of the local government in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, heard about the decision, he burst into tears, but soon pulled himself together and decided to follow orders.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} The Chechen-Ingush Republic was never fully occupied by the Nazi army, but the repressions were officially justified by "an armed resistance to Soviet power".{{sfn|Burds|2007|p=16–26}} The charges of the Vainakh collaboration with the Nazis were never subsequently proven in any Soviet court.{{sfn|Dushnyck|1975|p=503}}

During World War II, 3,332,589 individuals were encompassed by Stalin's policies of deportations and forced settlements.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=107}} Some of the stated reasons were allegedly to "defuse ethnic tensions", to "stabilize the political situation" or to punish people for their "act against the Soviet authority".{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=61}} According to the 1939 census, 407,690 Chechens and 92,074 Ingush were registered in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kreindler|1986|p=387}} On October 13, 1943, Operation Lentil commenced when about a hundred thousand troops and operative workers were moved into Checheno-Ingushetia, supposedly for mending roads and bridges. The soldiers even lived for a month inside the homes of the Chechens, who considered them guests.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=167}} On February 20, 1944, Beria arrived to Grozny to supervise the operation.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=166}}

[[File:Депортация чеченцев и ингушей.svg|thumbnail|Map of the Chechen and Ingush regions of the Caucasus prior to the deportation]]
On February 23, 1944 (on [[Defender of the Fatherland Day|Red Army Day]]), the operation began. The NKVD troops went systematically from house to house to collect individuals.{{Sfn|Wong|2015|p=68}} The inhabitants were rounded up and imprisoned in [[Studebaker US6|Studebaker trucks]], before being packed into unheated and uninsulated [[Goods wagon|freight cars]].{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=170}} The people were given only 15 to 30 minutes to pack for the surprise transfer.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=167}} According to a correspondence dated March 3, 1944, at least 19,000 officers and 100,000 NKVD soldiers from all over the USSR were sent to implement this operation. Some 500 people were deported by mistake even though they were not Chechens or Ingush.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=106}} The plan envisaged that 300,000 people were to be evicted from the lowland in the first three days, while in the following days the remaining 150,000 people living in the mountain regions would be next in line.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=166}}

Many times, resistance was met with slaughter, and in one such instance, in the aul of Khaibakh, about [[Khaibakh massacre|700 people were locked in a barn and burned to death]] by NKVD General Mikheil Gveshiani, who was praised for this and promised a medal by Beria.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=170}} Many people from remote villages were executed per Beria's verbal order that any Chechen or Ingush deemed 'untransportable should be liquidated' on the spot.{{sfn|Burds|2007|p=16–26}} This meant that the old, the ill and the infirm were to either be shot or left to starve in their beds alone. The soldiers would sometimes plunder the empty homes.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=169}} An eyewitness recalled the actions of the NKVD forces:

{{cquote|They combed the huts to make sure there was no one left behind... The soldier who came into the house did not want to bend down. He raked the hut with a burst from his submachine gun. Blood trickled out from under the bench where a child was hiding. The mother screamed and hurled herself at the soldier. He shot her too. There was not enough rolling stock. Those left behind were shot. The bodies were covered with earth and sand, carelessly. The shooting had also been careless, and people started wriggling out of the sand like worms. The NKVD men spent the whole night shooting them all over again.{{sfn|Radzinsky|1997|p=503}}}}
[[File:Naujoji Vilnia train station 4.JPG|thumb|Sealed off freight cars were used to deport the Chechens and Ingush]]
Those who resisted, protested or walked too slow were shot on the spot.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=18}} In one incident, NKVD soldiers climbed up Moysty, a high mountain, and found 60 villagers there. Even though their commander ordered the soldiers to shoot the villagers, they fired in the air. The commander then ordered half of the soldiers to join the villagers and another platoon shot them all.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=169, 170}} 2,016 'anti-Soviet' people were arrested, and 20,072 weapons were confiscated in the operation.{{sfn|Askerov|2015|p=12}}

Throughout the [[North Caucasus]], about 650,000 people{{sfnm|1a1=Bugay|1y=1996|1p=106|2a1=Pokalova|2y=2015|2p=16|3a1=Mawdsley|3y=1998|3p=71}} (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=37}}) were deported in 1943 and 1944 by the Soviet forces. 478,479 people were forcibly resettled in the Aardakh: 387,229 Chechens and 91,250 Ingush.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} They were loaded onto 180 special trains, about 40 to 45 persons into each [[freight car]]. A combined total of 14,200 freight cars and 1,000 flat cars were used for this mass [[forcible transfer]] from February 23 to March 13, a rate of almost 350 freight cars per day. Some 40% to 50% of the deportees were children.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=67}} The Chechens were the second most numerous repressed peoples in the USSR, after the [[Volga Germans]].{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=191, 193}} Tens of thousands of [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyks]], [[Balkars]], [[Meskhetian Turks]] and [[Karachays]] were also deported from the region.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=156}} Only Chechen and Ingush women married to non-punished peoples were spared from the deportation. However, Russian women married to Chechen or Ingush men were subject to deportation unless they divorced.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=66}} Their [[livestock]] was sent to [[kolkhoz]]es in [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]] and [[Orel oblast|Orel Oblasts]]. Many of these animals perished from exhaustion.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=74}}
[[File:Operation Lentil (Caucasus).svg|thumb|Destinations of the resettled Chechens and Ingush inside the Soviet Union]]

Some 6,000 Chechens got stuck in the mountains of the Galanzhoy district due to the snow, but this slowed the deportation only minimally: 333,739 people were evicted, of which 176,950 were sent to trains already on the first day of the operation.{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=147}} Beriya reported that there were only six cases of resistance, 842 were "subject to isolation" while 94,741 were removed from their homes by 11 p.m. on the first day of the operation.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=104}} Each family was allowed to carry up to 500&amp;nbsp;kg of personal belongings on the trip.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=67}} The people were transported in cattle trains that were not appropriate for human transfer, lacking electricity, heating or [[running water]]. The exiles inside endured [[epidemics]], which lead to deaths from [[infections]] or hunger. The transit to Central Asia lasted for almost a month.{{sfn|Pokalova|2015|p=16}} Some of the epidemics included [[typhus]].{{Sfn|Joes|2007|p=133}} One witness, who was seven years old at the time of her family's deportation, recalls that the wagons were so full of people that there was no space to move inside them.{{Sfn|Brauer|2010|p=387}} The exiles were given food only sporadically during the transit and did not know where they were being taken to.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=173}} The wagons did not even stop for [[Toilet|bathroom]] breaks: the passengers had to make holes in the floor to relieve themselves.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=18}} The special trains traveled almost 2,000 miles{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=18}} and discharged the peoples into desolate areas of [[Central Asia]], devoid of shelters or food.{{Sfn|Joes|2007|p=133}} 239,768 Chechens and 78,479 Ingush were sent to the [[Kazakh SSR]], whereas 70,089 Chechens and 2,278 Ingush arrived in [[Kirgiz SSR]]. Smaller number of the remaining deportees were sent to [[Uzbek SSR]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and [[Tajik SSR]].{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=68}}

The [[persecution]] of the Chechens did not stop there. In May 1944, Beria issued a directive ordering the NKVD to browse the entire USSR in search for any remaining members of that nation, "not leaving a single one". As a result, an additional 4,146 Chechens and Ingush were found in [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Rostov Oblast|Rostov]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]. In April 1945, Beria was informed that 2,741 Chechens were deported from the Georgian SSR, 21 from the Azerbaijan SSR and 121 from Krasnodar Krai. In [[Moscow]], only two Chechens managed to avoid eviction. All the Chechen and Ingush were discharged from the [[Red Army]] and sent to Central Asia as well.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=66}} With these supplementary exiles, the number of the deported Chechens and Ingush grew to a total of 493,269.{{Sfn|Marshall|2010|p=386}} In July 1944, Beria reported an even higher figure to Stalin, claiming that a total of 496,460 Chechen and Ingush were deported.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=25}} This [[ethnic cleansing]] operation was marked by an utter "culture of impunity".{{Sfn|Werth|2008|p=412}} Many perpetrators of Operation Lentil were, in fact, even awarded the Suvorov First Class prize for arresting and capturing Chechens and Ingush.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=67}}

As with eight other "punished peoples" of the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=197}} the Chechens were put into the regime of [[Special settlement (Soviet)|special settlements]]. There was no barb wire around their compound, but any Chechen aged 16 or over had to report to the local NKVD officials each month. Those who tried to escape were sent to the [[gulag]]. This status of a special settler was supposed to be inherited by the children of the exiles.{{Sfn|Lee|Thomas|2012|p=185}} The exiles were assigned with the heaviest tasks, such as constructing sites, mines and factories in the most inhospitable places.{{Sfn|Werth|2008|p=412}} The only compensation they received for their work was food coupons.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=27}} They would be punished if they would not do any work assigned to them. Local authorities would act harshly towards them: sometimes they would beat the children of the Chechens to death.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=21}} At [[Krasnoyarsk]] about 4,000 Chechens were assigned to forced [[labor camps]]. This, combined with [[malnutrition]] due to the negligence of the authorities to provide enough food for the newly arrived exiles, led to high death rates.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=69}} The settlers were not provided with adequate accommodation: on September 1, 1944, only 5,000 out of the 31,000 families in Kirgiz SSR were provided with housing. One district prepared only 18 apartments for 900 families.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=69}} Some exiles had to live in unheated tents.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=20}} The Chechen children had to attend school in the local language, not their own. Several cases of rebellion were reported: in Krasnoyarsk in October 1954, some 4,000 Chechens managed to escape from a gulag concentration camp. The Soviet police found and killed half of them, but the other half managed to hide in the vast outdoors.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=72}}

==Aftermath==
===Casualties and death toll===
[[File:Семья Газдиевых у тела умершей дочери (Казахстан).jpg|thumb|An Ingush family mourning the death of their daughter in Kazakhstan]]
Many deportees died ''en route'', and the extremely harsh environment of exile, especially considering the amount of [[Thermal stress on humans|exposure and thermal stress]], killed many more. The temperatures ih the Kazakh SSR would drop anywhere from {{convert|-50|°C|°F}} during winter and then hit up to {{convert|50|°C|°F}} during summer.{{sfn|Khrapunov|2015|p=13}}

They travelled in wagons that were locked from the outside, without light or water, during winter. Trains would stop and open the wagons only occasionally to bury the dead in the snow. The local people at the train stations were forbidden to help the sick passengers or to give them any medicine or water.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=68}} Some Russian sources claim that 1,272 people died during this transit.{{sfn|King|2006|p=225}}  In 1948, there were 118,250 special settlers in Kazakh SSR "in extreme need in regard for food" and authorities reported thousands of children dying from [[undernourishment]].{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=69}} Food rations were fixed at only 116 grams of [[flour]] and 56 grams of [[grain]] per day for each person, which was even below the standards of the captives in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] camp. The local authorities in Kyrgistan set up enough supplies for only four months.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=19}} One mother tried to make soup out of [[grass]] for her children.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=20}} According to official Soviet reports, 608,749 Chechen, Ingush, Karachay and Balkars were registered in exile in Central Asia by 1948. The NKVD gives the statistic of 144,704 people who died in 1944–48 alone: a [[death rate]] of 23.7% per all these groups.{{sfn|Pokalova|2015|p=16}} 101,036 Chechens, Ingush and Balkars died in Kazakhstan and 16,052 in Uzbekistan.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=81}} This means that their group suffered the highest death toll of all the deported peoples within the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Ther|2014|p=118}}

Professor Jonathan Otto Pohl estimates the combined number of deaths among Chechen and Ingush exiles during transit and confinement in special settlements by 1949 at 123,000. Out of these deaths, Chechens comprised 100,000 and Ingush 23,000.{{Sfn|Pohl|1999|p=97–98}} Thomas McDonell also gives a figure of at least 100,000 Chechens who died from starvation and diseases in exile, but does not give a figure for the Ingush casualties.{{Sfn|McDonnell|2009|p=333}} Tom K. Wong, Associate Professor of Political Science, estimates that at least 100,000 Vainakhs died in the first three years in exile, excluding those who perished during the transit and the round-ups.{{Sfn|Wong|2015|p=68}} Historian William Flemming released calculations giving a minimum of 132,000 Chechens and Ingush who died between 1944 and 1950. In comparison, their number of births in that period was only 47,000. Thus, the Chechen and ingush population fell from 478,479 in 1944 to 452,737 in 1948.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} From 1939 to 1959, the Chechen population grew by 2.5%. In comparison, between 1926 and 1939, it grew 28%.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=174}} Historian [[Alexander Nekrich]] stated that the net losses of Chechens between 1939 and 1959 (after allowing for wartime losses) were 131,000, and of Ingush 12,000.{{sfn|Nekrich|1978|p=138}} German journalist [[Lutz Kleveman]] determined that 150,000 people did not survive the first four years of winter cold in Central Asia.{{sfn|Kleveman|2002|p=87}} Estimates for the maximum deaths and demographic losses of the Chechen and Ingush range from about 170,000{{sfn|Griffin|2012|p=40}} to 200,000,{{sfn|Bancheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=229}} thus ranging from a quarter{{sfnm|1a1=Griffin|1y=2004|1p=188|2a1=Mawdsley|2y=1998|2p=72}} of the total Chechen population to nearly a third being killed in those years.{{sfnm|1a1=Joes|1y=2007|1p=133|2a1=Tishkov|2y=2004|2p=27|3a1=Binet|3y=2016|3p=185}}

The demographer Dalkhat Ediev, in a study of casualty figures for all ethnic groups that were singled out for "punishment" by Stalin, found that deaths due to the deportations included 125,500 of the Chechen deportees and 20,300 of the Ingush deportees,{{Sfn|Buckley|Ruble|Hofmann|2008|p=207}} or 30.8% of the Chechens and 21.3% of the Ingush.&lt;ref name=Ediev&gt;{{cite web|author=D.M.

He estimates that the Chechen population dropped to a low of 285,000 and the Ingush to 78,800 people in October 1948.&lt;ref name=Ediev/&gt; However, despite these heavy losses, the Chechens subsequently increased their [[fertility rates]], which is seen by some as a manifestation of their resiliance and determination to survive.{{sfn|Iliyasov|2015}}

===Political, cultural, social and economic consequences===
The Checheno-Ingush ASSR was dissolved and transformed into [[Grozny Oblast]], which included also the [[Kizlyarsky District]] and [[Naursky Raion]], and parts of it were given to [[North Ossetia]] (part of [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]]), [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] and [[Dagestan]] ASSR. As a result, Georgian SSR "grew" from 69,300 to 76,400, North Ossetiya from 6,200 to 9,200 and Dagestan from 35,000 to 38,200 [[square kilometers]].{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=73}} Names of repressed nations were totally erased from all books and encyclopedias.{{sfn|Burds|2007|p=16–26}} By the next summer, a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical [[Nakh language]] books and manuscripts was near complete.{{sfn|Gammer|2006|p=182}}{{Sfn|Joes|2007|p=133}} Their villages were razed to the ground and their graveyards bulldozed.{{sfn|Porter|1997|p=146}} With the native population gone, the Chechen region experienced a huge lack of skilled workers: the local [[oil production]] industry dropped more than ten times in 1944 compared to 1943.{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=109}}

On November 26, 1948 the [[Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet]] issued a decree which sentenced the deported nations to a permanent exile in those distant regions. This decree was not only mandatory for Chechens and Ingush, but also for [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Volga Germans|Germans]], Balkars and Kalmyks.{{sfn|Sakwa|2005|p=292}} The settlers were not allowed to travel beyond three kilometers of their new place of residence.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=69}} The authorities also prohibited any public mention or documentation of the deportations and its murders.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=86}} Thousands of historical Vainakh texts, along with their origins, were lost when the Russians destroyed the public and private library of the peoples of Chechnya.{{Sfn|Jaimoukha|2005|p=212}} The settlers were the target of various provocations in the Kazakh SSR: in December 1954, students in Elizavetinka taunted the Chechens as "traitors and betrayers of motherland". In May 1955, a worker in a coal mine engaged in a fight with a Chechen colleague in [[Ekibastuz]]. This escalated into a [[pogrom]] in which Russian hooligans even attacked a police station which sheltered the runaway Chechens.{{sfn|Kozlov|McClarnand|2015|p=110}} Many refugees from the Soviet Union were moved to the empty homes, including Russians, Ukrainians, [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]] and [[Ossetians]].{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=74}} As a consequence of this, the Russians comprised 49% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1959.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} By one report dated April 8, 1957, there were 415,000 Chechen and Ingush living in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz SSR, or 90,000 families. 38,500 were employed in the industry, 91,500 in agriculture, 25,000 in offices.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=29}}

===Return===
{{see|Khrushchev thaw}} 
In 1953, the three architects of the deportation perished: shortly after Stalin died on March 5, Beria and Kobulov were arrested on June 27, 1953. They were convicted on multiple charges, sentenced to death and executed on December 23, 1953.{{Sfn|Lewytzkyj|1974|p=15}} However, these charges were unrelated to the crimes of deportations, and were merely a ploy to remove them from power. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new Soviet leader and revoked numerous deportations, even denouncing Stalin. [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|In his secret speech]] on February 24, 1956, Khrushchev condemned these Stalinist deportations:
{{cquote|The Soviet Union is justly considered as a model of a [[multinational state]] because we have in practice assured the equality and friendship of all nations who live in our great fatherland. All the more monstrous are the acts whose initiator was Stalin and which are crude violations of basic Leninist principles of the nationality policy of the Soviet State. We refer to the mass deportations from their native places of whole nations, together with Communists and [[Komsomol]]s without exception.{{Sfn|Smith|2006|p=65}}}}

[[File:На вокзале. 1957 год Фрунзе. Жители с. Юрт-Аух.jpg|thumb|Vainakhs returning to the Caucasus in 1957]]
On July 16, 1956 the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet adopted a decree lifting the restrictions of the legal status of Chechens, Ingush and Karachais in the special settlements.{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=184}} In January 1957, the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Soviet Council of Ministers]] passed a decree allowing repressed nations to freely travel in the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Smith|2006|p=65}} The Chechens and Ingush were thereby rehabilitated.{{sfn|Bryan|1984|p=99}} Their exile lasted 13 years.{{Sfn|Brauer|2010|p=387}} Some started slowly returning to the Caucasus already in 1954, but were sent back by the authorities. During 1956 alone, between 25,000 and 30,000 Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, some even carrying the bodies of their relatives. The Soviet government tried to give them [[autonomy]] inside Uzbekistan or to resettle them in other parts of the Caucasus, but the returnees were adamant to return to their native lands.{{sfn|Cornell|2005|p=190}}

Over 50,000 families returned in 1957.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=33}} By 1959, Chechens and Ingush already comprised 41% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR.{{sfn|Cornell|2005|p=190}} 58.2% of Chechens and 45.3% of Ingushetians returned to their native lands by that year.{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=199}} By 1970, this peaked with 83.0% of all Chechens and 72.1% of all Ingush being registered in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. However, this distribution fell to 76.8% and 69.0%, respectively, by 1989.{{sfn|Kaiser|2017|p=161}} In comparison, 91.9% of all Chechens and 91.9% of all Ingush were concetrated in their titular republic in 1926.{{sfn|Fowkes|1996|p=209}} However, some Chechens stayed in [[Kyrgyzstan]]: some were afraid of the harsh long trip, some lacked the money to travel.{{Sfn|Gessen|2015|p=24}} By 2010, there were still a 100,000 Chechens living in Kazahstan.{{Sfn|Brauer|2010|p=387}}

When the Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, they found their farms and infrasturcture had deteriorated. Some of the mountain regions were still a restricted zone for the returnees, which meant they had to settle in the lowlands.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=33}} Worse still, they found other peoples living in their homes, and viewed these other ethnicities ([[Ossetians]], Russians, [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], and [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]]) with hostility. Some Laks, Darghins and Avars had to be moved back to [[Dagestan]], where they came from.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=33}} Conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny were sparked.{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=200}} The massive numbers of Vainakhs who were coming back to the Northern Caucasus took the locals by surprise: the Soviet government thus decided to temporarily halt the influx of returnees in the summer of 1957. Many Chechens and Ingush sold their homes and belongings, and quit their jobs to be able to return.{{sfn|Kozlov|McClarnand|2015|p=112}} A renewed ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians was also on the rise. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership and job competition, [[1958 Grozny riots|rioted as early as 1958]].{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=33}} The 1958 riot was sparked by a fight between a Russian sailor and an Ingush youngster over a girl in which the Russian was fatally injured. In the next four days, the Russians formed mob riots and looted the Vainakh property,{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} seizing government buildings and demanding either a restoration of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non-titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of "Russian power", mass search and disarming of Chechens and Ingush, before Soviet law enforcement dispersed the rioters.{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=80–81}} Although the riot was dispersed and denounced as "chauvinistic", afterward the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, including mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians.{{sfn|Bancheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=121}}

[[File:Soviet Caucasus map.svg|thumb|Map of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR from 1957 to 1991]]
In 1958, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was officially restored by a decree direct from Moscow, but in previous 1936 borders. [[North Ossetia]] kept the Psedakh and [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]], Georgian SSR kept the [[Daryal Gorge]], amounting to 1/6 of lost land for Ingushetia,{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=200}} while the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was "compensated" with the [[Itum-Kalinsky District|Itum-Kalinsky]] and [[Prigorodny District, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Prigorodny]] Districts from the Georgian SSR.{{Sfn|Hille|2010|p=60}} This was done to dissipate the demographic impact of the 419,000 Vainakh returnees on Russians who moved there. By 1989, the 750,000 Chechens already comprised a majority (55%) of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, while 300,000 Russians comprised 22% and 163,700 Ingush 12% of the population. Chechens started to gain control by the 1970s. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to discourage potential uprisings failed due to the higher birthrate of the Vainakhs.{{sfn|Bancheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=121}}

A local report from 1961 indicated that out of 524,000 Vainakhs, 432,000 had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, 28,000 to Dagestan and 8,000 to North Ossetiya.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=34}} However, ethnic clashes continued even in the 1960s: in 1965 alone, 16 such clashes were recorded, resulting in 185 injuries and 19 fatalities.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} Chechens were greatly disadvantaged after being allowed to return. There were no Chechen-language schools, leading to a lack of education of the populace (which did not universally understand [[Russian language|Russian]]).{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=81, 88}} According to sociologist Georgi Derluguyan, the Checheno-Ingush Republic's economy was divided into two spheres, in which the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries in the urban areas: no Chechen cadre was promoted to a top position all until 1989.{{Sfn|Derluguyan|2005|p=243}} In the 1960s, in order to finance their families, some forty thousand men temporarily migrated from Chechen-Ingushetia each year to find part-time jobs in Kazakhstan and Siberia, thanks to their contacts from the time of their exile.{{Sfn|Derluguyan|2005|p=245}} On paper, the Chechen-Ingush Republic enjoyed the same privileges as other Soviet ASSRs, but in reality it had very little actual Chechens or Ingush representing its government, which was run directly by the Russians.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} Despite being rich with oil, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR remained the second poorest region of the entire USSR. Yusup Soslambekov, a chairman of the Chechen parliament after 1991, lamented that his people returned from exile to their homes "not as masters of that land but as mere inhabitants, tenants. Other people took our jobs in our factories".{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=88}}

==Remembrance and legacy==
[[File:Митинг чеченцев-аккинцев 23.02.2013г.JPG|thumb|People gathering at a monument in Dagestan to commemorate the deportation of Chechens and Ingush in 2013]]
This deportation left a permanent scar in the memory of the Chechens and is today regarded by some historians as "one of the most significant ethnic traumas of the Soviet period". Some descendents of the peoples of the North Caucasus are even today in fear of a new deportation.{{sfn|Pokalova|2015|p=16}} One historian named it "the central defining event in modern Chechen history".{{Sfn|Joes|2007|p=133}} It also played a role in the Chechen mistrust at the [[Kremlin]] and a partial motivation for the subsequent declaration of independence in 1991 and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]] in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=11}} For instance, insurgent [[Shamil Basayev]] referred to his 40 relatives who died during the deportation while [[Aslan Mashadov]], the [[President of Ichkeria]], stated that February 23 remains "one of the most tragic dates for his people" and that the goal of the Russian government has always stayed the same: "Chechnya without Chechens".{{sfn|Pokalova|2015|p=16}} Historian [[Nikolay Bugay]] described the deportation as a "perversion of [[Lenin's national policy]] and a direct disregard for the [[constitutional rights]] of the peoples".{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=110}}

In 1991, Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] made political capital by, in a symbolic move, sending out officials to gather these lost gravestones (that had been used by the Soviets for the construction of pedestrian footpasses and foundations of pig pens), many of which had lost their original inscriptions, and to construct out of them a [[Memorial to the Victims of the Deportation of 1944|memorial]] in the center of Grozny. The memorial was made to symbolize both Chechen remorse for the past as well as the desire to, in the name of the dead ancestors, fashion the best possible Chechen Republic out of their land and work hard towards the future. It bears an engravement, reading: "We will not break, we will not weep; we will never forget." Tablets bore pictures of the sites of massacres, such as Khaibakh.&lt;ref name=gravestoneremoval&gt;{{cite news|title=Relocation of Chechen 'genocide' memorial opens wounds|date=June 5, 2008|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uae/the-national-news/20080605/281913063860413|publisher=The National|author=Aslan Nurbiyev|accessdate=September 22, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923002100/https://www.pressreader.com/uae/the-national-news/20080605/281913063860413|archivedate=September 23, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lieven|1999|p=321}} The memorial was damaged during the subsequent Russo-Chechen wars.

[[File:Nazran. Memorial of memory and glory PB060293 2200.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial "9 towers" in Nazran built in memory of deportation]]
[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', published in 1973, mentioned the Chechens: "They are a nation that refused to accept the psychology of submission... I never saw a Chechen seek to serve the authorities, or even to please them".{{sfn|Porter|1997|p=146}}

In 1977 [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] wrote the song ''Летела жизнь'' (''Letela zhizn'') devoted to the deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v-vissotsky.ru/song.php?pid=421 Владимир Высоцкий. Летела жизнь.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatoly Pristavkin]] wrote the 1987 novel ''The Inseparable Twins'' which deals with this deportation. [[Semyon Lipkin]] published the novel ''Dekada'' in 1983. Iunus Desheriev, a philologist of Chechen origin, published an autobiography about how he escaped the fate of his people thanks to assistance from Russian friends.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}}

'''Destruction (2018)''' is a series of [[professional wrestling]] events promoted by [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) annually since [[Destruction '07|2007]]. In 2018 NJPW will promote three events: '''Destruction in Hiroshima''' on September 15, '''Destruction in Beppu''' on September 17 and '''Destruction in Kobe''' on September 23. These will be events eighteen to twenty in the [[NJPW Destruction|Destruction]] chronology.

==Background==
2018 is the third consecutive year in which NJPW hold three events under the Destruction name. From 2007 to 2013 NJPW held one event per year, expanding to two shows in 2014 and to three shows in 2016.

==Storylines==
The three Destruction events will feature nine [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] each that will involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portray [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#tweener|less distinguishable characters]] in the scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm | title = How Pro Wrestling Works | last=Grabianowski | first=Ed | accessdate=October 9, 2017 | work=HowStuffWorks, Inc. | publisher=[[Discovery Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37259">The '''economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States''' is challenging to measure and politically contentious. Since it is a challenging field to quantify, it leaves room for varying methodologies of study, and so the definitive results of the economic impact can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Xiangbo|title=Labor Market Search and the Dynamic Effects of Immigration|journal=Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control|date=2010|volume=12|issue=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possibility is that foreign workers entering the country illegally can lower wages and increase overall costs of production. This comes from the theory that when there are more illegal immigrants in the country, there will be more immigrants looking for employment because most illegal immigrants prefer to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griswold|first1=Daniel T.|title=Immigration and the Welfare State|journal=Cato Journal|date=2012|volume=32|issue=1|url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/catoj32&amp;section=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increases competition among low-skilled local workers, and this will push wages for the domestic low-skilled labor market down. Simultaneously the increased supply in unskilled illegal migrants can offset technological developments and "reduce the country's economy's competitiveness in the international market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Djajić|first1=Slobodan|title=Illegal Immigration and Resource Allocation|journal=International Economic Review|date=February 1997|volume=38|issue=1|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2527410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing theory is that even though this can happen in some areas with more low-skilled employment, on the net illegal immigration increases the welfare of domestic workers because their additional consumption outweighs the costs of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palivos|first1=Theodore|title=Welfare Effects of Illegal Immigration|journal=Journal of Population Economics|date=January 2009|volume=22|issue=1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-007-0182-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines it is argued that illegal immigrants work for lower wages, then domestic residents recognize these profits and can choose to either spend or save this new revenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=H.M.|title=The simple analytics of optimal growth with illegal migrants: A clarification|journal=Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control|date=December 2006|volume=30|issue=12|pages=2469–2475|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188905001739}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the net outcome can be decided by the net of these two economic forces. Studies have shown that overall in the long run illegal immigration benefits the country in terms of its general production, but introducing many people in the labor market can lead to income distribution that can tend towards domestic workers and immigrant workers on other occasions. The net short-term impacts of some aspects of illegal immigration can be inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palivos|first1=Theodore|last2=Yip|first2=Chong|title=Illegal immigration in a heterogeneous labor market|journal=Journal of Economics|date=September 2010|volume=101|issue=1|pages=21–47|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-010-0139-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this net effect changes, the number of immigrants crossing the border illegally is less unclear.

There were approximately 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2016, roughly unchanged from the prior year but well below the 12.2 million peak in 2007. There were an estimated 8 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. civilian workforce in 2016, roughly 5%.&lt;ref name="Pew2017"/&gt; The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported in 2007 that "the tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to them" but "in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use."&lt;ref name="CBO2007a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf|title=The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local Governments|date=December 2007|publisher=The Congress of the United States – Congressional Budget Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unauthorized immigrants demand goods and services&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration|title=The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration|last=Immigration|first=Panel on the Economic and Fiscal Consequences of|last2=Statistics|first2=Committee on National|last3=Education|first3=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last4=Sciences|first4=National Academies of|last5=Engineering|last6=Medicine|first6=and|date=2016-09-21|isbn=9780309444453|language=en|doi=10.17226/23550}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an estimated 50 to 75 percent pay taxes.&lt;ref name="CBO2007"/&gt; Due to cheaper labor, they contribute to lower prices in the industries where they work, such as agriculture, restaurants, and construction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Undocumented immigrant population==
{{Main article|Illegal immigrant population of the United States}}

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], there were 11.3 million illegal immigrants living in the United States in 2016, statistically unchanged from the previous year. The number peaked at 12.2 million in 2007, following a steady increase that began in 1990. An estimated 5.6 million unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico in 2015 and 2016, down from 6.4 million in 2009. Non-Mexicans numbered 5.7 million, indicating Mexicans are no longer the clear majority of unauthorized immigrants. The U.S. civilian workforce includes 8 million unauthorized immigrants, accounting for 5% of those working or looking for work in 2014. This number has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging between 8.0 and 8.3 million. Unauthorized immigrants represent 26% of farming and 15% of construction labor. They are primarily concentrated in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. About two-thirds have been in the U.S. for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="Pew2017"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/|title=5 facts about illegal immigration in the U.S.|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction has been driven mainly by a decrease in the number of new immigrants from Mexico, the single largest source. Net immigration from Mexico to the U.S. has stopped and possibly reversed since 2010. At its peak in 2000, about 770,000 immigrants arrived annually from Mexico; the majority arrived illegally. By 2010, the inflow had dropped to about 140,000—a majority of whom arrived as legal immigrants.&lt;ref name="Pew Hispanic Center 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/12/06/unauthorized-immigrants-11-1-million-in-2011/|title=Unauthorized Immigrants: 11.1 Million in 2011|first1=Jeffrey S.|last1=Passel|first2=D’Vera|last2=Cohn|date=6 December 2012|website=Pewhispanic.org|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak in August 2007, the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. was 12.5 million. This decreased by 1.3 million to 11.2 million by July 2008 (11%) due to either increased law enforcement or fewer job opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/us/31immig.html?partner=rssnyt | work=The New York Times | title=Decline Seen in Numbers of People Here Illegally | first=Julia | last=Preston | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Department of Homeland Security estimates in 2009, unauthorized immigrant population living in the United States decreased to 10.8 million in January 2009. On the whole, between 2000 and 2009, the unauthorized immigrant population grew by 27 percent.&lt;ref name="dhs.gov"&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2009.pdf |title=Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009 |last1=Hoffer |first1=Michael |last2=Rytina |first2=Nancy |last3=Baker |first3=Bryan C.|date=January 2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics Policy Directorate |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrants to the U.S. are concentrated at both the high- and low-income ends of the U.S. labor market, determined largely by their educational attainment. In 2004, at the low end, half of workers age 25 and older who lacked a diploma were from Mexico and Central America. These workers were employed in jobs that required little formal education, such as construction labor and dishwashing, and on average they earned much less than did the average native worker.&lt;ref name="Congressional Budget Office Paper: The Role of Immigrants in the U.S. Labor Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Immigrants in the U.S. Labor Market|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/68xx/doc6853/11-10-Immigration.pdf|publisher=The Congress of the United States – Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact of undocumented immigrants==

===Consumer demand===
An employer may benefit from the illegal status of a migrant who is desperate for work and therefore prepared to accept poor pay, usually below local norms. If paid [[under the table]] rather than using an [[Individual_Taxpayer_Identification_Number|ITIN]], hiring an illegal worker also brings the employer the advantage of paying less in the way of welfare contributions and other non-wage costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tapinos G.|date=n.d.|title=Illegal immigrants and the labour market| url=http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/190/Illegal_immigrants_and_the_labour_market.html|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly every dollar earned by illegal immigrants is spent immediately, and the average wage for US citizens is $10.25/hour with an average of 34 hours per week. This means that approximately 8 million US jobs are dependent upon economic activity produced by illegal immigrant activities within the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naid.ucla.edu/uploads/4/2/1/9/4219226/b46.pdf|title=Labor Market Impacts of Amnesty: A Comparative Analysis of IRCA and current conditions|publisher=UCLA North American Integration and Development Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Hinojosa%20-%20Raising%20the%20Floor%20for%20American%20Workers%20010710.pdf|title=Raising the Floor for American Workers|publisher=The Advocates for Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517100641/http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Hinojosa%20-%20Raising%20the%20Floor%20for%20American%20Workers%20010710.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/realer.pdf|title=Real Earnings – 2011|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budgetary impact===
A 2007 review of the academic literature by the nonpartisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that "over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use." While the overall fiscal impact on the US is beneficial, unauthorized immigrants have an adverse impact on the budgets of state and local governments. While cautioning that the reports are not a suitable basis for developing an aggregate national effect across all states, they concluded that:&lt;ref name="CBO2007a" /&gt;
* "State and local governments incur costs for providing services to unauthorized immigrants and have limited options for avoiding or minimizing those costs";
* "The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions";
* "The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to them, the impact is modest, and most do not qualify for them"; and
* "Federal aid programs offer resources to state and local governments that provide services to unauthorized immigrants, but those funds do not fully cover the costs of necessities."
IRS estimates that about 6 million unauthorized immigrants file individual income tax returns each year.&lt;ref name="CBO2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf|title=The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local Governments|date=December 2007|publisher=The Congress of the United States – Congressional Budget Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research reviewed by the nonpartisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] indicates that between 50 percent and 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes.&lt;ref name="CBO2007" /&gt; Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about $7 billion per year into Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/business/05immigration.html?ex=1270353600&amp;en=78c87ac4641dc383&amp;ei=5090 | title=Illegal Immigrants Are Bolstering Social Security With Billions | publisher=New York Times | author=Eduardo Porter | date=April 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they spend millions of dollars per year, which supports the US economy and helps to create new jobs. The Texas State Comptroller reported in 2006 that the 1.4 million illegal immigrants in Texas added almost $18 billion to the state's budget, and paid $1.2 billion in state services they used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141213205836/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/undocumented/undocumented.pdf ''Special Report – December 2006 Illegal Immigrants in Texas:A Financial Analysis of the Impact to the State Budget and Economy''], Carole Keeeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Security and Medicare contributions of illegal immigrants directly support older Americans, as illegal immigrants are not eligible to receive these services, although their children born in the United States are eligible for such benefits.&lt;ref&gt;“illegal Workers: Impact on Missouri’s Economy,” The Missouri Budget Project, June 21, 2006 and “Replacing the illegal Work Force,” Center for American Progress, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal immigrants pay social security payroll taxes but are not eligible for benefits. During 2006, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] analysts wrote: "Each year, for example, the U.S. Social Security Administration maintains roughly $6 billion to $7 billion of Social Security contributions in an "earnings suspense file"—an account for W-2 tax forms that cannot be matched to the correct Social Security number. The vast majority of these numbers are attributable to illegal workers who will never claim their benefits. For 2010, the Social Security Administration estimated that illegal immigrants and their employers paid $13 billion in required social security payroll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf|format=PDF|title=Social Security Administration-Effects of Unauthorized Immigration on the Actuarial Status of the Social Security Trust Funds|date=April 2013|website=Ssa.gov|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Security Administration has stated that it believes unauthorized work by non-citizens is a major cause of wage items being posted as erroneous wage reports instead of on an individual's earnings record.&lt;ref name="SSA14032006"&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/testimony_021606.html Administrative Challenges Facing the Social Security Administration]. Congressional Testimony – March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When Social Security numbers are already in use; names do not match the numbers or the numbers are fake, or the person of record is too old, young, dead etc., the earnings reported to the Social Security Agency are put in an Earnings Suspense file. The Social Security spends about $100 million a year and corrects all but about 2% of these. From tax years 1937 through 2003 the ESF had accumulated about 255 million mismatched wage reports, representing $520 billion in wages and about $75 billion in employment taxes paid into the over $1.5 trillion in the Social Security Trust funds. As of October 2005, approximately 8.8 million wage reports, representing $57.8 billion in wages remained unresolved in the suspense file for tax year 2003.&lt;ref name="SSA14032006" /&gt;

Estimates indicate that about 4% of the school-age population is made up of children who are illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local Governments,” Congressional Budget Office, Dec. 2009, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many require remedial assistance in language skills, which increases costs to the public schools. During April 2006, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] analysts wrote: "Local school districts are estimated to educate 1.8 million illegal children. At an average annual cost of $7,500 (averages vary by jurisdiction) per student, the cost of providing education to these children is about $11.2 billion." Other estimates of the costs to educate illegal children and US-born children of illegal immigrants reached $30 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;“S&amp;P Study: Costs and Benefits of illegal Immigrants,” Hispanic News, May 1, 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price levels===
NPR reported in March 2006 that when the wages of lower-skilled workers go down, the rest of America benefits by paying lower prices for things like restaurant meals, agricultural produce and construction. The economic impact of illegal immigration is far smaller than other trends in the economy, such as the increasing use of automation in manufacturing or the growth in global trade. But economists generally believe that when averaged over the whole economy, the effect is a small net positive. Harvard's [[George Borjas]] says the average American's wealth is increased by less than 1 percent because of illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="NPR Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Adam|title=Q&amp;A: Illegal Immigrants and the U.S. Economy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5312900|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on wages===
Economists have different conclusions regarding the impact on wages from immigration, both legal and illegal. It is challenging to separate the impact of illegal immigration (generally workers with lower educational attainment) from immigration overall. Studies generally conclude there is a small adverse impact on the wages of lower-skilled workers from immigration and some benefit for higher-skilled workers:
*Research by economist David Card (University of California-Berkeley) indicated the effect of immigration on native born workers without high school degrees is limited, perhaps reducing the wages of high school dropouts by 5% over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/08/25/wage-war The Economist-Wage War-August 25, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Harvard economist George Borjas wrote in 2007 that: "Economic theory implies that immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers. For example, an influx of foreign-born laborers reduces the economic opportunities for laborers — all laborers now face stiffer competition in the labor market. At the same time, high-skill natives may gain substantially. They pay less for the services that laborers provide, such as painting the house and mowing the lawn, and natives who hire these laborers can now specialize in producing the goods and services that better suit their skills." Borjas' other research also indicated that "high-school dropouts experience a substantial wage loss from immigration of 6.3% in the short run and 3.1% over the long haul as labor markets adjust to the increased number of workers."&lt;ref name="Edsall_Costs16"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/opinion/campaign-stops/what-does-immigration-actually-cost-us.html New York Times-Edsall-What Does Immigration Actually Cost Us-September 29, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2015 [[National Academy of Sciences]] report concluded that native-born workers who are substitutes for immigrants (e.g., lower-skilled workers in the case of illegal immigrants) "will experience negative wage effects." The report continues: "In summary, the immigration surplus [overall net benefit from immigration] stems from the increase in the return to capital that results from the increased supply of labor and the subsequent fall in wages. Natives who own more capital will receive more income from the immigration surplus than natives who own less capital, who can consequently be adversely affected."&lt;ref name="Edsall_Costs16"/&gt;
*The [[Brookings Institution]] reported in 2012 that: "[T]he most recent economic evidence suggests that, on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans.  Based on a survey of the academic literature, economists do not tend to find that immigrants cause any sizeable decrease in wages and employment of U.S.-born citizens, and instead may raise wages and lower prices in the aggregate." However, certain groups may be adversely affected. Brookings pointed to two studies at the opposite ends of the impact spectrum, one (Borjas-Katz 2007) indicating a 4.5% reduction in the wages of native workers that were high-school dropouts and a roughly 1.6% reduction for native college graduates, with another (Ottaviano-Peri 2008) indicating a small positive for all education levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/jobs/2012/05/04/what-immigration-means-for-u-s-employment-and-wages/ Brookings Institution-What Immigration Means for U.S. Employment and Wages-May 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Gordon H. Hanson at University of California–San Diego and National Bureau of Economic Research performed a study to see if undocumented immigration affects native workers employment. From the study was concluded that unauthorized immigrants provide a source of manpower in agriculture, construction, food processing, building cleaning and maintenance, and other low-end jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/Hanson-Dec09.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Economics and Policy of Illegal Immigration in the United States |website=Migrationpolicy.org |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities with a high percentage of illegal immigration were examined in this study and data showed that illegal immigrants overall impact on the US economy is small. On the other hand, US employers gain from lower labor costs and the ability to use their land, capital, and technology more productively.

===Health care===
{{further|Healthcare availability for undocumented immigrants in the United States}}
''[[Reuters]]'' reported that illegal immigrants, as well as legal immigrants in the country less than five years, generally are not eligible for [[Medicaid]]. However, they can get Medicaid coverage for health emergencies if they are in a category of people otherwise eligible, such as children, pregnant women, families with dependent children, elderly or disabled individuals, and meet other requirements. The cost of this emergency care was less than 1% of Medicaid costs in North Carolina from 2001–2004 and the majority was for childbirth and related complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-immigrants-idUSN1346120320070313|title=Medicaid spends 1 pct on illegal immigrants: study|date=13 March 2007|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that "Illegal immigrants can get emergency care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor and people with disabilities. But they can't get non-emergency care unless they pay. They are ineligible for most other public benefits."&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Richard|title=Rising health care costs put focus on illegal immigrants|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-01-21-immigrant-healthcare_N.htm|accessdate=11 April 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the U.S. [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] of 1986 ({{usc|42|1395dd}}), most hospitals may not refuse anyone treatment for an emergency medical condition because of [[citizenship]], legal status, or ability to pay. An example of the cost conflict between federal government, state and local government, and private institutions, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] brings injured and ill illegal immigrants to hospital emergency rooms but does not pay for their medical care.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordercounties.org/vertical/Sites/%7BB4A0F1FF-7823-4C95-8D7A-F5E400063C73%7D/uploads/%7B19324764-F50C-4C2D-ABDC-73317A65FC41%7D.DOC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409063347/http://www.bordercounties.org/vertical/Sites/%7BB4A0F1FF-7823-4C95-8D7A-F5E400063C73%7D/uploads/%7B19324764-F50C-4C2D-ABDC-73317A65FC41%7D.DOC |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost $190 million, or about 25 percent, of the uncompensated costs Southwest border county hospitals incurred resulted from emergency medical treatment provided to illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

At least two research studies have been done which attempt to discover the cost of health care for illegal immigrants by asking the illegal themselves.
* A phone survey in which Alexander Ortega and colleagues at the University of California asked illegal immigrants how often they receive medical care reported that illegal immigrants are no more likely to visit the emergency room than native born Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN26407393|title=Illegal immigrants not US health care burden – study|date=26 November 2007|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A RAND study concluded that the total federal cost of providing medical expenses for the 78% illegal immigrants without health insurance coverage was $1.1 billion, with immigrants paying $321 million of [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] out-of-pocket. The study found that illegal immigrants tend to visit physicians less frequently than U.S. citizens because they are younger and because people with chronic health problems are less likely to migrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid%3D56809 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101154933/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=56809 |archivedate=2007-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rand.org/news/press.06/11.14.html|title=News Releases for 2006 – RAND|website=Medicalnewstoday.com|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, studies have also shown that not providing illegal immigrants with a decent healthcare might actually cost the country in the long-run rather than save expenses. In 2000, researchers compared the perinatal outcomes and costs of illegal women with and without prenatal care and inferred the impact of denial of prenatal benefits to illegal immigrants in California. Nearly 10% of illegal women had no prenatal care. These women were nearly 4 times as likely to be delivered of low birth weight infants and more than 7 times as likely to be delivered of premature infants as were illegal women who had prenatal care. For every dollar cut from prenatal care, an increase of $3.33 in the cost of postnatal care and $4.63 in incremental long-term cost were expected. Elimination of publicly funded prenatal care for illegal women could save the state $58 million in direct prenatal care costs but could cost taxpayers as much as $194 million more in postnatal care, resulting in a net cost of $136 million initially and $211 million in long-term costs. Although their parents are illegal immigrants, these children are actually U.S citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, M. C., Lin, Y. G., Prietto, N. M., &amp; Garite, T. J. (2000). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937800705187 Elimination of public funding of prenatal care for illegal immigrants in California: a cost/benefit analysis]. American journal of obstetrics and gynecology, 182(1), 233–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on income inequality===
Economist [[David Card]] wrote in 2009 that immigration (legal and illegal) has a minor impact on [[income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] and wages: "Together these results imply that the impacts of recent immigrant inflows on the relative wages of U.S. natives are small. The effects on overall wage inequality (including natives and immigrants) are larger, reflecting the concentration of immigrants in the tails of the skill distribution and higher residual inequality among immigrants than natives. Even so, immigration accounts for a small share (5%) of the increase in U.S. wage inequality between 1980 and 2000."&lt;ref name="DCard2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w14683|title=Immigration and Inequality|first=David|last=Card|date=1 January 2009|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost-benefit analysis==
[[Aviva Chomsky]], a professor at Salem State College, states that "Early studies in California and in the Southwest and in the Southeast...have come to the same conclusions. Immigrants, legal and illegal, are more likely to pay taxes than they are to use public services. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most public services and live in fear of revealing themselves to government authorities. Households headed by illegal immigrants use less than half the amount of federal services that households headed by documented immigrants or citizens make use of."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Aviva. [https://www.amazon.com/They-Take-Our-Jobs-Immigration/dp/0807041564#reader_0807041564 ''They Take Our Jobs! And Twenty Other Myths about Immigration''] (2007), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Public Radio]] (NPR) wrote in 2006: "Supporters of a crackdown argue that the U.S. economy would benefit if illegal immigrants were to leave, because U.S. employers would be forced to raise wages to attract American workers.  Critics of this approach say the loss of illegal immigrants would stall the U.S. economy, saying illegal workers do many jobs few native-born Americans will do."&lt;ref name="NPR Q&amp;A" /&gt;

Professor of Law Francine Lipman writes that the belief that illegal migrants are exploiting the US economy and that they cost more in services than they contribute to the economy is "undeniably false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J. Lipman, Francine, J. | title=Taxing illegal Immigrants: Separate, Unequal and Without Representation | ssrn=881584 | publisher= The Tax Lawyer| date=Spring 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipman asserts that "illegal immigrants actually contribute more to public coffers in taxes than they cost in social services" and "contribute to the U.S. economy through their investments and consumption of goods and services; filling of millions of essential worker positions resulting in subsidiary job creation, increased productivity and lower costs of goods and services; and unrequited contributions to Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance programs."

===Relative contribution by income tax bracket===
PEW studies on unauthorized immigrants estimates that the average household of 3.1 persons earns about $36,000 per year. This average wage is consistent with the PEW estimate that 49% of illegal immigrants have not graduated from high school.&lt;ref name="pewhispanic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/a-portrait-of-unauthorized-immigrants-in-the-united-states/|title=A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States|first1=Jeffrey S.|last1=Passel|first2=D’Vera|last2=Cohn|date=14 April 2009|website=Pewhispanic.org|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional Budget office (CBO) estimates that people in this salary bracket (the second [[wikt:quintile|quintile]]) pay about 6.8% of their income in Federal taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43373-06-11-HouseholdIncomeandFedTaxes.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009 |website=Cbo.gov |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household in the bottom quintile received $29,015 in benefits and paid $4,251 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the second quintile the average household received $24,709 in benefits and paid $9,524 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the top quintile, the average household received $21,515 in benefits and services and paid $69,704 in Federal, state and local taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/11/how-wealth-is-spread-distribution-of-government-benefits-services-taxes-by-income-quintile-in-us |title=How the Wealth is Spread: The Distribution of Government Benefits, Services and Taxes by Income Quintile in the United States |website=Heritage.org|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear how much benefit the average unauthorized immigrant household is eligible for.

===Heritage Foundation Study===
In 2013, Robert Rector and Jason Richwine of [[The Heritage Foundation]] released a study concluding that as of 2010, the "average unlawful immigrant household" had a net deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $14,387 per household.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer|title=Cost of Unlawful Immigrants to the U.S. Taxpayers|publisher=Heritage Foundation|date=May 6, 2013|authors=Robert Rector and Jason Richwine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the Rector-Richwine report "questioned several assumptions made by the report’s authors—everything from the amount that legalization could boost earnings for immigrants to the amount of welfare they may use."&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Farley|title=The Immigration Bill's '$6.3 Trillion Price Tag'|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2013/06/the-immigration-bills-6-3-trillion-price-tag-2/|publisher=[[Annenberg Public Policy Center]]|website=FactCheck.org|date= June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heritage report purported to project costs over a 50-year period and assumed no changes to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which prompted criticism that the study was overly speculative.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt; The report also counted "the cost of benefits paid to the children of those living in the U.S. illegally, even though many of those children by law are citizens."&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt; The methodology and conclusions of the 2013 Heritage Foundation study were sharply criticized as flawed by, among others, [[Alex Nowrasteh]] of the [[Cato Institute]], [[Doug Holtz-Eakin]] of the [[American Action Forum]], and [[Tim Kane]] at the [[Hudson Institute]]. Nowrasteh wrote that the Heritage report's refusal to account for GDP growth and increased economic productivity from immigration led to "a massive underestimation of the economic benefits of immigration and diminishing estimated tax revenue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nowraseth|first1=Alex|title=Heritage's Flawed Immigration Analysis|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/heritages-flawed-immigration-analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Senator [[Marco Rubio]] of Florida also criticized the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leary|first1=Alex|title=Rubio sharply critical of Heritage study, offers parents as evidence of contribution of immigrants|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014212746/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-sharply-critical-of-heritage-study-offers-parents-as-evidence-of/2119615|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy Study===
The [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] released a report in February 2016, stating that 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States are paying annually an estimated amount of $11.64 billion in state and local taxes, "on average an estimated 8 percent of their incomes."&lt;ref&gt;[Illegal Immigrants' State &amp; Local Tax Contributions], ''Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.''

{{Criminal law}}
In [[criminal law]], property is obtained by '''false pretenses'''{{cref|a}} when the acquisition results from intentional misrepresenting of a past or existing fact.

==Elements==

The elements of false pretenses are:
(1) a false representation
(2) of a material past or existing fact
(3) which the person making the representation knows is false
(4) made for the purpose of causing
(5) and which does cause
(6) the victim to pass title
(7) to his property [3]
False pretenses is a statutory offense in most jurisdictions; subject matter covered by statute varies accordingly, and is not necessarily limited to tangible personal property - some statutes include intangible personal property and services. For example, the North Carolina false pretense statute applies to obtaining "any money, goods, property, services, choses in action, or any other thing of value ..."[4]
Under common law, false pretense is defined as a representation of a present or past fact, which the thief knows to be false, and which he intends will and does cause the victim to pass title of his property. That is, false pretense is the acquisition of title from a victim by fraud or misrepresentation of a material past or present fact.

'''a false representation''' - there must be a description or portrayal of something that is false.  If a person makes a statement about something that he mistakenly believes to be untrue there is no false representation.  For example, if a person represents that the ring is a diamond solitaire when he believes that is in fact made of cubic zirconium he is not guilty of false pretenses if it turns out that the ring was in fact a diamond. The representation must be false at the time title passes. Thus if the representation was false when made but is true at the time title to the property passes there is no crime. For example, representing to a seller that you have funds available in your bank account to pay for the goods when in fact your account has a zero balance is not false pretenses if at the time the transaction takes place adequate funds are present in the account. The representation may be oral or written. The misrepresentation has to be affirmative. A failure to disclose a fact does not fit this misrepresentation in common law, unless there is a fiduciary duty between the thief and victim. Moreover, opinion and puffing are not considered misrepresentation as they color the facts but do not misrepresent them.

'''of a material past or existing fact''' - the representation must relate to a material past or existing fact. A representation concerning a future state of facts is not sufficient. Nor is merely an expression of opinion.

'''which the person making the representation knows is false''' - A mistaken representation about some past or existing state of facts is not sufficient for false pretense.

'''made for the purpose of causing and which does cause''' - It is essential that the victim of the false pretenses must actually be deceived by the misrepresentation: the victim must transfer title to the property in reliance on the representation; and the victim being deceived must be a major (if not the only) reason for the victim's transferring title to the defendant. Simply making a false promise or statement is not sufficient. It is not a defense to false pretenses charge that a reasonable person would not have been deceived by the false representation. No matter how gullible the victim, if he/she was in fact deceived the offense has been committed. On the other hand, the offense requires the victim believe the representation to be true. If the person to whom the representation has been made has doubts or serious misgivings about the truth of the representation but nonetheless goes through with the transaction he has not been deceived - he has basically assumed the risk of a false representation.

'''Title passes''' - False pretense is conventionally referred to as a crime against “title” and "title" must pass from the victim to the perpetrator for the crime to be complete. However, this is not to be taken literally for the simple reason that a person who obtains ownership of property by deceit does not obtain full title to the property; only a voidable title.&lt;ref name="Boyce 1992"&gt;Boyce &amp; Perkins, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (1992) at&lt;/ref&gt; False pretense applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains “title or ownership – or whatever property interest the victim had in the chattel, if it was less than title.”&lt;ref name="Boyce 1992"/&gt; If the victim has an interest is the property less than full title the acquisition of that interest through false representation can be false pretenses unless the only interest the person has is possession of the property.&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000"&gt;Lafave, Criminal Law 3rd ed. (West 2000) Sec.&lt;/ref&gt; In such case the crime would be larceny by trick rather than false pretenses.&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000"/&gt; Larceny by Trick also applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains possession only, with the victim retaining ownership or some superior interest in the chattel.[5] Determining whether the victim obtained title or possession can present problems. Generally a sell or conditional sell is sufficient to pass title for purposes of false pretenses whereas lending property does not involve a transfer of title. Note that if property is falsely obtained for a specific purpose - for example money to buy a car that does not exist - the crime is larceny by trick rather than false pretenses because the victim intended to pass title to the money only upon completion of the transaction; until such time the victim intended to deliver possession only.&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000"/&gt;
The essential distinction between false pretenses and larceny and embezzlement is that false pretenses requires that the victim pass title to the defendant whereas the other offenses do not.
The determination as to whether the offense is larceny or false pretenses can have significant effect on the ability of true owner to reclaim the appropriated property. If false pretenses, a bona fide purchaser for value would acquire title superior to the victim; whereas, if the crime is larceny a purchaser from the wrongdoer, bona fide or otherwise, would not acquire any title to the property and would have to return the property to the victim.

== United States ==

[[United States]] statutes on this subject are mainly copied from the English statutes, and the courts there in a general way follow the English interpretations.  The statutes of each state must be consulted.  Under federal law, obtaining money or property through false pretenses as part of a scheme or artifice to defraud, and using means of interstate commerce such as a telephone, is illegal under title 18 USC section 1343; the crime is usually referred to as "Wire Fraud."  There are Federal laws providing penalties for false personation of the lawful owner of public stocks, &amp;c., or of persons entitled to pensions, prize money, &amp;c.,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Rev. Stats. 5435&lt;/ref&gt; or the false making of any order purporting to be a [[money order]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Rev. Stats. 5463&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

== United Kingdom ==

'''False pretences''' as a concept in the [[criminal law]] is no longer used in [[English law]]. It used to refer to the means whereby the [[defendant]] obtained any [[Personal property|chattel]], money or valuable security from any other person with intent to defraud, indictable as a [[misdemeanour]] under the Larceny Act 1861 as amended by the Larceny Act 1916. The modern concept is a [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]] and it is used as the common basis of the ''[[actus reus]]'' (the [[Latin]] for "guilty act") in the deception offences under the [[Theft Act 1968]] and in the [[Theft Act 1978]]. The [[Fraud Act 2006]] repealed these latter two Acts and replaced deception offences with other offences.

===History===
The three major theft offences were [[larceny]], [[embezzlement]] and false pretences. Larceny was a common law offence (created by judicial action) while embezzlement and false pretences were statutory offences (created by legislative action). Larceny is by far the oldest. The elements of larceny were "well-settled" by the thirteenth century. The only other theft offence then existing was cheat which was a misdemeanor. Cheat was a primitive version of the crime of false pretences and involved obtaining property by the use of false weights or measures. In 1541 a statute was enacted by Parliament that made it a misdemeanor to obtain property by a false token or a counterfeit letter "made in any other man’s name."&lt;ref name="LaFave"&gt;LaFave, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (West 2000) 828 n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This statute did not cover obtaining property by the use false spoken words.&lt;ref name="LaFave" /&gt; The first "modern" false pretence statute was enacted by Parliament in 1757.&lt;ref name="LaFave" /&gt; The statute prohibited obtaining "money, goods, wares, or merchandise" by "false pretence."&lt;ref name="LaFave" /&gt; The first general embezzlement statute was enacted by Parliament in 1799.&lt;ref name="LaFave, Criminal Law 2000"/&gt;

The broad distinction between this offence and [[larceny]] is that in the former the owner intends to part with his property, in the latter he does not.  This offence dates as a statutory crime practically from 1756.  At [[common law]] the only remedy originally available for an owner who had been deprived of his goods by fraud was an indictment for the crime of cheating, or a civil action for deceit.  These remedies were insufficient to cover all cases where money or other properties had been obtained by false pretences, and the offence was first partially created by a statute of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (1541), which enacted that if any person should falsely and deceitfully obtain any money, goods, &amp;c., by means of any false token or counterfeit letter made in any other man's name, the offender should suffer any punishment other than death, at the discretion of the judge.  The scope of the offence was enlarged to include practically all false pretences by the Act of 1756, the provisions of which were embodied in the [[Larceny Act 1861]].

The pretence must be a false pretence of some existing fact, made for the purpose of inducing the prosecutor to part with his property (e.g. it was held not to be a false pretence to promise to pay for goods on delivery), and it may be by either words or conduct.  The property, too, must have been actually obtained by the false pretence.  The owner must be induced by the pretence to make over the absolute and immediate ownership of the goods, otherwise it is larceny by means of a trick.  It is not always easy, however, to draw a distinction between the various classes of offences.  In the case where a man goes into a restaurant and orders a meal, and, after consuming it, says that he has no means of paying for it, it was usual to convict for obtaining food by false pretences.  But in ''R v Jones'' {{Oscola|PROP|1898|1|QB|119||}}, an English court found that it is neither larceny nor false pretences, but an offence under the [[Debtors Act 1869]], of obtaining credit by fraud.

''R v Danger''&lt;ref&gt;R v Danger (1857) Dears &amp; B 307, (1857) 26 LJMC 185, (1857) 29 LT (OS) 268, (1857) 21 JP 403, (1857) 3 Jur NS 1011, (1857) 5 WR 738, (1857) 7 Cox 303, [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved|CCR]]&lt;/ref&gt; revealed a [[Lacuna (law)|lacuna]] in the law. This was remedied by section 90 of the [[Larceny Act 1861]]. That section was replaced by section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward 1978. page 173"&gt;Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Fifth Edition. Sweet and Maxwell. 1986. Paragraph 10-15 at page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Fitzjames Stephen|Stephen, James Fitzjames]]. Digest of the Criminal Law. Ninth Edition. Page 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 32 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]] read:

{{Blockquote|Every person who by any false pretence-
:(1) with intent to defraud, obtains from any other person any chattel, money, or valuable security, or causes or procures any money to be paid, or any chattel or valuable security to be delivered to himself or to any other person for the use or benefit or on account of himself or any other person; or
:(2) with intent to defraud or injure any other person, fraudulently causes or induces any other person-
::(a) to execute, make, accept, endorse, or destroy the whole or any part of any valuable security; or
::(b) to write, impress, or affix his name or the name of any other person, or the seal of any body corporate or society, upon any paper or parchment in order that the same may be afterwards made or converted into, or used or dealt with as, a valuable security
shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years.}}

The offence of '''obtaining by false pretences''', contrary to section 32(1) of the [[Larceny Act 1916]], was replaced by the offence of [[obtaining property by deception]], contrary to section 15 of the [[Theft Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Fifth Edition. Sweet and Maxwell. 1986. Paragraph 6-02 and note 2 at page 117. Paragraph 6-08 and note 15 at page 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916 was replaced by section 20(2) of the Theft Act 1968.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward 1978. page 173"/&gt;

==Notes==
*{{cnote|a|The use of the word "pretenses" here is perhaps slightly confusing to a modern reader since "pretense", in the modern sense of the word, is the conscious creation of fiction, but in the former sense of the word, as it was borrowed from the [[French language]], it simply meant "claim" or sometimes "belief". See also [[Pretender]] for another case of confusion on this point. In certain other cases, the distinction between the two definitions affects the meaning only slightly, as in "John pretends to a great knowledge of world history", which to the speaker clearly refers to something untrue, but more in the nature of wishful thinking on the part of John himself than a lie as [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] would define it (requiring the liar to be conscious of the untruth).}}

The '''George Enescu Festival''' (also known as '''George Enescu International Festival and Competition'''), held in honor of the celebrated Romanian composer [[George Enescu]], is the biggest [[classical music]] festival and classical international competition held in [[Romania]] and one of the biggest in [[Eastern Europe]]. Enescu's close associate [[George Georgescu]] organized the first festival in 1958; highlights included a performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Double Violin Concerto (Bach)|Concerto for Two Violins]] with Yehudi Menuhin and David Oistrakh as soloists and a staging of Enescu's sole opera, ''[[Œdipe (opera)|Œdipe]]'', with [[Constantin Silvestri]] conducting.&lt;ref name=Fani&gt;[http://souvenirsdescarpates.blogspot.com/2007/12/george-georgescu.html Alain Chotil-Fani: ''Danube to Bucharest'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The official opening day of the Enescu Festival took place on 4 September 1958, merely three years after George Enescu's death. Among the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the festival were performers such as David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi.  On 22 September of the same year, the national premiere of George Enescu's lyrical tragedy "Oedipe" took place, starring a young David Ohanesian in the lead role. This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by: Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub).

Violinist, teacher, conductor and composer, worldwide  known for his lush opera composition ''Oedipe'', George Enescu presented his first work as a composer with the Collonne Orchestra in Paris, 1898;  he also performed as a conductor at prestigious Carnegie Hall (NY).  George Enescu was also the teacher of one of the greatest violinists of the past century – Lord Yehudi Menuhin. Their bond was so strong that in 1995, Menuhin accepted the invitation to come to Romania to open the George Enescu International Festival. Menuhin also accepted to be the President of Honor of the Enescu Festival in 1998, though his schedule as a soloist was full up to 2003. 

Today, an average of around 20 works by Romanian composer George Enescu are interpreted in the Enescu Festival each edition. The 2015 edition of the Enescu Festival (30 August – 20 September 2015 Bucharest) brings on stage interpretations from Enescu's works by record-breaking German violinist David Garrett, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (Pulitzer Prize for Music), or Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta. Highlights of this edition of the Festival also include violinist  Anne-Sophie Mutter, Berliner Philharmoniker, London Symphony Orchestra and Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra. 

The concerts are held in three different venues in [[Bucharest]], [[Iaşi]] and [[Sibiu]]. The 2007 presentations ended with a performance of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' before an audience of over 4,000 at the [[Sala Palatului]].

The competition portion of the Festival lasts about a week, and it consists of three different categories: composition (118 participants in 2007), piano (44 in 2007), and violin (41 in 2007), each a record number of participants.

In the 2005 and 2007 presentations a daily open-air concert was added to the festival program. It is known as the ''Festival Piazza'' and features 3½ hours of classical music, in addition to  movies about the life of George Enescu.

== History ==

=== 1958 - First edition ===
The official opening day of the festival took place on 4 September 1958, merely three years after George Enescu's death, thus marking the official debut of the most important international musical manifestation hosted by Romania. The festival was meant to occur once every three years, being accompanied by an international competition, that was interrupted after the 5th edition, only to be reintroduced in the festival in 1991.

Among the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the show were performers such as Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi.

On 22 September of the same year, the national premiere of George Enescu's lyrical tragedy "Oedipe" took place, starring a young David Ohanesian in the lead role. This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by: Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub).

=== 1961 - Second edition ===
Compared to the first one, the second edition paid much more attention to repertoires from the lyrical theatre and vocal art. This initiative was supported by several renowned soloists such as Dimitr Uzunov, Ivan Petrov and Anton Dermota. Five lyrical spectacles were presented by the Bucharest Theatre of Opera and Ballet: « Oedipe » by George Enescu, «Boris Godunov » by Modest Mussorgski, « Fidelio » by Ludwig van Beethoven, « Othello » by Giuseppe Verdi and « O Noapte Furtunoasă » by Paul Constantinescu, alongside two ballet acts in the forms of « La Piata » by Mihai Jora and « Priculiciul » by Zeno Vancea.

For the first time, there were opened three new concert halls: the Grand Hall of the Palace, the Small Hall of the Palace (now the Auditorium Hall) and the Concert Studio of the Romanian Radiotelevision (now the Mihail Jora Concert Studio).

In this edition participated the following: Sviatoslav Richter, Aldo Ciccolini, Leonid Kogan, Henryk Szeryng, Valentin Gheorghiu, Ştefan Gheorghiu, Vladimir Orlov, Radu Aldulescu, Ion Voicu, Sir John Barbirolli (his second time at the George Enescu Festival), Lorin Maazel, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski with George Georgescu, Mircea Cristescu, Mircea Basarab, Iosif Conta and Mihai Brediceanu.

=== 1964 – The Third Edition ===
The third edition debuted with a regrettable event – the death of the conductor George Georgescu, a few days after the beginning of the international event, depriving the Romanian stage of an indisputable artist.

The success of the previous editions was reconfirmed in 1964 mainly by the presence of exceptional international artists such as: Arthur Rubinstein, Henryk Szering, Gaspar Cassado, Monique Haas, Miroslav Ceangalovici, André Navarra, André Cluytens, Herbert von Karajan, Zubin Mehta and John Pritchard. Beside them there were also Romanian artists such as Valentin and Ştefan Gheorghiu, Ştefan Ruha, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Vladimir Orlov, Mircea Basarab and Mihai Brediceanu.

It was an edition of first auditions, among the most important being the interpretations of the poem Vox Maris (by the Radiotelevision Orchestra, conducted by Iosif Conta) and the Piano Quartet no. 1, both signed by George Enescu.

=== 1967 – 4th Edition ===
During the 1967 festival, a great importance was given again to promoting both Enescian music and Romanian contemporary creations. It was one of the editions when the highest number of George Enescu's musical pieces was auditioned (12) and when 18 Romanian composers were included in the concert programs.

This edition also brought the first world audition of the Enescian creation: "Trio in A minor for violin, cello and piano". Other important first auditions were: "String Quartet No. 2" by Mihail Jora, "String Quartet No. 7" by Wilhelm Berger and "Scene nocturne" by Anatol Vieru.

Besides the presence of Romanian orchestras and artists (Valentin Gheorghiu, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Mircea Basarab, Constantin Bugeanu and Antonin Ciolan, the "George Enescu" Philharmonic Orchestra, the Radiotelevision Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra in Cluj, the Madrigal Choir, the "George Enescu" Quintet or the "Muzica Quartet"), international performers or ensembles were also present, such as Los Angeles Philharmonic, Moscow State Philharmonic, Grand Paris Opera Ballet, Czech Nonet and Tatrai Quartet. These ones and other artists such as Van Cliburn, Isaac Stern, Claire Bernard, Friedrich Gulda, David Oistrah, Mstislav Rostropovich, Zubin Mehta, Kiril Kondrashin and Kurt Masur have filled the concert halls once again.

=== 1970 – 5th Edition ===
Due to the Beethoven bicentenary, an initial characteristic of this edition was the massive presence of the creation of Bonn titan – 12 works interpreted – during the festival.

According to this and considering Enescu's affinity for the great classic, the Research Sector of the History of Art Institute, part of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences and the "George Enescu" Studies Center organized a round table with the theme "George Enescu and the Beethovian tradition".

The international personalities who performed in 1970 on the Bucharest stages were Paul Badura- Skoda, Gyorgy Cziffra, Henryk Szeryng, Mstislav Rostropovich, Nicanor Zabaletta, Jean Pierre Rampal, who replaced Valentin Gheorghiu (who became unavailable in the last minute), Virginia Zeani, Paul Klecky and André Previn. If in the previous editions the range of instruments was reduced to piano, violin and cello, during this edition a greater variety was observed, by inviting the most notable harpist of the time, Nicanor Zabaletta, and the legendary flautist Jean Pierre Rampal.

Probably the most important symphonic ensemble was the London Symphony Orchestra for which the Palace Grand Hall proved to be too small. Besides these two, other orchestras were also present such as the Opera and Ballet Theatre Orchestra in Leningrad, the Bach Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig and other chamber orchestras, such as the [[Juilliard]] American Quintet and the Gasparo da Salo Chamber Orchestra.

=== 1973 – 6th Edition ===
The sixth edition of the International Festival "George Enescu" was reduced to only one week, due to the discomfort presented by the political authorities, who considered an artistic manifestation of this kind to be a useless investment.

Among the international soloists and conductors present this year were: Leonid Kogan, who replaced Sviatoslav Richter, who was supposed to perform in the opening concert, Yehudi Menuhin, Philippe Entremont, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski and Radmila Bakocevici.

Artists were invited exclusively on political criteria, most of them coming from socialist countries or from the ones sympathizing with the doctrine of the communist government. Three from the five international orchestras come from the communist countries.

=== 1976 – 7th Edition ===
This year, the Festival did not include a competition and an organizing committee. Also, the International Musicology Symposium did not benefit from the participation of international researchers, becoming a national symposium.

The soloists and the orchestras invited to participate in the festival were again selected based on political criteria. Among the notable international personalities, the Romanian public could attend the concerts of Pierre Cochereau, Christian Ferras, Grace Bumbry, Victoria de Los Angeles and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, three years before the retirement of the great artist.

There were four international ensembles present: the Hungarian Symphony Radiotelevision Orchestra in Budapest, the Madrigals in Belgrad, Moscow Chamber Orchestra and the "Studio der Frühen Musik" Vocal-Instrumental Quartet.

Among the Romanian artists could be mention: Radu Lupu, Ştefan Ruha, Ludovic Bacs, Mircea Basarab, Mihai Brediceanu, Iosif Conta, Emil Simion and Cornel Trăilescu.

=== 1979 – 8th Edition ===
The Festival « George Enescu » was becoming rather a national manifestation, as a shadow of the Competition "Cântarea României", which could thus celebrate its laureates at an international artistic level. Despite this drawback, this year's edition had a few remarkable guests, such as Nikita Magaloff, Viktor Tretiakov, Ludwig Hölscher and Sheila Armstrong.

The international instrumental ensembles that came to Bucharest had a chamber music repertoire (Deutsche Kammerakademie, the Sextet Gabrielli Brass Ensemble and the Contemporary Music Atelier in Poland). A novelty was the presence of two choreographical ensembles: Alvin Ailey Ballet Company from the US and Miyagi Minoru Traditional Dance Troupe from Japan.

=== 1981 – 9th Edition ===
Although the organizers did not dispose of great funds, they made efforts to start this edition, with the occasion of the 100 years anniversary from the birth of George Enescu.

Some of the international personalities present were: Annerose Schmidt, François Joël Thiollier, Vladimir Spivakov, Emil Ceakarov, Isaac Karabtchiewisky and Herbert Kegel.

Three of the seven musical troupes present in the festival were choreographical ensembles: Eurythmeum Troupe from Stuttgart, Lar Lubovitch Company and Sopianae Ballet Company.

The critics had very good reviews for the Great Academic Theatre Ensemble of URSS which performed "The Queen of Spades" and "Iolanta" by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky and "Mozart and Salieri" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, along with other famous pieces of the Russian, Italian and French romantic lyrical repertoire.

From the Romanian personalities present at the festival we mention: Valentin Gheorghiu, Dan Grigore, Radu Lupu, Ion Voicu and many names of the lyrical stage such as: Victoria Mann, Emilia Petrescu, Mihaela Agachi, Ionel Pantea, Florin Diaconescu.

=== 1985 – 10th Edition ===
An unprecedented number of Romanian creations was registered at the 10th edition, being interpreted 80 contemporary works, an impressive number, considering that in the program were included only 76 Romanian composers.

The Enescian creation was also generously represented, 25 works were interpreted, the highest number registered until then. Highly appreciated interpretations of the Enescian works were performed, among others, by Cristian Mandeal ("Third Suite") and Ion Baciu ("Second Symphony").

Internationally reputed interprets performing in the Festival were: Viktor Tretiakov, Siegfried Lorenz, Herbert Kaliga, Rudolf Innig, Jose Miguel Moreno Aguado and Jean Perisson. There were only two international instrumental ensembles in this edition, due to limited funds, the Dolezal Quartet from Czechoslovakia and Brodsky Quartet from Great Britain.

=== 1988 – XI Edition ===
The 1988 edition took place during the Romanian Antheneum Centenary. Also, 120 years from the foundation of the "George Enescu" Philharmonic was celebrated that year.

From the peak of the interpretative moments of George Enescu's creation we mention: "Symphony I" conductor Mihai Brediceanu, "Vox Maris" symphonic poem conducted by Iosif Conta, "Rapsody I" conducted by Yekoslav Sutej and "Two Intermezzi for String Orchestra" – Târgu-Mureș Chamber Orchestra.

The international personalities who participated in this edition were [[Georges Pludermacher]], Michael Roll, Levon Ambartumian and Ferdinang Klinda.

During the festival, original moments were offered by Alexander Rudin, present both as a pianist and a cellist, in two concerts by J. Haydn and the French conductor Francoise Legrande.

=== 1991 – XII Edition ===
Starting with this edition, the first after the events of December 1989, the International Festival "George Enescu" begins to recapture its former glory.

The combined efforts of the organizing institutions succeeded to bring to Bucharest international renowned guests. It was a new beginning, which resulted, in the coming editions, in an array of famous international music names.

From the guest artists we mention: Mathias Weber, Jean Francois Antionioli, Gerhard Oppitz, Teiko MaMaehashi, Carlos Paita, Levon Ambartumian and Michiyoshi Inoue.

[[Yolanda Marculescu]], who had been the prima dona of the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera of Bucharest]] from 1948 to 1968, was invited to return to Romania as a juror in 1991.&lt;ref name="Faculty Document #1865"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duvall|first1=William|last2=Goodberg|first2=Robert| last3=LaBruce|first3=Evelyn|last4=Nelson |first4=Daniel|title=Memorial Resolution for Professor Yolanda Marculescu|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/secu/facdocs/1865.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=11 January 2016|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=22 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theatre of Classical Ballet from Kiev, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Percussionists from Hague, the Saint Martin in the Fields Chamber Orchestra, Rheinisches Barocktrio, and Concerto Averna from Warsaw were the international ensembles present in the festival.A distinctive feature of this festival was the presence of works such as "Missa Brevis" by Joseph Haydn, "Requiem" by Mozart, "Palestrina Missa Brevis" operas impossible to interpret in the communist era.

=== 1995 – 13th Edition ===
The allocated funds, the facilities and the authorities’ desire to create a new international image of Romania in the 90's, led to organizing the 13th edition at incredible high standards. Thus, through the Government's Decision nr. 364/30 from 1995, the amount of 2.690.488 RON (approx. $2 million) was approved for organizing the festival, to which the financial support of the Romanian Radiotelevision Society was added.

Important international names participated in this edition, such as: Lord Yehudi Menuhin, Lorin Maazel, Georges Pretre, Zubin Mehta, Yuri Temirkanov, Roberto Benzi, Sergiu Comissiona, Alberto Lissy, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Jean Pierre Rampal, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Saint Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Radio Television Orchestra in Madrid, along with the most important Romanian soloists and instrumental and vocal ensembles.

One of the most controversial moments of this edition was the putting in stage of George Enescu's opera "Oedipe" by Andrei Şerban. In this version, the key role was interpreted by two soloists: Sever Barnea – young Oedipe and Nicolae Urdareanu – old Oedipe. Andrei Şerban gave the spectacle strong political connotations, which led to inevitable reactions.

=== 1998 – 14th Edition ===
In 1998, the anniversary of 40 years from the first International Festival « George Enescu » was celebrated. Complementary activities took place in the same time with the international event: recitals and concerts performed during the series "Romanian Music of the 20th century" (with the support of the National Radio Orchestra and the ensembles Archaeus, Concordia, Contraste, Romantica, Trio Modus), series entitled "Bach by Midnight", the International Seminar "George Enescu and the music of the 20th century" and the International Seminar I.A.M.A. with the theme "Development Directions of Managerial Cultural Exchanges".

Twelve international music troupes participated in this year's edition: the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Chicago, the Tonhalle Zurich Orchestra, the French National Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Koln, the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, The Budapest Festival Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Virtuosi Orchestra, The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome, the Kremarata Baltika Chamber Orchestra and the Alban Berg Quartet.

From the interprets and soloists present we mention: Viktoria Mullova, Gidon Kremer, Misha Maisky, Peter Donhoe, Peter Zimmermann, Shlomo Minz, Barbara Hendricks, Vladimir Spivakov, Yan Pascal Tortellier, Lawrence Foster, Daniel Barenboim, Lord Yehudi Menuhin, for the last time in front of the Romanian public, the maestro passed the following year.

=== 2001 – 15th Edition ===
The 2001 edition was by far the richest and most glamorous of all 15 editions of the festival. A lot of prestigious international artists performed on the Bucharest stages during the three-week festival. Among the participants of the 15th edition were: Helene Grimaud, Vasko Vasiliev, Jean-Phillippe Collard, Rudolf Buchbinder, Maurice Andre, Maxim Vengerov, Pierre Amoyal, Isabelle Faust, Christian Zacharias, Cristoph Eschenbach, Laurent Petitgrard, Kurt Masur, Claus Peter Flor, Alexandros Myrat, Michel Plasson, Seiji Ozawa, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Leopold Hager, Sakari Oramo and Riccardo Mutti.

Beside these world-renowned personalities were prestigious instrumental ensembles such as: the Paris Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Russian State Symphony Chapel, the Hamburg Radio Orchestra, Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Penderecki Festival Orchestra, Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne, London Chamber Orchestra, „Sine Nomine" Quartet.

The "By Midnight" concert series continued in this edition starting with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 17 operas were interpreted.

=== 2003 – 16th Edition ===
The organizers concentrated on promoting the contemporary Romanian creations, through the series entitled "Romanian Music of the 20th Century", during which important operas could be listened to, signed mostly by the most appreciated and prestigious Romanian composers.

The International Contest « George Enescu » was organized a week before the Festival, allowing the finale and the Gala Concert to be included in the festival program. Similar to the precedent edition, the series "Midnight Concerts" continued, this year's focus being on Ludwig van Beethoven ("Beethoven by Midnight"), 26 of his works being interpreted.

In 2003, there was an initiative to organize concerts in the Festival Market, idea which continued in the following editions. Therefore, the International Festival "George Enescu" symbolically greeted potential audiences, facilitating the access to classical music to those unfamiliar with the genre.

The artistic excellence of the participants was confirmed also during this edition, when 11 international symphony orchestras performed, with Sir Collin Davis as conductor, the Orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (conducted by Zubin Mehta, a familiar presence in the program of the International Festival "George Enescu"), the Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome (with Myung Whun Chung as conductor), the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by Leif Segerstam), the Royal Stockholm Orchestra (conducted by Alain Gilbert) or the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Vladimir Fedoseev). The public could also see perform the Gulbenkian Orchestra from Lisbon or the Britten Sinfonia Ensemble from Great Britain.

=== 2005 – 17th Edition ===
The 2005 edition was organized for the commemoration of 50 years from the passing of the great composer. The objectives were to present and promote the Enescian creation to the prestigious artists invited, to promote the contemporary Romanian creations, to include the precedent editions laureates in the festival program and to open the festival to a jazz repertoire.

As a premier, for this edition there were presented three important elements: Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos and orchestral suites, performed by King's Consort ensemble and Ludwig van Beethoven's concertos for piano, with Christian Zacharias as soloist. Besides King's Consort ensemble and Christian Zacharias, in this edition also participated: Kirov Theatre Symphony Orchestra with conductor Valery Gergiev, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta, and Nigel Kennedy.

=== 2007 – 18th Edition ===
This edition's pleasant surprises were offered by the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Murray Perahia, Martha Argerich, Trio Beaux Arts and the violinist Joshua Bell who replaced Maxim Vegherov (unavailable). The absence of the masterpiece "Oedipe" on the festival banners was criticized.

Similar to the precedent edition, the variety of the repertoire can be noticed, great symphony hits or concerts were accompanied by other names, some of them quasi-famous to the large audience, coming from either the areas of old music, or from the most innovative areas of the contemporary music. This change is due to the type of ensembles invited, some of them being specialized in interpreting historical repertoires and others in contemporary ones.

George Enescu's compositions were also present in this year's program.

=== 2009 – 19th Edition ===
The debut at the end of August was a premiere for this edition, which had seven musical themed directions (« Romanian Contemporary Creation », « Enescu and His Contemporaries », « Midnight Concerts », « Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation », « Opera and Ballet », « Great Orchestras » and « Chamber Concerts ») and a long and consistent program. The complexity of the repertoire, a feature of the previous festival editions, reached its peak this year.

The fact that in 2007, "Oedipe" opera was not included on the festival banners led to criticism, therefore, this year's edition debuted with this spectacle, a co-production of the Capitole Theatre in Toulouse and the Romanian Opera in Bucharest.

The commemoration of 200 years from the passing of Joseph Haydn in 2009, concluded in Haydn being the second composer in the top of works included in the festival program.

The Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Christian Zacharias performed the music of the great Austrian maestro for three evenings, and was joined by the Ensemble le Musiciens du Loubre, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and the Munich Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra.

The novelty of this edition was the concert series "Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation" as an alternative for jazz and world music lovers. From this series concert we mention Uri Caine and his troupe, Florin Răducanu.

=== 2011 - The 20th Edition ===

The '''Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump''' was a meeting arranged by two professors at the University of Toronto in December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump {{!}} Faculty of Information (iSchool) {{!}} University of Toronto|url=https://ischool.utoronto.ca/content/guerrilla-archiving-event-saving-environmental-data-trump|website=ischool.utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto group wants to save science and climate change data from Trump with internet archiving {{!}} Metro Toronto|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2016/12/13/toronto-group-to-save-science-data-from-trump-.html|work=metronews.ca|date=13 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to pre-emptively preserve US government climate data from possible deletion by the [[Trump Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Academics are in a 'race against time' to protect climate science from Donald Trump|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/protect-climate-science-data-donald-trump-542416|work=Newsweek|date=15 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists are Racing to Save Climate Data Fearing Trump Administration|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-racing-save-climate-data-210038533.html|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

During his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|run for presidency]], President Trump had expressed, in various occasions, [[climate change denialism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foran|first1=Clare|title=Donald Trump and the Triumph of Climate Denial|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/donald-trump-climate-change-skeptic-denial/510359/|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the [[climate change]] as Chinese hoax "in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive", and voiced his hostility towards [[climate science]] and [[Paris climate agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Edward|title=Trump Has Called Climate Change a Chinese Hoax. Beijing Says It Is Anything But.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/world/asia/china-trump-climate-change.html|work=The New York Times|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump would 'cancel' Paris climate deal|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36401174|work=BBC News|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 2016, a prominent climate change sceptic, [[Scott Pruitt]] was selected as a new administrator of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Donald Trump picks climate change sceptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/trump-scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency|work=The Guardian|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proceeding had raised concerns among academic community that the [[scientific opinion on climate change]] might be suppressed during Trump's presidency. Indeed, according to Reuters sources, in 25 January 2017, Trump's administration instructed [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to remove climate change page from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump administration tells EPA to cut climate page from website: sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G|work=Reuters|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
Fearing for possible deletion, or alteration of the US government websites containing the government climate data, as happened in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;xxx&lt;/ref&gt; people from various academic backgrounds and training such as coders, environmental scientists, social scientists, archivists, and librarians gathered together in order to save US government websites at risk of changing or disappearing during or after government transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U of T Hosts Successful Climate Data Archiving Event|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2017/01/08/u-of-t-hosts-successful-climate-data-archiving-event/|work=The Varsity|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/|work=Washington Post|date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event collaborated with the [[Internet Archive]]'s End of Term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto 'guerrilla' archivists to help preserve US climate data|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38324045|work=BBC News|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Peter|title=University of Toronto professors ‘race against time’ to save environmental data ahead of Donald Trump presidency|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3133382/university-of-toronto-professors-race-against-time-to-save-environmental-data-ahead-of-donald-trump-presidency/|work=Global News|date=17 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits''''' is a 2005 novel by [[Morocco|Moroccan]] American author [[Laila Lalami]]. First published in the United States, it offers a wider view of the immigration phenomenon from North Africa to Europe. The novel was inspired by a story that Lalami read in ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref name = Marchi/&gt;

==Plot summary==

A group of young Moroccan immigrants seeking a better life in Spain cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on a lifeboat. When it capsizes near shore, it is everyone for themselves.  The book then chronicles the lives of four of the passengers, Murad, Halima, Aziz and Faten, exploring their lives before the trip and what motivated their attempt at immigration.

==Themes==
The novel sets up an empathy for the situations which create the need for migration; as critic Lisa Marchi points out, the novel "highlights the economic precarity, social invisibility, and indisputable vulnerability of the migrants".&lt;ref name = Marchi&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1528-4212| volume = 51| issue = 4| pages = 603–626| last = Marchi| first = Lisa| title = Ghosts, Guests, Hosts: Rethinking "Illegal" Migration and Hospitality Through Arab Diasporic Literature| journal = Comparative Literature Studies| date = 2014| url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/comparative_literature_studies/v051/51.4.marchi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel also complicates the nature of the "Muslim" identity of many of these immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Reception==
When describing the novel, critic Lisa Marchi said it's "wisely constructed: the writer confidently travels between temporal settings and geographical zones to gradually unveil the genealogy of each character’s migratory project".&lt;ref name = Marchi/&gt;

[[Makar Sankranti]] celebrated in other parts of Indian subcontinent by Hindus, is known as Maghi in Punjab&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and is always on the first day of the month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] in [[Bikrami calendar]]. On Maghi, when the sun takes its northern journey on entering the sign of Makara or Capricorn, the Hindus take bath in the Ganges or if that is not possible, in some other river, rivulet, canal or pond.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1O0eAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=maghi+punjab+bathing+rivers&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ganges Census of India, 1961: Punjab.

Maghi is celebrated by people eating [[kheer]] such as Rauh di kheer which is an old dish where rice is cooked in sugarcane juice.

'''Meadow Brook Hall''' is a [[Tudor revival]] style mansion located at 480 South Adams Road in [[Rochester Hills, Michigan]]. It was built between 1926 and 1929 by [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]] (the widow of auto pioneer [[John Francis Dodge]]) and her second husband, lumber broker Alfred G. Wilson. In 1957, the mansion and the surrounding property and buildings were donated to the State of Michigan in order to fund Michigan State University–Oakland, now known as [[Oakland University]]. In 2012, it was named a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite web| title=National Historic Landmarks: 13 New Sites Designated| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/national-historic-landmar_n_1326444.html#s760456&amp;title=Meadow_Brook_Hall| publisher=[[Huffington Post]]| date=7 March 2012| accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Meadow Brook Farms originally belonged to Matilda's first husband, automotive tycoon John F. Dodge. He purchased the property along with the large white farmhouse off of Adams Road as a holiday retreat for his family. The mansion is located on a {{convert|1443|acre|km2|sing=on}} estate off South Adams Road; Dodge added a nine-hole golf course, some of the holes of which still follow the current [[Katke-Cousins]] 18-hole course on the property. Meadow Brook Hall was constructed between 1926 and 1929 by Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, Alfred Wilson at a cost of $4 million.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lavey |first1=Kathleen |title=Check out these 5 Michigan castles |url=https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/travel/michigan/2016/01/07/check-michigan-castles/78414678/ |accessdate=24 August 2018 |newspaper=Times Herald |location=Port Huron, Michigan |date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her lifetime, Matilda resided in the hall for over forty years. Some of the family's time was spent vacationing at their summer home in Bar Harbor, Maine and winter home in Scottsdale, Arizona. The hall was also partially closed for a brief time during the depth of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Colman |first1=Justin |title=Meadow Brook Hall receives national landmark recognition |url=https://oaklandpostonline.com/6269/news/meadow-brook-hall-receives-national-landmark-recognition/ |newspaper=[[The Oakland Post (Michigan)|The Oakland Post]] |accessdate=24 August 2018 |date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Claw''', in Norwegian known as '''Lillehammer-kuppet''' was a joint Swedish-American operation, with Norwegian support,&lt;ref name=Lillehammer02&gt;"The day after the message of the German capitulation in Norway arrived, a Tuesday,  Törneman arrived on request from Petersén  around one PM. With Petersén was the Norwegian major Dahl, then chief of the Norwegian intelligence office in Stockholm. At the visit there were stated a wish for Törneman to travel to Lillehammer and there take contact with Sala and from him receive certain content. More was not said of that part, and to Stockholm transfer this content and also as much content as Törneman could get his hands on from the German staff at Lillehammer. Törneman were promised assistance from available Norwegian personnel and he selected a Lieutenant Sjetne and Hans Peter Eggen.", statement by Törneman in 1948, from the radio program ''Den mystiska kofferten från Lillehammer'', from 21:05 in the recording&lt;/ref&gt; that was carried out at [[Lillehammer]] shortly after the [[Victory in Europe Day|German capitulation]] by the end of [[World War II]]. Thirty-five German [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] specialists were transferred along with various equipment first to Sweden and then to U.S. camps in occupied Germany through an agreement between the Americans and the German High Command of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Norway.

The intelligence material from Operation Claw, among it a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] codebook, became very useful for the Americans during the [[Cold War]]. Operation Claw was controversial both when it happened and afterwards. In 1945, it was controversial that the Americans operated in what was seen as a British controlled country, and that they secured information about its ally the Soviet Union, in cooperation with neutral Sweden. In later years,  a hypothesis that the Norwegian [[Milorg|resistance fighter]] [[Kai Holst]]'s sudden death in June 1945 was related to his involvement in the Operation Claw has been put forward by among others the historian [[Tore Pryser]].

== Background ==
Even before the war in Europe ended the various [[Allies of World War II|allied states]] had begun the search for German scientists and other German expertise.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Bower |first=Tom |authorlink= |year=1987 |title=The paperclip conspiracy : the battle for the spoils and secrets of Nazi Germany |publisher=M. Joseph | location= London | isbn= 0-7181-2744-7  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Signals intelligence]] had been vital during World War II and especially the British work with breaking the German codes, from the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] had been of huge importance.&lt;ref name="engima_cryptographic_mathematics"&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last= Miller|first=A. Ray|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2001|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945 had revealed conflicts of interest between the western allied nations on one side and the Soviet Union and the relation was severely strained.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Gaddis |first=John Lewis |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=The United States and the origins of the Cold War, 1941-1947 |publisher=Columbia University Press | location= New York | isbn= 0-231-08302-5  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

American intelligence organisations were very interested in German intelligence experts knowledge of the Soviet Union and immediately after the war in Europe ended they began to cooperate with the German Major General [[Reinhard Gehlen]] and his organisation [[Fremde Heere Ost]] (FHO) which had led German intelligence on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It was part of an organized effort to obtain as much German intelligence information and personnel as possible; the operation had the name [[Target Intelligence Committee]] (TICOM).

The war was however still fought in East-Asia, the US and the Soviet Union were still allies and the Americans were counting on Soviet assistance in the war against Japan. The allies had designated Norway as part of the British sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Zimke|first=Earl F. |authorlink= |year=1959 |title=German northern theatre of operations, 1940-45. |publisher=U S Govt Printing Office | location=  | isbn= 0-16-001996-6  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The so-called "Lillehammer-kuppet" (Norwegian name, translators remark) or Operation Claw as OSS called it, was executed behind the back of both the British and the Norwegians. British military authorities were in charge of the German capitulation in Norway. Thus Sala's men and archives were British war bounty. But the British was (sic) cheated by the Swedes which again cooperated with the americans.", ''Svik og gråsoner'', 162&lt;/ref&gt; Both for the US and the neutral Sweden the operation was thus very sensitive and was conducted in great secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;"Donovan himself flew from Washington to London for a conference regarding the transfer. It happened in great secrecy. Especially the Swedish high command feared that the transfer would be discovered and would be a problem for Sweden's official policy of neutrality. In a memorandum dated June 7, 1945 from J. T. Kloman to brigadier Kessler, the US military attaché in Stockholm it is revealed that the transfer had to be fast ''In order to avoid all complications with the Norwegians and the Russians'' (Tore Prysers utheving).», ''Svik og gråsoner'', 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedish-US cooperation==
[[File:KaiHolst-last-photo-1945.jpg|thumb|[[Kai Holst]], assisting the British-Norwegian razzia at Lillehammer, was reported dead by suicide in Stockholm the day after.]]
In the Wehrmacht camp at Lillehammer a group of 35 German experts on signals intelligence were gathered. They had been working on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against Soviet forces and had an archive and extensive knowledge about Soviet affairs. This was knowledge the Western Allies, and especially the Americans, wanted and that probably also were of use during the Cold War.

In cooperation with the American intelligence organisation [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and with knowledge and support from the Norwegian legation&lt;ref name=Lillehammer01&gt;"On the day of capitulation [[Algot Törneman]], with Norwegian knowledge and with good contacts with the Norwegians, got the task of going to Lillehammer to collect Sallas' archive. The Norwegians in Stockholm had confirmed the operation.", from the radio program «Den mystiska kofferten från Lillehammer», from 20:46 in the recording&lt;/ref&gt; in Stockholm agents for the Swedish intelligence organisation [[C-byrån]] traveled together with two Norwegian intelligence specialists to Lillehammer on May 9 and 10, 1945.&lt;ref name=Lillehammer02/&gt; The German group of experts were taken out of the camp and transported to Sweden.&lt;ref name=Svik161&gt;''Svik og gråsoner'', 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Svik185-186&gt;''Svik og gråsoner'', 185-186&lt;/ref&gt; After a few weeks in Sweden they were on June 12 flown from [[Torslanda Airport]] close to [[Gothenburg]] to US occupied Germany and were interned in an American military camp at [[Wiesbaden]].&lt;ref name=Svik185-186/&gt;

The transfer to Sweden of the German experts at Lillehammer, that OSS called ''Operation Claw'', was directed from the highest level. From the U.S. side the leader of OSS, Major General [[William J. Donovan]] was involved, from the Swedish side the chief of the Defense Staff, Major General [[Carl August Ehrensvärd (1892–1974)|Carl August Ehrensvärd]].&lt;ref name=Svik185-186/&gt; The famous Swedish police director [[Harry Söderman]] was also involved from the Swedish side.&lt;ref name=Svik165&gt;''Svik og gråsoner'', 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==British-Norwegian [[Raid (military)|Raid]] June 1945==

More than a month after the German capitulation, a British led search supported by Norwegian personnel &lt;ref name=Svik169&gt;"The [[Raid (military)|razzia]] was initiated and led by the British major W. D. MacRoberts from Task Force with support from Norwegian intelligence personnel and the police.", from ''Svik og gråsoner'', 169&lt;/ref&gt; was executed in order to find people from [[Gestapo]] and other German key personnel that tried to hide among ordinary soldiers in German military camps.&lt;ref name=Svik161/&gt; The search force that [[Kai Holst]] and other Norwegians were assisting were soon aware of that a number of German key personnel had been removed in the Swedish-US operation a month earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''USAs hemmelige agenter'',  151&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai Holst had been working at the military office number 4 (Mi4) at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm,&lt;ref name=VarmKald95&gt;''Fra varm til kald krig''&lt;/ref&gt; and after the search he unexpectedly traveled right back to Stockholm. The next day he was found shot at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rindögatan 42 on [[Gärdet]]. The official cause of death was stated as suicide, but neither Holst's family nor many of his colleagues from the resistance movement have accepted this and are of the opinion that he was liquidated.&lt;ref name=VarmKald105&gt;"Also a lot of other friends and colleagues of Holst from the war reject the suicide theory. They argue that the Swedish police showed little ability or will in solving the case", ''Fra varm til kald krig'', 105&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Tore Pryser]] has put forward the hypothesis that Holst brought with him information from Lillehammer that could damage Operation Claw and thus was killed.&lt;ref name=VarmKald127-129&gt;''Fra varm til kald krig'', 127-129&lt;/ref&gt; To be able to damage the operation Kai Holst can not have been trusted as others were. He must have been considered a threat due to his contact with Alexandra Kollontaj who was ambassador in Stockholm representing Soviet Union. A possible reason for the what looks like a murder of Kai Holst was not his knowledge as such but his connections.

== Aftermath ==

Operation Claw was the beginning of the [[Post-war|postwar era]] cooperation between Swedish and US intelligence services, in violation of Sweden's officially stated [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;''USAs hemmelige agenter'', 147&lt;/ref&gt; From the American side the operation was viewed as a great success and the responsible within OSS, William T. Carlson and Joseph T. Kloman, were both honored with decorations where the operation specifically were mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;''USAs hemmelige agenter'', 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''USAs hemmelige agenter'', 167&lt;/ref&gt; For the Swedish C-byrån Operation Claw quickly became toxic. Even though the operation was to be kept confidential, information leaked to the Swedish press and C-byrån were dissolved in February 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''USAs hemmelige agenter'', 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Information regarding Operation Claw continued to be classified as confidential in the post-war years and some of it still remains so today. A report about the operation in the British [[The National Archives|National Archives]] is restricted until 2020.&lt;ref name=Svik166&gt;«Dyrhaug has also identified a document in the British National Archive with the title ''Post Use of a German Intelligence Unit by Sweden''». But this is restricted for 75 years and is therefor not available until year 2020. ''Svik og gråsoner'', 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''parcel mule scam''', also known as the '''reshipping scam''', involves scammers and unsuspecting victims handling goods&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leyden|first=John|journal=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/28/parcel_mule_scam/ | title = Parcel mules scam exposed: Cybercrook, keen phisherman seeks reliable partners on dating sites | date = 28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to other countries. In some ways it is similar to the [[money mule]] scam. Scammers use fake advertising&lt;ref name="compact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computeractive.co.uk/computeractive/news/2229142/fraudsters-target-vulnerable|title=Criminals dupe vulnerable into handling stolen goods: Fraudsters targeting women on dating websites in particular |last=Greek|first=Dinah| accessdate = 15 February 2015 | publisher = Computeract!ve | date = 27 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081031210639/http://www.computeractive.co.uk/computeractive/news/2229142/fraudsters-target-vulnerable | archive-date = 31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hire mules. Items are bought with [[Carding (fraud)|stolen cards]],&lt;ref name="compact" /&gt; and since the goods are typically re-sold once shipped, this scam can be viewed as an indirect form of [[money laundering]].

{{no footnotes|date=September 2014}}
The '''Pig War''' ({{lang-sr|Свињски рат/Svinjski rat}}), or '''Customs War''', (Царински рат/Carinski rat) was a [[trade war]] between the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1906 to 1908 in which the [[Habsburgs]] unsuccessfully imposed a customs blockade on Serbian pork.

== Background ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Serbia was economically a satellite of the Habsburgs, its major export being pork, most of which was bought by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When Serbia started trying to evade economic and political control by the Habsburgs and build links with other countries, particularly [[Bulgaria]] and [[France]], the Hungarian government decided to punish the Serbs with economic sanctions. Specifically, in an attempt to reduce its economic dependence on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia began to import [[France|French]] rather than Austrian munitions in 1904 and established a [[customs union]] with [[Bulgaria]] in 1905, ending the sale of tariff-laden Austrian goods in Serbia.

== History ==
Long used to setting economic policy, Austria responded in April 1906 by closing its borders to Serbian pork. Serbia refused to bow to [[Vienna]], gained French investment to build new packing plants for international trade, began to order materials from Austria's rival [[German Empire|Germany]]
and pressured the Austrian-administrated provinces of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for a trade outlet on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. That caused Austria to give up by March 1908, as shown by the trade statistics of the period in question, published in the 1911 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]:

[[Russian Empire|Russia]] supported Serbia's actions, and war between Austria-Hungary and Russia was averted only because of a German ultimatum in 1909 that demanded the end of Russian aid to Serbia.

'''Reactions to the Special Counsel investigation''' of any [[Russia]]n government [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|efforts to interfere]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] have been widely varied and have evolved over time. An initial period of bipartisan support and praise for the selection of former FBI director [[Robert Mueller]] to lead the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel investigation]] gave way to some degree of partisan division over the scope of the investigation, the composition of the investigative teams, and the results achieved.

While initially enjoying bipartisan support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Newt |last=Gingrich |date=May 17, 2017 |title=Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel.

Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D–[[California|CA]]) stated, "Bob was a fine U.S. attorney, a great FBI director and there's no better person who could be asked to perform this function." She added, "He is respected, he is talented and he has the knowledge and ability to do the right thing." Rep.

On August 3, 2017, at a campaign-style rally in West Virginia, Trump continued to deny any Russian involvement in his campaign or win: "The Russia story is a total fabrication.

== Opposition to the investigation ==

Throughout 2017 and 2018, Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have promulgated a series of false narratives to assert that the FBI, Justice Department and Mueller investigation have been engaged in an elaborate, corrupt conspiracy against Trump. Among other things, Trump has characterized the Mueller investigation as a "rigged Russia witch hunt," while prominent Trump supporter Sean Hannity has described it as "the biggest corruption scandal in American history."&lt;ref name="foxnews.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2018/05/29/former-trump-campaign-members-on-contact-with-mueller-probe.html|title=Former Trump campaign members on contact with Mueller probe|date=May 29, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2018, Trump went so far as to assert that the Mueller investigation intended to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1001417880116891650|title=Donald J.

Amid concerns that Trump might attempt to halt the investigation by having Mueller dismissed, some members of Congress have supported a bipartisan bill designed to protect Mueller. [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] announced on April 17, 2018, that such a bill was not necessary and he would not allow it to come to the Senate floor for a vote.

Trump reportedly asked White House Counsel [[Donald McGahn]] in April 2017 to call acting deputy attorney general [[Dana Boente]]—who was supervising the Russia probe at the time, before Mueller's appointment—and get him to persuade Comey to announce that Trump was not personally under investigation. McGahn made the call but failed to convince Boente that Comey should make the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-is-frustrated-with-the-white-house-counsel-who-walks-a-fine-line-over-his-bosss-demands/2018/02/14/eca8b59e-101c-11e8-8ea1-c1d91fcec3fe_story.html|title=White House counsel walks a fine line in serving Trump's demands|first1=Josh|last1=Dawsey|first2=Rosalind S.|last2=Helderman|first3=Matt|last3=Zapotosky|date=February 14, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Trump reportedly tried to fire Mueller, according to several independent accounts published in January 2018. The reports said that Trump told McGahn to fire Mueller; that McGahn refused, saying that to do so would have a catastrophic effect on Trump's presidency; and that Trump then backed off. ''The New York Times'' reported that McGahn said he would resign rather than carry out the order, while CNN said McGahn did not directly threaten to resign, and Fox News said Trump was persuaded not to carry out the action by McGahn and other aides.&lt;ref name="Haberman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html|title=Trump Ordered Mueller Fired, but Backed Off When White House Counsel Threatened to Quit|first1=Michael S.|last1=Schmidt|first2=Maggie|last2=Haberman|date=March 8, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNJan2018&gt;{{cite news| last1=Tatum|first1=Sophie |last2=Scannell|first2=Kara|title=Trump denies he called for Mueller's firing |url= https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henry|first1=Ed |last2=Chamberlain|first2=Samuel|title=Trump was talked out of firing Mueller last June, source says|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/25/trump-ordered-mueller-fired-then-backed-off-ny-times-reports.html|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' report said that Trump cited three conflicts of interest on Mueller's part to justify the dismissal: a years-old dispute over fees at Trump National Golf Club; the fact that Mueller had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and the fact that Mueller had been interviewed to return as [[FBI Director]] the day before he was appointed special counsel.&lt;ref name="Haberman" /&gt; According to CNN, another reason Trump wanted to fire Mueller was Trump's perception that Mueller was close friends with Comey, although others have described them as professional acquaintances from having simultaneously worked in the Justice Department during the George W.

Also in June 2017, Trump reportedly instructed his aides to start a campaign for his administration and his Republican allies to discredit potential witnesses in the investigation, including FBI officials [[Andrew McCabe]], Jim Rybicki, and James Baker. The three men had been identified by Comey as his confidants. The instruction was reported in January 2018 by ''[[Foreign Policy]]''.

Trump reportedly talked about wanting to fire Rosenstein and proposed firing him, before being persuaded otherwise by his advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Sara|last2=Scannell|first2=Kara|last3=Bash|first3=Dana |last4=Brown|first4=Pamela |title=Frustrated by Russia investigation, Trump turns ire toward Rosenstein|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/26/politics/donald-trump-rod-rosenstein-frustration/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2018, Trump appeared to abandon his attorneys' advice to avoid directly criticizing the Mueller investigation, tweeting that the "Mueller probe should never have been started" and that it was a "WITCH HUNT!" He also claimed that "there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice &amp; State."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-lashes-out-at-fbi-state-department-justice-department-for-leaking-lying-corruption/|title=Trump lashes out at FBI, State and Justice Departments for "leaking, lying and corruption"| last=Watson|first=Kathryn|date=March 17, 2018|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he questioned how "fair" it was that "the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans".

Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb later stated that the president "is not considering or discussing" firing Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html|title=Trump Assails Mueller, Drawing Rebukes From Republicans|first=Peter|last=Baker|date=March 18, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump for the first time spoke openly about firing Mueller, saying that "many people" had advised him to do so and "We'll see what happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-president-trump-has-power-fire-mueller-n864556|title=White House: President Trump 'certainly believes he has the power' to fire Mueller|last=Salama|first=Vivian|date=April 10, 2018|publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Department of Justice regulations, that authority can only be exercised by Rosenstein, the DOJ official in charge of the special counsel investigation, but White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] said that Trump believes he has the power to do it directly, although he is not currently acting to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/382513-white-house-trump-believes-he-has-power-to-fire-mueller|title=White House: Trump believes he has power to fire Mueller|last=Fabian|first=Jordan|date=April 10, 2018|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump also said that the "witch hunt" that began "right after I won the nomination" is "an attack on our country in a true sense.

Following the May 2018 disclosure that FBI informant [[Stefan Halper]] had spoken with Trump campaign aides Carter Page, George Papadopolous and Sam Clovis, Trump advanced a conspiracy theory dubbed as [[Spygate (conspiracy theory)|Spygate]] that the previous administration under [[Barack Obama]] paid to plant a spy inside Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to assist his rival, [[Hillary Clinton]], win the 2016 US presidential election.&lt;ref name=voxhalper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tatum |first1=Sophie |title=Carter Page: I 'never found anything unusual' in conversations with FBI source |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/22/politics/carter-page-fbi-informant-cnn-tv/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523170622/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/22/politics/carter-page-fbi-informant-cnn-tv/index.html |archivedate=23 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With no actual supporting evidence produced, Trump's allegations were widely described as blatantly false.&lt;ref name=voxhalper&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=“Spygate,” the false allegation that the FBI had a spy in the Trump campaign, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17380212/spygate-trump-russia-spy-stefan-halper-fbi-explained |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528041047/https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17380212/spygate-trump-russia-spy-stefan-halper-fbi-explained |archivedate=28 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With ‘Spygate,’ Trump Shows How He Uses Conspiracy Theories to Erode Trust|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theories-spygate.html|last1=Davis|first1=Julie|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=29 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528232738/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theories-spygate.html|archivedate=28 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bump |first1=Philip |title=There is no evidence for ‘Spygate’ — but there is a reason Trump invented it |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?noredirect=on |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=1 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603051743/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3682f63e12ab |archivedate=3 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Darcy |first1=James |title='Spygate' is just latest Trump lie: Darcy cartoon |url=https://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2018/05/spygate_is_latest_trump_lie_da.html |website=[[cleveland.com]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531132227/https://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2018/05/spygate_is_latest_trump_lie_da.html |archivedate=31 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's allegations prompted the Justice Department and the FBI to provide a classified briefing regarding Halper to several Congressmen, including Republicans [[Trey Gowdy]] and [[Paul Ryan]].

According to a ''Washington Post'' tally, by August 21 Trump had fired or threatened over half of the officials with leadership roles in the investigation.  Speaking to [[Reuters]] on that date he said,“I can go in, and I could do whatever — I could run it if I want. But I decided to stay out.  I’m totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be.

On March 17, 2018, Trump's personal attorney, John Dowd, urged Rod Rosenstein to follow the "courageous example" of Sessions in dismissing [[Andrew McCabe]] and "bring an end" to the Mueller investigation. Dowd originally told the ''Daily Beast'' that he was speaking on behalf of the president, but later told CNN he was speaking only for himself. A source told CNN that Trump had not authorized the statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/17/politics/john-dowd-mueller-russia-investigation/index.html|title=On heels of McCabe firing, Trump lawyer calls for end of Mueller probe|first1=Gloria|last1= Borger| first2=Sophie|last2=Tatum|first3=Laura|last3=Jarrett|first4=Pamela|last4=Brown|publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two sources told ''The New York Times'' that Dowd was speaking at Trump's urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Michael S.| last1=Schmidt |first2=Maggie |last2=Haberman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-lawyers-mueller-russia-investigation.html| title=Trump Considers Reshuffling Legal Team as He Takes On Mueller More Aggressively|date=March 19, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the week of March 19, 2018, Trump hired the law firm diGenova &amp; Toensing, headed by [[Joseph diGenova]] and his wife and law partner [[Victoria Toensing]]. Both are longtime Republican activists, having appeared on Fox News on numerous occasions to criticize Democrats, most notably Bill and Hillary Clinton. In recent weeks diGenova has advanced the narrative that a "[[deep state in the United States|deep state]]" conspiracy is attempting to subvert Trump. In January 2018, diGenova said on Fox News, "There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime. Make no mistake about it: A group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime."

Several conservative sources sided with Trump to embrace and promote the Spygate conspiracy theory, including the ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' talk show and political commentators [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Sean Hannity]] for Fox News, the website [[Breitbart]], and also radio show host [[Rush Limbaugh]].

''The New York Times'' reported on July 12, 2018, that the White House had ordered that classified information about informant Stephan Halper be given to all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, beyond the tight access that had previously been granted to the [[Gang of Eight (intelligence)|Gang of Eight]]. The directors of national intelligence and the FBI both opposed the move. House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump ally, had requested the expanded access for weeks, while Democrats asserted it was an effort by Republicans to gain information they could use to undermine the Mueller investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/us/politics/white-house-fbi-informant.html|title=White House Orders Broader Access to Files About F.B.I.

It was reported in early September that Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said that the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege.

On February 2, 2018, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] with Trump's authorization released a memo written by committee chair [[Devin Nunes]] and staff. The [[Nunes memo]],&lt;ref name=nunesmemo /&gt; based on classified information, alleged that the FBI and Department of Justice "may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources" in October 2016 in seeking authorization for a wiretap on Carter Page, a former adviser to Trump's campaign.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-sought-release-of-classified-russia-memo-putting-him-at-odds-with-justice-department/2018/01/27/a00f2a4c-02bb-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html |title=Trump sought release of classified Russia memo, putting him at odds with Justice Department |last=Parker |first=Ashley |date=January 27, 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date= January 29, 2018 |last2=Helderman |first2=Rosalind S. |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |last3=Dawsey |first3=Josh |last4=Leonnig |first4=Carol D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the memo's release, Trump told associates that it would discredit the investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump moves toward releasing memo he hopes will undermine Russia probe |first1=Kevin |last1=Liptak |first2=Kaitlan |last2=Collins |first3=Sara |last3=Murray |first4=Dan |last4=Merica |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 2, 2018 |access-date=February 2, 2018 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/01/politics/nunes-memo-donald-trump/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo "totally vindicates" him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cochrane |first1=Emily |title=Trump Says Republican Memo 'Totally Vindicates' Him |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/us/politics/trump-memo-vindicates.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2018, the House Intelligence Committee with Trump's authorization released a redacted version of a memo from [[Adam Schiff]], ranking Democratic member of the committee, as a response to the Nunes memo.

A poll published in November 2017 by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that 58% of Americans approved of Mueller's handling of his investigation, while 28% disapproved. It also indicated that half of Americans believed that President Trump was not co-operating with the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/post-abc-poll-most-americans-approve-of-trump-russia-probe-and-nearly-half-think-trump-committed-a-crime/2017/11/02/9ccb3ccc-bfd6-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html|title=Post-ABC poll: Most Americans approve of Trump–Russia probe, and nearly half think Trump committed a crime|date=November 2, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Quinnipiac poll published on November 15, 2017, suggested that 60% of Americans believed that Mueller's investigation was proceeding fairly, with 27% believing that it was not.

A December poll by Associated Press–NORC indicated that four out of ten Americans believed that Trump had committed a crime in connection with Russia, with an additional three out of ten beyond that believing that he had acted unethically. It found that 62% of Democrats and 5% of Republicans believe that Trump acted illegally. It found that 68% of Americans believed that Trump was obstructing the investigation. 57% of respondents said that they were "extremely confident" or "moderately confident" that Mueller's investigation is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kcentv.com/news/poll-most-believe-trump-trying-to-obstruct-russia-investigation/499620582|title=Poll: Most believe Trump trying to obstruct Russia investigation|date=December 15, 2017|work=[[KCEN-TV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another December poll from [[The Hill (newspaper)|''The Hill'']], 54% of respondents believe Mueller has a [[conflict of interest]] due to his relationship with [[James Comey]].

A ''[[USA Today]]''/[[Suffolk University]] poll released on February 26, 2018, showed that a 58% majority of registered voters say they have a lot or some trust in Mueller's investigation, while a 57% majority say they have little or no trust in Trump's denials. Further, 75% say they take the charges filed by Mueller seriously; most of them say they take them "very" seriously. That represents some shift in views over the past year. In a ''[[USA Today]]''/Suffolk Poll in March 2017, 63% called it very or somewhat serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/26/russia-americans-trust-special-counsel-mueller-more-than-trump-usa-today-poll-shows/371345002/|title=On Russia, Americans trust special counsel Mueller more than Trump, USA Today poll shows|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family hails from [[Mandi Bahauddin]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

He completed his A levels at [[Nelson and Colne College]] before studying Law at University.  He attended the College of Law in [[Chester]] studying Law. He qualified as a [[solicitor]] of the [[Supreme Court of England and Wales]] in 1997 and rose to becoming an equity partner very quickly specialising in cases of serious fraud defence work.

He later joined the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in 1989. Sajjad was elected a member of [[Pendle Borough Council]] in 1994 and served until 2002 representing Brierfield ward.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Member of the European Parliament, 2004–present==

Karim was elected to represent the North West England in 2004 as a Liberal Democrat. On 26 November 2007 he re-joined the Conservative Party and was re-elected to the European Parliament in June 2009. In May 2014 he was re-elected to serve a third term.

Karim is interested in human rights issues including [[child labour]] and the [[civil liberties]] of EU citizens in [[War on Terrorism|the War on Terror]]. He led the successful [[European Union]] contribution to the campaign for the commutation of the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] of British man, [[Mirza Tahir Hussain]], who had spent half of his life on death row in Pakistan, for a crime he maintains he did not commit.

Sajjad has spoken out on a number of key human rights issues and in particular, campaigns for self-determination for Kashmir. He has hosted a number of conferences in the European Parliament on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2014/09/10/kashmir-and-europe-prolonging-friendship-and-solidarity-says-sajjad/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006155156/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2014/09/10/kashmir-and-europe-prolonging-friendship-and-solidarity-says-sajjad/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he brought together Syrian opposition groups to try encourage a co-hesive strategy to the current regime. He has also been active on the issue of democracy in Egypt and civil rights in Turkey.

On 26 November 2008, whilst visiting India as part of a European Parliament [[Committee on International Trade]] delegation (ahead of an EU-India summit), he was caught up in the [[26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] in the lobby of the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower]] hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/at-least-78-dead-in-mumbai-terror-attacks-1036457.html|title=At least 78 dead in Mumbai 'terror attacks'|date=26 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the Associated Press while holed up in the hotel's restaurant shortly after the terrorists gained control of the hotel, Karim said "I was in the main lobby and there was all of a sudden a lot of firing outside...all of a sudden another gunmen appeared in front of us, carrying machine gun-type weapons. And he just started firing at us ... I just turned and ran in the opposite direction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hz0C0SXcxgP0NxzlqGA_EI57FBkQD94MSOB80|title=Associated Press: Gunmen kill at least 78 in attacks across Mumbai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Karim was appointed as the Legal Affairs Spokesperson for the Conservative Group in the European Parliament. He was reappointed to this front bench position in June 2014 following the European Elections in May. As well as serving as a full member of the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI), Sajjad was previously a substitute member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee and the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee. He also currently Chairs the South Asia Monitoring Group and is a member of the delegations with the Mashreq countries and the Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28481/Sajjad_KARIM.html|title=Sajjad KARIM - Home - MEPs - European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karim has championed the role played by the EU in developing and facilitating International trade between the EU and the wider world and has been involved the development of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement within the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2012/01/30/european-parliamentary-indian-trade-envoy-welcomes-hagues-commitment/|title=Commitment to EU-India FTA|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316213902/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2012/01/30/european-parliamentary-indian-trade-envoy-welcomes-hagues-commitment/|archivedate=16 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karim was the European Parliament's rapporteur on the free trade agreement with India and has authored two trade-related European Parliament Reports on EU-India Trade Relations and the EU-India Free Trade Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/about-sajja/|title=Sajjad Biography|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303003533/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/about-sajja/|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both reports maintain the need for human rights to be integral in any trade related agreement that the EU has with another country.

Karim continues to spend a considerable amount of his time working towards a reduction in EU regulations and red tape on businesses, particularly SMEs. In October 2011 he was appointed as the European Parliament rapporteur on a new report that will look at improving the law-making process across the EU and reduce the legislative burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2011/10/12/sajjad-appointed-to-report-on-better-law-making-in-the-eu/|title=Sajjad appointed to report on better law-making|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103093720/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2011/10/12/sajjad-appointed-to-report-on-better-law-making-in-the-eu/|archivedate=3 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[English Defence League]] staged an anti-Islamic protest outside Karim's family home near Burnley, allegedly regarding new EU proposals on the labelling of Halal meat.{{verify source|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-14028512|title=MEP Sajjad Karim 'threatened' over EDL protest by home|date=5 July 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group have targeted him despite Karim not having much to do with either [[Saudi Arabia]] or [[British Bangladeshis]].

In February 2012, Karim was one of five MEPs to be appointed to a panel to police the new code of conduct rules that will govern the behaviour of MEPs. He is the only British MEP to serve on this committee. The Advisory Committee provides guidance to MEPs and advises the Parliament's President on what steps to take in the event of alleged breaches of the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2012/02/09/sajjad-honoured-to-be-appointed-to-new-panel/|title=Sajjad appointed to new panel|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303003945/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2012/02/09/sajjad-honoured-to-be-appointed-to-new-panel/|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 he was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Committee by the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz.

After the European elections in 2014 Karim was selected as the European Conservative and Reformist Group Parliament Presidential candidate. The incumbent Martin Schultz retained his position as President with Karim coming second of a total of four candidate. It being widely acknowledged that Karim secured support from MEPs right across the house beyond his own group.

Karim made headline news in December 2012 when he played an instrumental role in securing the return of 6 year-old Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson to UK from Pakistan following abduction by her father. Over several weeks he worked closely with Greater Manchester Police and the Pakistani authorities and Atiya was returned safely to her mother during the Christmas holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-20856712 | work=BBC News | title=Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson being returned from Pakistan | date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the European Parliament voted to approve a concessionary trade status for Pakistan. The preferential trade package for Pakistan's exports to EU countries came into force in January 2014. Karim steered the International Trade Committee to approve the beneficial trade tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2013/12/12/sak-8-years-of-work-finally-secures-gsp-status-for-pakistan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122126/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2013/12/12/sak-8-years-of-work-finally-secures-gsp-status-for-pakistan/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Sajjad was awarded an Honorary Doctorate for the University of Management and Technology in Lahore for his work in securing the GSP+ deal and for services to the British Pakistani community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2013/12/16/prime-minister-congratulates-dr-sajjad-karim-mep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162538/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2013/12/16/prime-minister-congratulates-dr-sajjad-karim-mep/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 Karim was awarded the Sitara-i-qaid-i-Azam, Pakistan's highest national honour to non-Pakistanis, for his services to strengthen Pakistan/UK and Pakistan/EU relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2014/08/14/saj-awarded-pakistans-highest-honour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006185822/http://www.sajjadkarim.eu/2014/08/14/saj-awarded-pakistans-highest-honour/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karim was presented with the award in March 2015 by Pakistan President, [[Mamnoon Hussain]], at a ceremony in Islamabad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19212">The '''San Diego free speech fight''' in [[San Diego]], [[California]], in 1912–1913 was one of the most famous of the "[[free speech fights]]", [[class conflict]]s over the [[free speech]] rights of [[labor union]]s.

==Introduction==
{{see also|Labor history of the United States}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, growing confrontations between the [[working class]] and their employers caused suspicion and animosity both within, and against the workers. [[Strike (labor)|Striking]] workers had taken [[Militant (word)|militant]] action which culminated in the [[Haymarket Riot]] in [[Chicago]]; the [[Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886]] was crushed, destroying the [[Knights of Labor]], coincident with the birth of the conservative [[American Federation of Labor]]. In the [[western United States]] the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) inherited the mantle of militant [[Trade union|unionism]], challenging capital in strikes from Cripple Creek to Canada. Many communities sought to limit the spread of union philosophy by revoking rights granted by the [[United States Constitution]], particularly the [[freedom of speech]] granted by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

===Industrial Workers of the World===
{{see also|Industrial Workers of the World}}
In 1905 the WFM and other unions, together with [[socialist]], and [[anarchist]] groups met in Chicago to form the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in what came to be called the "[[First Continental Congress]] of the working class." The immediate purpose of the IWW was to unite all working people into one worldwide union, regardless of race, creed, sex, skill, or [[national origin]]. The ultimate goal was abolition of the wage system, replacing [[wage labour]] with [[worker cooperative]]s.

The ''Wobblies'', as IWW members were called, frequently [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|engaged in creative tactics]], including [[soapbox]]ing. The IWW orators spoke to workers about bosses, corruption, exploitation, and the unfairness of [[capitalism]]. Championing such a direct challenge to capital, members of the IWW faced persecution and prejudice in [[North America]], and throughout the world. In many American cities, from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[California]], IWW members found their right to public speech interfered with by [[local ordinance]] or police harassment. Thus began the [[free speech fights]] of the IWW.

From approximately 1906, the [[San Diego General Membership Branch]] of the IWW focused on various small industries, including cigar making and lumber. In 1910 the IWW attempted to organize Mexican workers of the [[San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company]]. A successful strike led to the formation of a public service union, which was disbanded when many of the Mexican workers left to participate in the [[Mexican Revolution]].

==Events leading to the fight==
One of the most brutal and significant of the free speech fights occurred in the [[Stingaree]] neighborhood of [[San Diego]], home to the city's "undesirables."  The [[San Diego City Council|San Diego Common Council]] had passed an ordinance to curb Wobbly soapbox orations, resulting in the San Diego free speech fight in which the IWW clashed with law enforcement and [[vigilante]]s who were incited to violence by local newspapers.

==Germania Hall incident==
The San Diego free speech fight began on February 1, 1912, but confrontation with the San Diego's "old guard" began as early as 1910. On November 10, 1910, Local 13 of the IWW held a meeting to celebrate the martyrs of the Chicago Haymarket Riot. The police closed down the Wobbly meeting place, [[Germania Hall]], before the event could take place. In response, the IWW took their grievances to the streets and began their soapbox free speech campaign. Afterwards, Wobblies who spoke "on the soapbox" were jailed, "fingerprinted, photographed in jail and then released."&lt;ref&gt;Miller pp.215-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Germania Hall incident, the IWW shifted their efforts to a form of soapbox oratory in order to win over a diverse spectrum of the working class, focusing on gaining converts through their speeches. The fifty members of the IWW refocused their efforts to [[Heller's Corner]] at the corner of 5th and E Streets, in the center of the Stingaree. The Stingaree contained a mélange of ethnic groups: ranging from whites, white immigrant, blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese, most of which were members of the working class. The Stingaree and Heller's Corner were symbolic hubs for the San Diegan prejudices against different races and [[American lower class|lower class]]es. The Stingaree was home to everything different and unknown that went against the "mission" ideal in San Diego, including: saloons, shops, cheap hotels, gambling houses, opium dens and prostitutes. The square block at the corner of Fifth and E Streets was home to more than just debauchery, as it also was the central location for a variety of "soapbox orators" including the [[Salvation Army]], [[Socialism|Socialists]], [[Holy Roller]]s, and the [[Single Taxers]]. The situation was relatively peaceful and there were no violent run-ins with the police, until after the Germania Hall incident.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p.188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordinance prohibiting free speech==

The free speech fight officially began on January 8, 1912, when the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance No. 4623, which called for a restricted zone of 49-square blocks (more than that which was requested by San Diegans) in the middle of San Diego, encompassing all of "soapbox row." The ordinance came as a result of a recommendation given by the San Diego grand jury and a petition signed by eighty-five prominent citizens and property owners who had hoped to prohibit free speech in a seven-square block zone centered around 5th &amp; E. The meetings blocked traffic, it was officially argued, and that necessitated an ordinance for "the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety and one of emergency."&lt;ref&gt;Miller p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial punishment for violating the ordinance was punishable by a $25 to $100 fine and/or thirty days' [[imprisonment]]. Prior to passage of the ordinance, the Wobblies, Single Taxers, and Socialists had signed a 250-person [[petition]] in which they called for an allowance of unrestricted free speech. This effort countered the petitions previously submitted by the San Diego Grand Jury and the high powered San Diegan citizens, but to no avail.

There was a period of uncertainty, during which the council delayed its decision. The council may have simply been searching for affirmation from the general public in order to avoid widespread conflict and dismay throughout the city. Some council members "believed that a referendum would show that the majority of San Diegans favored speaking anywhere at anytime."&lt;ref&gt;Miller p.218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council finally found a reason to pass the ordinance on the evening of January 6, 1912. The Socialists and Single Taxers were holding a soapbox event on the streets when an off-duty constable and [[real estate]] man, R.J. Walsh drove his car into a crowd at the closed-off soapbox row. With his horn blaring, he attempted to disrupt the orators.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bill Haywood]]'s letter of April 9, 1913, to ''[[The New York Times]]'', available online at [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00814FA3C5B13738DDDAA0994DC405B838DF1D3 NYT archive].&lt;/ref&gt;  His car was mobbed and its tires were slashed. The police intervened and two days later the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance 4623 with an emergency clause that called for the immediate cessation of public free speech rights, sidestepping the customary twenty-day implementation wait period. The free speech fight had officially begun.

==Opposition to the ordinance==

The [[California Free Speech League]] was created on January 16, 1912, with the support of Socialists, Wobblies, church groups, the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] and other [[trade union]]s. The League attempted to take a legal stand against the free speech restrictions by holding up the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and defending the rights of non-property owning peoples. The League also hired [[E.E. Kirk]] as an attorney to provide some legal leverage against the law and its enforcement.

After the passage of free speech restrictions, the Wobblies and other groups began testing the ordinance. At a typical IWW street meeting the police left the Wobblies undisturbed and merely relegated themselves to traffic and pedestrian direction. Indeed, the Wobblies and the Socialists believed that they had already won back their free speech rights. But law enforcement was simply adhering to a generally accepted 30-day [[grace period]] after the ordinance was enacted. Once the grace period was over, forty-one people were arrested during a parade and demonstration consisting of 5,000 protesters. Those arrested were jailed for twenty-four hours, held initially on a misdemeanor charge. But the prosecutors decided the violators had conspired to break the law, and thus tried the prisoners under a felony charge of conspiracy. The Wobblies and other soapbox speakers then moved their orations out of the restricted zone. But the council passed an ordinance which gave police the ability to arrest anyone that disrupted traffic throughout San Diego.

==Jail conditions and civil disobedience==

The increase in arrests led to the rapid filling of the San Diego jails, causing overcrowding and the rapid decline of prison conditions, increasing Wobbly anger toward law enforcement. The reports about jail conditions were conflicting, but the general trend seems to show that the Wobblies and other pro-free speech detainees were treated badly. The jails filled up so quickly that the police used their sobering rooms or drunk tanks for housing inmates. These tanks had no beds and the arrested were forced to sleep on vermin infested concrete floors. Moreover, [[police brutality]] and aggression were rampant, while beatings and other abuses were relatively common throughout the ordeal. Sixty-three-year-old Michael Hoy died on March 28th after the police beat him and withheld medical attention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bovokoy|first1=Matthew|title=The San Diego World's Fairs and Southwestern Memory, 1880-1940|date=2005|publisher=UNM Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McWilliams|first1=Carey|title=California: The Great Exception|date=April 2, 1999|publisher=Univ of California Press|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events coincided with the plan of the Free Speech League to "glut the jails and then to demand individual [[jury trial]]s which would clog the courts and bring the legal machinery to a standstill."&lt;ref&gt;Shanks 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This especially appealed to the IWW, so much so that they called for 20,000 Wobblies to converge on San Diego in order to bring the system to a halt. There were 50 members of local 13 in 1912, but roughly 5,000 Wobblies came to San Diego to participate in the free speech fight. [[District attorney|District Attorney]] Utley tried to offer a compromise to the Wobblies, promising to free the men originally arrested for conspiracy if the IWW ceased its public speaking in the restricted zone. The IWW declined the offer on principle even through its attorney, E.E. Kirk, recommended that they accept the compromise. The arrests continued. The IWW then protested against the detainment and the prison conditions in front of the city jail. Five thousand protesters turned out, and the police indiscriminately blasted people, including women and children, with fire hoses.

==Vigilantes==

The increase in arrests left Police Chief [[Keno Wilson]] with a dilemma; he wanted to punish the protesters, but simultaneously faced overcrowded jails and stockades. After local newspapers began editorializing vociferously against the protesters and their tactics, groups of vigilantes began transporting arrested Wobblies and free speakers to the county line. The vigilantes began patrolling trains that were inbound from the north, and would grab Wobblies and invited speakers before they could get to the city. The vigilantes then proceeded to "reeducate" the speakers on [[patriotism]] as this brutal first hand account notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;They were drunk and hollering and cursing the rest of the night. In the morning they took us out four or five at a time and marched us up the track to the county line… where were forced to kiss the flag and then run a gauntlet of 106 men, every one of which was striking at us as hard as they could with their pick ax handles. They broke one man's leg, and everyone was beaten black and blue, and was bleeding from a dozen wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These incidents occurred quite frequently, but there was no significant outcry from the middle class citizens of San Diego.

The state of California finally intervened, as Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] was flooded with demands for an inquiry into the arrests and [[Vigilante|vigilantism]] in San Diego. Governor Johnson sent Colonel Weinstock to act as an investigative commissioner. By all accounts Weinstock was an impartial judge of situation, and he concluded that the arrests and free speech restrictions were unlawful, but that the Wobblies were wrong in their pursuance of an activist stance. Moreover, Weinstock likened the situation to [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] and suggested the [[California Attorney General|Attorney General]] take action, but he did not. Although Weinstock's presence caused a temporary cessation in violence, the situation was once again aroused when Joseph Mikolash, a Wobbly, was killed by police in the IWW headquarters in San Diego on May 7.    &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assassins Attack and Wound Two Policemen|publisher=San Diego Union|date=May 8, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wobblies reportedly employed firearms against the police in the incident, which led to the discovery of a small arms cache in the IWW headquarters. This increased the public's hostility toward the IWW and toward Weinstock's report, which had defended the Wobblies' [[constitutional right]] to free speech.

==Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman==

[[Emma Goldman]] and [[Ben Reitman]] came to San Diego for Goldman to give her speech "An Enemy of the People" on May 15, 1912. When the two arrived at the train station the same women that allegedly needed protection from the soapbox orators yelled "Give us that anarchist; we will strip her naked; we will tear out her guts."&lt;ref&gt;Miller 194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Mayors of San Diego, California|Mayor of San Diego]] [[James E. Wadham]] offered a warning, but no help to the two activists. Reitman was abducted by vigilantes from his hotel room and tortured. He later recalled,
&lt;blockquote&gt;They tore my clothes off. They knocked me down, and when I lay naked on the ground, they kicked and beat me until I was almost insensible. With a lighted cigar they burned the letters I.W.W. on my buttocks; then they poured a can of tar over my head and, in the absence of feathers, rubbed sage-brush on my body. One of them attempted to push a cane into my rectum. Another twisted my testicles. They forced me to kiss the flag and sing ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''. When they tired of the fun, they gave me my underwear for fear we should meet any women. They also gave me back my vest, in order that I might carry my money, railroad ticket, and watch. The rest of my clothes they kept. I was ordered to make a speech, and then they commanded me to run the gauntlet. The Vigilantes lined up, and as I ran past them, each one gave me a blow or a kick. Then they let me go.&lt;ref&gt;Reitman, as quoted by Emma Goldman, ''[[Living My Life]]'', v.1, pp. 494-501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Reitman had not been a member of the IWW, although he was a supporter. Emma Goldman then returned to Los Angeles after being misled into thinking that the Vigilantes had not harmed Reitman but simply put him on a train for Los Angeles. Reitman was released a day later and arrived in Los Angeles badly beaten.

By the fall of 1912, the soapbox row had been abandoned. The vigilantes ended their terror campaign, for they had brutalized, driven out, or– some believe– possibly murdered anyone who stood up for the right of free speech in San Diego. This was quite a different result from what the IWW had experienced in its other [[free speech fights]] around the country. The Wobblies did not return to San Diego until 1914.

==In song==

From the July 11, 1912, edition of the IWW's ''[[Little Red Songbook]]'', the first stanza of "We're Bound For San Diego":

:In that town called San Diego when the workers try to talk,
:The cops will smash them with a sap and tell them "take a walk",
:They throw them in a bull pen and they feed them rotten beans,
:And they call that "law and order" in that city, so it seems.&lt;ref&gt;A recording of the song is available online at [http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/parton/2/boundfor.html "History in Song"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610170755/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/parton/2/boundfor.html |date=2007-06-10 }}, by Manfred Helfert.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonus track "Tar and Sagebrush", from [[Anti-Flag]]'s new album, ''[[The Bright Lights of America]]'', is a folk punk interpretation of Ben Reitman's description of his torture.

'''Shakespeare Santa Cruz''' was an annual professional [[theatre festival]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]], which ran from 1981 to 2013. After losing the financial support of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], the company was relaunched through [[crowdfunding]] as [[Santa Cruz Shakespeare]].

== History ==
Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121876098005742875?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Greasepaint under the Redwoods |accessdate=2008-08-15 |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=2008-08-15 | first=Terry | last=Teachout}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays by [[Shakespeare]] and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/about/index.php |title=Our Mission |accessdate=10 November 2008 |work=shakespearesantacruz.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218183316/http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/about/index.php |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Daniel B.|title=A Shakespeare Makeover in Santa Cruz|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0831/31141.html|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=31 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), [[Danny Scheie]] (1993–95), Risa Brainin, [[Paul Whitworth]] (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/22/PK78V1RDO.DTL&amp;type=performance |title=Bay Area Theater Artistic Director Timeline |accessdate=10 November 2008 |work=sfgate.com |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: [[David Aaron Baker]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Maria Dizzia]], Dan Donohue, [[Caitlin FitzGerald]], [[Richard Gunn (actor)|Richard Gunn]], [[Peter Jacobson]], [[Carrie Preston]], [[Reg Rogers]], and [[Michael Stuhlbarg]].


In 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual '''Winter Holiday season'''. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick.  A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, ''Cinderella'', ''Gretel and Hansel'', ''The Princess and the Pea'' and ''Sleeping Beauty'' were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages.  The winter season performed in November and December.

In addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The '''Fringe show''' was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included ''[[Lysistrata]]'', ''The Antipodes'', ''Fools in the Forest'', and ''The Mock-Tempest''. '''Shakespeare to Go''' was an educational engagement program—and recipient of [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances.

The festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Taylor |title=Drama, Live and on the Financial Edge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/theater/15Tayl.html?_r=2 |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/santacruz/ci_23948559/ucsc-end-shakespeare-santa-cruz-after-holiday-production|title=UCSC to end Shakespeare Santa Cruz after holiday production|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through [[crowdfunding]] to continue on without the financial support of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baine|first=Wallace|title=Shakespeare Santa Cruz raises $1.1M, exceeding fundraising goal|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/News/ci_25048060/Shakespeare-Santa-Cruz-raises-11M-exceeding-fundraising-goal|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2014, the new company changed its name to [[Santa Cruz Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baine|first=Wallace|title=New name, new season for Shakespeare Santa Cruz|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/News/ci_25275825/New-name-new-season-for-Shakespeare-Santa-Cruz|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''solar eclipse on May 12, 1706''' was a [[total eclipse]].

==Description==
The eclipse was visible in north and west Africa along with all Europe and its islands, Asia including the most of Middle East and almost all of Siberia and a small part of northeastern North America and the northern islands.  It was also visible in the Atlantic.  A very small portion occurred in the Southern Hemisphere almost entirely over the ocean.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar eclipse of May 12, 1706|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/1701-1800/1706-05-12.gif|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of [[Solar Saros 133|solar saros 133]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros133.html|title=Solar Saros 133|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbral portion which was as far as 242&amp;nbsp;km (150&amp;nbsp;km), it included areas that were 150 miles (250&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of the Cape Verdean island of Santo Antão (then a Portuguese colony) in the Atlantic, the Spanish controlled [[Canary Islands]], [[Morocco]] including [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]], [[Tangier]] and [[Tetouan]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Spain]] including [[Malaga]], [[Valencia]] and [[Barcelona]], [[France]] including [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], [[Nîmes]] and [[Marseilles]], [[Switzerland]], [[Munich]], Danzig (now [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]]), Mazuria, much of the Baltic, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], newly founded at the time and a part of the Russian north including the Samoyedic and Yakut areas and up to Manchuria. The greatest occurred in the area between [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Silesia]] (now in Poland) at 51.5 N, 15.2 E at 9:35 UTC (10:35 CET) and lasted for over 4 minutes.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration in Burkina Faso, Mai, Songhai, Benghazi in Libya, Ankara, Sinope, the north of the Caspian and a part of Mongola and on the other side, northwestern Islands and the east shore of Greenland.  It was 75% obscuration in places like Norway, Lapland and Zemlya and on the other side around Bissau, Syracuse in Sicily and Bucharest.  Places that was 25% obscuration of the sun included Kingdom of Benin, Egypt and Babylon in Iraq (then commonly as Mesopotamia). Areas that were on the rim of the eclipse included Gabon, Darfur, Nubia, the north of the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, the Arghan Empire, Nepal, Assam and Manchurian controlled Yunnan.

The eclipse started in the middle of the Atlantic and finished at sunset in Siberia, Korea and China.

The subsolar marking was in Nubia.

== Scientific and historical significance ==

The eclipse was the first to be the subject of predictive maps.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. van Gent,[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/publications/eclipse_maps.pdf"Early 18th-Century Maps of Solar Eclipse Paths"]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the famous [[Solar eclipse of May 3, 1715|Halley's eclipse]] of 1715, the eclipse was not total in England. However [[John Flamsteed]], based on a letter by a Captayn Stanyan in Bern,  reported to the Royal Society that, for the first time to his knowledge, someone "took notice of a red streak preceding the emersion of the sun's body from a total eclipse", erroneously&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

The '''''Spirit of St. Louis''''' (Registration: N-X-211) is the custom-built, single engine, single-seat, high wing [[monoplane]] that was flown by [[Charles Lindbergh]] on May 20 – 21, 1927, on the [[Charles Lindbergh#The Orteig Prize, Spirit of St. Louis, and New York–Paris flight|first solo nonstop]] [[transatlantic flight]] from [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to [[Paris]], [[France]], for which Lindbergh won the $25,000 [[Orteig Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/ryan-nyp-spirit-st-louis-charles-lindbergh|title=Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis|work=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindbergh took off in the ''Spirit'' from [[Roosevelt Airfield]], [[Garden City, New York]], and landed 33 hours, 30 minutes later at [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport|Aéroport Le Bourget]] in Paris, France, a distance of approximately 3,600 miles (5,800&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2012, pp. 512–516.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-known aircraft in the world, the ''Spirit'' was built by [[Ryan Airline Company|Ryan Airlines]] in [[San Diego, California]], owned and operated at the time by [[Benjamin Franklin Mahoney]], who had purchased it from its founder, [[T. Claude Ryan]], in 1926. The ''Spirit'' is on permanent display in the main entryway's ''Milestones of Flight'' gallery at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Development==

Officially known as the "Ryan NYP" (for ''N''ew ''Y''ork to ''P''aris), the single-engine monoplane was designed by [[Donald A. Hall]] of Ryan Airlines and named the "Spirit of St. Louis" in honor of Lindbergh's supporters from the St. Louis Raquette Club in his then hometown of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. To save design time, the NYP was loosely based on the company's 1926 [[Ryan M-2]] mailplane, the main difference being the NYP's 4,000-mile range. As a nonstandard design, the government assigned it the registration number N-X-211 (for "experimental"). Hall documented his design in "Engineering Data on the ''Spirit of St. Louis''", which he prepared for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) and is included as an appendix to Lindbergh's 1953 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book ''The Spirit of St. Louis''.

B.F. "Frank" Mahoney and Claude Ryan had co-founded the company as an [[airline]] in 1925 and Ryan remained with the company after Mahoney bought out his interest in 1926, although there is some dispute as to how involved Ryan may have been in its management after selling his share. It is known, however, that [[Hawley Bowlus]] was the factory manager who oversaw construction of the Ryan NYP, and that Mahoney was the sole owner at the time of [[Donald A. Hall]]'s hiring.

The ''Spirit'' was designed and built in San Diego to compete for the $25,000 [[Orteig Prize]] for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris.&lt;ref name=belfiore2007&gt;Belfiore 2007, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Ryan Airlines staff worked closely with Lindbergh to design and build the ''Spirit'' in just 60 days. Although what was actually paid to Ryan Airlines for the project is not clear, Mahoney agreed to build the plane for $6,000 and said that there would be no profit; he offered engine, instruments, etc. at cost. After first approaching several major aircraft manufacturers without success, in early February 1927 Lindbergh, who as a U.S. Air Mail pilot was familiar with the good record of the M-1 with [[Pacific Air Transport]], wired, "Can you construct Whirlwind engine plane capable flying nonstop between New York and Paris ...?"

Mahoney was away from the factory, but Ryan answered, "Can build plane similar M-1 but larger wings... delivery about three months." Lindbergh wired back that due to competition, delivery in less than three months was essential. Many years later, Jon van der Linde, chief mechanic of Ryan Airlines, recalled, "But nothing fazed B.F. Mahoney, the young sportsman who had just bought Ryan." Mahoney telegraphed Lindbergh back the same day: "Can complete in two months."

[[File:Lindbergh check.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the funding for the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' came from Lindbergh's own earnings as a U.S. Air Mail pilot ({{nowrap|January 15}}, 1927 RAC paycheck).]]Lindbergh arrived in San Diego on February 23 and toured the factory with Mahoney, meeting Bowlus, chief engineer Donald Hall, and sales manager A. J. Edwards. After further discussions between Mahoney, Hall and Lindbergh, Mahoney offered to build the ''Spirit'' for $10,580, restating his commitment to deliver it in 60 days. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 toward the cost of the ''Spirit'' that he had saved from his earnings as an Air Mail pilot for [[Robertson Aircraft Corporation]].  The rest was provided by the [[Spirit of St. Louis Organization]].

Lindbergh was convinced: "I believe in Hall's ability; I like Mahoney's enthusiasm. I have confidence in the character of the workmen I've met."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He then went to the airfield to familiarize himself with a Ryan aircraft, either an M-1 or an M-2, then telegraphed his St. Louis backers and recommended the deal, which was quickly approved.

Mahoney lived up to his commitment. Working exclusively on the aircraft and closely with Lindbergh, the staff completed the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' 60 days after Lindbergh arrived in San Diego. Powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-5C 223-hp radial engine, it had a 14&amp;nbsp;m (46-foot) wingspan, 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) longer than the M-1, to accommodate the heavy load of 1,610&amp;nbsp;L (425&amp;nbsp;gal) of fuel. In his 1927 book ''We'', Lindbergh acknowledged the builders' achievement with a photograph captioned "The Men Who Made the Plane", identifying: "B. Franklin Mahoney, president, Ryan Airlines", Bowlus, Hall and Edwards standing with the aviator in front of the completed aircraft.&lt;ref name=bfm&gt;Tekulsky, Joseph D.

==Design==

[[File:SpiritofStLouisCockpit.JPG|left|thumb|''Spirit of St. Louis'' cockpit, Washington, D.C.]]
Lindbergh believed that multiple engines resulted in a greater risk of failure while a single engine design would give him greater range. To increase fuel efficiency, the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' was also one of the most advanced and aerodynamically streamlined designs of its era.

Lindbergh believed that a flight made in a single-seat monoplane designed around the dependable [[Wright J-5 Whirlwind]] radial engine provided the best chance of success. The Ryan NYP had a total fuel capacity of {{convert|450|U.S.gal}} or {{convert|2710|lb}} of gasoline, which was necessary in order to have the range to make the anticipated flight non-stop. The fuel was stored in five fuel tanks, a forward tank – {{cvt|88|U.S.gal}}, the main – {{cvt|209|U.S.gal}}, and three wing tanks – total of {{cvt|153|U.S.gal}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bak 2011, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh modified the design of the plane's "trombone struts" attached to the landing gear to provide a wider wheel base in order to accommodate the weight of the fuel.&lt;ref name=LindyHop&gt;Buck, Rinker. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-lindy-did-the-hop-1495829913 "How Lindy Did the Hop".] ''Wall Street Journal''. May 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Lindbergh's request, the large main and forward fuel tanks were placed in the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This arrangement improved the [[center of gravity]] and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine in the event of a crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum.&lt;ref name=LindyHop /&gt; Lindbergh also installed a newly developed [[Earth Inductor Compass]] made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the [[magnetic declination]] of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bak 2011, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.&lt;ref name=LindyHop /&gt;

Lindbergh sat in a cramped cockpit which was 94&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 81&amp;nbsp;cm long and 130&amp;nbsp;cm high (36&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;× 32&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;× 51&amp;nbsp;in). The cockpit was so small, Lindbergh could not stretch his legs. The ''Spirit of St. Louis'' was powered by a {{cvt|223|hp|adj=on}}, air-cooled, nine-cylinder Wright J-5C Whirlwind radial engine. The engine was rated for a maximum operating time of 9,000 hours (more than one year if operated continuously), and had a special mechanism that could keep it clean for the entire New York-to-Paris flight. It was also, for its day, very fuel-efficient, enabling longer flights carrying less fuel weight for given distances.{{#tag:ref|The "History Detectives" (Season 3, Episode 1; Season 4, Episode 5) PBS program confirms through three documents and interviews of several experts that the uncle of two brothers, now in possession of the letter (image on first reference), did indeed build the J5 rotary aeronautical engine of the ''Spirit of St. Louis''.&lt;ref name="PBS program"&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/lindbergh-engine/ "Investigations: Lindbergh Engine"] ''History Detectives'' (Season 3, Episode 1; Season 4, Episode 5). PBS, first airdate: May 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Another key feature of the Whirlwind radial engine was that it was rated to self-lubricate the engine's valves for 40 hours continuously. Lubricating, or "greasing," the moving external engine parts was a necessity most aeronautical engines of the day required, to be done manually by the pilot or ground crew prior to every flight and would have been otherwise required somehow to be done during the long flight.&lt;ref name="PBS program"/&gt;

The engine was built at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson, New Jersey by a 24-year-old engine builder, Tom Rutledge, who was disappointed that he was assigned to the unknown aviator, Lindbergh. Four days after the flight, he received a letter of congratulations from the Wright management.&lt;ref name="PBS program"/&gt;&lt;ref name=J5&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/rut.asp "Photos from the estate of Tom Rutledge, who is credited with building Lindbergh's J5".] ''Charles Lindbergh – An American Aviator''.

[[File:SoSL Fabric 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of the treated fabric from the ''Spirit of St. Louis'']]

The race to win the prize required time-saving design compromises. [[Donald A. Hall]] decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design.&lt;ref&gt;Cassagneres 2002, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This setup resulted in a [[Longitudinal static stability|negatively stable]] design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated [[flight dynamics|pitch]], [[flight dynamics|yaw]], and [[flight dynamics|bank (roll)]] elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him awake at various times during the flight.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; The stiff [[wicker]] seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom fitted to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.

[[File:Spirit of St. Louis Nose Cone 1.jpg|right|thumb|Inside of the original propeller spinner of the ''Spirit of St. Louis'']]
Lindbergh also insisted that unnecessary weight be eliminated, even going so far as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map. He carried no radio in order to save weight and because the radios of the period were unreliable and difficult to use while flying solo. Also, although he was an airmail pilot, he refused to carry souvenir letters on the transatlantic journey, insisting that every spare ounce be devoted to fuel. The fuselage was made of treated fabric over a metal tube frame, while the wings were made of fabric over a wood frame. The plywood material that was used to build most of Lindbergh's plane was made at the [[Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref name=Lindbergh&gt;{{Citation | journal = Grand Rapids Spectator  | volume = XVI  | issue = 11 |page = 11|date=June 18, 1927 |title=Haskelite Used on Lindbergh's Plane |publisher=Grand Rapids Association of Commerce |publication-place=Grand Rapids, Michigan |url= |quote="Made in Grand Rapids" is the tag on the material forming the important structural part of the "Spirit of St. Louis," the airplane which Col.

In the Lindbergh plane the cabin, wing ribs, wing beams, leading edges and practically all parts of the ship in which plywood was used were of haskelite.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small, left-facing Indian-style [[Swastika#Buddhism|swastika]] was painted on the inside of the original propeller spinner of the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others.{{#tag:ref|During this period, the swastika (which has [[neolithic]] origins) was a widely used symbol of good luck and was not yet associated in the United States with the German [[Nazi Party]] which was still a largely unknown organization outside of Europe.|group=Note}} The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The propeller spinner that is on the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.

==Later history and conservation==
[[File:Lindbergh Airmail Stamp c10.jpg|thumb|left|10c [[Airmails of the United States|US Air Mail]] stamp honoring [[Charles Lindbergh|Capt. Charles Lindbergh]] and the ''Spirit of St Louis'' was issued June 11, 1927. (Scott C10)]]
Lindbergh's New York-to-Paris flight made him an instant celebrity and media star. In winning the Orteig Prize, Lindbergh stirred the public's imagination. He wrote: "I was astonished at the effect my successful landing in France had on the nations of the world. It was like a match lighting a bonfire."&lt;ref&gt;Nevin 1980, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh subsequently flew the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' to Belgium and England before President [[Calvin Coolidge]] sent the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Memphis|CL-13|2}} to bring them back to the United States. Arriving on June 11, Lindbergh and the ''Spirit'' were escorted up the [[Potomac River]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], by a fleet of warships, multiple flights of military pursuit aircraft, bombers, and the rigid airship {{USS|Los Angeles|ZR-3|2}} where President Coolidge presented the 25-year-old [[U.S. Army Reserve]] aviator with the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, the U.S Post Office issued a commemorative 10-cent [[Airmails of the United States|"Lindbergh Air Mail"]] stamp depicting the ''Spirit'' over a map of its flight from New York to Paris, and which was also the first stamp issued by the post office that bore the name of a living person.

Over the next 10 months, Lindbergh flew the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' on promotional and goodwill tours across the United States and [[Latin America]].  According to the published log of the ''Spirit,'' during his 3 month tour of the US, he allowed Major Thomas Lamphier  (Commander of the 1st Pursuit Squadron, Selfridge Field) and Lieutenant Philip R. Love (classmate in flight school and colleague of Lindbergh's in the airmail service of [[Robertson Aircraft Corporation]]) to pilot the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' for ten minutes each on July 1 and August 8, 1927, respectively.  These two are apparently the only persons other than Lindbergh who ever piloted the ''Spirit of St. Louis.''&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, pp. 455-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spirit Of St Louis2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Spirit'' at the National Air and Space Museum.]]
Just one year and two days after making their first flight at Dutch Flats in San Diego, California, on April 28, 1927, Lindbergh and the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' flew together for the final time while making a hop from St. Louis to [[Bolling Field]], in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1928. There he presented his monoplane to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] where for more than eight decades it has been on display, hanging for 48 years (1928–76) in the [[Arts and Industries Building]] and today hanging, since 1976, in the atrium of the National Air and Space Museum alongside the [[Bell X-1]] and [[SpaceShipOne]]. At the time of its retirement, the ''Spirit'' had made 174 flights, totaling 489:28 hours in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Quentin. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/27/specials/lindbergh-spiritof.html "The Bold Victory of a Man Alone".] ''The New York Times'' (Books), September 13, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in other respects the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' appears today much as it appeared on its accession into the Smithsonian collection in 1928, the gold color of the aircraft's aluminum nose panels is an artifact of well-intended early conservation efforts. Not long after the museum took possession of the ''Spirit'', conservators applied a clear layer of varnish or shellac to the forward panels in an attempt to preserve the flags and other artwork painted on the engine cowling. This protective coating has yellowed with age, resulting in the golden hue seen today. Smithsonian officials have indicated that the varnish will be removed and the nose panels restored to their original silver appearance the next time the aircraft is taken down for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Direct correspondence with Dr. F. Robert van der Linden, Chairman, Aeronautics Division at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in response to a direct inquiry to their Archives department about this matter. Dr. van der Linden is the curator responsible for the ''Spirit of St. Louis''. His response verbatim:
{{quote|text=The nose of the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' is a golden color because of a well-intentioned but mistaken attempt by us to preserve the markings on the cowling. We don’t know exactly when, but soon after the Smithsonian acquired the ''Spirit'' in May 1928, we sought to preserve the markings by applying a clear coat of varnish or shellac. Unfortunately, over the years, this coating has yellowed with age. While it has taken on a beautiful golden hue, the color is wrong. The aluminum cowling should be in its natural silver color.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Smithsonian has subsequently reversed this stance, deciding that the golden hue on its engine cowling will remain, as it is part of the aircraft's natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of [[vulcanization]], are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration (conservation was also likely undertaken on the wheel assembly itself).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airspacemag.com/multimedia/inside-look-spirit-st-louis-180955351/?no-ist "An Inside Look at the ''Spirit of St. Louis''."] ''Air &amp; Space magazine'', May 20, 2015.

Retrieved: October 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developed types==
NYP-2, an exact duplicate  of the ''Spirit of St. Louis'', was built 45 days after the transatlantic flight, for the Japanese newspaper ''[[Mainichi]]''. The NYP-2 carrying serial number 29 was registered as ''J-BACC'' and achieved a number of record-breaking flights early in 1928 before a crash ended its career.&lt;ref name="Bowers p. 71."/&gt;

Although Ryan capitalized on the notoriety of the NYP special, further developments were only superficially comparable to the ''Spirit of St. Louis''. An offshoot of the [[Ryan Brougham|Ryan B-1 Brougham]] emerged as a five-seater with the same J-5 engine but modified with a conventional cockpit layout and a shorter wingspan. Under the newly restructured B.F. Mahoney Company, further development continued with the six-place [[Ryan Brougham|Model B-7]] utilizing a 420&amp;nbsp;hp engine and the [[Ryan Foursome|Model C-1]] with the basic 220&amp;nbsp;hp engine. 

Shortly after the original ''Spirit'' was retired in April 1928, the Mahoney Aircraft Corporation presented Lindbergh with a Mahoney Ryan B-1 "Brougham".&lt;ref&gt;Cassagneres 2002, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, Mahoney built a B-1X as a gift for Charles Lindbergh.&lt;ref name="Bowers p. 71."&gt;Bowers 1967, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalimageservices.com/ryan_brougham/ "Charles Lindbergh and his Ryan Brougham B-1X (NX4215)."] ''DigitalimageServices.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot [[Frank Hawks]] purchased a Mahoney Ryan B-1 Brougham (NC3009) with money from his wife, naming the plane the "Spirit of San Diego." &lt;ref&gt;Forden 1973, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the media exposure surrounding Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, he flew to Washington with his wife on board to greet the triumphant Lindbergh. Due to the ensuing publicity, Hawks was hired by the Ryan Aircraft company to be its official representative. Hawks went on to tour the country, selling rides in the aircraft "like Lindy flew."&lt;ref&gt;Daniels 1969, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductions==

===Airworthy examples===
The Mahoney Ryan B-1 "Brougham" was also used as the basis of a reproduction of the ''Spirit of St. Louis''. The reproduction was used in the 1938 Paramount film ''[[Men with Wings]]'' starring [[Ray Milland]].&lt;ref name=bfm/&gt;

All three reproductions from the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St Louis]]'' (1956) have survived with B-153 on display at the [[Missouri History Museum]], in St. Louis, B-156 is part of the collection at [[The Henry Ford]] museum in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], and B-159 belongs to the [[Cradle of Aviation Museum]] located in Garden City, Long Island, New York, not far from the site of Roosevelt Field from which the original departed in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Cassagneres 2002, pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; According to information at the Henry Ford Museum, their copy (B-156) was actually owned by [[James Stewart]], who portrayed Lindbergh in the film.  Stewart is credited as having donated the aircraft to the Henry Ford.  Lindbergh was reputed to have flown one of the reproductions during the film's production, however, the connection to Lindbergh is now considered a myth.&lt;ref&gt;Cassagneres 2002, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spirit of St Louis at EAA Museum.JPG|thumb|''Spirit of St. Louis'' replica at [[EAA Aviation Museum]]]]
On the 40th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight, a new reproduction named ''Spirit 2'' was built by movie stunt pilot [[Frank Tallman]]. It first flew on April 24, 1967 and  appeared at the 1967 [[Paris Air Show]] where it made several flights over Paris. In 1972, ''Spirit 2'' was bought for $50,000 by the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]] (formerly San Diego Aerospace Museum) and placed on public display until it was destroyed by arson in 1978. The museum built a replacement named ''Spirit 3'' which first flew on April 28, 1979; it made seven flights before being placed on display. In August 2003, the ''Spirit 3'' was removed from display and was flown as a 75th Anniversary tribute to Lindbergh. The aircraft is now on display in the museum's rotunda.&lt;ref name="simpson2003"/&gt;

Through the efforts of both staff and volunteers, the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] produced two reproductions of the ''Spirit of St. Louis'', powered by [[Continental R-670]]-4 radial engines, the first in 1977 (the first of which was to be based on a conversion from a B-1 Brougham; the aircraft proved to be too badly deteriorated to be used in that manner) to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh’s flight across the Atlantic Ocean and subsequent tour of the United States. This example is now on display in the main museum gallery. A second reproduction, started from scratch in 1977 and first flown in November 1990, continues to fly at air shows and commemorative events. Both of the EAA reproductions were registered under the original's N-X-211.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirit of St Louis Replica Takes to the Sky." ''Air Progress'', April 1991, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another airworthy reproduction was built by David Cannavo and first flown in 1979, powered by a [[Lycoming R-680]] engine. In 1995, it was bought by [[Kermit Weeks]] for his [[Fantasy of Flight]] Museum in [[Polk City, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fantasyofflight.com/collection/aircraft/currently-not-showing-in-museum/golden-age/1927-spirit-of-st-louis/ "1927 Spirit of St. Louis".] ''[[Fantasy of Flight]]'' Retrieved: July 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reproduction of the ''Spirit'' (Registration ES-XCL), which had been built and certified in Estonia in 1997, was written off on May 31, 2003. Shortly after takeoff at an air show in Coventry, England, structural failure occurred, resulting in a fatal crash, killing its owner-pilot, Captain Pierre Holländer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/2953268.stm "Pilot killed in air show crash."] ''BBC News'', June 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| Even though the airframe only had 191 total hours, the accident investigation revealed the cause of the crash to be a metal fatigue failure of the starboard wing's "wishbone" strut resulting from a faulty weld.

A recently completed ''Spirit'' reproduction, intended for airworthiness is owned by the [[Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome]] (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, [[Cole Palen]] (1925–1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death, and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft maintenance manager Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project's start, with original, and still functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated — including the same basic type of [[earth inductor compass]] used by Lindbergh — matching the ones in the original ''Spirit'' at the NASM, with the goal of becoming the most authentic airworthy reproduction of the ''Spirit'' yet built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldrhinebeck.org/golden-age/ "Ryan NYP – Spirit of St. Louis."] ''[[Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome]]'', May 28, 2013.

'''Suzanne A.''' "'''Suzie'''" '''Bombardier''', (March 14, 1966{{snd}}June 22, 1980) was kidnapped, raped, and stabbed to death on June 22, 1980. On June 27, her body was found by a fisherman,  floating in the [[San Joaquin River]] east of [[Antioch, California]] near its [[Antioch Bridge|bridge]], {{convert|60|miles|0|abbr=off}} east of [[San Francisco]]. On December 11, 2017, after extensive [[DNA analysis]], 63-year-old Mitchell Lynn Bacom, a local [[registered sex offender]], was arrested as the prime suspect. This was Antioch's oldest [[cold case]] murder. "We never gave up on bringing this case to a successful resolution," said Antioch Police Chief Tammany Brooks. At the time of Bombardier's homicide, Bacom, currently residing in the 300 block of Madill Street, Antioch, was known to her family. He has been a person of interest all along. Bombardier was raped, stabbed in the chest, and her heart was punctured. The Antioch Police Department states that she was kidnapped from her sister's 3421 Hudson Street townhome in Antioch while she was babysitting her nieces. Her sister, Stephanie Mullen, arrived home at 4:00 a.m. to find Bombardier missing.&lt;ref name="East Bay Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Gartrell |first1 = Nate |last2 = Davis |first2 = Aaron |last3 = Coetsee |first3 = Rowena |title = Antioch police make arrest in 37-year-old kidnapping, homicide case |url = http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/12/11/antioch-police-solve-notorious-37-year-old-kidnapping-homicide-case/ |accessdate = December 12, 2017 |work = East Bay Times |date = December 12, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171212130551/http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/12/11/antioch-police-solve-notorious-37-year-old-kidnapping-homicide-case/ |archivedate = December 12, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombardier's father, Ted, said that she knew her killer, as there was no forced entry.

Fourteen-year-old Bombardier was an honor roll student at Antioch Junior High at the time of her homicide. She also belonged to the California Junior Scholastic Federation.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; She was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]].

In 2015, DNA samples from Bombardier's case were sent to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Forensic Laboratory for them to create a DNA profile. In early 2017, after advancements in DNA analysis technology, Antioch police were notified that a [[CODIS]] hit was made that tentatively identified Bacom as the perpetrator. After additional testing, when the samples were conclusively linked to Bacom through a federal DNA database, he was taken into custody without incident at his home.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KRON4"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Clifford |first1 = Charles |last2 = Cestone |first2 = Vince |title = Arrest made in 1980 cold-case murder of Antioch girl |url = http://kron4.com/2017/12/11/arrest-made-in-1980-cold-case-murder-of-14-year-old-antioch-girl/ |accessdate = December 12, 2017 |work = KRON4.com |date = December 12, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171212130551/http://kron4.com/2017/12/11/arrest-made-in-1980-cold-case-murder-of-14-year-old-antioch-girl/ |archivedate = December 12, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Bacom was tried for several crimes, convicted, and sentenced to five years to life imprisonment. In 1981 he was convicted for several more crimes and sentenced to 24 years in prison. In 2002 he failed to register as a sex offender and was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="East Bay Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioch Herald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payton|first1=Allen|title=Former officers offer assistance to solve cold case of Suzanne Bombardier, murdered in Antioch 35 years ago {{!}} Antioch Herald|url=http://antiochherald.com/2015/06/p16714/|accessdate=December 12, 2017|work=antiochherald.com|issue=8|date=June 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914004423/http://antiochherald.com/2015/06/p16714/|archivedate=September 14, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Strictly Come Dancing''''' (informally known as '''''Strictly''''') is a British television dance contest in which celebrities partner with professional dancers to compete in a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[Latin dance|Latin]] dance. Each couple is scored out of 10 by a panel of judges. The format has been [[Dancing with the Stars|exported to over 40 other countries]], and has also inspired a [[modern dance]]-themed spin-off ''[[Strictly Dance Fever]]''. The show is currently presented by [[Tess Daly]] and [[Claudia Winkleman]].

The show has run on [[BBC One]] since 15 May 2004, primarily on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show (with certain exceptions) and with its high viewing figures ''Strictly Come Dancing'' has become a significant programme in [[British popular culture]].{{According to whom|date=October 2018}} The fifteenth series ended on 16 December 2017. A further eleven stand-alone Christmas specials have also been produced, in consecutive years from 2004 onwards. Nine charity specials have also been produced since 2008. Since the fourth series, the show has also been aired in [[High-definition television|high definition]] on [[BBC HD]], and [[BBC One HD]] from series 8.

On 7 November 2013 it was announced that [[Bruce Forsyth|Sir Bruce Forsyth]] would be retiring from presenting the main series. While intended to return as host for each Children in Need and Christmas special, he only did so for the Christmas special in 2014 and the Children in Need special in 2015. He sent a video message for the 2015 Christmas special&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/dancing-11-year-old-cradling-11012094|title=The first and last TV appearances of Sir Bruce Forsyth|first=Seamus|last=Duff|date=18 August 2017|website=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412001334/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/dancing-11-year-old-cradling-11012094|archivedate=12 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was unable to appear due to his illness.

==Development==
Producer [[Richard Hopkins (TV producer)|Richard Hopkins]], who had produced the first UK series of ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'', unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a modern ''[[Come Dancing]]'' to the BBC under the title of Pro-Celebrity Dancing in 2003.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/9011191/Richard-Hopkins.html|title=Richard Hopkins|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111164943/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/9011191/Richard-Hopkins.html|archivedate=11 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving ''Come Dancing'', so [[Jane Lush]], the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Hopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced ''[[Comic Relief Does Fame Academy]]'' for BBC One and ''[[The Games (UK TV series)|The Games]]'' for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two|It Takes Two]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Karen|title=Broadcast|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/people/executive-producers/5009420.article|accessdate=9 July 2015|work=Broadcast Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711225917/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/people/executive-producers/5009420.article|archivedate=11 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Karen|title=Broadcast Karen Smith Promotion|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/bbc-promotion/1099299.article|accessdate=9 July 2015|agency=Broadcast|publisher=Media Business Insight|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711235101/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/bbc-promotion/1099299.article|archivedate=11 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Karen|title=BBC's Karen Smith Promoted|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/21/broadcasting.bbc1|accessdate=9 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=21 February 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710035637/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/21/broadcasting.bbc1|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-hopkins-producer-of-big-brother-and-strictly-come-dancing-6287682.html|title=Richard Hopkins: Producer of 'Big Brother' and 'Strictly Come Dancing'|author=Anthony Hayward|work=The Independent|date=11 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915135844/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-hopkins-producer-of-big-brother-and-strictly-come-dancing-6287682.html|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
From series 1 to 11, [[Bruce Forsyth|Sir Bruce Forsyth]] and [[Tess Daly]] presented the pro-celebrity ballroom dancing competition. From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by [[Claudia Winkleman]], at which point Daly assumed Forsyth's role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly's role as co-presenter. Winkleman has joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth's departure after the 2013 series. Through [[telephone voting]], viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/howtovote/terms.shtml | title=Strictly Come Dancing – How to vote | publisher=BBC | accessdate=5 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015034533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/howtovote/terms.shtml |archivedate = 15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profits from the telephone lines were donated to [[Sport Relief]] in series 1, and to [[Children in Need]] from series 2 to 5.

The show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by [[Tess Daly]] and [[Claudia Winkleman]] (however [[Zoë Ball]] covered for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir [[Bruce Forsyth]] presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26889405 |title=Sir Bruce Forsyth steps down from Strictly Come Dancing |publisher=BBC |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604042338/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26889405 |archivedate=4 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some of the second series, [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of [[Bruno Tonioli]], [[Arlene Phillips]], [[Len Goodman]] and [[Craig Revel Horwood]]. [[Alesha Dixon]] took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' which led retired ballerina [[Darcey Bussell|Dame Darcey Bussell]] to replace her; Bussell remains a judge alongside Tonioli and Revel Horwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/alesha-dixon-quits-strictly-come-dancing-for-britains-got-talent-6284102.html | title=Alesha Dixon quits Strictly Come Dancing for Britain's Got Talent | work=The Independent | first=Emma | last=Hallett | date=2 January 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112101441/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/alesha-dixon-quits-strictly-come-dancing-for-britains-got-talent-6284102.html | archivedate=12 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is [[Alan Dedicoat]]. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast "as live" on the Sunday.

The singers on the show are [[Tommy Blaize]], [[Hayley Sanderson]], [[Lance Ellington]], Andrea Grant and formerly the well known UK dance music vocalist [[Tara McDonald]]. The music director is [[David Arch]]. [[Tommy Blaize]] has been part of ''Strictly'' since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth.

The show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at the [[BBC Television Centre]], moving to the [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in 2013. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the [[Tower Ballroom]] in [[Blackpool]], where the original ''Come Dancing'' series was filmed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;{{cite web

The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool." Eventually, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, for series 7, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated.

===Dances===
On average, dances last for approximately 90 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-10-08/tim-wonnacott-there-are-never-enough-practice-hours-for-strictly-come-dancing|title=Strictly Come Dancing 2014: Tim Wonnacott's diary|author=Tim Wonnacott|work=Radio Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027212751/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-10-08/tim-wonnacott-there-are-never-enough-practice-hours-for-strictly-come-dancing|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for the dances are performed by The Strictly Come Dancing Band.
*The [[Waltz]], [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha Cha Cha]], [[Quickstep]], [[Rhumba|Rumba]], [[Tango (ballroom)|Tango]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], [[Foxtrot]], [[Paso Doble]] and [[Samba]] have all been danced since Series 1.
*The [[American Smooth]] and the [[Viennese Waltz]] were added in Series 3.
*The [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] and the [[Argentine Tango]] were added in Series 4.
*No more dances were added until Series 7, week 11 when couples performed either a [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] (which winner Chris Hollins chose to perform again in the final) or a [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock N' Roll]] routine. The final also featured a head-to-head [[Lindyhop]]. Of these dances, only the Charleston was retained for subsequent series, although elements of the Lindyhop have often featured in Showdances.
*Series 8 introduced the [[Swing (dance)|Swing-a-thon]], where all remaining couples dance Swing simultaneously and are voted off the dancefloor one by one by the judges until only one couple remains. This returned in Series 9 and 11.
*The tenth series featured a "Dance Fusion", in which the couples attempt to perform two dances consecutively in one routine.
*The twelfth series introduced the [[Waltz|Waltz-a-thon]], which uses the same manner as the Swing-a-thon of all remaining couples on the dance floor at the same time, all the couples dance Waltz. Afterwards, the results are revealed by the judges.
* The thirteenth series introduced a [[Quickstep|Quickstep-a-thon]], in which all seven remaining couples simultaneously performed a quickstep. The judges then ranked them one to seven and gave points accordingly.
*The fourteenth series saw the Cha-Cha-Challenge introduced, in which all six remaining couples simultaneously performed a cha-cha-cha. The judges then ranked them one to six and gave points accordingly.
*The sixteenth series introduced [[Contemporary dance|Contemporary]], [[Jazz (dance)|Jazz]], [[Street dance|Street]] dances as part of a "couples' choice" category.
*A [[Showdance]] (Freestyle) has always been performed in the series final as a last chance for couples to impress the public. However, since Series 8, the Showdance has been danced as the second dance in the final.

Prior to [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 10)|series 10]], the dances performed in the early weeks are switched between one Ballroom and one Latin, and are divided as evenly as possible depending on the number of contestants left. As the competition progressed further, this system is abandoned and many styles, not just two, can be performed in one week by each of the remaining contestants. From [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 4)|series 4]] through [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 4)|7]], the remaining contestants who made it to the semi-finals are granted to perform the semi-final-exclusive [[Argentine Tango]]. Beginning with series 10, this has all changed. The contestants are now allowed to dance whichever dance they are bestowed to (not accustomed to any patterns), though the Argentine Tango remains to be somewhat reserved for the latter stages of the series. The Showdance, however, is still restricted only for the finalists from the very first series until now.

===Coaching===
As of series four, coaches are Jaclyn Spencer and Chris Marques (aka Cuban Groove) for [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] and [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]], and Jenny Thomas and [[Ryan Francois]] for [[Swing (dance)|Swing]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], [[Rock n Roll]] and The [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]. The [[Argentine Tango]] coaches in series three were [[Flavia Cacace]] and [[Vincent Simone]], both of whom have subsequently competed in the show.

===Results show===

From Series 1-4, the results show was shown live, later on the Saturday after 1 hour after the performances.

From Series 5 onwards, the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers' votes which are completed by 21:30. This was confirmed by the official BBC website in 2008:

{{quote|The Sunday show is recorded on Saturday night but no element involving the results of the vote will start recording until after lines are closed and votes counted and verified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/vote/ Strictly Come Dancing Vote] BBC. Retrieved 18 October 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929061605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/vote/ |date=29 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the Sunday results show the presenters refer to 'last night' in reference to the main show, due to the timing of the Sunday programme, and Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman's and the judges' outfits are changed to present an illusion of a second live broadcast.

For Series 7, the Sunday results show was axed and put back to Saturday nights as a result of a revamp of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a170885/strictly-results-move-back-to-saturdays.html 'Strictly' results move back to Saturdays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813233155/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a170885/strictly-results-move-back-to-saturdays.html |date=13 August 2009 }} Digital Spy, 12 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was then put back on Sundays in Series 8.

===Dance-off===
{{unreferenced section |date=December 2015}}
A new system called the dance-off was introduced in series 5. It continued on the program through series 7, was not used for series 8 and 9, but was reinstated as of series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since. There are two couples in each dance-off, which occurs on the results show: the two who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and the public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt the dance a second time the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide who continues on the show and who is eliminated based on the second dance performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be "saved", that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the Head Judge, originally [[Len Goodman]] and currently [[Shirley Ballas]]. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance—some people call it waltzing out of the ballroom. The Monday after they are eliminated they appear on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two|It Takes Two]]'' to talk about their time on the show. The dance-off has been cancelled only once, in series 14, due to an injury sustained earlier by one of the contestants, [[Anastacia]]. She was unable to perform the dance-off, and the couple with the lowest total was eliminated.

===''Strictly: It Takes Two''===
{{Main article|Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two}}
During the run of ''Strictly Come Dancing'', ''Strictly: It Takes Two'' is broadcast each weeknight on [[BBC Two]]. The series was previously hosted by Claudia Winkleman; but, due to her pregnancy in 2011, she had to leave the series, and Zoë Ball took over from Series 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s104/strictly-come-dancing/news/a328492/zoe-ball-to-host-strictly-come-dancing-spinoff-im-giddy-with-glee.html Zoë Ball to host 'Strictly Come Dancing' spinoff: "I'm giddy with glee"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710014601/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s104/strictly-come-dancing/news/a328492/zoe-ball-to-host-strictly-come-dancing-spinoff-im-giddy-with-glee.html |date=10 July 2011 }} Digital Spy, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The show features reviews of the performances during the previous Saturday's show, and interviews with, and training footage of, the couples preparing for the next show. The judges and other celebrities also provide their opinions on how the couples are doing. ''It Takes Two'' replaced ''Strictly Come Dancing on Three'', hosted by [[Justin Lee Collins]], which ran on [[BBC Three]] during the first series. Prior to 2010, [[BBC Two Scotland]] aired the programme on four nights only, running their own [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic-language]] programming on Thursdays instead.

===Series 5 (2007)===
{{Main article|Strictly Come Dancing (series 5)}}
The fifth series of ''Strictly Come Dancing'' began on BBC One on 29 September 2007, with Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly returning as presenters. For the first and only time, the line up of professionals was unchanged from the previous series. The first programme was a catch-up show and preview to the new series, before the start of the competition on 6 October, which ran for 12 weeks.

The show featured 14 new celebrities, who were paired with 14 professional dancers. In a change to the previous format, the results show was recorded on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday, rather than shown live later on Saturday. In addition to this, the two couples who were at the bottom of the table after the viewers' vote were subject to a dance-off, where they reprised their routine, for the judges to decide who left. Head Judge [[Len Goodman]] had the casting vote in case of a tie. The series raised just over a million pounds for Children in Need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/news/2008/01/09/51953.shtml | title=Children in Need proceeds |accessdate=19 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112193042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/news/2008/01/09/51953.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 6 (2008)===
{{Main article|Strictly Come Dancing (series 6)}}
A sixth series of the show was confirmed after the dancers' pay dispute was called off in late June 2008.&lt;ref name="scd2008-ds"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a104277/strictly-dancers-end-pay-row.html | title='Strictly' dancers end pay row | author=Alex Fletcher | work=Digital Spy | date=26 June 2008 | accessdate=1 July 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701023707/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a104277/strictly-dancers-end-pay-row.html | archivedate=1 July 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series lasted for 14 weeks, which is the longest series so far.&lt;ref name="scd2008-ds" /&gt; The series involved three new professional dancers, [[Brian Fortuna]], [[Hayley Holt]] and [[Kristina Rihanoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ballroomdancechannel.ning.com/profile/BrianFortuna | title=Brian Fortuna's Page | publisher=Ballroom Dance Channel | accessdate=11 August 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915110335/http://ballroomdancechannel.ning.com/profile/BrianFortuna | archivedate=15 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole Cutler did not return to the series.

In July 2008 it was reported that current EastEnders cast members were banned from taking part in the competition due to the length of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article1462064.ece | title=Strictly No Dancing | author=Sara Nathan | work=The Sun | date=24 July 2008 | accessdate=1 August 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904232916/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article1462064.ece | archivedate=4 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 7 (2009)===
{{Main article|Strictly Come Dancing (series 7)}}
The seventh series of ''Strictly Come Dancing'' ran from 18 September until 19 December 2009.&lt;ref name="bbcnews-alesha" /&gt; Tess Daly signed a two-year deal to continue presenting the programme for at least the 2009 and 2010 series'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a160893/report-daly-signs-new-strictly-deal.html |title=Strictly Come Dancing – News – Report: Daly signs new 'Strictly' deal |work=Digital Spy |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723033931/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/a160893/report-daly-signs-new-strictly-deal.html |archivedate=23 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2009, former competitor [[Alesha Dixon]] was confirmed to be joining the judging panel for this series, and that [[Darcey Bussell]] would be a guest judge towards the end of the series run. Dixon replaced [[Arlene Phillips]] who moved to ''[[The One Show]]'' as a ''Strictly Come Dancing'' expert.&lt;ref name="bbcnews-alesha"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8142139.stm |title=Dixon joins Strictly dance judges |publisher=BBC News |date= 9 July 2009|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported in the media that many of the show's professional dancers are furious at Phillips being replaced by Dixon. They apparently feel that they "will be judged by someone who knows less than they do about dancing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Nick |last=McDermott |author2=Thomas, Liz |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1199183/Strictly-dancers-furious-appointment-gimmick-judge-Alesha-Dixon.html |title=Strictly dancers furious at appointment of 'gimmick' judge Alesha Dixon |work=Daily Mail |date=12 July 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802180732/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1199183/Strictly-dancers-furious-appointment-gimmick-judge-Alesha-Dixon.html |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC were also accused of sexism, as none of the male judges on the show had been replaced. The BBC received over 5,000 complaints. Dixon's fans were also unhappy as she had to cancel a number of dates on her autumn tour to do the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.sky.com/strictly-backlash |title=Strictly Backlash |publisher=Sky TV |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716174424/http://tv.sky.com/strictly-backlash |archivedate=16 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official line-up was revealed on 25 August 2009 and the winner was ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' presenter [[Chris Hollins]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8220020.stm?lsf | title=Strictly reveals dancing line-up | publisher=BBC News| date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 9 (2011)===
{{Main article|Strictly Come Dancing (series 9)}}
Strictly returned with a launch show on 10 September 2011, with the final in December at the [[Tower Ballroom, Blackpool]]. [[Bruce Forsyth]] and [[Tess Daly]] returned to front the main show, and [[Claudia Winkleman]] presented the Sunday night results show along with Daly.

For ''[[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two]]'', a new presenter joined the team. Winkleman had to pull out of the 2011 series as it would be difficult to do a daily programme so soon after giving birth and was replaced by [[Zoë Ball]].

All of series eight's judges returned to the show. [[Jennifer Grey]] served as a cover judge for [[Len Goodman]] during week six due to his break from the show. This was the last series to feature [[Alesha Dixon]] as a judge after she left the show after the final to become a judge on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''

The professional line-up was announced on 15 June 2011 with most of the Series 8 professionals returning, except for [[Jared Murillo (dancer)|Jared Murillo]] who was replaced by Siberian dancer [[Pasha Kovalev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/06_june/15/strictly.shtml New professional dancer joins Strictly Come Dancing 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105064610/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/06_june/15/strictly.shtml |date=5 January 2012 }} BBC Press Office, 15 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity line-up was announced on 6 September 2011 on ''[[The One Show]]'' and the couples were paired up for the first time on the launch show.

===Series 15 (2017)===
{{main article|Strictly Come Dancing (series 15)}}

On 4 May 2017, Series 7 finalist, [[Natalie Lowe]] announced that she would be departing the show. Five days later, [[Shirley Ballas]] announced that she would be replacing [[Len Goodman]] as head judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/09/queen-of-latin-shirley-ballas-replace-len-goodman-strictly-come-dancing-head-judge|title='Queen of Latin' Shirley Ballas to be head judge on Strictly Come Dancing|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=9 May 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 September 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064539/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/09/queen-of-latin-shirley-ballas-replace-len-goodman-strictly-come-dancing-head-judge|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2017, previous series professional champion, [[Joanne Clifton]], as well as [[Oksana Platero]] announced that they would also be leaving. The new professionals replacing them are Australian Open champion, [[Dianne Buswell]], Welsh dancer, [[Amy Dowden]], and Ukrainian two-time world champion, [[Nadiya Bychkova]]. On 7 August, [[Nick Grimshaw]] announced that [[Mollie King]] is the first celebrity to be taking part this series. This is the first series to be broadcast since Sir Bruce Forsyth's death in August that year.
In a change to the format of previous five years, there was no elimination in the final, hence there were three runner-up couples this series.

&lt;!--Please don't add the result before the results show is broadcast if you've read the spoiler. It will ruin it for people who want to wait for the results to air.--&gt;

On forty-seven occasions, a perfect 40 out of 40 has been awarded inside the main series (including three perfect 50 out of 50s in Series 7). [[Caroline Flack]] and [[Pasha Kovalev]], and [[Danny Mac]] and [[Oti Mabuse]] both hold the record for most perfect scores with four forties. Kovalev also holds the record for most perfect scores by a professional dancer with eight forties. On another eight occasions, a couple scored 40/40 on a Christmas Special. The [[Rhumba|Rumba]] is the only dance style not to have received the perfect score.

Here is a table showing all of the perfect scores achieved by number of perfect scores

The lowest score the judges have ever awarded was 8/40 (1,1,3,3) to [[Quentin Willson]] and [[Hazel Newberry]] for their Cha Cha Cha. Eleven individual ones have been awarded in the entirety of Strictly Come Dancing, with ten of those coming from [[Craig Revel Horwood]] and the other coming from [[Arlene Philips]]. [[Ann Widdecombe]] holds the current record for the most ones, receiving ones from Revel Horwood for her [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Samba]], and [[Rhumba|Rumba]]. The biggest margin between two singular judges scores is five, awarded to [[Jason Wood (comedian)|Jason Wood]] and [[Kylie Jones]] for their [[Rhumba|Rumba]] (2,5,7,5), [[Christopher Parker]] and [[Hanna Karttunen]] for their Tango (2,6,7,6), [[Fiona Philips]] and [[Brendan Cole]] for their Rumba (1,2,6,4), [[Gary Rhodes]] and [[Karen Hardy]] for their Cha-Cha-Cha (1,5,6,5), [[Scott Maslen]] and [[Natalie Lowe]] for their [[Rhumba|Rumba]] (4,9,7,8), [[Mark Benton]] and [[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. season 8)#Top 20 Finalists|Iveta Lukosiute]] for their Cha-Cha-Cha (3,8,8,7), and [[Scott Mills]] and [[Joanne Clifton]] for their Samba with Donny Osmond (2,5,7,5,6).
 	
[[Alexandra Burke]] and her partner [[Gorka Márquez]] hold the record of most tens with 32, then that is followed by [[Ricky Whittle]] and his partner [[Natalie Lowe]] with 28. However, if the four tens given by [[Darcey Bussell]] during her tenure as a fifth judge are removed, he is behind [[Danny Mac]] and [[Oti Mabuse]], with 26 tens, and [[Rachel Stevens]] and her partner [[Vincent Simone]] and [[Harry Judd]] and his partner [[Aliona Vilani]] with 25 each. They are followed by [[Natalie Gumede]] and [[Artem Chigvintsev]], and [[Ore Oduba]] and [[Joanne Clifton]] with 24 each, [[Caroline Flack]] and [[Pasha Kovalev]] with 23, [[Abbey Clancy]] and [[Aljaž Skorjanec]] with 22, [[Kara Tointon]] and [[Artem Chigvintsev]] with 21 and [[Lisa Snowdon]] and [[Brendan Cole]], [[Kimberley Walsh]] and [[Pasha Kovalev]] and [[Denise van Outen]] and [[James Jordan (dancer)|James Jordan]] with 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatestrictly.com/celebrity-10s/ League table for Celebrities scoring 10s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426060047/http://www.ultimatestrictly.com/celebrity-10s/ |date=26 April 2012 }} Ultimate Strictly&lt;/ref&gt; Of these celebrities, Snowdon and Cole and Flack and Kovalev are the only pairings to receive straight tens from the judges in all of their dances in their respective series finals. Flack and Kovalev are the only pair to manage three sets of perfect 40 marks in the final, and also hold the records for the longest consecutive streak of 40 marks with four, that includes their Salsa in the semi-final show, and the longest consecutive streak of tens, that adds to a total of 16.
 	
Gumede and Chigvintsev also have the best average score from the judges out of all contestants on every series being 36.9/40 for their dances. [[Danny Mac]] and [[Oti Mabuse]], and [[Alesha Dixon]] and her partner [[Matthew Cutler]], follow, with averages of 36.6 and 36.5 respectively. [[Quentin Willson]], [[Susannah Constantine]] and [[Diarmuid Gavin]] hold averages of 8.0, 12.0 and 13.8, the lowest of any celebrities so far.

===Highest and lowest scoring performances by dance===
The best and worst performances in each dance according to the judges' marks (out of 40) are as follows (not including scores earned on Christmas or any other specials).		 
	
For a more accurate comparison [[Darcey Bussell]]'s scores have been subtracted from the totals of the Series 7 quarter-finalists where relevant; specifically [[Ali Bastian]]'s American Smooth, [[Chris Hollins]]' Charleston and [[Ricky Whittle]]'s Quickstep. Bussell scored all of them a ten. Whittle's Showdance has not been included as it did not receive the perfect score from Bussell, and therefore cannot be considered the same standard. The Rumba is the only dance that has not received the full mark of 40, the highest score being 39/40. Winner of series 12, [[Caroline Flack]], and runner-up of series 14, [[Danny Mac]], hold the record for receiving the most perfect scores as a celebrity with four. With nine perfect scores, Flack's partner [[Pasha Kovalev]] holds the record for most perfect scores by a professional dancer.
 	
&lt;!--Do NOT remove the scores including Darcey Bussell's. For example - to say that Harry Judd had the best Charleston ever is wrong, because he scored 39, and you can't remove Chris Hollins just because there was an extra judge present. Chris scored a perfect 40 without Darcey. Additionally, do not add the Rock and Roll, Lindyhop, Fusion, or any other one-off dance styles.--&gt;

==Controversies==

===Phone voting===
On 13 December 2008, ''Strictly Come Dancing'' became the subject of press attention and viewer complaints about an error in the voting system during the semi-final of [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 6)|series six]]. In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third - [[Tom Chambers (actor)|Tom Chambers]] and [[Camilla Dallerup]] - were in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to survive. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final; all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition; and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/45870/issue132.pdf|title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin - Issue number 132|last=|first=|date=2009-04-27|website=|publisher=[[Ofcom]]|pages=42-43|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC received 1800 complants about the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/16/strictlycomedancing-bbc|title=Strictly Come Dancing fans offered refund by BBC after voting fiasco as complaints top 1,800|last=Deans|first=Jason|date=2008-12-16|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while media regulator [[Ofcom]] received 297.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jon Beazley, the BBC's Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on ''Strictly''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s spin-off show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two]]'' on 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an "unprecedented situation." On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on their website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer "fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/2008/news/december/wk13_news_update_151208.shtml|title=BBC - Strictly Come Dancing 2008 - News: Week 13 Results Update|last=|first=|date=2008-12-15|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also stated that, following the mistake, "the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that "the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received", and that they were "satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised." Ofcom also opined that: "the BBC had been open and transparent with viewers about the mistake it made and the solution adopted."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arlene Phillips / Alesha Dixon===
In June 2008, tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that the then 66-year-old judge [[Arlene Phillips]], who had judged the show since its [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 1)|inception]] in 2004, was to replaced by [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 5)|series five]] winner [[Alesha Dixon]], then aged 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8106527.stm|title=Judge's Strictly exit unconfirmed|last=|first=|date=2009-06-18|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/09/arlene-phillips-strictly-come-dancing-bbc|title=BBC denies ageism as Arlene Phillips shifted off Strictly Come Dancing|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|date=2009-07-09|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the BBC was accused of [[ageism]] and [[sexism]] by several sources,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/strictly-come-dancing/5844671/Strictly-Come-Dancings-Arlene-Phillips-is-a-victim-of-ageism-says-Harriet-Harman.html|title=Strictly Come Dancing's Arlene Phillips is a victim of ageism, says Harriet Harman|last=Singh|first=Anita|date=2009-07-16|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older presenters, including [[Moira Stuart]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/11/miriam-oreilly-standing-up-bbc|title=Miriam O'Reilly: 'Standing up to the BBC was the right thing to do'|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2011-01-11|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juliet Morris]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/countryfile-bbc|title=Countryfile shifts to peak time but loses middle-aged female hosts|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|date=2008-11-28|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miriam O'Reilly]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Michaela Strachan]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Charlotte Smith (broadcaster)|Charlotte Smith]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and [[Anna Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/27/mondaymediasection.television|title=Interview with Anna Ford|last=Hagerty|first=Bill|date=2007-08-27|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Furthermore, Dixon herself was criticised after the debut episode of the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 7)|seventh series]], the first to feature her as a judge. A total of 272 complaints were received by the BBC - bringing the total number about Dixon joining the programme to over 4000 - along with over 5000 comments on ''Strictly Come Dancing''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s internet message board.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8266534.stm|title=Complaints over Strictly's Dixon|last=|first=|date=2009-09-21|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon was compared unfavourably to Phillips, with claims that the former was "unsuitable", "unqualified" and lacked "knowledge, experience and talent".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, Dixon was praised and defended from her critics by the BBC,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; by fellow judge [[Craig Revel Horwood]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and by Phillips herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/sep/21/alesha-dixon-strictly-come-dancing|title=Alesha Dixon's debut as Strictly judge draws more than 250 complaints|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=2009-09-21|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race row===
In 2009, during the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 7)|seventh series]], professional dancer [[Anton du Beke]] issued a public apology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/05/anton-du-beke-carol-thatcher-apologies|title=The apologies of Anton du Beke and Carol Thatcher in full|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=2009-10-05|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his use of a [[racial slur]] during a conversation with his dance partner [[Laila Rouass]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/05/strictly-come-dancing-race|title=Strictly Come Dancing: Anton Du Beke apologises over racist term|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|date=2009-10-05|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Beke claimed that the comment, which was never broadcast, was a joke referring to Rouass' spray-tan, in which he said that she "looked like a [[Paki (slur)|Paki]]".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments [[Bruce Forsyth]], then host of ''Strictly Come Dancing'', made about the controversy on a [[Talksport]] radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain "used to have a sense of humour" about such incidents, and that du Beke's apology should be accepted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/09/strictly-come-dancing-bruce-forsyth|title=Bruce Forsyth spurs surge in Strictly Come Dancing complaints|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|date=2009-10-09|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, and Forsyth's response, the BBC stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;Racially offensive language in the workplace is entirely unacceptable. Anton was right to apologise quickly and without reservation and Laila has wholly accepted his apology. Everyone is very clear that there can be no repetition of this behaviour.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Forsyth also clarified his position:&lt;blockquote&gt;What Anton said to Laila was wrong and he has apologised unreservedly for this. Nor do I in any way excuse or condone the use of such language. To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable. However, there is a major difference between this and racist comments which are malicious in intent and whilst I accept that we live in a world of extraordinary political correctness, we should keep things in perspective.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Same-sex couples===

In 2015, in an interview with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[CJ de Mooi]] said that he was turned down for the show because he had wanted to dance with a same-sex partner. In response, the BBC said "Strictly is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictly-come-dancing-reject-cj-6384863|title=Strictly hasn't started but there's already been a bust-up|last=Watts|first=Halina|date=2015-09-05|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including [[Will Young]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/strictly-come-dancing-same-sex-couples-will-young_uk_59c287cde4b087fdf50991b2|title=Will Young Weighs In On 'Strictly Come Dancing' Same-Sex Couples Debate|last=|first=|date=2017-09-20|work=[[HuffPost UK]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Calman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/12/strictly-come-dancing-susan-calman-gender-gay-partner-television|title=Susan Calman same-sex pairing row: is fancying your partner Strictly necessary?|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2017-09-12|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rinder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/judge-rinder-strictly-come-dancing_uk_59bfd246e4b086432b08c0ce?a4g|title=Judge Rinder Weighs In On 'Strictly Come Dancing' Same-Sex Partners Debate|last=|first=|date=2017-09-18|work=[[HuffPost UK]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Coles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/03/strictly-come-dancing-will-not-have-same-sex-couples-year/|title=Strictly Come Dancing will not have same-sex couples this year|last=Ward|first=Victoria|date=2018-08-03|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ranj Singh]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/22/shirley-ballas-backs-dr-ranj-to-have-same-sex-partner-on-strictly-its-two-humans-moving-to-music-7871107/|title=Shirley Ballas backs Dr Ranj to have same sex partner on Strictly Come Dancing|last=|first=|date=2018-08-22|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Strictly Come Dancing'' judges [[Shirley Ballas]]&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and [[Craig Revel Horwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/24/strictlys-craig-revel-horwood-backs-campaign-for-same-sex-couples-to-be-added-to-the-show-7974389/|title=Strictly's Craig Revel Horwood backs same-sex couples being added to the show|last=|first=|date=2018-09-24|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples.

===Strictly curse===
The so-called "Strictly curse" has been blamed for the number of affairs and relationship break-ups that have occurred during or soon after taking part in the show.&lt;ref name="BBC curse"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Cherry |title=Has the Strictly curse struck again? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45783682 |website=BBC News |accessdate=13 October 2018 |date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele curse"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Strictly Curse: a history of how one Saturday night TV show wreaked domestic havoc |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/curse-strictly-romances-have-crumbled-pressure-dancefloor/ |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such incident was the suggested affair between dancer [[Brendan Cole]] and newsreader [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] during the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 1)|initial series]]: they both denied the affair, but the surrounding controversy resulted in the ending of both their long term relationships.&lt;ref name="Tele curse" /&gt;

'''''SuperNews!''''' was a half-hour, satirical animated television series which aired on [[Current TV]]. It was created by Josh Faure-Brac who also wrote for the show and performed the majority of male voices. The show is primarily based on popular culture satire and political humor. Frequent characters include animated interpretations of such mainstream figures as President of the United States [[Barack Obama]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]], [[Hillary Clinton]], Senator [[John McCain]], and various pop-culture icons and celebrities such as [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Perez Hilton]], and [[Britney Spears]].

==History==
[[Josh Faure-Brac]] created the pilot for ''SuperNews!'' in 2005 which was developed to appear with the launch of the new cable network [[Current TV]] and subsequently all of the art and animation was created by Faure-Brac and [[Steven K. L. Olson]] until 2006. Faure-Brac and Olson were then joined by animator [[Dustin McLean]] (of [[literal music video]]) who later became assistant director for the show. SuperNews! episodes (short-form segments) aired in [[Current TV]]'s "shuffle" rotation.

In March 2009, as [[Current TV]] started shifting to more traditional 30-minute programming, the show transitioned to a full half-hour program consisting of several shorts married together by thematic transitions. During these transitions, the show's logo and mascot Earf would appear in very brief scenes that often related to the previous or upcoming segment.

Season 2 premiered on November 12, 2009.

SuperNews! formerly aired every Thursday night on [[Current TV]] at 11:00 P.M./10:00 P.M. Central

SuperNews! was cancelled on May 12, 2010.

Rambo vs. Terror was also recompiled and aired as a classic.

In October 2009, SuperNews! made a cartoon called '''The First Halloween''', seemingly to explain the holiday in addition to their already explained Thanksgiving and Christmas.

==Deletions==
*During the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoon controversy]], Current TV briefly took down the cartoon ''The Gods Must Be Bowling'' off of their website.
*The cartoon ''Goodbye, Mr. Rove'' had been removed from Current TV's website due to a reservation copyright on the song ''[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]''; however it remained on Current TV's [[YouTube]] profile until all videos were removed in August 2013.
*Current TV had a problem with some copyrighted songs in ''Rambo vs. Terror'', and deleted all episodes of this cartoon series on Current TV's website. All episodes eventually appeared in a SuperNews! Classics episodes with changed songs.
*After [[Michael Jackson]]'s and [[Ted Kennedy]]'s death, their caricatures were deleted from the opening sequence, but the episode with [[Ted Kennedy]] (''Revenge of the Nerds'') was reemitted after his death in an edition of SuperNews! Classics.

[[File:L'italiana in Algeri set design by Francesco Bagnara.jpg|thumb|210 px|Set design by [[Francesco Bagnara]] for the production of ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' at the Teatro San Benedetto in 1826]]
The '''Teatro San Benedetto''' was a theatre in [[Venice]], particularly prominent in the operatic life of the city in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It saw the premieres of over 140 [[operas]], including Rossini's ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and was the theatre of choice for the presentation of ''[[opera seria]]'' until [[La Fenice]] was built in 1792.

==History==
The small, elegant theatre was first constructed by [[Grimani|Michele Grimani]] on land owned by the [[House of Venier|Venier]] family. It was inaugurated on 26 December 1755 with a performance of [[Gioacchino Cocchi]]'s opera ''Zoe''. In 1766 the ownership of the San Benedetto passed from Grimani to a consortium of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families in Venice who had been [[Box (theatre)|box]] holders at the theatre. The original design of the theatre was circular. However it was rebuilt in the traditional horseshoe shape following a fire in 1773. 

In 1765 [[Vincenzo Galeotti]] who danced here from 1761 became the ballet master of the theatre and staged his first ballet here (at that time besides Galeotty and his wife Antonia there were two soloists and 16 corps de ballet dancers in the company). In 1772—1773 the ballet master of San Benedetto was [[Gasparo Angiolini]].

In 1782 Teatro San Benedetto hosted the ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord, Russian prince [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel Petrovich]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|his spouse]], visiting Venice. 

In 1786 the owners' consortium had to cede the theatre to the Venier family following a lawsuit, and later went on to build La Fenice. The theatre then became the '''Teatro Venier''' (or Teatro Venier in San Benedetto). 

In 1810, the ownership passed to the impresario Giovanni Gallo, and for a time it was known as the '''Teatro Gallo'''. His sons, who had inherited the theatre in 1847, renamed it '''Teatro Rossini''' in 1868 in honour of [[Gioachino Rossini]] whose operas ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' and ''[[Eduardo e Cristina]]'' had premiered there earlier in the century, but by then its glory days as an opera house were over.

In 1937 the building was completely remodelled as a [[movie theater]], the Cinema Rossini, with a new facade by the Italian architect [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The cinema was closed in 2007 and will undergo restoration in 2010 in a project financed by the City of Venice.

Up to this date, "False" and "Like You Used To" remain commercially unreleased, while "The Icile Melts" was re-recorded and released a year later on the band’s second album, ''[[No Need to Argue]]''.
The complete session was broadcast again on 7 December 2011 on Dan Hegarty's ''Alternative to Sleep'' show (RTÉ 2FM).&lt;ref&gt;RTÉ 2FM.

It is unclear if another Dave Fanning Session took place, since information about the Cranberries’ Fanning Sessions remains scarce and sometimes contradictory in the fan community. In 2002, Zombieguide webmaster, Alex Kraus, received CD-Rs from the Cranberries’ drummer, [[Fergal Lawler]], which contained some tracks identified as being from a 1990 Dave Fanning Session.&lt;ref name=Zombieguide1&gt;Kraus, Alex.[http://www.zombieguide.com/news/2002/04/09/exclusive-full-watercircle-xeric-records-demo-downloads/ "Exclusive: Full "Watercircle" &amp; Xeric Records Demo Downloads"], Zombieguide.com, April 9, 2002. Retrieved on 2011-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Since some of the information from those CD-Rs are now know to be inaccurate (e.g., the four 1991 Fanning Session tracks are identified as "Xeric Demos"), we cannot confirm the existence of a 1990 Dave Fanning Session. It possible that the information on those CD-R tracks was mixed up sometime between the original tape recording in the early 1990s and the CD transfer, a decade later.

===The John Peel Session===
The Cranberries worked on a studio session for the [[John Peel]] show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The session, produced by Dale Griffin and engineered by Nick Gomm, was recorded at Maida Vale 4 on January 16, 1992 and broadcast a month later, on February 16.&lt;ref name=Peel&gt;BBC Radio 1.

P. J. Abdul Kalam]] in New Delhi on January 24, 2004]]

'''Wangala''' (also known as The Hundred Drums Festival, Wanma, Wanma Rongchua) is a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the [[Garo (tribe)|Garo]] tribe, who live in [[Meghalaya]] and [[Assam]] in [[India]] and Greater [[Mymensingh]] in [[Bangladesh]]. In this post harvest festival, they give thanks to Misi Saljong (also known as ''Pattigipa Ra'rongipa''), the [[sun god]], for blessing the people with a rich harvest. Wangala is celebrated in the months from September to December, with different villages setting different dates for the occasion.

==History of modern Wangala==

The first Hundred Drums Wangala Festival was organized on December 6 and 7, 1976 at Asanang, near the Rongram C&amp;RD Block Office, 18&amp;nbsp;km from Tura, India. Since then, it has been celebrated every year. The festival has grown so big as to include dance troupes from outside Garo Hills such as [[Bangladesh]] and [[Karbi Anglong]], with a sizeable amount of prize money up for grabs awarded to the best performing dance troupe. The 100 Drums Festival is a state sponsored event, attracting many local, national and international tourists every year.

==The Celebrations==
Wangala is traditionally celebrated for two to three days - or up to a week - by two or three collaborating villages; though recently it has been celebrated for one day in metropolitan areas as an attempt to conserve the ancient heritage of the [[Garo people|Garo]] tribe and to expose the younger generation to their roots. True traditional styles of celebrating Wangala can be found in remote "Songsarek" ([[animistic]]) villages such as Sadolpara in [[West Garo Hills]] district of [[Meghalaya]], where people who worship the old gods still persist in their way of life; all the while rejecting [[Christianity]]. A much more hyped and  commercialised variant of Wangala can be observed in the 100 Drums Festival held at
Asanang in West Garo Hills, Meghalaya, where performers (who may or may not be [[Christians]] and not Songsarek) are invited from all over Garo Hills, and even from far off places such as [[Karbi Anglong]], [[Tripura]] and [[Bangladesh]] which have sizeable pockets of Garo inhabitants. This mega event is held for three days and is a host to various fan favourites such as sports, food, art and culture.  [[Tura, Meghalaya|Tura]], the cultural, financial and de facto political heartland of the [[Garos]], is mainly represented by the students of [[Christian Girls' Higher Secondary School, Tura]] (which teaches the dance to its students as an essential part of the curriculum) at every 100 Drums Festival.

''Rugala'' (lit. The Pouring of [[rice beer]]) and ''Cha·chat So·a'' (lit. [[Incense]] burning) are the rituals performed on the first day by the priest, who is known as "Kamal". These rituals are performed inside the house of the ''Nokma'' (chieftain i.e. the husband of the woman who holds power over an a'king) of the village. ''Dama Gogata'', the dance with drums, flutes and assorted brass instruments by men and women in colourful dresses and proud headgear - a picture which is synonymous with visuals of Wangala - is performed on the last day of the days-long celebration.

During Wangala, people young and old dress in their colourful garments (''Dakmanda", Daksari'', or ''Gando'') and feathered headgear (''do'me'') and dance to music played on long, oval-shaped drums (''Dama'').

''Katta Doka'' (talking in a singing style/traditional tribal [[rapping]]), ''Ajia'', ''Dani Doka'' (describing Wangala by singing), ''Chambil Mesaa'' or the Pomelo Dance are performed during these days.

A '''war diary''' is a regularly updated official record kept by [[Military organization|military units]] of their activities during wartime. The purpose of these diaries is to both record information which can later be used by the military to improve its training and tactics as well as to generate a detailed record of units' activities for future use by historians. War diaries are focused on the administration and operations of the unit they cover, and generally do not contain information about individual personnel.&lt;ref name="AWM_War Diaries"&gt;{{cite web|title=War Diaries|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War diaries were invented by the [[Prussian Army]]. On 22 April 1850, the [[Prussian Minister of War]], [[August von Stockhausen]], ordered that all commanders of major units should keep war diaries. All significant military actions, relocations, important messages and orders, casualties, material losses, reinforcements etc. were to be recorded. Subsequent regulations of 1870, 1895, 1916 and 1940 were largely identical to the 1850 regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch zur Deutschen Militärgeschichte''. Militärverlag der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik VEB, Berlin 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Army]] first required that its units keep war diaries in 1907 as a means of preventing its mistakes of the [[Second Boer War]] from being repeated, and units currently operating in Afghanistan continue to maintain such diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The war diaries kept by Australian military units are normally maintained by the unit's adjutant or intelligence officer and contain a regularly updated narrative of its activities as well as copies of reports, messages received and maps.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2008), pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

WWII ''War Diaries'' from units of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] (including all ships) and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] were declassified on December 31, 2012 by the [[Chief of Naval Operations|Office of the Chief of Naval Operations]] (OCNO) and made available to the public through the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). These ''war diaries'' are part of a larger collection of records from the OCNO at NARA, currently spanning 1875 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Records of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, 1875 - 2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, 1875 - 2006 |url=https://research.archives.gov/description/367|publisher=NARA|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6210">The '''William James Lectures''' are a series of invited lectureships at [[Harvard University]] sponsored by the Departments of [[Philosophy]] and [[Psychology]], who alternate in the selection of speakers.  The series was created in honor of the American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]], a former faculty member at that institution. It was endowed through a 1929 bequest from Edgar Pierce, a Harvard Alumnus, who also funded the prestigious Edgar Pierce Chair in Philosophy and Psychology.  Pierce stipulated that the delivered lectures be open to the public and subsequently published by the [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Alumni Bulletin'', ''34'' (22), (Fri. March 4, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; The program was initiated in 1930 and has continued to the present. Its invited lecturers have included some of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In some cases, the selection of lecturer has generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, R. (2001).  ''Bertrand Russell: The ghost of madness, 1921–1970.''

He was a long-time [[print syndication|syndicated]] political columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and wrote the "On Language" column in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' about popular [[etymology]], new or unusual usages, and other [[language]]-related topics.

==Early life==
Safire was born William Lewis Safir in [[New York City]], New York the son of Ida (née Panish) and Oliver Craus Safir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/william-safire/ |title=William Safire Biography |publisher=BookRags.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/print/2008/08/01/no-bull-bill.php |title=No Bull Bill – People &amp; Politics |publisher=Washingtonian |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was [[Jewish]], and originated in [[Romania]] on his father's side.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=On language|publisher=Avon Books|year=1981|page=236|isbn=0-380-56457-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safire later added the "e" to his surname for pronunciation reasons, though some of his relatives continue to use the original spelling.

Safire graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]], a [[Specialized high schools in New York City|specialized public high school]] in New York City. He attended [[Syracuse University]] but dropped out after two years. He delivered the commencement address at Syracuse in 1978 and 1990, and became a trustee of the university.

==Career==
[[File:In the event of moon disaster.jpg|thumb|William Safire memo to [[H. R. Haldeman]] to be used in the event that [[Apollo 11]] ended in disaster.]]

He was a [[public relations]] executive from 1955 to 1960.  Previously, he had been a [[radio]] and [[television producer]] and an [[United States Army|Army]] [[correspondent]].  He worked as a publicist for a homebuilder who exhibited a model home at an American [[trade fair]] at [[Sokolniki Park]] in [[Moscow]] in 1959—the one in which [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had their famous [[Kitchen Debate]].  A widely circulated [[black-and-white]] photograph of the event was taken by Safire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/opinion/24safire.html?_r=1 |title=Safire, William. "The Cold War's Hot Kitchen," ''The New York Times'', Friday, July 24, 2009 |website=The New York Times |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Safire joined Nixon's campaign for the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 Presidential race]], and again in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]].  After Nixon's 1968 victory, Safire served as a speechwriter for him and for [[Spiro Agnew]]; he is well known for having created Agnew's famous term, ''"nattering nabobs of negativism."''

{{wikisource|In Event of Moon Disaster}}
Safire prepared a speech called ''In Event of Moon Disaster'' for President Nixon to read on television if the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts were stranded on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the plans, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] would "close down communications" with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LEM]] and a clergyman would have commended their souls to "the deepest of the deep" in a public ritual likened to [[burial at sea]]. Presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives were also planned. The speech originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's [[White House Chief of Staff|chief of staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/42983812.html?dids=42983812:42983812&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+7%2C+1999&amp;author=JIM+MANN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=5&amp;desc=National+Perspective%3B+The+Story+of+a+Tragedy+That+Was+Not+to+Be

&lt;/ref&gt; The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to [[Rupert Brooke]]'s [[World War I|First World War]] poem "[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]]".&lt;ref name="safire"/&gt; In a 2013 piece for ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, [[Joshua Keating]] included the speech as one of six entries in a list of "The Greatest Doomsday Speeches Never Made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Greatest Doomsday Speeches Never Made|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/01/the-greatest-doomsday-speeches-never-made/|last=Keating|first=Joshua E.|authorlink=Joshua Keating|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a political columnist in 1973.  Soon after joining the ''Times'', Safire learned that he had been the target of "national security" wiretaps authorized by Nixon, and, after noting that he had worked only on domestic matters, wrote with what he characterized as "restrained fury" that he had not worked for Nixon through a difficult decade "to have him—or some lizard-lidded paranoid acting without his approval—eavesdropping on my conversations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F0061FFC3B59137A93CBA91783D85F478785F9 | work=The New York Times | title=The Suspicious 17; ESSAY | first=William | last=Safire | date=August 9, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Safire won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary|Commentary]] on [[Bert Lance]]'s alleged budgetary irregularities; in 1981, Lance was acquitted by a jury on all nine charges.  Safire's column on October 27, 1980, entitled "The [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah]] Votes", was quoted in a campaign ad for [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|that year's presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1980/safire |title=Reagan campaign ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=1979-11-04 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safire also frequently appeared on the [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]''.

Upon announcing the retirement of Safire's political column in 2005, [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger|Arthur Sulzberger Jr.]], publisher of ''The New York Times'', said:&lt;blockquote&gt;''The New York Times'' without Bill Safire is all but unimaginable, Bill's provocative and insightful commentary has held our readers captive since he first graced our Op-Ed Page in 1973.  Reaching for his column became a critical and enjoyable part of the day for our readers across the country and around the world.  Whether you agreed with him or not was never the point, his writing is delightful, informed and engaging.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Safire served as a member of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] Board from 1995 to 2004. After ending his op-ed column, he became the full-time chief executive of the [[Dana Foundation]], where he was chairman from 2000. In 2006, Safire was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George W. Bush]].

Portions of Safire's [[FBI]] file were released in 2010.  The documents "detail wiretapping ordered by the Nixon administration, including the tapping of Safire's phone."&lt;ref&gt;Gresko, Jessica (2010-04-13) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/13/william-safires-fbi-file-_n_536038.html William Safire's FBI File Unlocked], ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing on English===
In addition to his political columns, Safire wrote a column, "[[On Language]]", in the weekly ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' from 1979 until the month of his death.  Many of the columns were collected in books.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;  According to the linguist [[Geoffrey Pullum]], over the years Safire became less of a "grammar-nitpicker," and [[Benjamin Zimmer]] cited Safire's willingness to learn from [[Linguistic description|descriptive]] linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zimmer | first = Benjamin | title = William Safire, 1929-2009 | work = Language Log | date = 2009-09-28 | url = http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1774#comments | accessdate = 2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another book on language was ''The New Language of Politics'' (1968),&lt;ref name=McFadden/&gt; which developed into what Zimmer called Safire's "magnum opus," ''Safire's Political Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zimmer | first = Benjamin | title = Remembering the Language Maven | date = 2009-09-28 | work = Word Routes: Exploring the Pathways of our Lexicon | url = http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2000/ | accessdate = 2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Safire described himself as a "[[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian conservative]]." A ''Washington Post'' story on the ending of his op-ed column quotes him on the subject:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm willing to zap conservatives when they do things that are not libertarian. [After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]],] I was the first to really go after [[George W. Bush|George W.]] on his treatment of prisoners.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After voting for [[Bill Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], Safire became one of the leading critics of Clinton's administration. [[Hillary Clinton]] in particular was often the target of his ire. He caused controversy in a January 8, 1996, essay when, after reviewing her record, he concluded she was a "congenital liar". She did not respond to the specific instances cited, but said that she didn't feel offended for herself, but for her mother's sake. According to the president's press secretary at the time, [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], "the President, if he were not the President, would have delivered a more forceful response to that on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/magazine/on-language-congenital-liar-punch.html | work=The New York Times | title=On Language;Congenital, Liar, Punch | first=William | last=Safire | date=February 4, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safire was one of several voices who called for war with Iraq, and predicted a "quick war" and wrote: "Iraqis, cheering their liberators, will lead the Arab world toward democracy."&lt;ref&gt;"Iraqis, cheering their liberators, will lead the Arab world toward democracy".[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/31/opinion/31SAFI.html?pagewanted=2 "To Fight Freedom's Fight"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He consistently brought up the point in his ''Times'' columns that an Iraqi intelligence agent met with [[Mohamed Atta]], one of the 9/11 attackers, in [[Prague]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/24/opinion/24SAFI.html?ex=1385096400&amp;en=675f702fa2295ecc&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND "Missing Links Found"], ''The New York Times'', November 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which he called an "undisputed fact", a theory which was disputed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[9/11 Commission Report]], pp. 228–29&lt;/ref&gt; Safire insisted that the theory was true and used it to make a case for war against Iraq. He also incorrectly predicted that "freed scientists" would lead coalition forces to "caches [of weapons of mass destruction] no inspectors could find".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4D81F38F933A25757C0A9659C8B63 "Jubilant V-I Day"], ''The New York Times'', April 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Safire was staunchly pro-[[Israel]]. He received the [[Guardian of Zion Award]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]] in 2005. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed him to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to [[Jerusalem]] for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the [[State of Israel]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lake|first=Eli|title=Bush Visit May Boost Olmert|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/bush-visit-may-boost-olmert/76303/|newspaper=New York Sun|date=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Safire died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at a hospice in [[Rockville, Maryland]], on September 27, 2009, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Helene Belmar (Julius); their children, Mark and Annabel; and granddaughter, Lily.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folkenflik |first=David |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113255309 |title=Political Columnist William Safire Dies At 79 |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
