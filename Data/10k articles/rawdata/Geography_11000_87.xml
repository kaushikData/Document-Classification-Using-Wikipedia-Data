'''Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated''' ('''ARINC'''), established in 1929, is a major provider of transport communications and [[systems engineering]] solutions for eight industries: [[aviation]], [[airports]], defense, government, healthcare, networks, security, and transportation. ARINC has installed computer data networks in police cars and railroad cars and also maintains the standards for [[line-replaceable unit]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=This makes it sound like it maintains standards for *all* LRUs everywhere|date=January 2009}}

ARINC was formerly headquartered in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], and has two regional headquarters in [[London]], established in 1999 to serve the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, and [[Singapore]], established in 2003 for the Asia Pacific region.  ARINC has more than 3,200 employees at over 120 locations worldwide.

The sale of the company by [[Carlyle Group]] to [[Rockwell Collins]] was completed on December 23, 2013.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
ARINC was incorporated in 1929 as Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated. It was chartered by the [[Federal Radio Commission]] (which later became the [[Federal Communications Commission]]) in order to serve as the airline industry’s single licensee and coordinator of radio communication outside of the government. The corporation's stock was held by four major airlines of the day. Through most of its history, ARINC was owned by airlines and other aviation-related companies such as [[Boeing]] until the sale to The Carlyle Group in October 2007.

Not much later ARINC took on the responsibility for all ground-based, aeronautical radio stations and for ensuring station compliance with [[Federal Radio Commission]] (FRC) rules and regulations. Using this as a base technology, ARINC expanded its contributions to transport communications as well as continuing to support the commercial aviation industry and [[U.S. military]].

ARINC also developed the standards for the trays and boxes used to hold standard line-replaceable units (like radios) in aircraft. These permit electronics to be rapidly replaced without complex fasteners or test equipment.

In 1978 ARINC introduced ACARS ([[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System]]), a [[datalink]] system that enables ground stations (airports, aircraft maintenance bases, etc.) to upload data (such as flight plans) and download data (such as fuel quantity, weight on wheels, [[flight management system]] (FMS) data), via an onboard Communications Management Unit (CMU).

ARINC has expanded its business in aerospace and defense through its ARINC Engineering Services [[subsidiary]].  With the sale of the company to Rockwell Collins, the ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary split into Commercial Aerospace and Defense Services.  The Defense Services branch was then purchased by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], remaining part of the Carlyle group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boozallen.com/media-center/press-releases/2012/10/dses-acquisition&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Reed fields" redirects here. For the natural habitat, see [[Reed bed]]. For the use of reeds to filter wastewater, see [[Constructed wetland]]. For the Tamil film, see [[Aaru (film)]].''

In ancient [[Egyptian mythology]], the fields of '''Aaru'''  ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|r|uː}}; {{lang-egy|[[wikt:jꜣrw|jꜣrw]]}} "Reeds, [[Typha|rushes]]"), known also as ''sḫt-jꜣrw'' or '''the Field of Reeds''', are the heavenly [[paradise]] where [[Osiris]] rules once he had displaced [[Anubis]] in the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]. It has been described as the ''[[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#k%EA%9C%A3_%22double%22|ka]]'' (a part of the [[soul]]) of the [[Nile Delta]].

The ancient Egyptians believed that the soul resides in the heart, and so, upon death, the [[Weighing of the Heart]] occurred. Each human heart is weighed on a giant scale against an ostrich feather, which represents the concept of [[Maat]]. Those souls which balance the scales are allowed to start a long and perilous journey to the Field of Reeds, where they will exist in pleasure for all eternity. Hearts heavy with evil tip and fall into the crocodilian jaws of the demon [[Ammit]]. After this "second death", the soul is doomed to restlessness in Duat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fadl|first=Ayman|title=Egyptian Heaven|url=http://www.aldokkan.com/religion/field.htm|work=Article|publisher=Aldokkan|accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The souls who qualify undergo a long journey and face many perils before reaching Aaru. Once they arrive, they enter through a series of gates. The exact number of gates varies according to sources; some say 15, some 21. They are uniformly described as guarded by evil [[demon]]s armed with knives. Aaru is also known as the home of Osiris.

Aaru usually was placed in the east where the Sun rises, and described as boundless reed fields, like those of the earthly Nile Delta. This ideal hunting and farming ground allowed the souls here to live for eternity. More precisely, Aaru was envisaged as a series of islands covered in fields of rushes. The part where Osiris later dwelt is sometimes known as the "field of offerings", ''Sekhet Hetepet'' in Egyptian.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
An '''address''' is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using [[border|political boundaries]] and [[street name]]s as references, along with other identifiers such as [[house number|house]] or [[apartment]] numbers. Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a [[postal code]], to make identification easier and aid in the routing of [[mail]].

==Functions==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2016}}
Addresses have several functions:
* providing a means of physically locating a building, especially in a city where there are many buildings and streets;
* identifying buildings as the end points of a [[Mail|postal system]];
* signalling social status;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* as parameters in statistics collection, especially in [[census]]-taking and the [[insurance]] industry;
* addresses are the most accepted representation of a location. 
Addresses may have drawbacks:
* Their standard formats are different in different places;
* They have no simple mapping to physical descriptions of location, such as coordinates.

Until the 18th and 19th centuries, most houses and buildings were not numbered.&lt;ref name=mask&gt;{{cite news|author=Deirdre Mask|date=2018-10-19|title=Where the Streets Have No Names, the People Have No Vote|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/opinion/sunday/north-dakota-addresses-voting-id.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Street naming and numbering began under the [[age of Enlightenment]], also as part of campaigns for [[census]] and military conscription, such as in the dominions of [[Maria Theresa]] in the mid 18th century.&lt;ref name=mask/&gt;
Numbering allowed everyone to efficiently receive mail, as the postal system evolved in the 18th and 19th century to reach widespread usage.&lt;ref name=mask/&gt;

Comprehensive addressing of all buildings is still not complete, even in developed countries.&lt;ref name=mask/&gt; For example, the [[Navajo Nation]] in the United States was still assigning rural addresses as of 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/11/02/452824825/navigating-navajo-nation-soon-to-be-easier-for-amazon-ambulances&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nndcd.org/rural-addressing.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of addresses can be used for [[voter disenfranchisement]] in USA.&lt;ref name=mask/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18a335_l647.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In many cities in [[Asia]], most minor streets were never named, and this is still the case today in much of Japan. A third of houses in Ireland lacked unique numbers until the introduction of [[Eircode]] in 2014.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Current addressing schemes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

===House numbering or naming===
{{Main article|House numbering}}
In most English-speaking countries, the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in each direction along a street, with odd numbers on one side (often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road) and even numbers on the other side, although there is significant variation on this basic pattern. Many older towns and cities in the UK have "up and down" numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road, and then sequentially back down the other side. Cities in [[North America]], particularly those planned on a [[grid plan]], often incorporate [[city block|block]] numbers, quadrants (explained below), and [[cardinal directions]] into their street numbers, so that in many such cities, addresses roughly follow a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. Some other cities around the world have their own schemes.

Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world, it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to be identified by name, rather than number, especially in villages. In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name. Such an address might read: "Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA" or "Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland" (fictional examples).

==={{anchor|cartesian}}Quadrants===
In cities with Cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems, the streets that form the north-south and east-west dividing lines constitute the ''x'' and ''y'' axes of a [[Cartesian coordinate plane]] and thus divide the city into '''quadrants.''' The quadrants are typically identified in the street names, although the manner of doing so varies from city to city. For example, in one city, all streets in the northeast quadrant may have "NE" prefixed or suffixed to their street names, while in another, the intersection of ''North'' Calvert Street and ''East'' 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant.

===Street-naming conventions===
[[Street name]]s may follow a variety of themes. In many [[North America]]n cities, such as, [[San Francisco]] USA, and [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada, streets are simply [[numbered street|numbered sequentially]] across the street grid. [[Washington, D.C.]] has its [[numbered street]]s running north-south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east-west, while diagonal avenues are typically named after states. In [[Salt Lake City]], and many other [[Utah]] cities, streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks. A similar system is in use in [[Detroit]] with the [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|Mile Road System]]. In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere, street names may all follow the same theme (for example, bird species), or start with the same letter. Streets in [[Continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Latin America]] are often named after famous people or significant dates.

===Postal codes===
Postal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing, designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality.

===Postal alternatives to physical addresses===
For privacy and other purposes, postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one's physical address or even having a fixed physical address.  Examples are [[post office box]]es, [[service address]]es and [[poste restante]] (general delivery).

==Address format==

&lt;!--Linked from [[Endianness]]; please update there if you change section title--&gt;
In most of the world, addresses are written in order from most specific to general, i.e. finest to coarsest information, starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit. For example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/personal/help-and-support/How-do-I-address-my-mail-correctly Clear addressing - How to address your mail]: [[Royal Mail]] Guidelines.

In English-speaking countries, the [[postal code]] usually comes last. In much of Europe, the code precedes the town name, thus: "1010 [[Lausanne]]". Sometimes, the country code is placed in front of the postal code: "[[Switzerland|CH]]-1010 [[Lausanne]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upu.int/uploads/tx_sbdownloader/descriptionPostcodesAddressingAddressElementsEn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If a house number is provided, it is written on the same line as the street name; a house name is written on the previous line. When addresses are written inline, line breaks are replaced by commas. Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ: either before or after the street name. Similarly, there are differences in the placement of postal codes: in the UK, they are written on a separate line at the end of the address; in Australia, Canada and the United States, they usually appear immediately after the state or province, on the same line; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city, on the same line.

[[East Asian addressing system]]s, including Chinese, [[Japanese addressing system|Japanese]] and Korean addressing systems, when written in their native scripts, use the opposite ordering, starting with the province/prefecture, ending with the addressee. However both have the same order as western countries when written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units, except that the name of the addressee is put into the first line.

The Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following:

:"The addressee's address shall be worded in a precise and complete manner. It shall be written very legibly in roman letters and arabic numerals. If other letters and numerals are used in the country of destination, it shall be recommended that the address be given also in these letters and numerals. The name of the place of destination and the name of the country of destination shall be written in capital letters together with the correct postcode number or delivery zone number or post office box number, if any. The name of the country of destination shall be written preferably in the language of the country of origin. To avoid any difficulty in the countries of transit, it is desirable for the name of the country of destination to be added in an internationally known language. Designated operators may recommend that, on items addressed to countries where the recommended position of the postcode is in front of the name of the location of destination, the postcode should be preceded by the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|EN ISO 3166–1 Alpha 2]] country code followed by a hyphen. This shall in no way detract from the requirement for the name of the destination country to be printed in full."&lt;ref&gt;Universal Postal Convention, Article 14, RL125, #3.3.

==Format by country and area==

===Argentina===
In Argentina, an address must be mailed this way:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format

|-
| ''Name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street name, number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Complements'', ''Neighbourhood (if needed)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postal code, Municipality''

|}

The [[Postal codes in Argentina|postal code]] has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format, which is shown in the example. The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning, which allows it to be identified. As the system has been changes 1961 recently recently, the four digit format can still be used: in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district.

===Australia===
{{main article|Postcodes_in_Australia}}
In common with the rest of the English-speaking world, addresses in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name, and the placename before the postcode. Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a [[suburbs and localities (Australia)|suburb or town]] – although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries. Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type, the [[postcodes in Australia|postcode]] serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address. As an example, there are around 8000 localities in Victoria (cf. [[List of localities in Victoria (Australia)]] and [[List of Melbourne suburbs]]), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes.&lt;ref&gt;Australia Post. (29 September 2009). [http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?sub=2 Full postcode datafile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001221912/http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?sub=2 |date=1 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 1 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the "locality" may be an institution or street name. It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.

Australia Post recommends&lt;ref&gt;Australia Post. (nd). [http://www.auspost.com.au/BCP/0,1467,CH2092%257EMO19,00.html Address presentation standards]. Retrieved 1 October 2009  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022031406/http://www.auspost.com.au/BCP/0%2C1467%2CCH2092~MO19%2C00.html |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters. In Australia, subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces; apartments, flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash (/) instead.

Apartment, flat and unit numbers, if necessary, are shown immediately prior to the street number (which might be a range), and, as noted above, are separated from the street number by a forward slash. These conventions can cause confusion. To clarify, ''3/17 Adam Street'' would mean Apartment 3 (before the slash) at 17 Adam Street (in the case of a residential address) or Unit 3 at 17 Adam St (in the case of a [[business park]]). On the other hand, ''3–17 Adam Street'' would specify a large building (or cluster of related buildings) occupying the lots spanning street numbers 3 to 17 on one side of Adam St (without specifying any particular place within the building(s)). These forms can be combined, so ''3/5–9 Eve Street'' signifies Apartment 3 (before the slash) in a building which spans street numbers 5 to 9 on one side of Eve Street.

As in the US, the state/territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states/territories; it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated. In printed matter, the postcode follows after two spaces; in handwritten matter, the postcode should be written in the boxes provided.

"Property numbers are worked out based on the distance from the start of the road to the entrance of the property. That distance (in metres) is divided by ten. Even numbers are on the right and odd numbers are on the left. For example: the entrance to a property 5,080 metres from the start of the road on the right hand side becomes number 508. The start of the road is determined as the fastest and safest road accessed from the nearest major road or town. Rural road maps are being drawn up to define the name, the start point and direction of every rural road."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Australia |first1=Government of South |title=Rural property addressing |url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/planning-and-property/planning-and-land-management/suburb-road-and-place-names/rural-property-addressing |publisher=Government of South Australia |accessdate=15 September 2018 |language=en-AU}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belarus ===

Some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don't face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a "main" building may have the same number as one or more "subsidiary" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as ''vul. Lenina, d. 123'' (''123 Lenin St'') An address may also cover one or more ''subsidiary buildings'' behind the main building, addressed as ''vul. Lenina, d. 123, bud. 2'' (''123 Lenin St, unit 2'', where ''bud.'' (abbreviation for будынак, ''budynak'') means a '(subsidiary) building'). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don't face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. ''123-а'', ''123-б'', etc., in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabetical]] order.

In some ''[[microraion]]'' neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the ''microraion'' (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at ''4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56'', i.e. ''123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56''.

===Belgium===
The address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (postcode and town for domestic mail or country for cross border mail.)
Spatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e. the line containing street, number and box number). If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.

The street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space. Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) or ‘n°’, or ‘nr’ are not allowed. Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for "box" (''bus'' in Dutch, ''bte'' in French). Symbols such as ''b'', ''Bt'', ''#'', ''-'', ''/'' are not allowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element.

The Belgian addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union ([[UPU]] and see the link http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html). These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.

The complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Belgian postal operator (bpost). The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see https://web.archive.org/web/20130420085220/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/letters-cards/send/best_practices.html (in French)).
 
It is also possible to validate a Belgian postal address on bpost's website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address. More information can be found on bpost's website (see [http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/customerservice/search/address.html http://www.bpost.be/validationadresse/ ](in French)).

===Brazil===
In Brazil, an address must be written this way:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street type (avenue/terrace), Street name, number, apartment/room (if needed)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Neighbourhood (optional)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Municipality, [[States of Brazil#List|State abbreviation]]'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postal Code''

|}

[[States of Brazil|States]] can have their name written in full, abbreviated in some way, or totally abbreviated to two letters (SP = [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], RJ = [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], etc.).

Only towns with 60,000 inhabitants and above have postal codes individualized for streets, roads, avenues, etc. One street can have several postal codes (by odd/even numbers side or by segment). These postcodes range from -000 to -899. Other towns have only a generic postcode with the suffix -000. Recipients of bulk mail (large companies, condos, etc.) have specific postcodes, with a suffix ranging from -900 to -959. P.O. boxes are mailed to ''Correios'' offices, with suffixes ranging from -970 to -979. Some rural settlements have community postboxes with suffix -990.

===Canada===
Addressing guidelines can differ between English- and French-speaking populations in Canada. Here are some formatting rules that are used in common:
* Cardinal directions like ''North'', ''North West'', etc. can be abbreviated in either English or French, and appear after the street name. Ordinal numbered streets (e.g. 6th, 2nd) can be written in either English or French.
* If there is an apartment number it should be written before the house number and separated by a hyphen. 
* Name of city or town followed by two letter [[canadian_postal_abbreviations_for_provinces_and_territories#Names_and_abbreviations|provincial abbreviations]]
* [[Postal_codes_in_Canada|Postal codes]] come in a letter-number-letter-space-number-letter-number format, for example: A1A 1A1. There should be two spaces between the province abbreviation and the postal code.
* If sending a parcel from outside Canada, the word "CANADA" must be placed at the very bottom.

See the example below for a comparison of the English and French address formats:

English (from [[Canada Post]]):
 NICOLE MARTIN
 123 SHERBROOKE ST
 TORONTO ON  L3R 9P6

French (from [[OQLF]]):
 Monsieur Jean-Pierre Lamarre
 101-3485, rue de la Montagne
 Montréal (Québec)  H3G 2A6

===Chile===
Chilean urban addresses require only the street name, house number, apartment number (if necessary) and municipality; however, more information is frequently included, such as neighbourhood, city, region. Postal codes are rarely included by people. All postal codes have seven digits, the first three indicating the municipality, the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory.

The territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities, so it is important to mention it.

{| class="wikitable"

Smaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial neighbourhoods that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes.

Several large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town, in such cases, the recipient address must mention either the town, the postal code or both.

===China===

The Postal area  when written in Chinese characters (preferably [[Simplified Chinese character]]s), has the order of the largest unit first, ending with the addressee, i.e. country, province, municipality, town, street or road, building name, floor/level, house/flat number, company name, addressee. This is the most common language used when posting within [[mainland China|China]].

|}

The whole address is commonly written as a string of characters with no particular format regarding where a new line would start, similar to one long sentence, with any new lines appearing depending on the space available on the envelope. Generally, the district is omitted when posting within China.

===Croatia===
{| class="wikitable"
! Format

|-
| ''Name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street name'' + ''number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''HR- Postal code'' + ''town''
| Hrvoje Horvat &lt;br/&gt; Ulica maršala Tita 174 &lt;br/&gt; HR-51410 Opatija
|}
Croatia uses five-digit postal code numbers. The Croatian postal service recommends using 2-letter ISO country codes as prefixes before international and domestic postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.

===Czech Republic===
Common format in Czech Republic:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
|-
| ''(Company + department)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street name (or village  name) + number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postal code + Town (or post office)''
|}
Postal codes are in the format "###&amp;nbsp;##" (i.e. 158 00 = Prague 58) or "CZ-#####" (especially for international sendings). At pre-printed Czech postcards and envelopes, the postal code is filled into frames at separate last row. If the envelope doesn't have pre-printed rows and frames, the postal code should be before the town (or post office) name.

On private letters, the first line is usually constituted by a courtesy title (pan, paní, slečna, žák…) For private mails addressed to the workplace, the order is (name + company), while in official mails it is (company + name).

The basic system of [[house numbering]] uses conscription{{clarify|date=March 2017}} house numbers (čísla popisná, čp. or č. p.). For a temporary or recreational house{{clarify|date=March 2017}}, an evidentional{{clarify|date=March 2017}} house number (číslo evidenční, ev. č. or če., or distinguished by initial 0 or E prefix) is used instead. In most larger cities and also in some towns and large villages with street names, there is a double system of house numbering. The first number is the conscription or evidentional number (which corresponds to the chronological order of cadastral registration of the house), and the second number (after a slash) is the orientational number (orientační číslo, č. or., č. o.) which expresses the position in the street. Sometimes only one of the two numbers is used, or the numbers are used in reverse order, and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which. Generally, orientation numbers (if they exist) are preferred for mail services.

Example: Josef Novák, Brněnská 2256/16, 123 07 Jitrnice

=== Denmark===

{{Further information|List of postal codes in Denmark}}

In Denmark, apartment buildings will usually have two or three apartments per floor. Thus, if the addressee lives in an apartment, the address should contain the floor they live on, and a side (''t.v.'', ''mf.'' or ''t.h.'', meaning "to the left", "in the middle" and "to the right", respectively) or an alphanumeric character (1, 2, 3... or A, B, C...= starting from left seen from the top most step just before the floor).

Also, for postal codes 2000 and up, there is a 1:1 relationship between postal code and town.

|}
If a person's name is written before the company name in the address field of a letter, then that person is considered the recipient. In this case, no other employee is allowed to open the letter but the indicated recipient. If the company name is before the person's name, then the company is the recipient and any employee is allowed to open the letter.

''* apartment number can formulated as "as 5" (as = asunto, 'apartment' in English) or as "C 55" (the letter A, B, C ... indicates the correct staircase in apartment blocks with several entrances)

Finland uses a five-digit postal code. Note that some of the larger companies and organizations have their own postal codes.

===France===
{{main article|Postal codes in France}}
In France, the address is generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
|''Addressee (Natural person/Organization)''&lt;br&gt;''More detailed description of addressee (optional)''&lt;br/&gt;''Housenumber + , +  Street name''&lt;br/&gt;''Postal code + uppercase location''&lt;br/&gt;''Country (if other than France)''

|}

The postal code always consists of five digits. The ''location'' is usually a town, but may be other territorial entities (up to a ''département'')

Organisations, government agencies, and companies which receive large amounts of mail often have a special "[[Postal codes in France#CEDEX|CEDEX]]" address which goes after the last line (for instance, "75001 PARIS CEDEX").

===Germany===
In Germany, the address is generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
|''Addressee (Natural person/Organization)''&lt;br&gt;''More detailed description of addressee (optional)''&lt;br&gt;''Street name + number''&lt;br&gt;''[[Postal codes in Germany|Postal code]] + town''&lt;br&gt;''Country (if other than Germany)''
| Firma ABC&lt;br&gt;Kundendienst&lt;br&gt;Hauptstr. 5&lt;br&gt;01234&amp;nbsp;Musterstadt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|}

* The postal code always consists of five digits.
* Organizations that receive large amounts of mail may be assigned a bulk customer postal code. These are different from regular postal codes in that they do not have a street name line. Some bulk customer postal codes are shared between several organizations.
* There are a few places that have house numbers but no street names (e.g. [[Baltrum]]) as well as addresses that have a street name but no house number.
* Some (but not all) private post companies are also able to deliver to [[Deutsche Post]]-operated P.O. boxes.
* Post codes follow the structure of DPAG's mail routing, not administrative boundaries.
* Each post code is used exclusively for street addresses, P.O. boxes or bulk recipients.
* Sub-building information, such as apartment numbers, is rarely used - a name on the post box is usually the only method of identification of an addressee within a building.

===Greece===
[[Hellenic Post]] recommends the following format for Greek addresses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elta.gr/Portals/0/pdf/TK_12.pdf |script-title=el:Πώς γράφεται η σωστή διεύθυνση για παραλήπτη στο εσωτερικό |language=Greek |trans-title=How to write the correct address for a recipient in Greece |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.elta.gr |publisher=[[Hellenic Post]] |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| P. Pavlou&lt;br&gt;Doiranis 25&lt;br&gt;653&amp;nbsp;02&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;KAVALA
|}

The most widespread format, shown above, gives on the last line the recipient's five-digit [[Postal codes in Greece|post code]] (with a single space between the third and fourth digits) and the name of the town or village that is the base of a post office, in capital letters and separated from the postcode by two spaces. When sending mail abroad, or when sending mail from abroad to Greece, [[Hellenic Post]] recommends the following format:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elta.gr/Portals/0/pdf/TK_13.pdf |script-title=el:Πώς γράφεται η σωστή διεύθυνση για παραλήπτη στο εξωτερικό|language=Greek |trans-title=How to write the correct address for a recipient abroad |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.elta.gr |publisher=[[Hellenic Post]] |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| A. Apostolou&lt;br&gt;Karkisias 6&lt;br&gt;GR-111&amp;nbsp;42&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ATHINA&lt;br&gt;GRÈCE
|}

As with domestic mail, mail sent from abroad must contain the postcode in the same manner, but the postcode must be preceded by the international prefix of the country of delivery (for Greece, GR). Below the destination, the country of delivery must be written in capital letters, either in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]] (for Greece, GRÈCE or GREECE).

===Hong Kong===
The [[official language]]s of [[Hong Kong]] are Chinese and English. For domestic mail within Hong Kong, the address may be written entirely in either Chinese or English. For overseas mail going out from Hong Kong, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkongpost.com/eng/publications/guide/content/6.1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030184640/http://www.hongkongpost.com/eng/publications/guide/content/6.1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-30 |title=POST OFFICE GUIDE PACKING, ADDRESSING AND PROHIBITIONS 6.1 |publisher=[[Hongkong Post]] |format=PDF |date=Sep 2008 |accessdate=30 Sep 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for an overseas mail from Hong Kong to Mainland China, [[Macao]], [[Taiwan]] or [[Singapore]], the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While [[traditional Chinese character]]s are commonly used in Hong Kong, [[simplified Chinese character]]s are also understood by Hong Kong's postmen. Note that Hong Kong does not use any postal codes, though many rural properties have a property identification code, e.g. HKT-12345.

An address written in English should begin with the smallest unit and end with the largest unit, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Hong Kong.
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Name of addressee''&lt;br&gt;''Flat number'', ''Floor number'', ''Name of building'' (if a rural address: (''Flat number'', ''Floor number'',) ''Name/number of house'')&lt;br&gt;''Street number and street name'' (if a rural address: ''[[List of villages in Hong Kong|Village]] name'')&lt;br&gt;''Name of [[List of towns in Hong Kong|district]]''&lt;br&gt;''"Hong Kong", "Hong Kong Island" or "H.

| Mr. Jackie Chan&lt;br&gt;Flat 25, 12/F, Acacia Building&lt;br&gt;150 Kennedy Road&lt;br&gt;Wan Chai&lt;br&gt;Hong Kong Island
|}

An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Hong Kong. [[Traditional Chinese character]]s are used in this example.
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| [''"香港", "港島" or "香港島" for [[Hong Kong Island]]''/''"九龍" for [[Kowloon]]''/''"新界" for [[New Territories]]'']&lt;br&gt;[''Name of [[List of towns in Hong Kong|district]]'']&lt;br&gt;[''Street name''][''Street number''] (if a rural address: [''[[List of villages in Hong Kong|Village]] name''])&lt;br&gt;[''Name of building''][''Floor number''][''Flat number''] (if a rural address: [''House name/number'']([''Floor number''][''Flat number'']))&lt;br&gt;[''Name of addressee'']
| 香港島&lt;br&gt;灣仔&lt;br&gt;堅尼地道105號&lt;br&gt;雅佳大廈12樓25室&lt;br&gt;陳港生先生
|}

For mail to Hong Kong from overseas, "Hong Kong" should be added at the end of an address written in English, and "香港" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.

===Hungary===
In Hungarian mail addresses, the city/town name precedes the street address. The post code then comes after the street address.
{| class="wikitable"
!Format&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.posta.hu/static/internet/download/correct_addressing.pdf Instructions on correct addressing] (page 4 of the product booklet on the [https://www.posta.hu/international_main Hungarian Post Office website])&lt;/ref&gt;
!Example
|-
|''Addressee (name or company name)''&lt;br&gt;''City or town''&lt;br&gt;''Street name and number and floor/door, or [[Post-office box|P.O. Box]] number''
Postal code
|''Kis Zoltán'' &lt;br&gt;''Budapest''&lt;br&gt;Árpád fejedelem útja 82. fszt. 2
1036
|}
Hungarian family names precede given names in Hungarian.  In this example, Kis is the family name.

Sometimes a district number might appear after the name of the city/town.

Various abbreviations might appear in the precise street/building address: for instance, specifying the street type (út, utca, krt., tér, etc.), or em. for 'emelet' (floor), or hrsz for 'helyrajzi szám' (which means Land Registry number, or lot number), or fszt for 'földszint' (ground floor) and so on.

The postal code consists of four digits.

=== Ireland ===
{{main article|Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland}}
In July 2015 Ireland introduced [https://www.eircode.ie Eircodes], a seven digit alphanumeric code, consisting of a 3 character routing key and a 4 character unique identifier for the property. Example A65 F4E2. Up until the introduction of Eircode's Dublin was the only county with a form of postal district identifier, these have been incorporated into the Eircode scheme; example Dublin 2 is routing code D02.

{|class="wikitable"

|''Lissadell House''&lt;br&gt;Lissadell&lt;br&gt;''Ballinfull''&lt;br&gt;''Sligo''&lt;br&gt;F91 ED70
|}

Rural addresses are specified by the [[counties of Ireland|county]], nearest [[post town]], and the [[townland]]. Urban addresses are specified by county, city or town name, street name, house number, and apartment or flat number where relevant. A house name may be used instead of a number. The Eircode is appended to the bottom of the address.

=== Israel ===
The Universal Postal Union recommend the following:
{| class="wikitable"

| Yisrael Yisraeli&lt;br&gt;16 Jaffa Street&lt;br&gt;9414219 Jerusalem
|}

In apartment buildings the building number should appear first and than the apartment number separated by a "/". In the below example, "16" is the building number while "20" is the apartment number:
:
{| class="wikitable"

|}
A seven digit postal code for all addresses was introduced in 2013 which can cover an entire locality for a small town or village. In bigger cities postal areas are divided along streets and neighbourhoods.

===Italy===
An internal address, in Italy, must be composed of three to five rows.
Up to six rows can be used if the mail is sent abroad:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Addressee's name and surname or company name''&lt;br&gt;Optional - ''Additional information about the addressee''&lt;br&gt;Optional - ''Additional information about the building (building number, floor, apartment number)''&lt;br&gt;''Street name and number (via/viale/corso/piazza...) or CASELLA POSTALE (P.O.Box number)''&lt;br&gt;''Postcode Town Province_abbreviation''&lt;br&gt;''Foreign State name''

A Japanese postal address, when written in Japanese phonetic and Chinese characters, starts with the largest geographical division, continues with progressively smallers subdivisions before ending with the addressee, i.e. country, prefecture, town, chōme, banchi, building number, building name, floor number, company name, addressee. This is the most common addressing format used when mailing within [[Japan]]. It is common practice to add the appropriate honorific to the addressee's name, e.g. 様 for a private individual or 御中 for a company or institution.

When written in the Latin alphabet, the address begins with the smallest geographical area and ends with the largest one as in the following example. Macrons (as on ō and ū) may be omitted.

Japanese-style envelopes are vertically aligned and the address is written from top to bottom, then right to left. Western-style envelopes are horizontally aligned and the address is written from left to right, top to bottom.

South Korea uses a system similar to Western addressing, but previously used a system similar to Japanese addressing. South Korean addresses start with the largest unit (country, province), like those other East Asian countries.

===Latvia===
In Latvia, the address in generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!Address Type
!Format
!Example
|-
|Rural Area
|''Addressee’s Name'' &lt;br&gt; ''Street Name,'' ''House Number,'' ''Flat Number'' or ''House Name'' &lt;br&gt; ''Village (if applicable)'' &lt;br&gt; ''Parish (if applicable)'' &lt;br&gt; ''Amalgamated Municipality'' &lt;br&gt; ''Postal Code''
|Andris Lapa &lt;br&gt; Liepu iela 1 &lt;br&gt; Ērberģe &lt;br&gt; Mazzalves pag. &lt;br&gt; Neretas nov. &lt;br&gt; LV-5133
|-
|Urban Area
|''Addressee’s Name'' &lt;br&gt; ''Street Name,'' ''House Number,'' ''Flat Number'' &lt;br&gt; ''City'' or ''Town'' &lt;br&gt;  ''Amalgamated Municipality (if applicable)'' &lt;br&gt; ''Postal Code''
|Andris Lapa &lt;br&gt; Jelgavas iela 1–12 &lt;br&gt; Aizpute &lt;br&gt; Aizputes nov. &lt;br&gt; LV-3456
|}

Notes:
* Every address element should be written on a separate line, starting with the more detailed element.
* Including addressee's name is not mandatory and address can be considered completed without it.
* In Latvian, addressee's name should be provided in dative, i.g., “Andrim Liepam”. There are two generally accepted official salutation forms you can use in front of the addressee's name: "A.god." (with a man's name) or "Ļ.cien." (with a man's or woman's name).
* Indicate a full street name, house and flat number (if applicable). Separate house and flat number with a hyphen.
* It is allowed to use abbreviation of parish ("pag." - abbreviation of "pagasts") and amalgamated municipality ("nov." - abbreviation of "novads").
* The postal code consists of two capital letters (LV) and four digits separated with a hyphen.
* For cross-border mail after the postal code you need to indicate the country of destination in block letters.

===Macau===
The [[official language]]s of [[Macau]] are [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Cantonese]]. For domestic mail within Macau, the address may be written entirely in either Portuguese or Chinese. For overseas mail going out from Macau, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English. However, for an overseas mail from Macau to [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] or [[Singapore]], the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While [[traditional Chinese characters]] are commonly used in Macau, [[simplified Chinese characters]] are also understood by Macau's postmen. Note that Macau does not use any postal codes.

An address written in Portuguese should begin with the street name and end with the area in Macau, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Macau.

{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Name of addressee''&lt;br&gt;''Street name'', ''Street number'', ''Name of building'', ''Floor number'', ''Flat number'',&lt;br&gt;''"Península de Macau" for [[Macau Peninsula]]''/''"Taipa" for [[Taipa]]''/''"Coloane" for [[Coloane]]''/''"Cotai" for [[Cotai]]''
| Sr. João Kuok&lt;br&gt;Rua de Macau, n.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 1, Edifício ABC, 2 andar, moradia C,&lt;br&gt;Península de Macau
|}

An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Macau. [[Traditional Chinese characters]] are used in this example.
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| [''"澳門半島" for [[Macau Peninsula]]''/''"氹仔" for [[Taipa]]''/''"路環" for [[Coloane]]''/''"路氹" for [[Cotai]]'']&lt;br&gt;[''Street name''][''Street number'']&lt;br&gt;[''Name of building''][''Floor number''][''Flat number'']&lt;br&gt;[''Name of addressee'']
| 澳門半島&lt;br&gt;澳門街1號&lt;br&gt;ABC大廈2樓C室&lt;br&gt;郭若昂先生
|}

For mail to Macau from overseas, "Macau" should be added at the end of an address written in Portuguese, and "Macao" at the end of an address written in English; "澳門" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.

|}

Notes:

* The Country line ''MALAYSIA'' is always omitted when mailing from within Malaysia.
* The State line is strictly optional, the mailing system will not be affected if the State line is omitted.
* The Post office/Mail centre field is the name of the town/city which post office/mail centre jurisdiction covers the mailing address, and in several cases, ''may not'' be the actual town/city which the address is geographically located.
* It is recommended to have the Post office/Mail centre written in block letters, e.g. ''KUALA LUMPUR''.
* The postcode is always in the 5-digit format and must correspond to the respective post office / mail centre. {{Further information|Postal codes in Malaysia}}
* [[Pos Malaysia]] allows usage of P.O. Box for both residential and business addresses. Whenever a P.O. Box address is used, its respective postcode and post office/mail centre must be written on the ''last'' line of an address. If both postcodes are present (original and P.O. Box), mail will be sent to the P.O. Box on its first attempt.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the address is generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
!Format
!Example
|-
|''Name&lt;br&gt;(Businesspark name etc.)''&lt;br&gt;''Street + number or Postbus (P.O.Box number)''&lt;br&gt;''Postal code + town''&lt;br&gt;''Country'' - Optional
|Thomas van der Landen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boschdijk 1092&lt;br&gt;5631 AV   EINDHOVEN&lt;br&gt;NETHERLANDS
|}

The postal code is a unique street identifier, and always consists of four numbers followed by a space and then two capital letters. [[PostNL]], which is appointed by the Dutch government to carry out the UPD (Dutch for ''Universal Postal Service''), recommends putting two spaces between postal code and town. Also, the name of the town should be written in capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing tips|url=http://www.postnl.nl/en/mail-and-parcels/mail/addressing-tips/|website=PostNL|publisher=PostNL|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the [[Dutch postal code]] uniquely identifies a street, a shortened format may also be used. This method only needs the postal code and the number. The ideal format for this method is the number after the postal code, meaning that this: '5631 AV 1092' will still get the letter delivered to the correct location.

It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. "postbus 1200") or [[freepost]] number (e.g. "antwoordnummer 150"), which have their own postal code.
{{further|:Category:Postal system of the Netherlands}}

===New Zealand===
{{main article|Postcodes in New Zealand#Examples}}
[[New Zealand Post]] recommends the following format:
{| class="wikitable"
!Format
!Example
|-
|''Recipient name'' &lt;br&gt; ''Flat number/House number Street address ''or ''PO Box number'' &lt;br&gt;''Suburb'' or ''RD Number ''or'' PO Box lobby name (if not the same as the town/city)''&lt;br&gt;''Town/City Postcode''
| Mr John Smith &lt;br&gt; 43 Vogel Street &lt;br&gt; Roslyn &lt;br&gt;Palmerston North 4414
|}

Note that no space or full stops exists between P and O in PO Box or R and D in RD. One should put only one space between the town/city and the postcode.

Note for [[Wellington]] metropolitan area, users should use the city name (i.e. Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Porirua), not the metropolitan area name. For example:
{| class="wikitable"
!Incorrect
!Correct
!Correct
|-
| 1 Molesworth Street &lt;br&gt; [[Taita, New Zealand|Taita]] &lt;br&gt; Wellington 5011
| 1 Molesworth Street &lt;br&gt; Taita &lt;br&gt; '''Lower Hutt''' 5011
| 1 Molesworth Street &lt;br&gt; [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] &lt;br&gt; '''Wellington''' 6011
|}

The city in this case is important, as if Wellington is used instead of Lower Hutt and the postcode is unclear (note only the first digit differs), someone's private mail could accidentally be sent to the [[New Zealand Parliament Buildings]] instead (or vice versa).

One anomaly about this system is the Wellington Mail Centre, which is addressed as ''Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045'', due to its location in the Lower Hutt suburb of [[Petone]].

===Norway===
Postal addresses in Norway are formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Format
! Example
|-
|''Recipient (Person or Entity)''&lt;br&gt;''Street Name + Number''&lt;br&gt;''Postal Code + Postal Town''&lt;br&gt;''Country (only if sending from abroad)''
|Kari Normann&lt;br&gt;Storgata 81A&lt;br&gt;6415 Molde&lt;br&gt;Norway
|}

The first line, ''Recipient (Person or Entity)'', is the legal recipient of the item being sent. The Recipient's name must be marked on the mail box in order for the item to be delivered.

Flat or floor number is not part of Norwegian postal addresses.

The postal code (always four digits) is mandatory. If a PO box is used (e.g. Postboks 250 Sentrum), it replaces ''Street name + Number''. PO box addresses have postal codes which differ from those used for street addresses. Some areas do not have street names. For these areas, ''Street name + Number'' is replaced by a local designation determined by the Norwegian postal service.

===Oman===
In the Sultanate of Oman (2012), the address is formatted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Brochure on the addressing system in Muscat, ca 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Format
! Example
|-
|''Name''&lt;br&gt;''Street number + house number''&lt;br&gt;''Block number''&lt;br&gt;''Area''&lt;br&gt;''City''
|&lt;br&gt; Way 2259, 2919&lt;br&gt;Block 222&lt;br&gt;Murtafaat Al Qurm&lt;br&gt;Muscat
|}

Physical addresses only exist in major urban centers like those of Greater Muscat, Sohar, Salalah, Sur and Nizwa.

{| class="wikitable"
!Format
!Example
|-
|First name &amp; surname of addressee&lt;br&gt;''and/or company name &amp; department''&lt;br&gt;ul. Street name + house (building) number / flat number&lt;br&gt;''or al.

|}

ul. = Str (Street)&lt;br&gt;
al. = Ave (Avenue)&lt;br&gt;
pl. = Sq (Square, or Circus)

The abbreviation "m." (meaning "mieszkanie" = "flat") can be used instead of "/" before the flat number.

The postal code always consists of five digits separated with a hyphen (in the "XX-XXX" format), i.e. 00-486 (00=Warsaw); 20-486 (20=Lublin), etc. The first digit signifies the postal district, the second: the code zone, the third: the code sector, the fourth and fifth signify the post office and its area of operation. Usually the code is unique on the street level for cities and the town level for smaller towns and villages.

Postal codes have the NNNN-NNN format. Street name and the number is traditionally separated by a comma, but nowadays [[CTT]] recommends just a blank space, or two blank spaces for extra clarity; this is to avoid [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] mistakes. The º after the number is the ordinal for floor number. Usually followed by "Esq." (Left, abbr from "Esquerdo") or "Dir." (Right, abbr from "Direito"), or an apartment letter (A, B, C, etc.). PO Boxes are called Apartado, followed by a number (e.g., Apartado 1001).

===Qatar===
[[Q-Post]] recommends the following format:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Name of addressee'' &lt;br/&gt; P.O. Box ''number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Name of town'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Country''
| Mr. Ali Al-Matwi &lt;br/&gt; P.O. Box 1714 &lt;br/&gt; Doha&lt;br/&gt; Qatar
|}

Not all of Qatar's roads and buildings are numbered, Q-Post doesn't deliver to any street addresses, and no postal codes are used in Qatar.

===Romania===
In Romania, the address is generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|First name &amp; surname of addressee and/or company name &amp; department&lt;br&gt;''Street Type*''. (or abbreviation for street type) + Street Name + ''nr.''

''Note: sub-region and region/oblast names are void if the city is [[Moscow]] or [[Saint Petersburg]] or if it is sub-region administrative center.''

Some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings face no named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, such as the historical center of Moscow, a "main" building may have the same number as one or more "subsidiary" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as, for example, ul. Lenina, d. 123 (that is, 123 Lenin St). An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, addressed as ul. Lenina, d. 123, str. 2 (123 Lenin St, Unit 2, where str. (abbreviation for строение, stroenie) means a '(subsidiary) building'. In newer {{when|date=November 2010}} areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that face no named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, such as 123-а, 123-б, etc., in alphabetic order.

In some microraion neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the microraion (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at 4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56, that is, 123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56.

===Saudi Arabia===
The address could be written in Arabic or English in the following format:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://address.gov.sa/en/about/addressing-in-saudi-arabia|title=Addressing in Saudi Arabia|publisher=[[National Address]]|accessdate=26 Jan 2016}}({{en icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://address.gov.sa/ar/about/addressing-in-saudi-arabia|title=العنونة في المملكة العربية السعودية|publisher=[[العنوان الوطني]]|accessdate=26 Jan 2016}}({{ar icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://address.gov.sa/en/address-format/overview|title=Address Format|publisher=[[National Address]]|accessdate=26 Jan 2016}}({{en icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Serbia===
Serbian postal addresses conform to rules similar to continental European rules:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Addressee'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street name + Number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postal code + Town'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Country (if other than Serbia)''
| Petar Petrović &lt;br/&gt; Krunska 5 &lt;br/&gt; 11000&amp;nbsp;Beograd &lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp;
|}

In addition to 5-digit postal code, another line can be added containing PAK, a six-digit number which encodes the town, street and house number section.

===Singapore===
[[SingPost]] recommends the following format for addresses:&lt;ref&gt;[http://singpost.com/quick_services/quicks_06mail_03before.htm SingPost Webpage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009035605/http://singpost.com/quick_services/quicks_06mail_03before.htm |date=9 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225070307/http://www.upu.int/post_code/en/countries/SGP.pdf Universal Postal Union: Singapore Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|}
Generally, the last line ''SINGAPORE'' is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in the English language.

===Slovakia===
Common format in Slovakia:
{|class="wikitable"
! Format
|-
| ''Addressee (Name or Company)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Company or Department or Landlord (if applicable)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street name + number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postal code + Town'' &lt;br/&gt; ''COUNTRY (if sent abroad)''
|}
Postal codes are in the format "###&amp;nbsp;##" (i.e. 851 01 = Bratislava 5).

Street numbers can be written as orientation numbers (related to street) or [[House numbering|descriptive numbers]] (unique within the town) or as a combination separated by a slash (descriptive/orientation). Descriptive numbers are also used within small villages that do not have named streets.

If the delivery is intended exclusively for a specific person at a company site, the address should begin with the individual's name and the company name should follow. The standard format of addresses enables anyone at the company to receive the delivery.

http://www.posta.sk/potrebujem/spravne-napisat-adresu ("How to write addresses correctly", in Slovak, with pictures)

===Slovenia===
Slovenia uses a four-digit postal number. The first digit indicates the area:
*1xxx for [[Ljubljana]]
*2xxx for [[Maribor]]
*3xxx for [[Celje]]
*4xxx for [[Kranj]]
*5xxx for [[Nova Gorica]]
*6xxx for [[Koper]]
*7xxx ''not used''
*8xxx for [[Novo Mesto]]
*9xxx for [[Murska Sobota]]

The simpler the code, the bigger the locality: 1000 Ljubljana, 2000 Maribor (big cities); 1310 [[Ribnica, Slovenia|Ribnica]], 9250 [[Gornja Radgona]] (mid-sized towns); 4263 [[Bohinjska Bela]], 8262 [[Krška Vas, Brežice|Krška vas]] (smaller settlements, including villages).

Some cities have more than one post office, thus having multiple postcodes (usually in the x1xx format). For example, Ljubljana which has a "general" postcode 1000, also has additional ones, ranging from 1101 to 1133 (for some reason, however, omitting 1103 and 1105), [[Kamnik]] has 1240 and 1241, etc. Albeit they exist, it is not necessary to use them - usually the "general" postcodes are used.

{{note|3|3}}Common abbreviations are: '''c.''' for ''cesta'' (Street), and '''ul.''' for ''ulica'' (Road) - both always capitalised if in the beginning of the line.

{{note|4|4}} Bigger towns have special postcodes for PO Boxes in the xxx1 format, e.g. ''1001 Ljubljana'', ''4001 Kranj''.

{{note|5|5}} Big companies which receive large amounts of mail are designated their special postcodes in the x5xx format.

|Sr. Francisco Ansó García&lt;br&gt; Paseo de la Castellana, 185, 5ºB &lt;br&gt; 29001 Madrid &lt;br&gt; Madrid
|}
5ºB means 5th floor (Spanish: quinto), door B. Also, there may be door number, printed as 1ª (primera-first). Suffixes "o" and "a" derives from Spanish words piso (floor) which is masculine and puerta (door) which is feminine.

Some doors may be indicated with the abbreviations Izq. or Dcha., to indicate either left (Izquierda) or right (Derecha). Streets and avenues can be indicated with the abbreviations C. (for calle) and Av. (for avenida).

===Sri Lanka===
[[Sri Lanka Post]] recommends the following format:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| ''Name of addressee'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Street number and name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Name of town'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Postcode'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Country''

|}
Sri Lanka uses a five-digit postal code. Generally, the last line ''SRI LANKA'' is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in English and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]].

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the address is generally formatted as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
!Format
!Example 
|-
|''Name''&lt;br&gt;''Street name + number''&lt;br&gt;''Postal code + Post town''&lt;br&gt;''Country'' (if sent from abroad)
|Anna Björklund&lt;br&gt;Storgatan 1&lt;br&gt;112 01 Stockholm     &lt;br&gt;SWEDEN
|}

The postal code is unique, and is always a five-digit number divided into groups of three and two (e.g. SE-414 73) with the prefix SE (ISO-code for Sweden) used only if sent from abroad. It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. Box 51).

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], the address is generally formatted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/fileadmin/documentsFiles/activities/addressingUnit/cheEn.pdf|title=Switzerland|publisher=[[Universal Postal Union]]|format=PDF|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in rural areas with decidedly little population and with no street addresses, address format is much simpler:

===United Arab Emirates===
Emirates Post Group recommends the following format:
{| class="wikitable"
! Format
! Example
|-
| ''Name of addressee'' &lt;br/&gt; P.O. Box ''number'' &lt;br/&gt; ''[[Emirates_of_the_United_Arab_Emirates|Name of the Emirate]]'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Country''
| Mr. Ali Al-Matwi &lt;br/&gt; P.O. Box 1714 &lt;br/&gt; Dubai&lt;br/&gt; United Arab Emirates (UAE)
|}
Not all of the roads and buildings in the UAE are numbered consistently and no postal codes are used in the United Arab Emirates. All mail are delivered only to PO boxes in the United Arab Emirates.

===United Kingdom===
The format specified by the postal operator [[Royal Mail]] is as follows:&lt;ref name="Royal Mail"&gt;Royal Mail, ''Address Management Guide,'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Format 
! Example
|-
| ''Addressee's name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Number supplement and street name'' &lt;br/&gt; ''Locality (only if required)'' &lt;br/&gt; ''[[Post town|POST TOWN]]'' &lt;br/&gt; ''[[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|POSTCODE]]''
| Mr A Smith &lt;br/&gt; 3a High Street &lt;br/&gt; Hedge End &lt;br/&gt; SOUTHAMPTON &lt;br/&gt; SO31 4NG
|}

The locality is required only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets with the same name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] (or permitted abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless it was a [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom#Special post towns|special post town]], for example [[London postal district|London]]. The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre.&lt;ref name="Royal Mail"/&gt; The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]] and [[List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|postcode district]]. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the postcode sector and postcode unit.&lt;ref name="Royal Mail"/&gt;

'''Notes''':
* Traditionally, only the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) has been permitted to deliver to a [[P.O. Box]]. For this reason the recipient may choose to insert their physical (aka street) address as line two, expanding the complete address to four lines. Providing both allows a sender to ship via the USPS or via a private carrier. Some USPS facilities allow a user of a P.O. box to use the street address of the postal facility with the P.O. box number in the place of a suite number, in which case the user may receive packages from private carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/508.htm USPS Domestic Mail Manual § 508] (see subsection 4.5.4)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mail will be delivered to the line immediately above the city, state, zip code line.
* The state and type of street, e.g. ''Lane'', is often abbreviated as shown in the PO standard.
* The USPS discourages the use of all punctuation except the hyphen in ZIP+4 codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_007.htm|title=222 Punctuation|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; slashes in fractional addresses, hyphenated street numbers, and periods in decimal addresses (e.g. the street name contains a decimal point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_013.htm|title=232 Street Name|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyphenated street numbers are common in the New York City borough of [[Queens]], Hawaii, and Southern California;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28apd_002.htm|title=D1 Hyphenated Address Ranges|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[house numbering]].
* Sometimes the name of the town required by the [[United States Postal Service]] does not necessarily mean that address is within that city. See also [[ZIP code#ZIP codes and previous zoning lines|ZIP codes and previous zoning lines]].
* In some other cases, the boundaries of towns as recognized by the U.S. Postal Service are much smaller than the area within the city limits. For one example, mail to much of the city of [[Los Angeles]] cannot be addressed to "Los Angeles".
* The U.S. Postal Service does not recognize "[[New York City]]" as a valid postal address. "New York" is a valid postal town only for [[Manhattan]]; mail to all of the city's other boroughs must be addressed with the borough name or, in [[Queens]], with a particular neighborhood name associated with the recipient's ZIP Code.
* Standards for variations on this format (apartment, rural route, general delivery, grid, P.O. Box and highway addresses) are covered in USPS Publication 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm|title=Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service Publication 28 - Postal Addressing Standards|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|date=Jan 2013|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Puerto Rico]] addresses often include an urbanization or condominium name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_041.htm|title=29 Puerto Rico Addresses|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=30 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The USPS allows for Spanish conventions in addresses in Puerto Rico.  The USPS prefers that territories be addressed in the standard domestic format (e.g. "San Juan PR 00907")&lt;ref&gt;http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_041.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ribbs.usps.gov/addressing/documents/tech_guides/pubs/PR_AND_USVI_ADDRESSING_-_ENGLISH.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice territory names are sometimes written as if they are a country (e.g. "San Juan 00907 Puerto Rico").
* International [[United States Department of State]] mail will use "DPO" as the city; [[military mail]] will use "APO" or "FPO".  Both use "AE", "AP", or "AA" in place of the state code, depending on the continent.
* Three independent countries with a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the U.S. ([[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]) have their own domestic government-run mail services, but are integrated into the USPS addressing and ZIP code system.  (See [[United States Postal Service#International services]].)

[[File:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the world according to [[Herodotus]]]]
[[File:Berber ancient Libyan; as depicted in the tomb of Seti I.jpg|thumb|320px|right|An Ancient Libyan; as depicted in the tomb of [[Seti I]]]]
The Latin name '''''Libya''''' (from Greek [[:wikt:Λιβύη|Λιβύη]], ''Libyē'') referred to the region west of the [[Nile]] generally corresponding to the modern [[Maghreb]]. Its people were ancestors of the modern [[Berbers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondeberbere.com/histoire/camps/origines.htm Gabriel Camps, L'origin des berbères] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129095013/http://www.mondeberbere.com/histoire/camps/origines.htm |date=29 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berbers occupied the area for thousands of years before the beginning of human records in ancient Egypt. [[Climate change]]s affected the locations of the settlements.

More narrowly, ''Libya'' could also refer to the country immediately west of Egypt, viz [[Marmarica]] (''Libya Inferior'') and [[Cyrenaica]] (''Libya Superior''). The [[Libyan Sea]] or ''Mare Libycum'' was the part of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] south of [[Crete]], between [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and [[Alexandria]].

In the [[Hellenistic period]], the Berbers were known as ''Libyans'',&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Roland &amp; Fagan, Brian M. (1975) ''Africa in the Iron Age: c. 500 B.C. to A.D. 1400''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek term for the inhabitants of the Maghreb. Their lands were called "[[Libya]]" and extended from modern [[Morocco]] to the western borders of [[ancient Egypt]]. Modern [[Egypt]] contains the [[Siwa Oasis]], which was part of ancient Libya. The [[Siwi language]], a [[Berber languages|Berber language]], is still spoken in the area.

== Name ==
{{Further|Libu}}
The Greek name is based on the ethnonym ''[[Libu]]''  ({{lang-grc|Λίβυες}} ''Líbyes'', {{lang-la|Libyes}}).  The name ''Libya'' (in use since 1934 for the [[Libya|modern country]] formerly known as [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania and Barca]]) was the Latin designation for the region of the Maghreb, from the [[Ancient Greek]] ({{lang-grc-att|Λιβύη}} ''Libúē'', {{lang-grc-dor|Λιβύᾱ}} ''Libúā''). In [[Classical Greece]], the term had a broader meaning, encompassing the continent that later (second century BC) became known as ''[[North Africa during Antiquity|Africa]]'', which, in antiquity, was assumed to constitute one third of the world's land mass, compared to Europe and Asia combined.

The ''Libu'' are attested since the [[Late Bronze Age]] as inhabiting the region ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''R'bw'', [[Punic language|Punic]]: {{script|Phnx|𐤋𐤁𐤉}} ''lby''). The oldest known references to the ''Libu'' date to [[Ramesses II]] and his successor [[Merneptah]], [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], during the 13th century BC. ''LBW'' appears as an ethnic name on the [[Merneptah Stele]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Alan Henderson (1964) ''Egypt of the Pharaohs: an introduction'' Oxford University Press, London, p. 273, {{ISBN|0-19-500267-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Menelaus]] had travelled there on his [[Nostos|way home from Troy]]; it was a land of wonderful richness, where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, where ewes lamb three times a year and no shepherd ever goes short of milk, meat or cheese. 

[[Homer]] names Libya, in ''[[Odyssey]]'' (IX.95; XXIII.311). Homer used the name in a geographic sense, while he called its inhabitants "[[Lotus-eaters]]". After Homer, [[Aeschylus]], [[Pindar]], and other ancient Greek writers use the name. [[Herodotus]] (1.46) used Λιβύη ''Libúē'' to indicate the African continent; the ''Líbues'' proper were the light-skinned North Africans, while those south of Egypt (and [[Elephantine]] on the Nile) were known to him as "[[Aethiopia]]ns";&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of North Africa'' and the people between them as the Egyptians, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; this was also the understanding of later Greek  geographers such [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]], etc.

When the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] actually settled in the real Libya in the 630s, the old name taken from the Egyptians was applied by the Greeks of [[Cyrenaica]], who may have coexisted with the Libu.&lt;ref&gt;Fage, J. D. (ed.) (1978) "The Libyans" ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From c. 500 BC to AD 1050'' volume II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, p. 141, {{ISBN|0-521-21592-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the name appeared in the [[Hebrew language]], written in the [[Bible]] as '''Lehabim''' and '''Lubim''', indicating the ethnic population and the geographic territory as well. 
In the neo-Punic inscriptions, it was written as ''Lby'' for the masculine noun, and ''Lbt'' for the feminine noun of ''Libyan''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Latin]] absorbed the name from Greek and the Punic languages.  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] would have known them before their colonization of North Africa because of the Libyan role in the [[Punic Wars]] against the Romans.  The Romans used the name '''Líbues''', but only when referring to Barca and the [[Libyan Desert]] of Egypt. The other Libyan territories were called "Africa".

[[Classical Arabic]] literature called Libya ''Lubya'', {{clarify|reason=pls clarify how the word "Lubya" (1) "indicates" a (2) "speculative" (3) "territory" (4) "west of Egypt" |text=indicating a speculative territory west of Egypt|date=December 2016}}. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Arabic]] uses ''Libya''. The Lwatae, the tribe of [[Ibn Battuta]],&lt;ref&gt;The full name of Ibn Battuta was Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah '''al-Lawati''' at-Tanji ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Arabs]] called it, was a Berber tribe that mainly was situated in Cyrenaica. This tribe may have ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to modern [[Libya]], however, and was referred to by Corippius as ''[[Laguatan]]''; he linked them with the [[Mauri people|Maures]]. [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' states Luwa was an ancestor of this tribe. He writes that the Berbers add an "a" and "t" to the name for the plural forms. Subsequently, it became ''Lwat''.

Conversely, the Arabs adopted the name as a singular form, adding an "h" for the [[plural]] form in Arabic. Ibn Khaldun disagrees with [[Ibn Hazam]], who claimed, mostly on the basis of Berber sources, that the Lwatah, in addition to the Sadrata and the Mzata, were from the [[Copts|''Qibt'']]s (Egyptians). According to Ibn Khaldun, this claim is incorrect because Ibn Hazam had not read the books of the Berber scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-eman.com/islamlib/viewchp.asp?BID=163&amp;CID=184 ''The History of Ibn Khaldun'', third chapter p. 184-258]{{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oric Bates]], a historian, considers that the name ''Libu'' or ''LBW'' would be derived from the name ''Luwatah''&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Oric (1914) ''The Eastern Libyans''. London: Macmillan &amp; Co. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the name Liwata is a derivation of the name Libu.{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=Liwata, Lib, Luwatah?? What languages are these?}}

== History ==
[[File:Archaeological Site of Sabratha-108976.jpg|thumb|Archaeological Site of Sabratha, Libya]]
Compared with the [[history of Egypt]], historians know little about the history of Libya, as there are few surviving written records. Information on ancient Libya comes from [[Archeology|archaeological]] evidence and historic sources written by Egyptians neighbors, the ancient Greeks, Romans, and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and from Arabs of Medieval times.

Since Neolithic times, the climate of North Africa has become drier. A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by megalithic remains, which occur in great variety of form and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: dolmens and circles like [[Stonehenge]], cairns, underground cells excavated in rock, barrows topped with huge slabs, and step-pyramid-like mounds. Most remarkable are the [[trilithon]]s, some still standing, some fallen, which occur isolated or in rows, and consist of two squared uprights standing on a common pedestal that supports a huge transverse beam. In the Terrgurt valley, Cowper says, "There had been originally no less than eighteen or twenty megalithic trilithons, in a line, each with its massive altar placed before it."

In ancient times, the [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (''see [[Libya (satrapy)]]''), the armies of [[Alexander the Great]] and his [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] successors from Egypt, then [[Rome|Romans]], [[Vandal]]s, and local representatives of the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled all or parts of Libya. The territory of modern Libya had separate histories until Roman times, as [[Tripoli]] and Cyrenaica.

[[Cyrenaica]], by contrast, was Greek before it was Roman. It was also known as [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], the "five cities" being [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (near the village of Shahat) with its port of [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]] (Marsa Susa), [[Taucheira|Arsinoe]] (Tocra), [[Berenice]] (Bengazi) and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] (Merj).  From the oldest and most famous of the [[Greek colonies]] the fertile coastal plain took the name of Cyrenaica.

These five cities were also known as the ''Western Pentapolis''; not to be confused with the [[Pentapolis]] of the Roman era on the current west Italian coast.

==Geography==

The exact boundaries of Ancient Libya are unknown. It lay {{When|date=December 2016}} west of [[Ancient Egypt]] and was known as "Tjehenu" to the Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian'', Raymond O Faulkner, Page 306&lt;/ref&gt; Libya was an unknown territory to the Egyptians: it was the land of the [[spirit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Oric&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[Ancient_Greece|Ancient Greeks]], Libya was one of the three known [[continent]]s along with [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. In this sense, Libya was the whole known African continent to the west of the [[Nile]] Valley and extended south of Egypt.  Herodotus described the inhabitants of Libya as two peoples: The Libyans in northern Africa and the ''Ethiopians'' in the south. According to Herodotus, Libya began where [[Ancient Egypt]] ended, and extended to [[Cape Spartel]], south of [[Tangier]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

Modern geographers suspect that Ancient Libyans may have experienced loss of forests, reliable fresh water sources, and game availability as the area became more desert-like. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

== Later sources ==
After the Egyptians, the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various other tribes in Libya.  Later tribal names differ from the Egyptian ones but, probably, some tribes were named in the Egyptian sources and the later ones, as well. The [[Meshwesh]]-tribe represents this assumption. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called ''Mazyes'' by Hektaios and [[Maxyes]] by Herodotus, while it was called "Mazaces" and "Mazax" in Latin sources.  All those names are similar to the name used by the Berbers for themselves, ''[[Imazighen (etymology)|Imazighen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, Highlights of thirty-three centuries of Imazighen p. 9 .&lt;/ref&gt;

Late period sources give more detailed descriptions of Libya and its inhabitants.  The ancient historian Herodotus describes Libya and the Libyans in his fourth book, known as ''The Libyan Book''. [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Procopius]] also contributed to what is now primary source material on ancient Libya and the Libyans.

Ibn Khaldun, who dedicated the main part of his book ''[[Kitab el'ibar]]'', which is known as "The history of the Berbers", did not use the names ''Libya'' and ''Libyans'', but instead used Arabic names: ''The Old [[Maghreb]]'', (''El-Maghrib el-Qadim''), and the ''Berbers'' (El-Barbar or El-Barabera(h)).

== Ancient Libyan (Berber) tribes ==
There were many Berber tribes in ancient Libya, including the now extinct [[Psylli]], with the [[Libu]] being the most prominent. The ancient Libyans were mainly pastoral nomads, living off their goats, sheep and other livestock. Milk, meat, hides and wool were gathered from their livestock for food, tents and clothing. Ancient Egyptian sources describe Libyan men with long hair, braided and beaded, neatly parted from different sides and decorated with feathers attached to leather bands around the crown of the head while wearing thin robes of antelope [[Hide (skin)|hide]], dyed and printed, crossing the shoulder and coming down until mid calf length to make a robe. Older men kept long braided beards. Women wore the same robes as men, plaited, decorated hair and both genders wore heavy jewelry. Depictions of Libyans in Egyptian reliefs show prominent and numerous tattoos, very similar to traditional Berber tattoos still seen today. Weapons included bows and arrows, hatchets, spears and daggers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Libyan script that was used in Libya was mostly a [[funerary]] [[writing system|script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inalco.fr/crb/libyco_berbere/libyco_berbere.htm |title=L'écriture libyco-berbère (The Libyco-Berber script) |last=Chaker |first=Salem |language=French |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113210502/http://www.inalco.fr/crb/libyco_berbere/libyco_berbere.htm |archivedate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to understand, and there are a number of variations.&lt;ref&gt;Chaker ''Script''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]] divided the Berbers into the [[Batr]] and the [[Baranis]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The History of Ibn Khaldun'': The thirth chapter p. 181-152.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=pls clarify this source (Ibn Khaldun): "thirth" + "p. 181-152"?|date=December 2016}}

[[Herodotus]] divided them into [[Eastern Libyans]] and [[Western Libyans]]. Eastern Libyans were [[nomad]]ic shepherds east of [[Lake Tritonis]]. Western Libyans were sedentary farmers who lived west of Lake Tritonis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html][[Herodotus]]&lt;span&gt;, On Libya, from The Histories, c. 430 BC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At one point{{when||date=December 2016}}, a catastrophic change{{clarify|reason=what happened, exactly?|date=December 2016}} reduced the vast body of fresh water to a seasonal lake or marsh.

Ibn Khaldun and Herodotus distinguish the Libyans on the basis of their lifestyles rather than ethnic background. Modern historians tend to follow Herodotus's distinction. Examples include Oric Bates in his book ''The Eastern Libyans''. Some other historians have used the modern name of the [[Berber people|Berber]]s in their works, such as the French historian [[Gabriel Camps]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gabriel Camps is considered as the father of the North African prehistory, by founding ''d'Etude Berbère''{{clarify|date=December 2010}} at the [[University of Aix-en-Provence]] and the ''Encyclopédie berbère''." (From the introduction of the English book ''The Berbers'' by Elizabeth Fentres and Michael Brett, p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan tribes mentioned in these sources{{clarify|reason=Which sources, precisely? Everything mentioned above? Some of it? What?| date=December 2016}} were: "[[Adyrmachidae]]", "[[Giligamae]]", "[[Asbystae]]", "[[Marmaridae]]", "[[Auschisae]]", "[[Nasamones]]", "[[Macae]]", "[[Lotus-eaters]] (or Lotophagi)", "[[Garamantes]]", "[[Gaetulia]]ns", "[[Mauri people|Mauri]]", and "[[Luwatae]]", as well as many others.

It was the location of the [[List of vessels of the Bengal Pilot Service to 1834|Bengal Pilot Service]] pilot boarding station (see chart).

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] French privateer captains such as [[Jean-François Hodoul]] and [[Robert Surcouf]] would cruise the mouth of the Hooghly River hoping to capture vessels anchored in the Roads, or proceeding to or from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The French captured both pilot vessels such as {{ship||Cartier|1787 ship|2}}, and large [[East Indiamen]] such as {{ship||Triton|1787 EIC ship|2}}.

The '''Canal of the Pharaohs''', also called the '''Ancient Suez Canal''' or '''Necho's Canal''', is the forerunner of the [[Suez Canal]], constructed in ancient times. It followed a different course than its modern counterpart, by linking the [[Nile]] to the [[Red Sea]] via the [[Wadi Tumilat]]. Work began under the Pharaohs. According to Suez Inscriptions and [[Herodotus]], the first opening of the canal was under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king [[Darius the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shahbazi|first=A.

==Egyptian and Persian works==
Probably first cut or at least begun by [[Necho II]], in the late 6th century BC, [[Darius the Great]] either re-dug or completed it. Classical sources disagree as to when it was finally completed.

[[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions]] comprise five Egyptian monuments, including the [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions|Chalouf Stele]],&lt;ref&gt;William Matthew Flinders Petrie, ''A History of Egypt''. Volume 3: From the XIXth to the XXXth Dynasties, Adamant Media Corporation, {{ISBN|0-543-99326-4}}, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; commemorate the construction and completion of the canal linking the Nile River with the Red Sea by [[Darius the Great|Darius I]] of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Watterson (1997), ''The Egyptians'', Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-21195-0}}, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; They were located along the Darius Canal through the valley of [[Wadi Tumilat]] and probably recorded sections of the canal as well.&lt;ref name="Redmount, Carol A 1995 pp. 127-135"/&gt; In the second half of the 19th century, French [[cartographer]]s discovered the remnants of the north–south section of Darius Canal past the east side of [[Lake Timsah]] and ending near the north end of the [[Great Bitter Lake]].&lt;ref name="Carte hydrographique"&gt;''Carte hydrographique de l'Basse Egypte et d'une partie de l'Isthme de Suez'' (1855, 1882). Volume 87, page 803. Paris. See [http://mapy.vkol.cz/mapy/v87803.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as far back as [[Aristotle]] there have been suggestions that perhaps as early as the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]], [[Pharaoh]] [[Senusret III]] (1878 BC–1839 BC), also called Sesostris, may have started a canal joining the [[River Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]]. In his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]],'' Aristotle wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book1.html Meteorology (1.15)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Strabo]] also wrote that Sesostris started to build a canal, and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;165. Next comes the Tyro tribe and, on the Red Sea, the harbour of the Daneoi, from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as the Delta; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again [[Ptolemy II]], who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;The Elder Pliny and John Healey ''Natural History'' (6.33.165) Penguin Classics; Reprint edition (5 Feb 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-14-044413-1}} p.70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvyF-8NXFbIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Pliny+the+elder+sesostris+canal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1np0DY4S3&amp;sig=i0wzXRGizdz6DK8e6CTGA1wFcoI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BieVSv3GE-PKjAfU-OnnDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although [[Herodotus]] (2.158) tells us Darius I continued work on the canal,&lt;ref name="Schörner 2000, p. 40, fn. 33"&gt;Schörner 2000, p. 40, fn. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] (Aristot. met. I 14 P 352b.), [[Strabo]] (Strab. XVII 1, 25 C 804. 805.), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (Plin. n. h. VI 165f.) all say that he failed to complete it,&lt;ref name="Schörner 2000, p. 40, fn. 33"/&gt; while [[Diodorus Siculus]] does not mention a completion of the canal by Necho II.&lt;ref&gt;Schörner 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny the Elder also says that Ptolemy II, who took up the work again, also stopped because of the differences of water level.&lt;ref name="Redmount, Carol A 1995 pp. 127-135"&gt;Redmount, Carol A. "The Wadi Tumilat and the "Canal of the Pharaohs"" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 54, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 127-135&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus, however, reports that it was completed by Ptolemy II after being fitted with a lock.&lt;ref&gt;Schörner 2000, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek, Roman and Islamic works==
{{See also|List of Roman canals}}

[[Ptolemy II]] was the first to solve the problem of keeping the Nile free of salt water when his engineers invented the [[Lock (water transport)|water lock]] around 274/273 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gmirkin, Russell ''Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic Histories and the Date of the Pentateuch'' T.&amp; T.Clark Ltd (24 Aug 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-567-02592-0}} p.236&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Ptolemy]] the Astronomer mentions a "River of [[Trajan]]", a [[Roman canal]] running from the Nile to the Red Sea.

Islamic texts also discuss the canal, which they say had been silted up by the seventh century but reopened in 641 or 642 AD by [['Amr ibn al-'As]], the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conqueror of Egypt]], and which was in use until closed in 767 AD in order to stop supplies reaching [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] which were [[Alid revolt of 762–763|in rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Redmount, Carol A 1995 pp. 127-135"/&gt;

Thereafter, the land routes to [[tranship]] camel caravans' goods were from Alexandria to ports on the Red Sea or the northern [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[Silk Road|silk route]] through the [[Caucasian Mountains]] transhipping on the [[Caspian Sea]] and thence to [[India]].

During his Egyptian expedition, Napoleon found the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria#Canal of the Pharaohs|canal]] in 1799.

'''Demography''' (from prefix ''demo-'' from [[Ancient Greek]] δῆμος ''dēmos'' meaning "the people", and ''-graphy'' from γράφω ''graphō'', implies "writing, description or measurement"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demography for etymology (origins) of ''demography''].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[statistics|statistical study]] of [[population|populations]], especially [[human|human beings]]. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see [[population dynamics]]).  Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[Migration (human)|migration]], [[aging]], and [[death]]. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.

[[Demographic analysis]] can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as [[education]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], and [[ethnicity]]. Educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Population |url=http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |website=demographicpartitions.org |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814023915/http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |archivedate=14 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually treat demography as a field of [[sociology]], though there are a number of independent demography departments.&lt;ref name="ub"&gt;{{Cite web | title=UC Berkeley Demography department website | url=http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal demography''' limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of '''social demography''' or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hinde ''Demographic Methods'' Ch. 1 {{ISBN|0-340-71892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Demographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNcflpmW3BUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=studies+in+demography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y1QFr3LGxP&amp;sig=xJkW1mxVL6XS-Gij0tOpOsFZA9E&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=qdjRS8DjMsGC8gbj4Ii_Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false S.C.Srivastava,''Studies in Demography'', p.39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of [[Herodotus]], [[Thucidides]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Epicurus]], [[Protagoras]], [[Polus]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006" /&gt; In Rome, writers and philosophers like [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the elder]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Epictetus]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], and [[Columella]] also expressed important ideas on this ground.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"/&gt;

In the [[Middle ages]], Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography.  Important contributors to the field were [[William of Conches]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000"&gt;Peter Biller,''The measure of multitude: Population in medieval thought''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnqlgqeYhwYC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Nicole+Oresme+on+demographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RB9HPQrvY&amp;sig=RtvI_JuQ4SGR0QYfa7ptB5eDW1w&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=kdLRS8SJBcO78gbWg8jNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartholomew of Lucca]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Pagula]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, &amp; Daria Khaltourina (2006). ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''. Moscow: URSS,  {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was ''Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality'' (1662) by [[John Graunt]], which contains a primitive form of [[actuarial table|life table]]. Among the study's findings were that one third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as [[Edmond Halley]], developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. [[Richard Price]] was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;“Our Yesterdays: the History of the Actuarial Profession in North America, 1809-1979,” by E.J. (Jack) Moorhead, FSA, ( 1/23/10 – 2/21/04), published by the Society of Actuaries as part of the profession’s centennial celebration in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by [[Augustus de Morgan]], ‘On the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies’ (1838).&lt;ref&gt;The History of Insurance, Vol 3, Edited by David Jenkins and Takau Yoneyama (1 85196 527 0): 8 Volume Set: ( 2000) Availability: Japan: Kinokuniya).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, [[Benjamin Franklin]] published his essay ''[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]'', projecting [[exponential growth]] in British colonies.&lt;ref name=valtier&gt;{{cite journal|title= "An Extravagant Assumption": The Demographic Numbers behind Benjamin Franklin's Twenty-Five-Year Doubling Period|last=von Valtier|first=William F.|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]|volume=155|number=2|date=June 2011|pages=158–188|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/5VonValtier1550205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst]].

The period 1860-1910 can be characterised as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international ‘great demographers’ like [[Adolphe Quételet]] (1796–1874), [[William Farr]] (1807–1883), [[Louis-Adolphe Bertillon]] (1821–1883) and his son [[Jacques Bertillon|Jacques]] (1851–1922), [[Joseph Körösi]] (1844–1906), [[Anders Nicolas Kaier]] (1838–1919), [[Richard Böckh]] (1824–1907), [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), [[Wilhelm Lexis]] (1837–1914), and [[Luigi Bodio]] (1840–1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;de Gans, Henk and Frans van Poppel (2000) Contributions from the margins.

==Methods==
There are two types of data collection—direct and indirect—with several different methods of each type.

=== Direct methods ===
Direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.

A [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.

Censuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.

[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]

=== Indirect methods ===
Indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.

There are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]]-Trussell models, [[parity progression ratios]]), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, [[Page model]]), disability ([[Sullivan's method]], [[multistate life tables]]), [[population projections]] ([[Lee–Carter model|Lee-Carter model]], the [[Leslie matrix|Leslie Matrix]]), and [[population momentum]] ([[Nathan Keyfitz|Keyfitz]]).

The United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 [[National Child Development Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power C and Elliott J |title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |year=2006 |pmid=16155052 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1970 British Cohort Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elliott J and Shepherd P|title=Cohort profile: 1970 British Birth Cohort (BCS70)|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=836–43|year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl174 |pmid=16931528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Cohort Study]], begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.&lt;ref&gt;The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common rates and ratios==

* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.
* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).
* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)
* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.
* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.
* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.
* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"&gt;Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.
* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;
* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

A stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.

==Basic equation==
Suppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' persons at time ''t''.
What is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Population}_{t+1} = \text{Population}_t + \text{Natural Increase}_t + \text{Net Migration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Natural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Natural Increase}_t = \text{Births}_t - \text{Deaths}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Net migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Migration}_t = \text{Immigration}_t - \text{Emigration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

This basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, "net migration" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR," ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.

The figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN "medium" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803–805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.

===Science of population===
Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.  Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bongaarts]]. The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables. Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 6/7. (Jun. - Jul., 1982), pp. 179-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population.  Demographers most commonly study mortality using the [[Life Table]], a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/lftbls/lftbls.htm N C H S - Life Tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Rowland ''Demographic Methods and Concepts'' Ch. 11 {{ISBN|0-19-875263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[epidemiology]], [[geography]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]], demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the [[Cicred]] (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iussp.org International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]&lt;/ref&gt; or a national association such as the [[Population Association of America]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationassociation.org Population Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canpopsoc.org Canadian Population Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626005822/http://www.canpopsoc.org/ |date=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red dots indicate capes and points, gray text indicates island names. The international boundary between Canada and the United States follows [[Portland Canal]] to "Point B", thence, according to Canada, to [[Cape Muzon]]. The purpose and significance of the "A–B Line" portion of the boundary are disputed.]]
The '''Dixon Entrance''' is a [[strait]] about {{convert|80|km|mi}} long and wide in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the [[Canada–United States border]], between the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alaska]] and the province of [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]].  It was named by [[Joseph Banks]] for Captain [[George Dixon (captain)|George Dixon]], a [[Royal Navy]] officer, [[fur trade]]r, and explorer, who surveyed the area in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Middleton |first= Lynn |title= Place Names of the Pacific Northwest Coast |year= 1969 |publisher= Elldee Publishing |location= Victoria |oclc= 16729415 |page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dixon Entrance is part of the [[Inside Passage]] shipping route. It forms part of the [[maritime boundary]] between the U.S. and Canada, although the location of that boundary here is disputed.  A name used in the [[Haida language]] is '''Seegaay''', which means only "ocean".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--it would have Tlingit and Tsimshian names also, N.B.--&gt;

The Dixon Entrance lies between [[Clarence Strait]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in [[Alaska]] to the north, and [[Hecate Strait]] and the islands known as [[Haida Gwaii]]&lt;ref&gt;The islands on the south side of the Entrance which are officially named ''Haida Gwaii'' by the Province of British Columbia in 2010, at the request of the [[Haida people]].  The new name, meaning "land of the people", originated in the 1970s.  These islands are still quite widely known by their historical name, the ''Queen Charlotte Islands.''&lt;/ref&gt; (the Queen Charlotte Islands) in [[British Columbia]], to the south. [[Prince of Wales Island, Alaska]], is the largest of the Alaskan islands on the north side of the entrance, and is also home to a branch of the Haida, known as the Kaigani Haida.    Members of the [[Haida people|Haida]] nation maintain free access across the Strait.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;!--"free" doesn't seem the right word; they still have to notify of crossings I believe--&gt;

The so-called "A–B" line (approximately [[Parallel 54°40′ north|54°40'N]]), which marks the northern boundary of the Dixon Entrance, was delineated by a court of arbitration set up by the [[Hay-Herbert Treaty|1903 Alaska Boundary Treaty]]. The meaning of the line remains in dispute between Canada and the United States. Canada claims the line is the international maritime boundary, while the United States holds that its purpose was only to designate the land masses belonging to each country. Hence, the U.S. does not recognize the "A–B" line as an official boundary (to govern, for example, seafloor resources or fishing rights). In 1977 the U.S. defined a maritime boundary as an equidistant line between land masses.&lt;ref name="IBRU"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-3_gray.pdf |title=Canada's Unresolved Maritime Boundaries|pages=61–63|last=Gray|first=David H.| work= IBRU Boundary and Security Bulletin|year=Autumn 1997|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two differing boundary lines intersect to create four separate water areas with different claim status. The two areas south of the "A–B" line (about 2789&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 51.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size) are claimed by both countries.  The other two water areas are north of the "A–B" line and are not claimed by either country.  The two unclaimed areas are about 72&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt;

In addition, Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation (LTE) ("bare at half-tide"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NSDE/|author=U.S. National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that lies south of the "A–B" Line, surrounded by the sea territory claimed by the U.S.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; The United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea Treaty]], although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work= Harvard Law School National Security Journal|date=March 15, 2015|title=Why the US Should Ratify UNCLOS: A View from the South and East China Seas|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2015/03/why-the-us-should-ratify-unclos-a-view-from-the-south-and-east-china-seas/ |quote=... much of UNCLOS is based on customary principles of international law to which the U.S. already adheres.|last=Mirasola|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Territorial fishing disputes between the countries remain today, as the United States has never shown the "A–B" line as an official boundary on its government maps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25847">The '''Dominion Land Survey''' (DLS) is the method used to divide most of [[Western Canada]] into one-square-mile (2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) sections for agricultural and other purposes.  It is based on the layout of the [[Public Land Survey System]] used in the [[United States]], but has several differences.  The DLS is the dominant [[surveying|survey]] method in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]], and it is also used in [[British Columbia]] along the [[Railway Belt (British Columbia)|Railway Belt]] (near the main line of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), and in the [[Peace River Block]] in the northeast of the province.  (Although British Columbia entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] with control over its own lands, unlike the [[Northwest Territories]] and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The federal government then surveyed these areas under the DLS.)&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;[http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf ''Crown Lands: A History of Survey Systems''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184529/http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}, by W.A.

== History ==
The survey was begun in 1871, shortly after Manitoba and the North-West Territories became part of Canada, following the purchase of [[Rupert's Land]] from the Hudson’s Bay Company.  Covering about {{convert|800000|km2}}, the survey system and its terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies. The DLS is the world's largest survey grid laid down in a single integrated system. The first formal survey done in western Canada was by [[Peter Fidler (explorer)|Peter Fidler]] in 1813.&lt;ref name="DLwS"&gt;{{cite book |last= Thomson, Don W. |title="Men and meridians; the history of surveying and mapping in Canada vol 2". |year= 1966–69 |publisher= Ottawa, R. Duhamel, Queen's printer |pages= 20–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspiration for the Dominion Land Survey System was the plan for Manitoba (and later Saskatchewan and Alberta) to be agricultural economies. With a large amount of European settlers arriving, Manitoba was undergoing a large change so grasslands and parklands were surveyed, settled, and farmed.&lt;ref name=poi&gt;Hanuta, Irene. "A dominion land survey map of the Red River Valley." Manitoba History 58 (2008): 23+.. Web. 15 Nov. 2012.), [[Gale World History In Context]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion Land Survey system was developed because the farm name and field position descriptions used in northern Europe were not organized or flexible enough, and the township and concession system used in eastern Canada was not satisfactory. The first meridian was chosen at 97°27′28.4″ west longitude and was established in 1869. Another 6 meridians were established after.&lt;ref name=DLS1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfe | last2=McKercher |first1= Bertram |first2=Robert B. |title= Understanding Western Canada’s Dominion Land survey system |year= 1986 |publisher= University Extension Press |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of places are excluded from the survey system: these include federal lands such as Indian reserves, federal parks, and air weapon ranges. The surveys do not encroach on reserves because that land was established before the surveys began. When the Hudson's Bay Company relinquished their title to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, via the deed of surrender it received Section 8 and all of Section 26 excluding the northeast quarter. These lands were gradually sold by the company and in 1984 they donated the remaining {{convert|5100|acre|km2}} to the [[Saskatchewan Wildlife Association]].&lt;ref name=DLS2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfe | last2=McKercher  |first1= Bertram |first2=Robert B.  |title= Understanding Western Canada’s Dominion Land survey system |year= 1986 |publisher= University Extension Press |pages= 9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surveying of western Canada was divided into five basic surveys. Each survey's layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, in 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north-south. The largest and most important of these surveys was the third which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.&lt;ref name=DLS2 /&gt; The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.

The reason that the Canadian government was pushing to subdivide Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta was to affirm Canadian sovereignty over these lands. The United States was undergoing rapid expansion in the 1860s, and the Canadian government was afraid that the Americans would expand into Canadian territory. Canada's introduction of a railway and surveying was a means to discourage American encroachment. Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] remarked in 1870 that the Americans "are resolved to do all they can short of war, to get possession of our western territory, and we must take immediate and vigorous steps to counteract them."&lt;ref name=DLeS&gt;{{cite book |last1= Olsson |first1= Gord |last2= Rogers | first2= Steve |last3= Ballantyne| first3= Brain|title="Surveys, Parcels and Tenure On Canada Lands". |year= 2010 |publisher= Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada |pages= 17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Dominion Land Survey marked a new era for western Canada. Railways were making their way to the West and the population of western regions began to increase. The introduction of the survey system marked the end of the nomadic ways for the First Nations and Metis. This did not go over well and was a catalyst to the events of the [[Red River Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

Being a surveyor was not easy. The hours were long, the time away from civilization was longer, and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members, which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder, and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an [[alidade]], [[dumpy level]], [[theodolite]], [[Gunter's chain]] (which was replaced by a steel tape), and a [[solar compass]] or a vernier compass.&lt;ref name=DLwS /&gt;

The Dominion Land Survey system was proposed in 1869 by [[John Stoughton Dennis]]. The initial plan, though based on the square townships of the American [[Public Lands Survey System]], involved 9 mile townships divided into sixty-four 800 acre sections consisting of four 200 acre lots each. Work to establish the first meridian and few township outlines began and quickly ended in 1869 when a party of Metis symbolically stepped on a survey chain, beginning the [[Red River Resistance]]. Work resumed in 1871; however, the system was redesigned to use 6 mile townships with 640 acre sections based on a suggestion from Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]], who advocated that most of the settlers would come from the United States, so it was "advisable to offer them lots of a size to which they have been accustomed." The Dominion Land Survey System still differed from the Public Land System because it contained road allowances.&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

The Dominion Land Survey was enormous. Around {{convert|178000000|acre|km2}} are estimated to have been subdivided into quarter sections, 27 million of which were surveyed by 1883 (14 years after the system's inception). The amount of work undertaken between 1871 and 1930 is given justice by the amount of paper work submitted: the maps, plans and memos transferred by the Canadian government to the provinces filled approximately 200 railway cars. This did not include the closed or dormant files which would be enough to fill 9000 filing cabinets, which would weigh about 227 tons.&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

Until very recently, surveying was done with manually controlled instruments to take distance and angular measurements. Distance was measured using either a chain or more recently a transit or range finder. To turn angles a [[theodolite]] was used. To find their location they used astronomical observations, and to find elevation levels and barometers were used.&lt;ref name=asidf&gt;LAJEUNESSE CLAUDE.[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/surveying ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', "Surveying."]: 23+.. Web. 30 Nov. 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to see over long distances towers were constructed from timber in flat and wooded areas.&lt;ref name=asdf&gt;[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography-boundary/spatial-referencing/geodetic-timeline/5560 Natural Resources Canada.

The meridians were determined by painstaking survey observations and measurements, and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent, but were determined using 19th century technology.  The only truly accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in Europe.  Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be calculated or estimated by the positions of the sun and stars.  Consequently, although they were remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several hundred metres in error.  Before the survey was even completed it was established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the results of the physical survey would take precedence over the theoretically correct position of the meridians.  This precludes, for example any basis for a [[border dispute|boundary dispute]] between Alberta and Saskatchewan on account of surveying errors.

The main east–west lines are the [[Baseline (surveying)|baselines]].  The First Baseline is at [[49th parallel north|49° north]], which forms much of the [[Canada–United States border]] in the West.  Each subsequent baseline is about {{convert|24|mi|km}} to the north of the previous one,&lt;ref name=larmour/&gt; terminating at [[60th parallel north|60° north]], which forms the boundary with [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]].

== Townships ==
[[File:Dominion-land-system-overview.png|thumb|350px|left|A part of the Dominion Land Survey (convergence of meridians exaggerated). The shaded township is Township 17, Range 8 west of the Third Meridian.]]
Starting at each intersection of a meridian and a baseline and working west (also working east of the First Meridian and the Coast Meridian&lt;ref name=western/&gt;), nearly square [[Township (Canada)|township]]s are surveyed, which are about {{convert|6|mi|km}} in both north–south and east–west extent.  There are two tiers of townships to the north and two tiers to the south of each baseline.

Because the east and west edges of townships, called "range lines", are meridians of [[longitude]], they converge towards the [[North Pole]].  Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south.  Only along the baselines do townships have their nominal width from east to west.  The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south.  Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships.  The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north–south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west.  These east–west lines halfway between baselines are called "correction lines".&lt;ref name=larmour/&gt;

Townships are designated by their "township number" and "range number".  Township 1 is the first north of the First Baseline, and the numbers increase to the north.  Range numbers recommence with Range 1 at each meridian and increase to the west (also east of First Meridian and Coast Meridian).  On maps, township numbers are marked in [[Arabic numeral]]s, but range numbers are often marked in [[Roman numeral]]s; however, in other contexts Arabic numerals are used for both.  Individual townships are designated such as "Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian," abbreviated "52-25-W4."  In Manitoba, the First Meridian is the only one used, so the abbreviations are even more terse, e.g., "3-1-W" and "24-2-E.". In Manitoba legislation, the abbreviations WPM and EPM are used: "3-1 WPM" and "24-2 EPM".

== Sections&lt;!--[[Section]], [[Quarter section]] and [[Annexations of Edmonton]] link here--&gt; ==
Every township is divided into 36 '''sections''', each about {{convert|1|mi|km}} square.  Sections are numbered within townships, beginning with the southeast section, as follows (north at top):
{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="3"
|- class="center"
|31||32||33||34||35||36
|- class="center"
|30||29||28||27||26||25
|- class="center"
|19||20||21||22||23||24

|18||17||16||15||14||13
|- class="center"
|7||8||9||10||11||12
|- class="center"
|6||5||4||3||2||1
|}

In turn, each section is divided into four '''quarter sections''' (square land parcels roughly 1/2 mile on a side):  southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast. This quarter-section description is primarily used by the agricultural industry.  The full legal description of a particular quarter section is "the Northeast Quarter of Section 20, Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian", abbreviated "NE-20-52-25-W4."

A section may also be split into as many as 16 '''legal subdivisions''' (LSDs). LSDs are commonly used by the oil and gas industry as a precise way of locating wells, pipelines, and facilities.  LSDs can be "quarter-quarter sections" (square land parcels roughly {{convert|1/4|mi|m}} on a side, comprising roughly {{convert|40|acre|m2}} in area)—but this is not necessary. Many are other fractions of a section (a half-quarter section—roughly {{convert|80|acre|m2}} in area is common.)  LSDs may be square, rectangular, and occasionally even triangular. LSDs are numbered as follows (north at top):
{| class="wikitable"
|- class="center"
|13||14||15||16
|- class="center"
|12||11||10||9
|- class="center"
|5||6||7||8
|- class="center"
|4||3||2||1
|}

In order to fully understand how the townships, sections, quarter sections, and legal subdivisions were set out, one should refer to the ''Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Land''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clss.nrcan.gc.ca/standards-normes/toc-domlan-terredom-1-3-v1-eng.php Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Lands, 1st to 10th Editions], Surveyor General Branch, Earth Sciences Sector, [[Natural Resources Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs such as "A, B, C, D etc." for example, to distinguish between multiple sites within an LSD.  These in no way constitute an official change to the Dominion Land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part of the legal description.

== Road allowances ==
[[File:Dominion-land-survey-township.png|thumb|400px|right|Road allowances and special sections in the Dominion Land Survey.]]
Between certain sections of a township run "road allowances" (but not all road allowances have an actual road built on them). The road allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly {{convert|24|mi|km}} apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of {{convert|1+1/2|chain|m|lk=in}} surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are {{convert|1|chain|m}} wide and run north–south between all sections; however, there are only three east–west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north-south road allowance every mile going west, and an east-west road allowance every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American [[Public Land Survey System]], which leaves no extra space for roads.

== Special sections ==
Certain sections of townships were reserved for special purposes:
* As part of the deal that transferred [[Rupert's Land]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to Canada, the HBC retained five per cent of the "fertile belt" (south of the [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] and [[Winnipeg River|Winnipeg rivers]]).  Therefore, Section 8 and three-quarters of Section 26 were assigned to the company.  Additionally, the fourth quarter of Section 26 in townships whose numbers were divisible by five also belonged to the HBC in order to give the company exactly five per cent. Although the HBC sold all these sections long ago, they are still often locally called "the '''Bay section'''" today.
* The odd-numbered sections (except 11 and 29) were often used for [[railway]] land-grants.  The Prairies could not be settled without railways, so the Dominion government habitually granted large tracts of land to railway companies as an incentive to build lines.  Notably, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted {{convert|25000000|acre|km2}} for the construction of its first line from Ontario to the Pacific.  These sections are colloquially called '''CPR sections''' regardless of the railway they were originally granted to.
* Sections 11 and 29 were '''school sections'''.  When [[school board]]s were formed, they gained title to these sections, which were then sold to fund the initial construction of schools.  The rural school buildings were often as not located on school sections; frequently, land trades were made between landowners and the school for practical reasons.
* The remaining quarter sections were available as '''homesteads''' under the provisions of the [[Dominion Lands Act]], the federal government's plan for settling the North-West.  A homesteader paid a $10 fee for a quarter section of his choice.  If after three years he had cultivated {{convert|30|acre|ha}} and had built a house (often just a [[sod house]]), he gained title to the quarter.  Homesteads were available as late as the 1950s, but the bulk of the settlement of the Prairies was 1885 to 1914.

Legal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations.  Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the sake of convenience or for certain tasks.  Urban developments superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and township grid also.

== Political disputes over the survey ==
Certain areas otherwise within the surveys' boundaries were not part of the survey grid, or not available for homesteading. These were [[Indian reserves]], pre-existing "settlements" divided into "[[Seigneurial system of New France|river lots]]" based on the French system used in Quebec, and lands around Hudson's Bay Company trading posts reserved for the company when it transferred its claim over the West to Canada in 1870.

The rights of the pre-DLS settlers was a major political issue in the West in the late nineteenth century.  The settlers claimed [[squatters' rights]] over the land they had already farmed, but the sizes and boundaries of these farms were poorly defined, leading to frequent disputes.  As well the Métis in the [[Southbranch Settlement|Southbranch settlements]] of Saskatchewan were particularly with their land rights given that they had not been well protected by the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' as they had been promised in 1870.  In the case of the closely clustered settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, and Fort Saskatchewan in the Alberta District, a militant "settlers' rights" movement developed which demanded action from the federal government to grant the settlers legal title to their land and to end claim jumping.  The movement even resorted to vigilante action against suspected claim jumpers.  Most of these grievances were resolved by 1885, which is likely one of the reasons the area never joined the [[North-West Rebellion]] despite the fact that St. Albert, and to a lesser extent Edmonton, were largely populated by Métis people.&lt;ref name="Macleod1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">'''Friedrich von Hellwald''' ( 29 March 1842, [[Padua]] &amp;ndash; 1 November 1892, [[Cannstatt]]) was an [[Austria]]n writer on [[geography]] and the [[history]] of civilization.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Padua]]. He entered the Austrian Army in 1858, and was a lieutenant of cavalry (1866) in the [[Prusso-Austrian War|war with Prussia]].

'''Geomatics''' is defined in the [[ISO/TC 211]] series of standards as the "[[academic discipline|discipline]] concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of [[geographic data or geographic information]]".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/TR 19122:2004(en)
Geographic information/Geomatics — Qualification and certification of personnel [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:19122:ed-1:v1:en]&lt;/ref&gt; Under another definition it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedgeomatics.net/about-us.html|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=Applied Geomatics Research Laboratory|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes '''geomatics engineering''' (and [[surveying engineering]]) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).

==Overview and etymology ==

Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced ''geomatics'' as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in ''The Canadian Surveyor'' and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the [[Canadian Institute of Geomatics|Canadian Institute of Surveying]] in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Paradis|first1= Michel|title= De l'arpentage à la géomatique|journal= Le géomètre canadien|date= September 1981|volume= 35| issue = 3|page=262 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in [[land surveying]], [[remote sensing]], [[cartography]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[Satellite navigation|global-navigation satellite systems]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[Compass navigation system|Compass]]), [[photogrammetry]], [[geophysics]], [[geography]], and related forms of earth [[map]]ping. The term was originally used in [[Canada]], because it is similar in origin to both French and English,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} but has since been adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the [[United States]]) have shown a preference for the term ''geospatial technology''.{{ref}}{{verify source|date=April 2015}}

The related field of ''hydrogeomatics'' covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of [[hydrography|hydrographics]] was considered{{by whom|date=April 2015}} too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.

A ''geospatial network'' is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One example of such a network is the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]'s efforts to provide ''ready global access to geographic information''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A number{{quantify|date=April 2015}} of university departments which were once titled "surveying", "survey engineering" or "[[topographic]] science" have re-titled themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".

The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in [[computer]] hardware, [[computer science]], and [[software engineering]], as well as by airborne and space observation [[remote-sensing]] technologies.

The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of geomatics.

== Science {{anchor|Spatial science}}{{anchor|Geospatial science}} ==
{{see also|Geographic information science}}
'''Geospatial science''' is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as [[surveying]], [[geographic information systems]], [[hydrography]] and [[cartography]]. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.&lt;ref name="QUT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |title=Queensland University of Technology, ''Undergratuate Program - Spatial Science (Surveying)'' |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719223038/http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |archive-date=2008-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''spatial science''' or '''spatial sciences''' is primarily used in [[Australia]].
Australian universities which offer degrees in spatial science include [[Curtin University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.curtin.edu.au/courses Curtin University - Spatial science courses]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Tasmania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utas.edu.au/spatial/courses.html University of Tasmania, Centre for Spatial Information Science, ''Courses''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725153828/http://www.utas.edu.au/spatial/courses.html |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Adelaide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciences.adelaide.edu.au/current-students/ug/study-plans/bsci/ecology-spatialscience-major.pdf|title=University of Adelaide, Major in Ecology and Spatial Science|author=|date=|website=adelaide.edu.au|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821172853/http://sciences.adelaide.edu.au/current-students/ug/study-plans/bsci/ecology-spatialscience-major.pdf|archive-date=21 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Melbourne University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geom.unimelb.edu.au/spatial/index.html Melbourne University - Spatial Information Science]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[RMIT University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/science/surveying-and-geospatial-sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., [[Texas A&amp;M University]] offers a bachelor's degree in Spatial Sciences and is home to its own Spatial Sciences Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssl.tamu.edu/home.aspx Texas A&amp;M University, Spatial Sciences Laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080905173501/http://ssl.tamu.edu/home.aspx |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2012, the [[University of Southern California]] started to place more emphasis on the spatial science branch of its geography department, with traditional human and physical geography courses and concentrations either not being offered on a regular basis or phased out. In place, the university now offers graduate programs strictly related to spatial science and its geography department offers a spatial science minor rather than the original geography major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalogue.usc.edu/schools/college/spatial-sciences-institute/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124031115/http://catalogue.usc.edu/schools/college/spatial-sciences-institute/ |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering {{anchor|Geomatics engineering}} ==
{{cleanup merge|Geomatics engineering|date=April 2016}}
'''Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering''' is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.

Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land [[surveying engineering]] along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from [[data science]] and [[cartography]] to [[geography]]. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.

Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.

The more traditional [[land surveying]] strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of [[real property]] parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land descriptions.  The tasks more closely related to [[civil engineering]] include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and control surveys for construction projects.

Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital [[theodolite]]/distance meter total stations, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.

Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of interdisciplinary fields.

In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with the name [[surveying]] in some, and in others with the names geomatics, geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in [[civil engineering]] education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data sciences under [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]] or [[applied mathematics]]. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering.
The job of ''geospatial engineer'' is well established in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/construction-engineering/geospatial-engineer.html|title=Geospatial Engineer Jobs (12Y)|author=|date=|website=goarmy.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalguard.com/12y-geospatial-engineer|title=12Y Geospatial Engineer - National Guard|author=|date=|website=www.nationalguard.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6017">'''Georgius Hornius''' (Georg Horn, 1620&amp;ndash;1670) was a German historian and geographer, professor of history at [[Leiden University]] from 1653 until his death.

==Life==
He was born in [[Kemnath]], [[Upper Palatinate]] (at the time part of the [[Electoral Palatinate]] under [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick V]]) as the son of the superintendent of the [[Calvinism in Germany|Reformed church]] there. 
His family was forced to move away in the wake of the Catholic victory at [[Battle of White Mountain|White Mountain]], when Horn was still an infant. 
In 1635, he visited the gymnasium in [[Nuremberg]], and in 1637 he was enrolled in [[University of Altdorf]] as a student of theology and medicine.
He later worked as a private tutor, in [[Gröningen]] and later in [[Leiden]], in the [[Dutch Republic]]. In Leiden, he was also enrolled as a student of [[Friedrich Spanheim]]. After a two year's sojourn in England, he returned to Leiden, compiling a history of the events of the ongoing [[English Civil War]] (''Rerum Britannicarum libri VII'', ''De statu ecclesiae Britannicae hodierno'').

In 1648, he completed a doctorate in Leiden and refused calls to both [[Frankfurt University]] and [[Heidelberg University]] as professor of theology, instead accepting the position of professor of history, politics and geography at the new [[University of Harderwijk]], where he became rector in 1652. In 1653, he became professor of history at [[Leiden University]], a position he held until his death in 1670.

In his later life, Horn was also greatly interested in [[alchemy]]. In 1665, he was swindled out of the considerable sum of 5,000 [[Dutch guilder#History|guilders]]&lt;ref&gt;5,000 guilders (''Carolusgulden'') at the time corresponded to 8.55&amp;nbsp;kg of gold at 14 carat, or 5&amp;nbsp;kg (176&amp;nbsp;oz) of pure gold.&lt;/ref&gt; by a fraudulent alchemist. 
His interest in alchemy als resulted in an edition of [[Pseudo-Geber]] in 1668.
From about this time, he also began to suffer from intermittent spells of mental distraction, although he remained a prolific writer until his death.

Among his publications, his Latin works on [[universal history]], intended as a textbook for students, wer especially influential (''Historia ecclesiastica et politica'', ''Arca Noae'', ''Orbis Politicus'', ''Orbis Imperans''). These works were re-published long after his death in both the Netherlands and Germany.
His  treated universal history in a modern manner, no longer divided into the history of the [[Four kingdoms of Daniel|four classical empires]] ([[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Macedonian Empire|Macedon]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]]) but based on the concept of [[national history]], including the history of the peoples of the New World (''De originibus Americanis'').
He was also one of the earliest historiographers to divide world history into three major epochs, antiquity from earliest times until the [[Migration period]], the [[Middle Ages|middle period]] from the Migration period to the year 1500, and [[modernity|modern history]] from 1500 to his own day.
His coverage of the Migration period is presented as the history of the "[[Scythians|Scythian]]" nation, which is divided into [[Germanic peoples|Germans]], [[Huns]] and [[early Slavs|Slavs]].

In all his works, Horn presents himself as a pious Protestant&lt;!-- so in ADB ("zeigt er sich als einen streng orthodoxen Protestanten"), but this probably means Calvinist, not Lutheran(?)--&gt; and as a patriot of his homeland, considering himself a native of and exile from the [[Upper Palatinate]] (which had been annexed by the Catholic [[Duke of Bavaria]] in 1628).&lt;ref&gt;An example of his continued patriotic attachment to his homeland is his description of 
[[Rauher Kulm]], a hill of 682&amp;nbsp;m close to his native Kemnath, in his ''Orbis Politicus'' (1667){{page needed|date=March 2018}}
as "standing in the center of Germany, standing taller than all mountains far and wide, as it were a Wonder of the World".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John A. Agnew''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born [[Millom]], England, August 29, 1949) is a prominent [[Great Britain|British]]-[[United States|American]] political geographer. Agnew was educated at the Universities of [[University of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] in England and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] in the [[United States]].

==Life and career==
Agnew is currently Distinguished Professor of [[Geography]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). From 1975 until 1995 he was a professor at [[Syracuse University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Dr. Agnew teaches courses on political geography, the history of geography, European cities, and the Mediterranean World.  From 1998 to 2002 he chaired the Department of Geography at UCLA. He has written widely on questions of territory, place, and political power. He has also worked on issues of "science" in geography and how knowledge is created and circulates in and across places. He is best known for his work completely reinventing "[[geopolitics]]" as a field of study and for his theoretical and empirical efforts at showing how national politics is best understood in terms of the geographical dynamics of "places" and how they are made out of both local and long-distance determinants. One of his best known books is "Place and Politics" (1987).  Another is "Geopolitics: Re-Visioning World Politics" (2003).  Much of his empirical research involves Italy, Greece, and the United States. For the year 2008–9, John Agnew was President of the [[Association of American Geographers]], the main professional organization for academic geography in the United States. He was associate editor of the flagship journal of the association, [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] and was co-editor of the international journal ''[[Geopolitics (journal)|Geopolitics]]'' with [[David Newman (political geographer)|David Newman]] from 1998 to 2009. He is now editor-in-chief of the journal, "Territory, Politics, Governance" published by Routledge.

==Place==
In ''Place and Politics'' (1987), John Agnew contends that for a space to become a 'place', three requirements need to be met : 
* A specific location, something that answers the question, 'Where?'in relation to everywhere else.
* A locale - the actual shape of the space, such as defined by the walls in a room or parks and streets in a city, etc. but usually associated with everyday activities (work, recreation, etc.)
* A sense of place - the personal and emotional attachment people have to a place
The focus on place reflects an effort to create a multi-scalar political geography.  Agnew sees this as an alternative to the long-dominant state-centrism of the field and better suited than it to the evolving global condition. In this work he tries to do two things: (a) offer a conception of places as geographical settings for political action that are structured by the historical accumulation of local, wider-ranging, and sense-of-place influences and (b) relate the changing character of places with respect to the politics they produce to changes in the wider environment (such as changes in the balance between local and national-state governments, changes in the workings of the world economy, changes in social-class, ethnic, and other social affiliations, and shifts in the meaning and attachments to particular places).

Bringing together research conducted over the previous fifteen years on Italian politics, ''Place and Politics in Modern Italy'' (2002), is the most significant development of this perspective since his 1987 book, ''Place and Politics''.  It engages with contemporary debates in political theory about rational choice, association, difference, and socialization to provide an alternative geographical perspective that is both attentive to theoretical issues yet immersed in empirical specificity at Italy-wide and local geographical scales.  More recently,(2003–2007), Agnew and his colleague Michael Shin have collaborated on an NSF-funded project concerning the transformation of Italian electoral politics between 1987 and 2006 that will further the goal of the research by measuring the geographical dynamics of Italian politics in the country as a whole.  The book, ''Berlusconi's Italy'' (2008), reports on this particular project.

== Geopolitics ==
Agnew has also been actively involved in reformulating on a critical footing the hitherto long-taboo subject among Anglo-American geographers of “geopolitics.”  His 1998 book ''Geopolitics'' appeared in a second edition in 2003 and along with the co-authored book ''Mastering Space'' (1995), is part of this enterprise.  Perhaps his most polished arguments in this area are in ''[[Hegemony]]: The New Shape of Global Power'', which won a Choice Award as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2005, and in “Sovereignty Regimes”, a long article that appeared the same year and has been transformed into a book length project, ''Globalization and Sovereignty'' (2009) which also won a Choice Outstanding Academic Title Award. Perhaps the three most important themes of this work taken as a whole are (a) the historicization of the idealized state of conventional political theory and geopolitics to the modern era; (b) the role of distinctive geopolitical discourses in different epochs of this era in normalizing the worldview associated with what he calls the state-centered “modern geopolitical imagination;” and (c) the need to take seriously the distinctive contributions to the character of “world order” brought by different hegemonic powers. His work on geopolitical discourse has been a major contribution to the [[geography of media and communication]].

This work has attracted the attention of international relations scholars interested in paying more attention to the ways in which “geography” enters into the theory and practices of “international relations.” Agnew's recent work in this area, specifically on the European origins of the modern state and what this signifies for contemporary statehood in southeastern Europe, was helped by the award of a [[John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship]] for the academic year 2003–2004.  The recent article "No Borders, No Nations: Making Greece in Macedonia" (''Annals of the [[Association of American Geographers]]'', 2007) is an important statement of Agnew's perspective on international borders, an important element in the field of geopolitics. His article "Sovereignty Regimes: Territoriality and State Authority in Contemporary World Politics" was published by the Annals of [[Association of American Geographers]]'', 2005) on the various geographical ways, both territorial and networked, in which sovereignty works other than just the simple mapping of territorial blocs of space long assumed by international relations and international law.

==Remote Sensing and Political Geography==
In September 2008 Agnew and a group from UCLA evaluated the relative success of the so-called US military surge in Baghdad using night-light satellite information ("Baghdad Nights", Environment and Planning A (2008)).  Claiming that the surge merely sealed the fate of Sunni and mixed Sunni/Shia neighborhoods already reduced in population by previous violence, this research received an enormous amount of coverage in the press and the blogosphere, not least from right-wing bloggers in the US defending the Bush-McCain claim that the surge "had worked" but without any sort of empirical information to justify their politically inspired arguments (S. Tavernise and A.W. Lehren, "A grim portrait of civilian deaths in Iraq" New York Times, 22 October 2010) During early 2009, a team led by Thomas W. Gillespie and Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical analysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar [Pakistan] as likely hideouts of the Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2001.  This too received considerable media coverage.  Much of this, however, failed to note the ironic tone of the MIT International Review paper (2009), "Finding Bin Laden", reporting the research with its emphasis on why so little effort seemingly had been put into finding the al-Qaeda leader after 2001 and the stake of US governments in keeping the myth of Islamic terrorism going as a basis for an endless new war recapitulating the "success" of the Cold War in mobilizing US identity and formulating a US foreign policy to which others could be recruited.

==Personal==
John Agnew has two daughters: Katherine Agnew Sommer, a deputy district attorney for [[Los Angeles County]] and Dr. Christine Agnew Brune, an epidemiologist at the CDC in Atlanta.

The '''Kunlun Mountains''' ({{zh|t=崑崙山|s=昆仑山|p=Kūnlún Shān}}, {{IPA-cmn|kʰu̯ə́nlu̯ə̌n ʂán|pron}}; {{lang-mn|Хөндлөн Уулс}}, ''Khöndlön Uuls''; {{lang-ug|كۇئېنلۇن تاغ تىزمىسى}}) are one of the longest [[mountain chain]]s in [[Asia]], extending more than {{convert|3000|km}}. In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] south of the [[Tarim Basin]].

The exact definition of this range varies. An old source&lt;ref&gt;L. Richard, 'Comprehensive Geography of the Chinese Empire',1905&lt;/ref&gt; uses Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Kunlun in the narrow sense: [[Altyn Tagh]] along with the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] and [[Qin Mountains]]. A recent source&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Atlas of China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; has the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the [[Tarim Basin]] and then continuing east south of the Altyn Tagh. [[Sima Qian]] (''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'', scroll 123) says that [[Emperor Wu of Han]] sent men to find the source of the Yellow River and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi-mythical location in the classical Chinese text ''[[Shanhai Jing]]''.

==Extent==
[[File:Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the Tibet-Xinjiang highway.jpg|thumb|Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the [[China National Highway 219|Tibet-Xinjiang highway]]]]
From the [[Pamirs]] of [[Tajikistan]], it runs east along the border between [[Xinjiang]] and Tibet autonomous regions to the Sino-Tibetan ranges in [[Qinghai]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325007/Kunlun-Mountains|title=Kunlun Mountains|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretches along the southern edge of what is now called the [[Tarim Basin]], the infamous [[Takla Makan]] or "sand-buried houses" desert, and the [[Gobi Desert]]. A number of important rivers flow from it including the [[Karakash River]] ('Black Jade River') and the [[Yurungkash River]] ('White Jade River'), which flow through the [[Khotan]] [[Oasis]] into the [[Taklamakan Desert]].
[[File:TibBahn1.jpg|thumb|left|The Kunlun Pass]]
[[Altyn-Tagh]] or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian Shan]] is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the [[Min Shan]]. [[Bayan Har Mountains]], a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the [[water divide|watershed]] between the catchment basins of [[China]]'s two longest rivers, the [[Yangtze River]] and the [[Yellow River]].

The highest mountain of the Kunlun Shan is the [[Liushi Shan|Kunlun Goddess]] (7,167 m) in the [[Keriya County|Keriya]] area in western Kunlun Shan. Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as [[Kongur Tagh]] (7,649 m) and the famous [[Muztagh Ata]] (7,546 m). But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] group (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Shan; its highest points are [[Ulugh Muztagh]] (6,973 m) and [[Bukadaban Feng]] (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Shan the highest peaks are [[Yuzhu Peak]] (6,224 m) and [[Dradullungshong]] (6,282 m); the latter is the eastern major peak in Kunlun Shan range and is thus considered as the eastern edge of Kunlun Shan range.

The mountain range formed at the northern edges of the [[Cimmerian Plate]] during its collision, in the [[Late Triassic|Late]] [[Triassic]], with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], which resulted in the closing of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]].

The range has very few roads and in its 3,000&amp;nbsp;km length is crossed by only two. In the west, [[China National Highway 219|Highway 219]] traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, [[China National Highway 109|Highway 109]] crosses between [[Lhasa]] and [[Golmud]].

===Kunlun Volcanic Group===
{{Main article|Kunlun Volcanic Group}}
Over 70 [[volcanic cone|volcanic cones]] form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of {{Convert|5808|m|ft|0}} above sea level ({{Coord|35.5|N|80.2|E|type:mountain}}). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] (after [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]) and one of [[Volcanic Seven Summits]] by elevation. (Mount [[Damavand]] is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1004-03-|title=Kunlun Volcanic Group|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Peak in Kunlun range.jpg|thumb|upright|Peak in Kunlun range]]
{{Main article|Kunlun Mountain (mythology)}}
Kunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a [[Taoist]] [[paradise]]. The first to visit this paradise was, according to the legends, [[King Mu of Zhou|King Mu]] (976-922 BCE) of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. He supposedly discovered there the Jade Palace of the [[Yellow Emperor]], the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met [[Hsi Wang Mu]] (Xi Wang Mu), the 'Spirit Mother of the West' usually called the 'Queen Mother of the West', who was the object of an ancient religious cult which reached its peak in the [[Han Dynasty]], and also had her mythical abode in these mountains.
&lt;br&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Kunlun mountains (spelled "Kuen-Lun" in the book) are described as the location of the [[Shangri-La]] monastery in the 1933 novel ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by English writer [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].

The mountains are the site of the fictional city of K'un Lun in the Marvel Comics [[Iron_Fist_(comics)|Iron Fist]] series and the [[Iron_Fist_(TV_series)|TV show of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-kun-lun-in-iron-fist-the-lost-city-has-a-mystical-history-44558 |title=What Is K'un-Lun In 'Iron Fist'?

action as we "let the pie fly." As with anything Nickelodeon, someone may end

up with a face full of whipped cream!

The Nickelodeon Celebration Parade, winner of the International

Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions' (IAAPA) 2004 &amp; 2005 Big E

Award for Best Production: Parade Performance, was presented daily at 6:00pm[EST]

[[File:No smoking sign.svg|right|thumb|150px|A [[pictogram]] often used to denote a smoking ban|alt=No smoking sign]]

The following is a '''[[list of smoking bans]] in [[Australia]]''', implemented by the [[Government of Australia|federal]], [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]], and [[Local government in Australia|local governments]].

==Federal Government==
Federal law bans smoking in all Australian Commonwealth government buildings, public transport, airports, and international and domestic flights. Further bans are in place but are governed by individual states. Currently all Australian states and territories have banned smoking in vehicles with children, in some enclosed public places, particularly most major company-owned workplaces, and most enclosed restaurants. Tobacco products cannot be sold or supplied to persons under 18 years old, but there is no legal age to use them.

The Australian Government has made very few laws on electronic cigarettes and leaves it up to the states.

==Smoking population==
In 2013, around 13.3% of people aged 18 and older in Australia were daily smokers.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{citation|title=Tobacco smoking tables (403KB XLS) 2 – Table 7.1: Daily tobacco smokers, people aged 18 years and older, by state/territoryex, 1998 to 2013 (per cent)|publisher=Australian Government|author=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129549644|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By state/territory, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] had the lowest percentage of daily smokers in the country at 9.9%, and the Northern Territory the highest at around 22.2% then Tasmania at 21% followed by Queensland at 20%.&lt;ref name=pop /&gt; In 2016, around 17.4% of people aged 18 and older in Australia were daily or occasional smokers, higher than the United States and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=More smokers lighting up, despite ever-increasing taxes|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/more-smokers-lighting-up-despite-everincreasing-taxes/news-story/190014e7306548c49fc372dabb5a0555|author=Adam Creighton|date=14 August 2017|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==States and territories==
===Australian Capital Territory===
On 6 December 1995, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government was the first jurisdictional government in Australia to introduce no smoking in cafes and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 years on, smoke-free dining is staple fare|first=Emma|last=Tinkler|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=8 December 2005|page=11|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 December 2006 a smoking ban has applied to all enclosed public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-10-25/act-govt-under-fire-over-smoking-regulations/2131354|title=ACT Govt under fire over smoking regulations|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=25 October 2005|archivedate=3 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903055923/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-10-25/act-govt-under-fire-over-smoking-regulations/2131354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACT Government introduced laws to prohibit smoking in most outdoor eating areas in the territory starting December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-09/no-smoking-in-outdoor-eating-areas/2368016|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|title=No smoking in outdoor eating areas|date=9 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903053924/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-09/no-smoking-in-outdoor-eating-areas/2368016|archivedate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions to this rule can be made but only under certain guidelines. A "Designated Outdoor Smoking Area" (DOSA) requirements include; may not encompass more than 50% of the outdoor area, must be separated from smoke-free areas by no less than 4 metres or a non-transparent fixed wall barrier at least 3 metres high.

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government introduced a ban on smoking in enclosed public areas in the State, except for bars and in licensed premises, on 6&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2000|first=Raoul A.|last=Walsh|title=Overwhelming support for smoking ban|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=24|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government introduced a total "enclosed space" ban in [[New South Wales]] on 1 July 2007. In this state, a public place is considered substantially enclosed only if the total area of ceiling and wall surfaces are more than 75% of its total notional ceiling and wall area. Windows and doors may be counted as open space only if they are locked open to the outside for the duration of trading hours. 10% of the total ceiling and wall area must remain open to the elements at all times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/resources/aboutus/legal/pdf/SFEAguide.pdf "NSW Health: Smoke-free guide: Determining an enclosed public place"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 July 2009, smoking in a car with someone under the age of 16 is against the law. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008 creates a new offence of smoking in a car with a child under 16 years of age in the vehicle. A $250 on-the-spot fine applies to the driver and any passenger who breaks the law. This is enforced by NSW Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/publichealth/healthpromotion/tobacco/smoke_free_cars.asp |title=Smoke-free Cars – NSW Department of Health |publisher=Health.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However licence premises may set aside an outdoor smoking area for drinking only and must be 4 metres away from restaurant tables and no more than 75% enclosed.

Since 7 January 2013, smoking is banned at public (outdoor) playgrounds within 10 m of children's play equipment, in open areas of public swimming pools, at major sports grounds, within 4 m of any building open to the public and at public transport stops (including outdoor parts of railway stations, bus stops, light rail stops and taxi ranks). Bans on smoking within 4 metres of a pedestrian access point to a public building will include  seated areas restaurants and cafés since 6 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asthmafoundation.org.au/NSW/MR/new_outdoor_smoking_laws_take_effect.aspx New outdoor smoking laws take effect in NSW]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New South Wales Government banned smoking at [[correctional facilities]] within the state since 10 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/sr/2015-390.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-20/smoking-ban-in-nsw-jails/5684526|title=Smoking to be banned in NSW prisons in 2015; Inmates, officers to be offered quit smoking programs|first=Philippa|last=McDonald|date=20 August 2014|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703073204/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-20/smoking-ban-in-nsw-jails/5684526|archivedate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-15/nsw-prisoners-advised-to-play-games-when-smoking-ban-comes-in/6621238|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902104547/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-15/nsw-prisoners-advised-to-play-games-when-smoking-ban-comes-in/6621238|archivedate=2 September 2015|title=Prisoners advised to meditate, play games when NSW jails put under smoking ban|first=Lucy|last=McNally|date=15 July 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/08/10/nsw-inmates-swap-ciggies-patches|title=NSW jails smoking ban comes into effect|date=10 August 2015|publisher=SBS|agency=AAP|archivedate=2 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902104817/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/08/10/nsw-inmates-swap-ciggies-patches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norfolk Island===
Smoking is banned in all government buildings, tour buses, taxis and flights to and from [[Norfolk Island]]. There is no law on smoking in restaurants, but many are smoke-free; however, they often have a dedicated smoking room for people that wish to smoke. Smoking is permitted in all bars and licensed premises. Resorts and motels have smoking rooms and areas for smokers.

===Northern    Territory===
Certain restrictions on smoking in enclosed areas of restaurants, licensed clubs and pubs came into force in the [[Northern Territory]] on 2 January 2010. Areas such as pubs, clubs and restaurants can now only have 50% of their premises a smoking room/area. The Northern Territory is also the last jurisdiction In Australia that still allows smoking inside certain areas of schools providing children do not have access to that area. In the Northern Territory it is common for bars in rural areas to disobey the smoking bans that the government has put into place although fines can be issued ranging from $1000 to $8000. The Northern Territory Government became the first jurisdiction to ban smoking in [[correctional facilities]] when it introduced a total ban on cigarettes in the institutions on 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/06/29/3792454.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705000515/http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/06/29/3792454.htm|archivedate=5 July 2013|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|first=Lauren|last=Fitzgerald|date=1 July 2013|title=No more excuses: smoking ban enforced in NT prisons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/10070/255988/1/Elferink-210613-Moving_towards_a_total_smoking_ban_in_territory_prisons.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902092555/http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/10070/255988/1/Elferink-210613-Moving_towards_a_total_smoking_ban_in_territory_prisons.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2015|first=John|last=Elferink|date=21 June 2013|title=Moving towards a total smoking ban in Territory prisons|publisher=Northern Territory Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland===
The [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] prohibits smoking in all pubs, clubs, restaurants and workplaces in [[Queensland]], as well as in commercial outdoor eating and drinking areas and in outdoor public places (e.g., patrolled beaches, children's playground equipment, major sport stadiums, and within 4 metres of non-residential building entrances). Since 1 July 2006, premises holding a hotel, club or casino liquor licence can designate up to 50% of the outdoor liquor licensed area as a smoking and drinking area. In this area no food or drink can be served, no food can be consumed, no entertainment can be offered and there must be no gaming machines provided. A "buffer", which can be either a 2-metre-wide area or a 2.1-metre-high screen that is impervious to smoke, must be on the area's perimeter wherever it is adjacent to other parts of the outdoor area usually accessed by patrons. Premises that choose to have such an area must have a smoking management plan for the premises that complies with legislative requirements.

===South Australia===
A total enclosed public place smoking ban was introduced in [[South Australia]] on 1 November 2007. However, under the SA Tobacco Products Regulation Act 1997, a place or area is only "enclosed" if it is fully enclosed or is at least partially covered by a ceiling and has walls such that the total area of the ceiling and wall surfaces exceeds 70 per cent of the total notional ceiling and wall area. It is illegal to smoke in cars while children (under 16) are passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Families SA|title=Fines for smoking in cars with children in South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/7098/Fines-smoking-in-cars-with-children.pdf|website=SA.GOV.AU|publisher=Government of South Australia, Department for Families and Communities|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since April 2012, smoking is not allowed beneath covered public transport waiting areas, including bus, tram, train and taxi shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SA Health|title=Smoke-free covered transport waiting areas|url=https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/4a456b0043bd5e67accbeda226e71fb1/OA_PTWA_FSTransport.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|website=SA Health|publisher=Government of South Australia, Department for Health and Ageing|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Correctional facilities]] in South Australia banned smoking inside prison cells starting  January 1, 2015.

===Tasmania===
[[Tasmania]] was the first Australian state to introduce a total indoor smoking ban in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobacco.health.usyd.edu.au/assets/pdfs/Law/FinalGuidetoTasmanianSFA.pdf "A Guide to Smoke-Free Areas in Tasmania"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321180027/http://tobacco.health.usyd.edu.au/assets/pdfs/Law/FinalGuidetoTasmanianSFA.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 January 2008, smoking in cars with passengers under the age of 18 is banned and will incur a $110 on the spot fine.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/smoking-banned-in-cars-in-tasmania/story-e6frg6ox-1111115222279 "Smoking banned in cars in Tasmania"] in ''[[The Australian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; (The laws would be strictly enforced only after a three-month education period.&lt;ref name=AU /&gt;). Smoking has been banned in all outdoor restaurants since 2012, however, outdoor areas of licensed premises are exempted from the ban. Tasmanian [[Correctional facilities]] have banned smoking since January 1, 2015.

===Western Australia===
[[Western Australia]] was the second Australian state to ban smoking in all indoor areas of pubs, bars and clubs since 31 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:27673P/$FILE/Tobacco%20Products%20Control%20Regulations%202006%20-%20%5B02-e0-00%5D.pdf |title=Western Australia – Tobacco Products Control Regulations 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking bans apply in outdoor eating areas, where people eat and/or drink sitting at tables (e.g. restaurants, cafes, delis, lunch-bars and hotels). Smoking is banned within 10 meters of any children’s playground equipment. Smoking is prohibited “between the flags” on a beach in patrolled swimming areas. It is also illegal to smoke in a car if a child (aged under 17) is inside. Liquor licensed premises that are not subject to a restaurant licence may set aside up to 50 per cent of outdoor eating areas as smoking zones. Smoking is permitted in the international room and pearl room at the [[Burswood Casino]]. The Health Minister has regulated to allow footpath drinking without food to accommodate smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgl.wa.gov.au/ResourceFiles/Policies/Guidelines_for_establishing_a_breakout_area.pdf |title=Guidelines for establishing 'breakout areas' (7 May 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geography'' (book 2, chapter 10), the '''Luna forest''' (Latin '''''Luna silva''''', Greek '''''Louna hule''''') is a geographical feature whose location is not known now with any certainty.

According to Ptolemy, the forest was located on the north bank of the [[Danube]], downstream from the [[Gabreta Forest]] but before the southward bend leading through today's [[Hungary]]. A river flowed through the forest from the north into the Danube.

The '''Messner Mountain Museum''' ('''MMM''') is a [[museum]] [[project]] created by Italian mountaineer and extreme climber [[Reinhold Messner]] in [[South Tyrol]] in northern Italy. Messner's museum project is designed to educate visitors on "man's encounter with mountains" and deals with the science of mountains and glaciers, the history of mountaineering and rock climbing, the history of mythical mountains, and the history of mountain-dwelling people.&lt;ref name="inhabit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmer |first=Lori |title=Medieval Italian Castle Transformed into Modern Mountain Museum |work=Inhabit |url=http://inhabitat.com/medieval-italian-castle-transformed-into-modern-mountain-museum/ |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum project consists of five museums based at six different locations: Firmian, Juval, Dolomites, Ortles, Ripa and Corones. MMM Firmian at [[Sigmundskron Castle]] near Bozen is the centerpiece of the museum and concentrates on man’s relationship with the mountains. The museum includes displays on the geology of the mountains, the religious significance of mountains in the lives of people, and the history of mountaineering and alpine tourism.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"&gt;{{cite web|title=MMM Firmian |work=Messner Mountain Museum |url=http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/firmian/museum/ |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMM Juval at [[Juval Castle]] in the [[Burggrafenamt]] in Vinschgau is dedicated to the "magic of the mountains", with an emphasis on mystical mountains and their religious significance.&lt;ref name="mmm-juval"&gt;{{cite web|title=MMM Juval |work=Messner Mountain Museum |url=http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/juval/museum/ |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMM Dolomites at the [[Cibiana Pass]] at Monte Rite, housed in an old fort, is dedicated to the subject of rocks, particularly in the Dolomites, with exhibits focusing on the history of the formation of the Dolomites.

[[File:FirmianHB40.jpg|thumb|Sigmundskron Castle]]
The centrepiece of the Messner Mountain Museum is based in [[Sigmundskron Castle]] ({{coord|46.480598|11.30484|region:IT-BZ_type:landmark|name=Messner Mountain Museum Firmian}}) near [[Bolzano]], Italy, and addresses the subject of man's encounter with the mountains.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt; The castle dates to the [[Late Middle Ages]] and houses the museum's headquarters, administration and event facilities. There is a rock theatre that seats 200 people. The museum was opened on 11 June 2006 after three years of restoration to the virtually ruined castle.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt;

The concept at ''MMM Firmian'', as this hub of the museum is known, is based on three strands: the castle, the restoration and the exhibitions. The appearance of the castle has not been destroyed by modern alterations. The architect, Werner Tscholl, paid attention to the fact that the historical building had to retain its originality; for example, the new glass roof structures and pipes or cables of any kind are not visible from the outside.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt;

The ''MMM Firmian'' itself covers an area of 1,100 square metres. The theme of the museum is the history and art of mountaineering. Messner wants to show "what effect the mountain has on people".&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt; as well as giving an understanding of mountains and mountain peoples.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt; He demonstrates this by means of pictures, sculptures, symbolic objects and memorabilia of various expeditions, which are portrayed as part of a tour through the castle. Messner also displays the history of [[alpinism]] and the impact of alpinism and tourism on nature and the environment. A separate exhibition on the history of the castle and the region is in a tower.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt;

=== Juval ===
[[File:Schloss Juval.jpg|thumb|right|Juval Castle]]
This part of the MMM is housed within [[Juval Castle]] ({{coord|46.651531|10.968019|region:IT-BZ_type:landmark|name=Messner Mountain Museum Juval}}) near [[Naturns]], a late-medieval castle, and was opened in 1995.&lt;ref name="mmm-juval"/&gt; This castle is privately owned by Messner and he uses it as his summer residence.

This MMM deals with the mountains as places of mystery and spirituality.&lt;ref name="mmm-juval"/&gt; Its main focus is the sacred mountains of the world such as [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]], [[Mount Fuji]] or [[Uluru|Ayers Rock]]. In addition, [[Tibet]]an exhibits such as precious [[Buddha]] sculptures and a giant [[prayer wheel]] are displayed. There is also an exhibition on [[Gesar|Gesar Ling]], an epic Tibetan king, a tantric room and an expedition room in the basement. Finally there is a collection of masks, displays on aspects of [[animism]] and mountain images in the [[keep]].&lt;ref name="mmm-juval"/&gt;

=== Dolomites ===
''MMM Dolomites'' is housed in a [[First World War]] fort at a height of 2,181 metres on [[Monte Rite]] ({{coord|46.38393|12.254713|region:IT-BL_type:landmark|name=Messner Mountain Museum Dolomites}}) between [[Cortina d’Ampezzo]] and [[Pieve di Cadore]]. This "museum in the clouds" was opened in 2002 and has the "vertical world" of the Dolomites as its theme.&lt;ref name="mmm-dolomites"/&gt; It covers the history of the opening up of the [[Dolomites]] as well as aspects of Alpine history and its protagonists.&lt;ref name="mmm-dolomites"/&gt;

=== Ortles ===
The fourth part of the MMM is laid out underground below the [[Ortler]] in [[Sulden]].&lt;ref name="mmm-ortles"/&gt; Since opening in 2004, subjects such as the eternal ice and the Ortler are covered in an exhibition space of 300 square metres, with exhibitions on skiing, ice climbing, the Arctic and the Antarctic.&lt;ref name="mmm-ortles"/&gt; Visitors are able to go inside the mountain and its glacier.&lt;ref name="mmm-ortles"/&gt;

Also in Sulden is the museum ''Alpine Curiosa'' ({{coord|46.529402|10.58548|region:IT-BZ_type:landmark|name=Messner Mountain Museum Ortles–Alpine Curiosa}}) in a twelve square metre little old cottage called ''Flohhäusl'', with portrayals of 13 legendary mountaineering stories (from [[Yoga|Yogi]] [[Milarepa]] to Messner himself), which offers a different interpretation of mountaineering and where alpine curiosities are displayed.&lt;ref name="mmm-ortles"/&gt;

=== Ripa ===
[[File:2013-05-06 Bruneck Schloss 01 anagoria.JPG|thumb|Bruneck Castle]]
The fifth part of the MMM is ''MMM Ripa'' at Bruneck Castle ({{coord|46.794299|11.939497|region:IT-BZ_type:landmark|name=Messner Mountain Museum Ripa}}) above the town of [[Bruneck]]. This is planned to open in Spring 2011 and is intended as an interactive museum, which will offer a forum for various mountain peoples to exchange experiences with the local farming community. Guests from other mountain regions will spend a summer here and talk about their lives. Examples that Messner has given include the [[Sherpas]], [[South American Indians]], [[Tibetans]], [[Mongols]] or [[Burusho people|Hunzas]].&lt;ref name="mmm-ripa"/&gt;

=== Corones ===
[[File:Messner Mountain Museum am Kronplatz.JPG|thumb|Messner Mountain Museum on the [[Kronplatz]]]]
The sixth and last museum of the MMM network, the MMM corones, was built on the top of the [[Kronplatz]] mountain (''Plan de Corones'' in [[Ladin language|Ladin]] and Italian) at an altitude of 2,275 meters above sea level. Opened in July, 2015, the museum, a modern structure designed by renowned British architect [[Zaha Hadid]], has a floor area of 1,000 square meters and features a permanent exhibition dedicated to [[traditional climbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Zaha Hadid's MMM Corones museum gazes at the mountains | url=https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/corones-museum-zaha-hadid-gazing-mountains | author= Federica Lusiardi |publisher=[[Inexhibit]]|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost and financing ==
The cost of the project is estimated at up to €30 million, split between Messner and the province of South Tyrol. The latter funded the restoration and expansion of the old buildings; in return, Messner has to maintain the exhibitions without subsidy for 30 years.&lt;ref name="mmm-firmian"/&gt; The restoration of the old fort on the Monte Rite was undertaken by the region of [[Veneto|Venetia]] together with the municipality of [[Pieve di Cadore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolomiti.it/ger/speciali/museonuvole/museo.htm Ein Treffpunkt in den Wolken (dolomiti.it)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040830221233/http://www.dolomiti.it/ger/speciali/museonuvole/museo.htm |date=2004-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For renovating and developing the ''MMM Bergvölker'' costs of between three and four million euros have been suggested, 80% of which will be borne by the province of South Tyrol in order to provide financial support to the municipality of Bruneck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provinz.bz.it/lpa/285.asp?redas=yes&amp;aktuelles_action=4&amp;aktuelles_article_id=201394 Pressemitteilung der Südtiroler Landesregierung dated 28 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Dutton Bay Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located on the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]] on islands located on waters in the sector between the north west to the east of the town of [[Coffin Bay, South Australia|Coffin Bay]].  The conservation park consists of a number of islands located in the following bays subsidiary to [[Coffin Bay (South Australia)|Coffin Bay]] - Port Douglas, [[Mount Dutton Bay]] and [[Kellidie Bay]].  Three of the islands are located in Port Douglas, being The Brothers and an unnamed group immediately west of [[Horse Peninsula]] and Rabbit Island immediately west of Coffin Bay township.  Another island is located at the north end of Mount Dutton Bay, while Goat Island immediately north of Coffin Bay township in the channel connecting Port Douglas to Kellidie Bay.  The constituent parts of the conservation park first received protection as Fauna Reserves under the ''Fauna Conservation Act 1964'' during the 1960s.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ia — Strict Nature Reserve|Category Ia protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name=  Mount Dutton Bay Conservation Park |feature= SA0037985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite web|title= Parks of the Coffin Bay Area Management Plan |url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/9144816b-fcb8-4300-9fe3-9e4f00b18093/PARKS_PDFS_COFFIN_BAY_MP.pdf |publisher= Department for Environment and Heritage |accessdate=21 October 2014|date= 2004|pages =3 &amp; 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">A '''''nhà thờ họ''''' (lit. ''lineage hall'' or ''clan ancestral house'') is a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Vietnamese folk religion|traditional]] [[place of worship]] of a clan or its branches which established by [[male]] descendants of paternal line. This type of worship place is most commonly seen in [[northern Vietnam]] as well as [[middle Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="bachkhoatoanthu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.bachkhoatoanthu.gov.vn/default.aspx?param=141BaWQ9MjUyMDQmZ3JvdXBpZD01JmtpbmQ9JmtleXdvcmQ9&amp;page=1|title=Nhà Thờ Họ|publisher=Bách khoa toàn thư Việt Nam|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919080923/http://dictionary.bachkhoatoanthu.gov.vn/default.aspx?param=141BaWQ9MjUyMDQmZ3JvdXBpZD01JmtpbmQ9JmtleXdvcmQ9&amp;page=1|archivedate=2010-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a clan is divided into branches by males of [[paternal line]], the head of the main branch of a clan (''trưởng tộc'' in Vietnamese) would lead the place where all clan members worship the primitive ancestor and store the primary genealogical book.&lt;ref name="bachkhoatoanthu"/&gt; This place would be called ''nhà thờ đại tôn'' (lit. ''primary lineage hall'' or ''main clan ancestral house''). Other breaches of a clan would have their own ''nhà thờ họ'' in which the creators of these branches are worshipped; these ''nhà thờ họ'' are called ''nhà thờ chi họ'' (lit. ''branch of clan ancestral house'').&lt;ref name="bachkhoatoanthu"/&gt;

The size and architecture of ''nhà thờ họ'' is depended on a clan financial capability, donations from each male clan members and the [[political]] status of clan elders. A ''nhà thờ họ'' is usually built follow the traditional 3 rooms house architecture in which the middle room is extended in the back so that a worship pedestal could be placed. The worship objects such as linh tọa (''chair of the [[ghosts]]''), giá gương (''glass stand''), and ngai (''throne'') will be placed in this worship pedestal. The ngai holds a vermilion-painted-and-gold-gilded box, which contains family genealogical book, and is covered by a piece of red cloth. This is the most sacred site of a ''Nhà thờ họ'', which people consider the gathering place of ancestors' soul.&lt;ref name="bachkhoatoanthu"/&gt;

An ancestral [[death anniversary]] will be held yearly at ''nhà thờ họ'' and this anniversary is usually used as an occasion to renew the relationship between clan members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vietimes.com.vn/vn/nganocuathegioi/3993/index.viet|title=Tục thờ cúng tổ tiên: Chén nước trong soi lòng trinh bạch (phần IV)|publisher=Vietnamnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nusantara''' is the Malayo-Polynesian name of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. It is a [[Javanese language|Javanese]] term which literally means "[[archipelago]]" from [[Old Javanese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friend |first=T. |title=Indonesian Destinies |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2003 |page=601|isbn=0-674-01137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indonesia]] it means the Indonesian archipelago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Echols  | first = John M.  | author-link =  | last2 = Shadily  | first2 = Hassan  | author2-link =   | title = Kamus Indonesia Inggris (An Indonesian-English Dictionary)  | place = Jakarta  | publisher = Gramedia  | year = 1989|edition=1st| isbn = 979-403-756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/entri/Nusantara|title=Hasil Pencarian - KBBI Daring|website=kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Malaysia]] the term has been similarly adopted to mean the [[Malay archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ms.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/malay-english/nusantara|title=Nusantara {{!}} Malay to English Translation - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Malay Living Dictionary|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word Nusantara was taken from an oath by [[Gajah Mada]] in 1336, as written in the Old Javanese ''[[Pararaton]]'' and ''[[Nagarakretagama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Mpu|first1=Prapañca|last2=Robson|first2=Stuart O.|title=Deśawarṇana: (Nāgarakṛtāgama)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZduAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=KITLV|isbn=978-90-6718-094-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gajah Mada was a powerful military leader and [[prime minister]] of [[Majapahit]] who was credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory. Gajah Mada delivered an oath called ''[[Sumpah Palapa]]'', in which he vowed not to eat any food containing [[spice]]s until he had conquered all of Nusantara under the glory of Majapahit.

Today, Indonesian historians believed that the concept of Nusantara was not an idea coined by Gajah Mada for the first time in 1336. It was coined earlier in 1275 as ''Cakravala [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] Dvipantara'' by [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Wahyono Suroto Kusumoprojo|title=Indonesia negara maritim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoJKR85srh8C&amp;pg=PA186|year=2009|publisher=PT Mizan Publika|isbn=978-979-3603-94-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dvipantara is a Sanskrit word for the "islands inbetween", the synonym to Nusantara as both ''dvipa'' and ''nusa'' mean "island". The term is used to describe the Southeast Asian Archipelago. Kertanegara envisioned the union of Southeast Asian maritime kingdoms and polities under Singhasari as a bulwark against the rise of the expansionist Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] in mainland China.

==Ancient concepts of Nusantara==
[[File:Majapahit Core and Provinces.svg|thumb|right|300px|Majapahit ''Negara Agung'' (grand state) and ''Mancanagara'' (provinces) in eastern and central parts of Java, including islands of Madura and Bali.]]
[[File:Majapahit Empire.svg|thumb|300px|The extent of Majapahit ''Nusantara'' according to Nagarakretagama.]]
===Etymology===
Nusantara is a Javanese word which appears in the ''[[Pararaton]]'' manuscript. In Javanese, Nusantara means "outer islands", {{etymology||nūsa|island}} and ''antara'', "within".  Based on the [[Majapahit]] concept of state, the monarch had the power over three areas:

# '''''Negara Agung''''', or the Grand State, the core kingdom. The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.
# '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' — traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].
# '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

==The first appearance of Nusantara concept in the 20th century==
[[File:Indonesian archipelagic baselines.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern ''Wawasan Nusantara'' the Indonesian archipelagic baselines pursuant to article 47, paragraph 9, of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]]]]
In 1920, [[Ernest Douwes Dekker|Ernest Francois Eugene Douwes Dekker]] (1879–1950), who was also known as Setiabudi, introduced a new name for this proposed independent country (successor state of colonial [[Dutch East Indies]]) — which unlike its currently used name of "Indonesia" — did not contain any words etymologically inherited from the [[Names of India|name of India]] or the [[Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Vlekke  | first = Bernard H.M.  | author-link =  | title = Nusantara: A History of the East Indian Archipelago | place = Netherlands  | publisher = Ayer Co Pub  | year = 1943|edition=1st
|pages=303–470|isbn = 978-0-405-09776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new proposed name was the locally developed name ''Nusantara''. This is the first instance of the term ''Nusantara'' appearing after it had been written into [[Pararaton]] manuscript.

The definition of Nusantara introduced by Setiabudi is different to the 14th century definition of the term. During the [[Majapahit]] era, Nusantara described vassal areas to be conquered. Setiabudi didn't want this aggressive connotation, so he defined Nusantara as all the Indonesian regions from [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]]  as far as [[Merauke]].

==Modern usage==
Today in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], Nusantara is synonymous with [[Indonesian archipelago]] or the national territory of Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://id.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/indonesian-english/nusantara|title=nusantara {{!}} Indonesian to English Translation - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Indonesian Living Dictionary|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this sense the term Nusantara excludes Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. In 1967, it has transformed into the concept of ''[[Wawasan Nusantara]]'' or "archipelagic outlook", which regarded the archipelagic realm of Indonesia, the islands and seas surrounding them, as a single unity of several aspects, including political unity, socio-cultural, economic, security and defense unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=ZczWDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=Nusantara+means+indonesian+archipelago&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g7RroWiv-B&amp;sig=fP0XlqlhpRNPmdQceY11TBjviag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKp4nIgaPYAhWIsJQKHcTJBms4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nusantara%20means%20indonesian%20archipelago&amp;f=false|title=Sovereignty and the Sea: How Indonesia Became an Archipelagic State|last=Butcher|first=John G.|last2=Elson|first2=R. E.|date=2017-03-24|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=9789814722216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While in [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] the term is synonymous and often interchangeable with [[Malay archipelago]] or [[Malay realm]] ({{lang-ms|Alam Melayu}}) which includes those countries.

In the 21st century, Nusantara can be referred to as the correct term to represent the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] region which consists of all [[Austronesia]]n nations.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy''' (Old Polish Industrial Region) is an [[industrial region]] in northern part of [[Lesser Poland]]. It is the oldest and in terms of area covered, largest of [[Poland|Polish]] industrial regions. Most of the region is located in [[Lesser Poland Upland]], and its historic center lies along the Kamienna river. Primary industrial cities: [[Kielce]], [[Radom]], [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]], [[Starachowice]] and [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]].

== History ==
In prehistoric times future Old Polish Industrial Region was the area of [[flint]] and later [[iron]] tools. In [[Nowa Slupia]], remnants of forty five [[bloomery|bloomeries]] were found (5th - 10th century). In the [[Middle Ages]], the region became the center of Polish industry - mining and [[steel mill]]s. Various kinds of weapons were manufactured here, iron ore, copper and silver were extracted. In the 17th century, first [[blast furnace]]s were opened in the villages of [[Samsonow]] and [[Bobrza]]. By 1782, out of 34 blast furnaces in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], as many as 27 were located in Old Polish Industrial Region. Furthermore, the area was a major glass producer of the country. 

First half of the 19th century was the time of rapid development of the region, due to efforts of the government of [[Congress Poland]], and such persons as [[Stanislaw Staszic]] and [[Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki]]. Both officials planned construction of a large metallurgical plant along the Kamienna. Those plans, however, were only partially implemented, due to lack of funds. Still, several new plants were opened at that time.

Growth of Old Polish Industrial Region stopped in the second half of the 19th century, due to two reasons. First, Congress Poland lost its autonomy and became [[Vistula Land]], integral part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Furthermore, another industrial center of Lesser Poland, [[Zaglebie Dabrowskie]], began to develop and compete with Old Polish Industrial Region. As a result, several plants had to close down. 

The region recovered in late years of the [[Second Polish Republic]], when [[Central Industrial Area]] was envisaged by [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]]. Already-existing factories in Kielce, Skarzysko, Radom, Starachowice and Ostrowiec were modernized, new ones were also built. After [[World War II]], industrialization of the area continued, with such plants, as [[FSC Star]].

== Main locations ==
Major urban centers of the region are Kielce, Radom, Starachowice, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and Skarżysko-Kamienna, which is an important railroad junction. Names of several villages indicate their industrial past, even though no traces of former plants remain there (Ruda, Kuźnica, Hucisko, Żelaznica, Górniki, Rudniki, Wąglów, Wólka Smolna, Kurzacze).

The '''Open Geospatial Consortium''' ('''OGC'''), an international voluntary consensus [[standards organization]], originated in 1994. In the OGC, more than 500 commercial, governmental, nonprofit and research organizations worldwide collaborate in a consensus process encouraging development and implementation of open standards for [[geospatial]] content and services, sensor web and [[Internet of Things]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] [[data processing]] and data sharing.

==History==
A predecessor organization, OGF, the Open [[GRASS GIS|GRASS]] Foundation, started in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gisws.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/grass04/viewpaper.php?id=53 ''GRASS Roots''], Westervelt, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 2004 the organization also used the name '''Open GIS Consortium'''.

The OGC website gives a detailed history of the OGC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/historylong&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards ==
Most of the OGC standards depend on a generalized architecture captured in a set of documents collectively called the ''Abstract Specification'', which describes a basic data model for representing [[geographic]] features. Atop the Abstract Specification members have developed and continue to develop a growing number of specifications, or [[standardization|''standards'']] to serve specific needs for [[interoperability|interoperable]] location and geospatial technology, including GIS.

More information here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards

[[File:GeoServer GeoNetwork with web app.svg|thumb|347px|Relationship between clients/servers and OGC protocols]]

The OGC standards baseline comprises more than 30 standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/|title=OGC Standards and Related Documents}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

*[[Catalog Service for the Web|CSW]] – Catalog Service for the Web: access to catalog information
*[[Geography Markup Language|GML]] – Geography Markup Language: [[XML]]-format for geographical information
*[[GeoXACML]] – Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup Language
*[[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]] – [[Keyhole, Inc|Keyhole]] Markup Language: [[XML]]-based language schema for expressing geographic annotation and visualization on existing (or future) Web-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers
*[[Observations and Measurements]]
*[[OGC Reference Model]] – a complete set of [[Reference Model|reference models]]
*[[Location Service (OpenLS)|OLS]] – Open Location Service (OpenLS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ols|title=OGC Standard – Location Service|year=2017|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[OWS Context|OGC Web Services Context Document]] defines the application state of an OGC Integrated Client 
*[[Web Service Common|OWS]] – OGC Web Service Common
*[[Sensor Observation Service|SOS]] – Sensor Observation Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos|title=OGC Standard – Sensor Observation Service|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*SPS – Sensor Planning Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sps|title=OGC Standard – Sensor Planning Service|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[SensorML]] – Sensor Model Language

Currently a candidate standard waiting for votes.
*[[Simple Features|SFS]] – Simple Features – SQL
*[[Styled Layer Descriptor|SLD]] - Styled Layer Descriptor
*[[SRID]], an identification for spatial coordinate systems 
*[[WaterML]] – Information model for the representation of hydrological observation data
*[[Web Coverage Service|WCS]] – Web Coverage Service: provides access, subsetting, and processing on [[Coverage data|coverage objects]]
*[[Web Coverage Processing Service|WCPS]] – Web Coverage Processing Service: provides a raster query language for ad-hoc processing and filtering on raster [[Coverage data|coverages]]
*[[Web Feature Service|WFS]] – Web Feature Service: for retrieving or altering feature descriptions
*[[Web Map Service|WMS]] – Web Map Service: provides map images
*[[Web Map Tile Service|WMTS]] – Web Map Tile Service: provides map image tiles
*[[Web Processing Service|WPS]] – Web Processing Service: remote processing service
*[[GeoSPARQL]] – Geographic SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql|title=GeoSPARQL – A Geographic Query Language for RDF Data|accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; representation and querying of geospatial data for the [[Semantic Web]]
*[[Web Terrain Service|WTS]] – Web Terrain Service (WTS)

The design of standards were originally built on the [[HTTP]] web services [[paradigm]] for message-based interactions in web-based systems, but meanwhile has been extended with a common approach for [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]] protocol and [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] bindings. Considerable progress has been made in defining [[Representational State Transfer]] (REST) web services, e.g., OGC [[SensorThings API]].

==Organization structure==
The OGC has three operational units:

# the Specification program
# the Interoperability Program
# Outreach and Community Adoption

==Collaboration==
The OGC has a close relationship with [[ISO/TC 211]] (Geographic Information/Geomatics). Volumes from the ISO 19100 series under development by this committee progressively replace the OGC abstract specification. Further, the OGC standards Web Map Service, GML, Web Feature Service, [[Observations and Measurements]], and Simple Features Access have become ISO standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1374|title=OGC Web Feature Service Standard accepted as ISO Standard|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OGC works with more than 20 international standards-bodies including [[W3C]], [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], [[Workflow Management Coalition|WfMC]], and the [[IETF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6207&amp;ei=haJwVY7ZOcfusAXb4oK4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKzXyIOXuYNii4cRrwGU6wfD4BgQ&amp;sig2=41F6mU19BEdW_td2wCIrIQ&amp;bvm=bv.94911696,d.b2w|title=OGC’s Role in the Spatial Standards World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pentaprism.svg|thumb|right|300px|A pentaprism.]]
[[File:Roof-pentaprism.svg|right|thumb|300px|A perspective drawing showing a roof pentaprism commonly used in a [[single lens reflex camera]] (SLR). The image is flipped laterally by the prism.]]
A '''pentaprism''' is a five-sided reflecting [[prism (optics)|prism]] used to deviate a beam of [[light]] by a constant 90°, even if the entry beam is not at 90° to the prism.
The beam reflects inside the prism ''twice'',&lt;ref name=darkside/&gt; allowing the transmission of an image through a right angle without inverting it (that is, without changing the image's [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|handedness]]) as an ordinary right-angle prism or mirror would.

The reflections inside the prism are not caused by [[total internal reflection]], since the beams are incident at an angle less than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] (the minimum angle for total internal reflection). Instead, the two faces are coated to provide [[mirror]] surfaces. The two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an [[anti-reflective coating|antireflection coating]] to reduce spurious reflections. The fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces.

This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a "[[roof prism|roof]]" section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90°, which laterally reverses the image back to normal.

[[File:7 - Itahuania - Août 2008.JPG|thumb|300px|Amazon rainforest in Peru]]

'''Peruvian Amazonia''' ({{lang-es|Amazonía del Perú}}) is the area of the [[Amazon rainforest]] included within the country of [[Peru]], from east of the [[Andes]] to the borders with [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. This region comprises 60% of the country and is marked by a large degree of  biodiversity. Peru has the second-largest portion of the Amazon rainforest after the [[Amazônia Legal|Brazilian Amazon]].

== Extension ==
Most Peruvian territory is covered by dense forests on the east side of the Andes, yet only 5% of Peruvians live in this area. More than 60% of Peruvian territory is covered by the [[Amazon rainforest]], more than in any other country.

According to the Research Institute of the Peruvian Amazon (''Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana'', IIAP), the spatial delineation of the Peruvian Amazon is as follows:
:[[Hydrography|Hydrographic]] criteria or basin criteria: {{convert|96,922.47|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} (75.31% of Peruvian territory and approximately 16.13% of the whole Amazon basin).

== Ecoregions and climate ==
The Peruvian Amazon is traditionally divided into two distinct ecoregions:

The lowland jungle (in Spanish ''Selva Baja'') is also known as ''[[Omagua]] region'', ''Walla'', ''Anti'', Amazonian rainforest or Amazon basin. This ecoregion is the largest of Peru, standing between 80 and 1,000 [[meters above sea level]]. It has very warm weather with an average temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C, high relative humidity (over 75%) and yearly rainfall of approximately {{convert|260|cm|abbr=on}}. Its soils are very heterogeneous, but almost all have river origins. Because of high temperatures and high rainfall, they are poor soils with few nutrients.

The jungle contains long and powerful rivers such as the [[Apurímac River|Apurimac]], [[Mantaro River|Mantaro]], [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]], [[Ucayali River|Ucayali]], [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]], [[Marañón River|Marañón]], [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]], [[Javary River|Yavarí]], [[Napo River|Napo]], [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]], [[Manú River|Manu]], [[Purus River|Purus]], and [[Tigre River|Tigre]]. The [[Apurimac River]] is the source of the Amazon River.  The [[Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve]], the [[Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve]] and the [[Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area]] are within the forest.

The highland jungle (in Spanish ''Selva Alta'') is also called ''[[Rupa Rupa]] region'', ''Andean jungle'', ''ceja de selva''. This ecoregion extends into the eastern foothills of the [[Andes]], between 1,000 and 3,800&amp;nbsp;m above the sea level. The eastern slopes of the Andes are home to a great variety of fauna and flora because of the different altitudes and climates within the region. Temperatures are warm in the lowlands and cooler in higher altitudes. There are many [[endemism|endemic]] fauna because of the isolation caused by the rugged terrain of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier:'' Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú.'' Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): ''Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, Boletín del Museo de historia natural'', „Javier Prado", n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
The Peruvian Amazon jungle is one of the most [[biodiversity|biologically diverse]] areas on [[Earth]]. As a nation, Peru has the largest number of [[birds|bird]] species in the world and the third-largest number of [[mammals]]; 44% of bird species and 63% of mammal species inhabit the Peruvian Amazon. Peru also has a very high number of species of [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[orchid]]s, and other organisms.

== Demography ==
Although it is the largest region of Peru, the Peruvian Amazon is the least populated. It is home to approximately 5% of the country's population.  Many [[indigenous people]]s, such as the [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]], [[Cocama-Cocamilla]] and the [[Urarina]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''[http://upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia]'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabit the jungle, some in relative isolation from the rest of the world.

The primary cities located in the Peruvian Amazon include:

* Lowland jungle
** [[Iquitos]] with 500,000 inhabitants at 104&amp;nbsp;m ([[Loreto Region|Loreto]] region)
** [[Pucallpa]], with 380,000 inhabitants at 154&amp;nbsp;m ([[Ucayali Region|Ucayali]] region)
** [[Yurimaguas]] with 140,000 inhabitants at 182&amp;nbsp;m ([[Loreto Region|Loreto]] region)
** [[Puerto Maldonado]] with 104,000  inhabitants at 139&amp;nbsp;m ([[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]] region)
** [[Tarapoto]] with 181,000 inhabitants at 350&amp;nbsp;m ([[San Martin Region|San Martín]] region)
** [[Jaén, Peru|Jaén]] with 86,743 inhabitants at 729&amp;nbsp;m ([[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] region)
** [[Moyobamba]] with 77,000 inhabitants at 860&amp;nbsp;m ([[San Martin Region|San Martín]] region)
** [[Bagua, Peru|Bagua]] with 65,000 inh. at 400&amp;nbsp;m ([[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]] region)
** [[Rioja, Peru|Rioja]] with 60,000 inh. at 848&amp;nbsp;m (at [[San Martin Region|San Martín]] region)

==Illegal logging==
Over the last decades [[illegal logging]] has become a serious problem in the Peruvian Amazon. In 2012 the [[World Bank]] estimated that 80% of Peru’s timber exports are illegally harvested.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2012) Justice for Forests. ''Improving Criminal Justice Efforts to Combat Illegal Logging''. Washington, DC: Pereira Goncalves, P., Panjer, M., 	Greenberg, T. S. &amp; Magrath, W.B.&lt;/ref&gt; This uncontrolled [[deforestation]] could negatively affect the habitats of indigenous tribes, the Peruvian [[biodiversity]] and of course the [[climate change]]. Moreover, illegal deforestation might lead to more violent [[crime]]s. This has already been demonstrated on 1 September 2014, when four indigenous leaders were murdered, including the famous environmental activist Edwin Chota. These leaders were asking for governmental protection against illegal loggers, after being threatened several times. Partly due to this, illegal loggers are being blamed for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, D. (2014). ''Illegal loggers blamed for murder of Peru forest campaigner''. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/09/illegal-loggers-blamed-for-of-peru-forest-campaigner]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of an illegal industry===
In an attempt to support local incomes in the Amazon, the Peruvian government granted non-transferable contracts to individual farmers to perform small-scale logging activities. Soon however, big [[logging companies]] started paying individual loggers for the use of their contracts and established an illegal, large-scale [[logging industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) was founded to guarantee a more sustainable use of national resources.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this institution has never been able to carry out its task due to several reasons. First of all, INRENA lacked sufficient resources compared with the magnitude of their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J., Colan, V., Sabogal, C., &amp; Snook, L. (2006). Why policy reforms fail to improve logging practices: The role of governance and norms in Peru. ''Forest Policy and Economics'', 8(4), 466.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to this, corruption was a problem in several layers of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, until recently, INRENA was part of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J., Colan, V., Sabogal, C., &amp; Snook, L. (2006). Why policy reforms fail to improve logging practices: The role of governance and norms in Peru. ''Forest Policy and Economics'', 8(4), 463.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that INRENA was not completely independent; it was housed in an institution that had to safeguard the interest of the agricultural sector, which could be conflicting with INRENA’s objective.

In 2000 Peru modified the Forestry and Wildlife Law in order to improve the logging sector.&lt;ref&gt;Naughton-Treves, L. Deforestation and carbon emissions at tropical frontiers: a case study from the Peruvian Amazon. ''World Development'' 32.1 (2004): 185&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years however, the situation in the Peruvian timber industry only deteriorated. To some extent this can be explained by the fact that [[Brazil]] illegalised the exports of [[mahogany]] (one of the most valuable and endangered types of wood in the world) from 2001 on.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This Brazilian ban is likely to have caused the increase in Peruvian mahogany exports. Soon after the ban, international institutions revealed their severe concerns about the state of the Peruvian timber industry. In particular the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), started paying extra attention to Peru as the trade in mahogany falls under CITES’ regulation. Albeit the fact that from then on, one needed special permits for harvesting and exporting any endangered species, the forestry sector was still far from sustainable.

===Illegal logging with permits===
Although it is understandable that illegal logging cannot be stopped easily in the Peruvian Amazons (an inaccessible area bigger than Spain), the illegal exportation of timber is supposed to be more difficult; the shipments are huge and there are very few routes from the Amazons to the coast. Nevertheless, until now it has been relatively easy for companies to ship and export illegal timber. Despite the fact that the Peruvian government claims that it does not know anything about the method used by these companies, it is common-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Matalon, L. (2014). Building a Template for Sustainable Forestry. Revista: ''Harvard Review of Latin America'', Peru 20-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Investigation Agency]] (EIA) provided a clear picture of this mechanism in their report The Laundering Machine. According to them, the biggest flaw in the Peruvian system for years has been the granting of logging permits: ‘Concessionaires submit for approval lists that do not exist in the real world, and complicit authorities approve the extraction of this non-existent wood’.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; These permits allow companies to transport almost all sorts of wood (both legal and illegal) out of the country. There are only two ways to stop illegal loggers: catching them in the act, or, in case of controlling a shipment, environmental prosecutors have to prove that the timber does not come from the place written on the permit (which is only possible by going to this place). With not more than a hundred environmental prosecutors in Peru, it is not surprising that both methods are far from effective.

===The American-Peruvian Free Trade Agreement===
The international attention levels increased again in 2007, when Peru and the [[United States]] (US) agreed on a new Free [[Trade agreement]] (FTA), which was implemented in 2009. According to the [[United States Trade Representative]] (USTR) the FTA included a number of binding commitments to ensure environmental protection, focussing on the Peruvian forestry sector.&lt;ref&gt;United States Trade Representative (2013). ''UNITED STATES – PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT: STRENGTHENING FOREST SECTOR GOVERNANCE IN PERU''. ''[http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/peru-tpa]''&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties agreed, amongst others, on the following measures: establishing an independent forestry oversight body, penalising those who committed logging crimes, creating new (and a better implementation of existing) laws, developing an anti-corruption plan and the US would provide monetary help.&lt;ref&gt;United States Trade Representative (2013). ''UNITED STATES – PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT: STRENGTHENING FOREST SECTOR GOVERNANCE IN PERU''. ''[http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/peru-tpa]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the results are ambiguous. On the one hand proponents claim that the forestry sector experienced significant improvements. Some (small) improvements are indeed visible. With the formation of the [[Supervisory Body of Forest and Wildlife Resources]] (OSINFOR),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osinfor.gob.pe/osinfor/&lt;/ref&gt; the first promise was met. Next to this, US officials started training Peruvian law enforcement officers, although only on a minor scale.

On the other hand, the FTA caused a lot of social unrest as indigenous groups expected the FTA to ‘give incentives for further and irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest’.&lt;ref&gt;Asociacíon Interétnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruanana (2007). ''Peru’s mahogany exports threaten survival of indigenous tribes and violate international environmental laws''.''[http://www.illegal-logging.info/sites/default/files/uploads/Mahogany_Briefingnote.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt; Local communities were not the only ones who criticised the agreement. In 2010 [[Public Citizen]] published an article, which stated that, despite all promises, ‘environmental and labour conditions in Peru have deteriorated rapidly since the congressional passage of the FTA’.&lt;ref&gt;Public Citizen (2010). A Year after Implementation of Peru Free Trade Agreement, U.S. and Peru Left with Broken Promises and No New Trade Model. Washington, DC: McArthur, T. &amp; Tucker T.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding who was right, the FTA has not prevented illegal timber trade between Peru and the US. At least 35% of the Peruvian timber exports to the US between 2008 and 2010, contained illegal wood.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). ''La Máquina Lavadora'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This percentage however, only covers the trade in species that are regulated by the CITES. As only very few types of timber fall under this legislation, the real percentage of illegally harvested timber in Peru is assumed to be significantly higher.

==Illegal gold mining==
Illegal [[gold mining]] is rampant among the [[Madre de Dios Region]] of Peru, and is extremely harmful to the environment. Individuals are mining more [[gold]] each year because of the exponential price hike in this commodity – a 360% surge in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;"Overview." Amazon Conservation Association, About,. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This price surge is driving many people who often are not able to attain jobs into the gold mining business because of the great financial gain. With the Interoceanic Highway available, "30,000 miners are estimated to be in operation without legal permits."&lt;ref&gt;"Overview." Amazon Conservation Association, About,. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

More [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is being imported into the country than ever before for mining purposes because of the price increase.&lt;ref&gt;Swenson, Jennifer J. et al. “Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: Global Prices, Deforestation, and Mercury Imports.” Ed. Guy J-P. Schumann. PLoS ONE 6.4 (2011): e18875. PMC. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In mining, mercury is used to “amalgamate gold particles and then burned off – generally without even rudimentary technology”.&lt;ref&gt;"Overview." Amazon Conservation Association, About,. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The import of mercury for this purpose is shown through atmosphere and [[water pollution]], directly impacting human, animal, and plant lives in the area and beyond&lt;ref&gt;Swenson, Jennifer J. et al. "Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: Global Prices, Deforestation, and Mercury Imports." Ed. Guy J-P. Schumann. PLoS ONE 6.4 (2011): e18875. PMC. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this contamination is a result of lack of education by the people directly mining the gold in Peru. The harmful impacts of gold mining in Madre De Dios can be seen from space.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Illegal oil extraction==
[[Oil extraction]] is a critical threat to the health of Peruvian Amazonia. While the land is potentially oil-rich, there are also many indigenous peoples living within the Amazon rainforest. The [[Camisea Gas Project]] on Lot 88 impacts the daily lives of indigenous residents.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil and Gas Extraction in the Amazon: Camisea." WWF -. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Project Camisea has numerous economic benefits, including savings of up to $4 billion in energy costs, however the environmental and cultural payoffs are widespread.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil and Gas Extraction in the Amazon: Camisea." WWF -. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 150,000 square kilometers was set aside for oil drilling in the Western Amazon, and today that number has grown exponentially to over 730,000 square kilometers &lt;ref&gt;"The Amazon's Oil Boom: Concessions Cover a Chile-sized Bloc of Rainforest." Mongabay. N.p., 3 Feb. 2015. Web. 16 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct destruction and deforestation often comes from the creation of access roads for oil and gas extraction. These roads then become catalysts for other illegal industries such as logging and gold mining &lt;ref&gt;"The Amazon's Oil Boom: Concessions Cover a Chile-sized Bloc of Rainforest." Mongabay. N.p., 3 Feb. 2015. Web. 16 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of land where Camisea is located is on one of the most highly prioritized areas for biodiversity and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil and Gas Extraction in the Amazon: Camisea." WWF -. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, these oil extraction projects impact the country through: fish stock decline, deforestation, pollution, disease and death of indigenous people, and roads and migration.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil and Gas Extraction in the Amazon: Camisea." WWF -. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Wildlife Federation concluded that the government has very little power over these oil sanctions, and there are countless loopholes in the policy, which makes stopping them in Peru extraction extremely difficult. Additionally, only seven percent of the oil blocs in the Western Amazon have been extracted, so there is potential for further illegal exploration in undiscovered areas.&lt;ref&gt;"The Amazon's Oil Boom: Concessions Cover a Chile-sized Bloc of Rainforest." Mongabay. N.p., 3 Feb. 2015. Web. 16 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a plant shows symptoms of a physiological disorder it is likely that, that season’s growth or yield will be reduced.

==Diagnosis of disorders==
Diagnosis of the cause of a physiological disorder (or disease) can be difficult, but there are many web-based guides that may assist with this.  Examples are: ''Abiotic plant disorders: Symptoms, signs and solutions'';&lt;ref name=Schutzki2007 /&gt; ''Georgia Corn Diagnostic Guide'';&lt;ref name=Lee2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=R.D.|title=Georgia Corn Diagnostic Guide|url=http://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.cfm?number=B1221|website=extension.uga.edu|publisher=University of Georgia Cooperative Extension|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diagnosing Plant Problems'' (Kentucky);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=J.L.|last2=Maloy|first2=O.|last3=Capizzi|first3=J.|last4=Hartman|first4=J.|last5=Townsend|first5=L.|title=Diagnosing Plant Problems: Kentucky Master Gardener Manual Chapter 7|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/id/id194/id194.pdf|website=www2.ca.uky.edu|publisher=Kentucky Cooperative Extension|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Diagnosing Plant Problems'' (Virginia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niemiera|first1=A.X.|title=Diagnosing Plant Problems|url=http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/426/426-714/426-714.html|website=pubs.ext.vt.edu|publisher=Virginia Cooperative Extension|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some general tips to diagnosing plant disorders:
*Examine where symptoms first appear on a plant—on new [[leaves]], old leaves or all over?
*Note the pattern of any discolouration or yellowing—is it all over, between the [[vein]]s or around the edges? If only the veins are yellow deficiency is probably not involved.
*Note general patterns rather than looking at individual plants—are the symptoms distributed throughout a group of plants of the same type growing together. In the case of a deficiency all of the plants should be similarly effected, although distribution will depend on past treatments applied to the soil.
*Soil analysis, such as determining [[Soil pH|pH]], can help to confirm the presence of physiological disorders. 
*Consider recent conditions, such as heavy rains, dry spells, frosts, etc., may also help to determine the cause of plant disorders.

==Weather damage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:20120607 škola 3802u.JPG|thumbnail|Drought.]]
[[Frost]] and cold are major causes of [[crop]] damage to tender plants, although hardy plants can also suffer if new growth is exposed to a hard frost following a period of warm weather. Symptoms will often appear overnight, affecting many types of plants. Leaves and stems may turn black, and buds and flowers may be discoloured, and frosted blooms may not produce [[fruit]]. Many [[Annual plant|annual]] plants, or plants grown in frost free areas, can suffer from damage when the air temperature drops below 40 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (4 degrees [[Celsius]]). Tropical plants may begin to experience cold damage when the temperature is 42 to 48&amp;nbsp;°F (5 to 9&amp;nbsp;°C), symptoms include [[wilting]] of the top of the stems and/or leaves, and blackening or softening of the plant tissue.

Frost or cold damage can be avoided by ensuring that tender plants are properly [[Cold hardening|hardened]] before planting, and that they are not planted too early in the season, before the risk of frost has passed. Avoid planting susceptible plants in frost pockets, or where they will receive early morning sun. Protect young buds and bloom with [[horticultural fleece]] if frost is forecast.
Cold, drying easterly winds can also severely inhibit spring growth even without an actual frost, thus adequate shelter or the use of windbreaks is important.

Drought can cause plants to suffer from water stress and wilt. Adequate [[irrigation]] is required  during prolonged hot, dry periods. Rather than shallow daily watering, during a drought water should be directed towards the roots, ensuring that the soil is thoroughly soaked two or three times a week. [[Mulch]]es also help preserve soil moisture and keep roots cool.

Heavy rains, particularly after prolonged dry periods, can also cause roots to split, [[onion]] saddleback (splitting at the base), [[tomato]]es split and [[potato]]es to become deformed or hollow. Using mulches or adding organic matter such as [[leaf mold]], [[compost]] or well rotted [[manure]] to the [[soil]] will help to act as a 'buffer' between sudden changes in
conditions. Water-logging can occur on poorly drained soils, particularly following heavy rains. Plants can become yellow and stunted, and will tend to be more prone to drought and diseases. Improving drainage will help to alleviate this problem.

Hail can cause damage to soft skinned fruits, and may also allow [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]] or other [[fungi]] to penetrate the plant. Brown spot markings or lines on one side of a mature [[apple (fruit)|apple]] are indicative of a spring hailstorm.

Plants affected by [[salt]] stress are able to take water from soil, due to an [[osmotic]] imbalance between soil and plant.

==Nutrient deficiencies==
[[File:20120817 9999 103u.JPG|thumbnail|Iron deficiency.]]
Poor growth and a variety of disorders such as leaf discolouration ([[chlorosis]]) can be caused by a shortage of one or more plant nutrients. Poor plant uptake of a nutrient from the soil (or other growing medium) may be due to an absolute shortage of that element in the growing medium, or because that element is present in a form that is not available to the plant.&lt;ref name=Mengel2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mengel|first1=K.|last2=Kirkby|first2=E.A.|title=Principles of plant nutrition|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=079237150X|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter can be caused by incorrect [[Soil pH|pH]], shortage of water, poor root growth or an excess of another nutrient.&lt;ref name=Mengel2001 /&gt; Plant nutrient deficiencies can be avoided or corrected using a variety of approaches including the consultation of experts on-site, the use of [[Soil test|soil]] and [[Plant tissue test|plant-tissue]] testing services, the application of prescription-blend [[fertilizer]]s, the application of fresh or well-decomposed [[Organic fertilizer|organic matter]], and the use of biological systems such as [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[Crop rotation|improved fallows]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Improved fallows |url=http://teca.fao.org/read/7769 |website=teca.fao.org|publisher=FAO|accessdate=10 April 2015|quote=Improved fallow is also land resting from cultivation but the vegetation comprises planted and managed species of leguminous trees, shrubs and herbaceous cover crops. These cover crops rapidly replenish soil fertility in one or at most two growing seasons. They shorten the time required to restore soil fertility; they help to improve farmland productivity because the plant vegetation that follows them is superior in quality; and they increase the range of outputs, because the woody fallow species can also produce fuel wood and stakes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ley farming|ley]] cropping, [[permaculture]], or [[crop rotation]].

'''''Pirates and Pathfinders''''' is a Canadian [[elementary school]] [[textbook]], originally published in 1947 (revised in 1963) by [[Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company|Clarke, Irwin, &amp; Company]].  [[Marjorie Hamilton]] wrote the text; [[Lloyd Scott (illustrator)|Lloyd Scott]] illustrated it.  A revised [[French language]] edition was printed by Clarke, Irwin in 1955; the French title was '''''La découverte du monde''''' ("The Discovery of the World"); the text was translated by [[Louis Charbonneau]].

==Content==
The book was a [[history]] textbook, intended for "the intermediate grades of the elementary schools".  The book focused on the history of [[European discovery]] and [[European colonization|colonization]] of the rest of the world, with a particular focus on the achievements of the [[British Empire]].  The book was divided into seven chapters:
*"The Road to [[Cathay]]", chiefly about [[Marco Polo]];
*"To the [[New World]]", chiefly about [[Christopher Columbus]]
*"Around the World", chiefly about [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], and Sir [[Francis Drake]];
*"Discoveries in the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]", chiefly about Captain [[James Cook]];
*"Light on the [[Africa|Dark Continent]]", chiefly about [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]];
*"The Search for the [[North-West Passage]]", chiefly about Sir [[John Franklin]]; and
*"To the Ends of the Earth," which focused on [[Arctic exploration|Arctic]] and [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] exploration, and the mountain climbing exploits of Sir [[Edmund Hillary]].
The book was also well furnished with [[map]]s, including a series in which areas of the world were progressively revealed from being obscured with brown ink, showing the different areas of the world that Europeans had explored.  The areas that Europeans had explored were called the "[[ecumene|known world]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie W. Hamilton, ''Pirates and Pathfinders'' (Clarke, Irwin &amp; Co., 1954, rev. 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The book was quite popular in [[education in Canada|elementary education in Canada]].  Over 50,000 copies of the text were purchased for [[Ontario]] schools in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Education Association]], ''Canadian Education'' (Canadian Education Association, 1960), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in print until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mcmaster.ca/archives/findaids/findaids/c/clarkir.01.htm The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heroic narratives presented by it, coupled with its copious and dramatic illustrations, have made the book a vivid memory for some Canadians who attended [[English language|English speaking]] elementary schools during the period in which it was in use.&lt;ref&gt;Randall White, [http://www.counterweights.ca/2007/07/new_global_village/ "NATIONAL HOLIDAY NOSTALGIA .. should Canadian history just be forgotten in new global village?"], in ''[[Counterweights]]''.  Byline July 5, 2007; accessed Feb. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the text has been sharply criticized in more recent years. The [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] chose this textbook by name as a bad example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva-Marie Kröller]], "Introduction", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature'', Eva-Marie Kröller, editor, (Cambridge University Press, 2005; {{ISBN|978-0-521-89131-8}}; {{ISBN|0-521-89131-0}}), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; observing its [[Anglocentrism|Anglocentric bias]]; the commission's reviewers found that the book "devotes 60 per cent of its text to the achievements of British explorers alone and completely ignores the [[French Canadian|French]]."&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Trudel and Genevieve Jain, ''Canadian History Textbooks: A Comparative Study'' (Ottawa: Queen’s Printer, 1970) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Nauru}}

The '''President of Nauru''' is elected by [[Parliament of Nauru|Parliament]] from among its members, and is both the [[head of state]] and the [[head of government]] of [[Nauru]]. Nauru's unicameral Parliament has 19 members, with an electoral term of 3 years. [[List of political parties in Nauru|Political parties]] only play a minor role in [[Politics of Nauru|Nauru politics]], and there have often been periods of instability in the Presidential office. Shifting allegiances among a small number of individuals can lead to frequent changes in the makeup of the government of the day, including the presidential position itself.

He was a Fellow of The Arctic Institute of North America,  primarily known for his contribution to the geology of the [[Proterozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] rocks.

==Biography==
Thorsteinsson was born in [[Wynyard, Saskatchewan]] of [[Iceland]]ic heritage.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; He obtained a BSc in geology at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] (1944) and an MSc in geology at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1955, he earned a [[Doctorate|PhD]] from the [[University of Kansas]].

Thorsteinsson began work in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], in 1947, as a summer field assistant. One of his assignments included an epic
canoe trip with [[Yves Fortier (geologist)|Dr. Y.O. Fortier]] to perform
geological reconnaissance in the centre of the largely unknown Arctic region. He began his lifelong career with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in 1952. He spent most of his time studying the Arctic. At first, his fieldwork was completed on foot and by dog team. He advanced the study of the Canadian Arctic by pioneering the method of landing small aircraft, with oversize tires, in remote places on the Arctic Islands. His work and that of his fellow geologists at the GSC led to extensive land acquisitions during the late 1950s and early 1960s by oil and mining companies.

Dr. Thorsteinsson made significant contributions in the fields of [[structural geology]] and [[biochronology]], as well as in regional [[stratigraphy]]. In 1973, the [[Royal Society of Canada]] noted
:His work is particularly characterized by its breadth and includes structural, stratigraphic, and biochronological histories of the enormously thick rock succession of the Islands and forms the basis of all future work. As a result of his studies the geological history and sedimentary column in the Islands are better understood than those in many areas of Canada that have been studied far longer. Few scientists have been fortunate enough to be presented with such a challenge and opportunity, and few could have risen to and mastered such a challenge.

Thorsteinsson published more than fifty maps and articles. His geological maps had scales varying from 1/125,000 to 1/500,000.

Thorsteinsson also performed [[Paleontology|paleontological]] studies. He made fundamental advances in the knowledge of [[graptolites]] and of the [[extinct]] [[ostracoderm]] [[fish]]. He established the most complete succession of [[Principle of faunal succession|faunal zones]] in [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks in the Arctic.

{{redirect|South Lebanon|other uses|South Lebanon (disambiguation)}}
'''Southern Lebanon''' ([[Lebanese Arabic]]: ''Jnoub'', meaning "south") is the area of [[Lebanon]] comprising the [[South Governorate]] and the [[Nabatiye Governorate]]. The two entities were divided from the same province in the early 1990s. The [[Rashaya District|Rashaya]] and [[Western Beqaa District|Western Beqaa]] Districts, the southernmost districts of the [[Beqaa Governorate]], in Southern Lebanon are sometimes included.

The main cities of the region are [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Jezzine and [[Nabatiyeh]]. The [[qadaa|caza]]s of [[Bint Jbeil]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and Nabatieh in Southern Lebanon are known for their large [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi'a Muslim]] population with a minority of [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]]. [[Sidon]] is predominantly [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]], with the rest of the caza of Sidon having a Shi'a Muslim majority, with a considerable Christian minority, mainly [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Greek Catholic]]s. The cazas of [[Jezzine]] and [[Marjeyoun]] have a Christian majority and also Shia Muslims. The villages of [[Ain Ebel]], [[Debel, Lebanon|Debel]], [[Qaouzah]], and [[Rmaich]] are entirely [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Christian Maronite]]. The caza of [[Hasbaya]] has a [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] majority.

==History==

===Free Lebanon State and South Lebanon security belt===
Southern Lebanon became the location of the self-proclaimed [[Free Lebanon State]], announced in 1979 by [[Saad Haddad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-lebanon.com/LFPNews/2004/February/feb2b/feb2b.html feb2b&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704055810/http://www.free-lebanon.com/LFPNews/2004/February/feb2b/feb2b.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state failed to gain international recognition, and its authority deteriorated with the death of Saad Haddad in 1984.

Southern Lebanon has also featured prominently in the [[Israel-Lebanon conflict]].

===Ahmadinejad's state visit===
In October 2010 [[Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] visited South Lebanon. This was his first visit to Lebanon since he first assumed office in [[Tehran]] in 2005. Both [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] condemned the trip as being "provocative." Ahmadinejad was welcomed by tens of thousands of supporters of [[Hezbollah]], Iran's Shiite Muslim ally in Lebanon which the United States and Israel have branded a terrorist organization despite its participation in Lebanon's fragile government.

A '''Vegetation Index''' ('''VI''') is a spectral transformation of two or more bands designed to enhance the contribution of vegetation properties and allow reliable spatial and temporal inter-comparisons of terrestrial photosynthetic activity and canopy structural variations.&lt;ref name=Huete2002/&gt;

There are many Vegetation Indices (VIs), with many being functionally equivalent. Many of the indices make use of the inverse relationship between red and near-infra red reflectance associated with healthy green vegetation. Since the 1960s scientists have used satellite remote sensing to monitor fluctuation in vegetation at the Earth’s surface. Measurements of vegetation attributes include leaf area index (LAI), percent green cover, chlorophyll content, green biomass and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR).

Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been historically classified based on a range of attributes, including the number of spectral bands (2 or greater than 2); the method of calculations (ratio or orthogonal), depending on the required objective; or by their historical development (classified as first generation VIs or second generation VIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Bannari|first = A.|last2 = Morin|first2 = D.|last3 = Bonn|first3 = F.|last4 = Huete|first4 = A.

Due to advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology, high-resolution reflectance spectrums are now available, which can be used with traditional multispectral VIs. In addition, VIs have been developed to be used specifically with hyperspectral data, such as the use of Narrow Band Vegetation Indices.
