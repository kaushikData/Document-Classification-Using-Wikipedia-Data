'''"A Manifesto for a Re-appraisal of Sinology and Reconstruction of Chinese Culture"''' (为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言; ''Wei Zhongguo Wenua Jinggao Shijie Renshi Xuanyan''; also translated as “Declaration on Behalf of Chinese Culture Respectfully Announced to the People of the World”&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, John. ''New Confucianism: A Critical Examination''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an essay originally published in China and Taiwan in 1958. The essay's collective authors included [[Carsun Chang]] (Zhang Junmai), Tang Chun-I ([[Tang Junyi]]), Mou Tsung-san ([[Mou Zongsan]]), and Hsu Fo-kuan ([[Xu Fuguan]]), all “[[New Confucianism]]” scholars and notable students of [[Xiong Shili]].

==Objectives==

The essay was first published in the journals ''Democratic Critique'' and the ''National Renaissance''. It aimed to educate Western peoples with proper ways of appreciating Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tsung-san, Mou, Carsun Chang, Tang Chun-i, and Hsu Fo-Kuan. A Manifesto for a Re-Appraisal of Sinology and Reconstruction of Chinese Culture. in Carsun Chang, ''The Development of Neo-Confucian Thought'', vol. 2 (New York: Bookman Associates, 1962). Print. A reprint of the Chinese original is available as: Mou, Zongsan, Zhang, Junmai, Xu, Fuguan, &amp; Tang, Junyi. (1989). 为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言 [A Manifesto to the World’s People on Behalf of Chinese Culture]. In Feng, Zusheng 封祖盛 (Ed.), 当代新儒家. Beijing: Sanlian Shudian, 1-52.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto marked an important starting point for [[New Confucianism]] and while its significance towards ideology is debated, the essay's cohesion led to a shared identity and revival for Confucian thought. Many of the individual views of these four scholars differed but this essay issued a “common conviction”&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; of the misunderstandings associated with Chinese culture as narrated by Western history and thought. In rejecting wholesale [[Westernization]] the essay “demands a place for Chinese cultural values on the world stage.” &lt;ref&gt;Manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay declares a new, proper manner in which to pursue the study of Sinology and explains Chinese culture from an experience viewpoint instead of an academic one. In Serina Chan's summary, the Manifesto advocates “post-colonial cultural nationalist discourse for cultural parity between China and the West in the midst of continuing Euro-American cultural dominance…(and) the document served to move the authors' Han Chinese cultural nationalist discourse into an imagined global arena for an ideological contest between Chinese and Western Cultures.”&lt;ref&gt;Chan, N. Serina. ''The Thought of Mou Zongsan''. Vol. 4. Boston: Brill, 2011. Print. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings of Western Framing of Chinese Culture==
The essay indicates three main approaches and subsequent failures in the Western study of [[Sinology]]. The scholars attributed these shortcomings to Christian missionaries, Sinologists or those who study Chinese history, and to members of the present world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Umberto. Reinventing Confucianism = Xian Dai Xin Ru Jia : The New Confucian Movement. Taipei: Taipei Ricci Institute for Chinese Studies, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these three approaches presented an insufficient explanation of Chinese culture to the West and required the creation of a new approach to foster respect for Chinese culture on the world stage.
	
'''Christian Missionaries''' The Manifesto claims “Chinese thought was first introduced into the Western world some three hundred years ago by [[Jesuit missionaries]], who had come to China to spread Christianity and incidentally scientific knowledge and technological skills.” The religious motives of the Christian missionaries accounted for differences in ideology, specifically with the Chinese [[Sung-Ming]] “emphasis on rationalism and idealism”.&lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese scholars highlighted the interplay between the “way of heaven” ([[Tiandao (disambiguation)|tiandao]]) and “the way of man” (rendao) in the revival of Confucianism, creating differences in religious thought with the Christian missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Ruokanen, Miikka, and Paulos Zhanzhu. Huang. Christianity and Chinese Culture. Grand Rapids, MI: W.B. Eerdmans Pub., 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay argues “Chinese culture arose out of the extension of primordial religious passion to ethical moral principles and to daily living. For this reason... its religious aspects have not been developed…”&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in cultural and religious values created misunderstandings between the two cultures, and fostered a bias in the cultural diffusion associated with Christian missionaries and their trips to China.
	
'''Sinologists/Myth of Chinese Antiquity''' The second approach that the New Confucian scholars denied is that taken by students and thinkers of Western Sinology. According to the manifesto, the new interest fostered by the [[Open Door Policy]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] led to curiosity about Chinese goods and history. “The objects of this interest soon included fine arts, archaeology, geography, history of frontier development, history of East-West communications, and even the characteristics of the written and oral language…” &lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue taken up by the scholars was not in the curiosity towards Chinese artifacts, but to the apparent disinterest in the living, modern nation and its growth. The newfound awareness of China’s antiquity downplayed the importance of China as a modern nation and actor on the world’s stage.  This study of antiquity “became the standard methodology of sinology” and portrayed an outdated and single faceted image of China as a country, a view the authors of the manifesto strongly disagreed with.
	
'''Political Motivations''' The last failed approach is an interest in the modern history of China and the viewing of China's “past through the present”. Blaming the predominantly Western leading historians of contemporary China, the authors of the manifesto claim to uncover varying attitudes and biases towards present political situations in China. All feelings and analysis of the past are influenced too heavily by the present and by “personal feelings and subjective attitude” to be a realistic depiction of Chinese culture for the West.&lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of antiquity was too outdated for the manifesto, the study of modernity was too biased by present political motives.

==New Approach==
The “new approach” asserted by the authors of the manifesto relies on “sympathy and reverence for the culture” in order to fully understand Chinese culture. Culture according to the manifesto is defined as: “the objective expression of the spiritual life of mankind,” &lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; and this spiritual life must be experienced to be fully understood. The mistake made in the previous three approaches to Sinology has been in the refusal to accept or understand the life of the object of study. The manifesto states that “we can indeed say that without sympathy and respect there can be no real comprehension. What one experiences is mere appearance; one must dig beneath this appearance in order to communicate with the heart and soul of what lies hidden within it.” &lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
'''The Doctrine of “Hsin-Hsing”''' The doctrine that the manifesto claims is most neglected by Western Sinologists is the “concentration of mind on an exhaustive study of the nature of the universe.” &lt;ref&gt;Mou et al., Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basis of all theories related to Chinese culture, and with a full grasp of “Hsin-Hsing” (literally “mind-nature”; ''xinxing'' 心性) one is able to understand the successes and limitations of Chinese culture. This doctrine allows for a development of the Chinese moral subject in harmony with the universe; but also displays the lack of development in “the political subject, the knowing subject, and the technological subject” in relation to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind this is the differences in history between China and its Western counterparts. Western society has pluralistic origins in “Greek reason, Hebrew faith, and Roman Law,” while China’s culture emphasizes on “''yiben'' 一本” or “one foundation”. This changes the values associated with each culture, as China focuses more on the development of moral individuals it places less importance on competition and technological progress in comparison with the West. To truly study Sinology the manifesto states that the researcher must  study this one foundation or “Hsin-Hsin” to experience the culture as a living, objective being.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shuxian. Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; After this understanding is achieved, the limitations of Chinese culture are uncovered along with the successes. The “New Approach” does not all together denounce Western culture. It urges the Chinese to learn Western systems of logic, natural sciences, technological advances, and institutions of democratic government. The synthesis of the cultures requires a respectful learning and appreciation of what each has to offer in order to better both sides of the world.

==World Approach, Lessons for the West==
The manifesto makes recommendations for Chinese culture to accept scientific and technological advances, but more clearly lays out lessons for the West to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook. "Book Review." Rev. of Essentials of Contemporary Neo-Confucian Philosophy. Northwestern University 2003. Web. 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes five elements that, according to the manifesto, “the west must also learn from the East if it is to carry out its task as the world’s cultural leader.” The cultivation of a world culture, as well as promoting Chinese culture to the world’s stage are primary goals of the manifesto and in order for either cultures to succeed they must engage in authentic communication. The manifesto dictates that the West needs the spirit and capacity of sensing the presence of what is at every particular moment, and of giving up everything that can be had. The second element is the all-embracing understanding or wisdom, third is the feeling of mildness and compassion. Fourth is how to perpetuate its culture, and the fifth that the “whole world is like one family.” &lt;ref&gt;Chan, N. Serina. The Thought of Mou Zongsan. Vol. 4. Boston: Brill, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The signers of the manifesto asserted that by accepting New Confucianism in accordance with aspects of Western culture, the future of mankind can transform to be a more open, inclusive and creative culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-ming. Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity: Moral Education in Japan and the Four Mini-dragons. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew S. Bowie''' (born 1952) is Professor of Philosophy and German at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] and Founding Director of the Humanities and Arts Research Centre (HARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhul.ac.uk/harc/ HARC] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked to promote a better understanding of [[German philosophy]] in the Anglophone [[Analytic philosophy|analytical tradition]] &lt;ref&gt;See his book on German Philosophy in the [[Very Short Introductions]] series and his [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL3244509W/Introduction_to_German_Philosophy Introduction to German Philosophy from Kant to Habermas]&lt;/ref&gt; - including the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg)]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Albrecht Wellmer]] and [[Manfred Frank]].

[[Manfred Frank|Frank]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] have spoken highly of his work in this area - with Habermas calling his work "masterly" and Frank calling him an "exceptional scholar", whose work represents "the most knowledgeable presentation in English of the history of the German contribution to so-called continental philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;See their reviews of his [http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745625713 Introduction to German Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605212746/http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745625713 |date=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has described his work on music as "excellent and densely argued".&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Charles |date=2016 |title=The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity|url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660205 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674660205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his philosophical work on music, he is a keen jazz saxophonist and has played with leading contemporary jazz musicians such as 
[[Al Casey (jazz guitarist)|Al Casey]] and [[Humphrey Lyttelton]].&lt;ref&gt;See his [http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/andrew-bowie_3d787cff-bd1c-4349-b003-8f501c909611.html biography] on the Royal Holloway website and the [https://soundcloud.com/andy-bowie Soundcloud page for the Andy Bowie Quartet]&lt;/ref&gt;

He did his doctoral research on "History and the Novel" (1980) at the [[University of East Anglia]], where he was taught by the renowned German writer and scholar [[W. G. Sebald]] (who later cited Bowie's work on [[Alexander Kluge]] in his ''Campo Santo''&lt;ref&gt;See W.G. Sebald, ''Campo Santo'' (London, Random House: 2005), pp. 73, 74, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;). He studied German philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. He was Professor of Philosophy at [[Anglia Ruskin University]] until 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1120">A '''charisticary''' is a person to whom is given the enjoyment of the revenues of a monastery, hospital, or benefice, also known as a ''comendatory'' or ''donatory''.

The charisticaries among the [[Ancient Greeks]] were a kind of donatories who enjoyed all the revenues of hospitals and monasteries, without giving an account thereof to any person. [[iconoclasm|Iconoclast]]s who have abused this in the past include [[Constantine Copronymus]], the avowed enemy of the monks, whose monasteries he gave away to strangers.

In later times, the emperors and patriarchs gave many to upper-class people, not by way of gift, to reap any temporal advantage from; but to repair, beautify, and patronize them. Eventually, those in good condition were given, especially such as were rich; and at last they were all given away, rich and poor, those of men and of women; and that to laymen and married men.

[[Jean-Baptiste Cotelier]], in his ''Ecclesiae Graecae Monumenta'', gives the form of these donations: they were given for life, or sometimes for two lives.

Martin''' (1924–2008) was an Australian [[philosopher]] noted for work in [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100136897 |title=Charles B. Martin |publisher=Oxford Reference |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Martin was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Calgary, Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney, and past President of the Australasian Philosophical Association. Inspired by [[John Locke]], he was an early proponent of causal theories of perception, knowledge, and memory, and a principal architect of [[Australian realism|Australian metaphysical realism]]. He advocated an uncompromising materialist conception of minds as complex neurologically based propensities for the manipulation of sensory materials. The "ofness" and "aboutness" of thoughts and images arises from their dispositional realizations in the nervous system. More generally, Martin held that property instances invariably possess both dispositional and non-dispositional aspects, and that causal transactions are best regarded, not as relations between distinct events, but as the "mutual manifestations of reciprocal dispositional property partners."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hei05|Heil 2005]]. pp. 556-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor David S. Oderberg''' (born 1963) is an Australian philosopher of [[metaphysics]] and [[ethics]] based in Britain since 1987. He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref name="reading.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.reading.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/dso/dso.htm#bitsand&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself as a non-consequentialist or a traditionalist in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Oderberg, 2000 p.x ({{ISBN|978-0631219057}})&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Oderberg places himself in opposition to [[Peter Singer]] and other utilitarian or consequentialist thinkers. He has published over thirty academic papers and has authored four books, ''Real Essentialism'', ''Applied Ethics'', ''Moral Theory'', and ''The Metaphysics of Identity over Time''. Professor Oderberg is an alumnus of the Universities of [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne]], where he completed his first degrees, and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] where he gained his D.Phil.&lt;ref name="reading.ac.uk"/&gt;

He was appointed editor of ''[[Ratio (journal)|Ratio]]'', the philosophical quarterly, in late 2012.

== ''Applied Ethics'' ==
''Applied Ethics'', which was first published in 2000, has become one of the most important of Oderberg's works.&lt;ref&gt;See reviews on https://www.amazon.co.uk/Applied-Ethics-Non-Consequentialist-David-Oderberg/dp/0631219056&lt;/ref&gt; Oderberg applies his classical viewpoint to some controversial ethical issues: abortion, [[euthanasia]], [[animal rights]], capital punishment and the [[just war theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Oderberg 2000 p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Oderberg provides a detailed defence of the view that abortion is morally wrong because the [[fetus]] is an innocent life, and intentionally taking an innocent life is always morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Oderberg 2000 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He aims to refute views like those of [[Peter Singer]], who suggests that we deny that it is always wrong to intentionally kill innocent human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, Abortion entry in the ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' 1995, pp. 2–3. Accessible at http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1995----03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Oderberg compares legalised abortion to [[contract killing]], arguing that the state has no more right to legalise and regulate abortion on the ground that this would take it out of the 'back street,' than it does to legalise and regulate contract killing on the same ground. On the subject of euthanasia, he argues that it too is immoral, because, like abortion, it involves the intentional killing of an innocent human being. Voluntary euthanasia is no more justifiable than involuntary, since a person has no absolute right to do whatever they want with their body. Furthermore, he believes the current scientific definition of [[brain death]] is unsatisfactory both on metaphysical grounds and from an ethical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Oderberg's position on animal rights is similar to that of [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] – rejecting in principle the idea that humans have duties to animals because they are not [[moral agency|moral agents]], he nonetheless believes that humans still have duties in respect of them to treat them kindly.  On the death penalty, Oderberg supports the state's right to enforce capital punishment, because justice must be [[retributive justice|retributive]] and death, being the worst punishment, is the suitable punishment for the worst crime – e.g. murder. Oderberg supports just war theory, and believes that civilians who do not contribute to the war effort should not be targeted. In virtue of this, he regards the use of [[atomic warfare]] in [[World War II]] to have been a seriously immoral act. He also regards contraception as immoral, and exhorts 'pro-lifers' like himself to engage in 'campaigning, protesting, writing, or whatever it is that we do best in defending the pro-life cause.'&lt;ref&gt;'Why Abortion Isn't Important', ''The Human Life Review'' 28.3, Summer 2002. https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-218539741/why-abortion-isn-t-important &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">[[File:Dehat Bibi Behat Bibi.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Dehat and Behat Bibi in Zalsu Kashmir]]
'''Dehat Bibi''', also known as '''Dehat Ded''', was a disciple of [[Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali|Sheikh Noor-Ud-Din (Nund Reshi)]], the patron saint of [[Kashmir]]. She along with her sister [[Behat Bibi]] are sometimes referred as Tsat'a Kori, literally girl disciples or girl students of Nund Reshi. Behat Bibi and Dehat Bibi were daughters of a Kashmiri pundit who was a village Patwari by profession and had converted to Islam under the influence of the Sufi saint.

The exalted state of their spirituality and the depth and breadth of their knowledge is testified by the fact that the two girls became the only known female khalifas of Nund Reshi. They are both buried at a village named Zalsu, a few miles from the village of [[Charari Sharief|Tsaar]]  (Chrar Sharif) in the valley of Kashmir. The two sisters were present at a meeting that took place between Sheikh Noor-Ud-Din and the proselytizer Saiyed Muhammad Hamadani. The presence of two female disciples in such an important meeting confirms that they were regarded highly by the Reshi.

When Hamadani saw the physically weak Reshi, he remarked that he (Nund Reshi) should not keep his horse (his body) in such a weak condition. To that, Reshi replied that to control once “nafas” (physical needs) was very important because otherwise just like a well-fed horse it could become unmanageable. Dehat Bibi is said &lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Ishaq Khan(2011). Sufis Of Kashmir, p. 105. Gulshan Books, Srinagar, Kashmir. {{ISBN|978-81-8339-095-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to have remarked, “Those who have already reached their destination or goal do not need a ride or a whip.” To this, Saiyed Hamadani is supposed to have asked her, who did she think had reached that goal? Dehat Bibi is said to have replied, “Those who have liberated themselves from the clutches of self.” When asked if she was a girl or a boy, Dehat Bibi’s answer was simple yet filled with such profound depth that it left everyone speechless; “If I am non-existent (''neest'' in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language) then I am neither a girl nor a boy; but if I am existent (''hast'' in Persian), then I am nothing.” &lt;ref&gt;Baba Kamal. Reshinama, p. 169-176&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4178">'''Differential argument marking (DAM)''' is a cover term for when languages encode the same [[grammatical function]] (e.g. subject or object) in different ways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|veditors = Seržant I, Witzlack-Makarevich A,|date=2018|title=Diachrony of differential argument marking|url = http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/173|publisher = Language Science Press| place = Berlin|language=en|doi=10.5281/zenodo.1219168|doi-access=free|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes non-uniform encoding of arguments in terms of [[case marking]], but also in terms of the presence or absence of [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] on the verb.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/711047863|title=Objects and information structure|last=Dalrymple|first=Mary|last2=Nikolaeva|first2=Irina|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=|year=|isbn=9780521199858|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=711047863}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''differential marking'' – specifically ''differential object marking'' or ''DOM'' – was coined by Georg Bossong in relation to his work on Sardinian and New Iranian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13348020|title=Empirische Universalienforschung : differentielle Objektmarkierung in den neuiranischen Sprachen|last=Georg.|first=Bossong,|date=1985|publisher=Narr|isbn=3878083645|location=Tübingen|oclc=13348020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years there has been a growing interest in the great variety of differential marking patterns across the world's languages in both formal and [[Functional theories of grammar|functional linguistics]].

== Types of differential marking ==
There are several sub-types of differential argument marking depending on the grammatical function and/or [[semantic role]] of the differentially-marked argument:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Differential Subject Marking
* Differential Object Marking
* Differential Agent Marking/Optional Ergative Marking
* Differential Recipient Marking
* Differential Theme Marking

The most widely studied are [[differential object marking]] and [[differential subject marking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009|editor-last=de Hoop|editor-first=Helen|editor2-last=de Swart|editor2-first=Peter|title=Differential Subject Marking|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6497-5|journal=Studies in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6497-5|issn=0924-4670}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is sometimes also known as optional ergative marking)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGregor|first=William B.|date=2010|title=Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2009.05.010|journal=Lingua|volume=120|issue=7|pages=1610–1636|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2009.05.010|issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Patterns of differential marking ==
Differential marking is known to be affected by a range of [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[information structure]] factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include semantic properties of the argument such as [[animacy]], [[definiteness]] and referentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aissen|first=Judith|date=2003|title=Differential Object Marking: Iconicity vs. Economy|url=|journal=Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory|volume=21|pages=435-483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes properties related to the event semantics, such as the affectedness of arguments or the level of volitionality or control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Næss|first=Åshild|date=2004|title=What markedness marks: the markedness problem with direct objects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0024384103001189|journal=Lingua|volume=114|issue=9-10|pages=1186–1212|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2003.07.005|issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in many languages, differential marking is related to the status of arguments as either topical or focal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There appear to be cross-linguistic differences in the triggering factors depending on whether the subject (agent) or object (patient) is differentially-marked.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Divine Mercy image''' is a depiction of [[Jesus]] based on the devotion initiated by Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]].

"I promise that the soul that will venerate this image will not perish," Jesus told Faustina, according to her diary, which has been studied and authenticated by the Church over several decades. "I also promise victory over enemies already here on earth, especially at the hour of death. I myself will defend it as My own glory." (Diary of Faustina, 48)

Jesus is shown in most versions as raising his right hand in blessing, and pointing with his left hand on his chest from which flow forth two rays: one red and one white (translucent). The depictions often contains the message "Jesus, I trust in You!" (Polish: ''Jezu ufam Tobie''). The rays streaming out have symbolic meaning: red for the [[Blood of Christ|blood of Jesus]] (which is the [[Life of Soul]]s), and pale for the water (which justify souls) (from Diary - 299). The whole image is symbolic of charity, forgiveness and love of God, referred to as the "Fountain of Mercy". According to the diary of St Faustina, the image is based on her 1931 vision of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-faustina.com/Diary/DMIMS1.shtml|title=Divine Mercy in My Soul - The Diary of Sister Faustina|publisher=Our Home with God|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815025733/http://www.saint-faustina.com/Diary/DMIMS1.shtml|archivedate=15 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of artistic renditions of the image (including that by [[Adolf Hyła]] in [[Kraków]]) have appeared since Faustina directed the painting of the first image in Vilnius (artist [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski]]). These are widely venerated worldwide, and are used in the celebration of [[Divine Mercy Sunday]], observed in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], as well as some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches.&lt;ref name="Brockman2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockman|first=Norbert|title=Encyclopedia of Sacred Places |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkSk4euA-TEC&amp;pg=PA140 |accessdate=26 April 2014|date=13 September 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598846546|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and background==

===History===
[[File:Chapelinterior.JPG|thumb|A 2006 rendition of the image above the altar of the sanctuary of the [[Fathers of Mercy]]]]
[[File:Brzegi- Udział premier Beaty Szydło w Mszy Świętej - 28564602182.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Francis]] celebrating the Holy Mass in front of the [[Divine Mercy]] image at the [[World Youth Day 2016]].]]

[[Faustina Kowalska]] was a [[Poles|Polish]] nun who joined the convent of [[Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy|Our Lady of Mercy]] in [[Warsaw]] 1925.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball174 &gt;''Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pages 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary, which was later published as the book ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'', Faustina wrote about a number of [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]] and conversations with him.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt; Her confessor was [[Michael Sopocko]], a priest and a professor of theology.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball174 /&gt;

In 1930, Faustina was assigned to the convent in [[Plock|Płock]], Poland. Faustina stated that whilst she was in her cell on the night of Sunday, 22 February 1931, Jesus appeared to her as the "King of Divine Mercy", robed in a white garment.&lt;ref name=Torretto84 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell63 /&gt;

Faustina wrote that Jesus' right hand was raised in a sign of blessing and the other was touching the garment near his breast, and that from beneath the garment slightly down, aside his breast, emanated two large rays, one red, the other white.&lt;ref name=Torretto84 &gt;''A Divine Mercy Resource'' by Richard Torretto 2010 {{ISBN|1-4502-3236-1}} "The Image of Divine Mercy" pages 84-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell63 &gt;Catherine M. Odell, 1998, Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}  pages 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;Tim Drake, 2002, ''Saints of the Jubilee'', {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In her diary (Notebook 1, items 47 and 48), she wrote that Jesus told her:&lt;ref name="Drake89"&gt;Tim Drake, 2002, Saints of the Jubilee, {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Paint an image according to the pattern you see, with the signature: "Jesus, I trust in You". I desire that this image be venerated, first in your chapel, and then throughout the world. I promise that the soul that will venerate this image will not perish.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretto84 /&gt;}}

Another nun, Sister Christine, later stated that rays of light from the window were visible that night and attracted the attention of people standing on the other side of the street, implying that this was a "physical" appearance rather than an interior vision.&lt;ref name=Torretto84 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sister Faustina Kowalska: her life and mission'' by Maria Tarnawska 1990 {{ISBN|0-948202-43-2}} page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Not knowing how to paint, Faustina approached some other nuns at her convent for help, but received no assistance. She attempted to sketch the image with charcoal on canvas, but had little success.&lt;ref name=Ball174 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell65 &gt;Catherine M. Odell, 1998, Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}  pages 65-75&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary (Notebook 1, item 53), she wrote that Jesus told her that she would receive "visible help" with the task. In November 1932, Faustina left Płock and returned to [[Warsaw]], and in May 1933, she was sent to the convent in [[Vilnius]] to work as the gardener.&lt;ref name=Odell85 &gt;Catherine M. Odell, 1998, Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}  pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vilnius, Faustina met Father [[Michael Sopocko]], the newly appointed confessor to the nuns.&lt;ref name=Odell85 /&gt; Sopocko supported Faustina's efforts and arranged for the first painting of the image by the artist [[Eugene Kazimierowski]],&lt;ref name=Ball174 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretto84 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell85 /&gt; which was the only rendition Faustina saw.&lt;ref name=Torretto84 /&gt; After Faustina's death, a number of other artists painted their own versions of the image, with the depiction by [[Adolf Hyla|Adolf Hyła]] being among the most reproduced.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

===Devotional significance===
{{quote|''Not in the beauty of the colour, nor of the brush lies the greatness of this image, but in My grace''.&lt;br&gt; — Words attributed to Jesus by Faustina in her diary.&lt;ref name=Odell85 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul'' by Faustina Kowalska 2003 {{ISBN|1-59614-110-7}} Notebok 1, item 313 {{cite web |url=http://www.saint-faustina.com/Diary/DMIMS7.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428210314/http://www.saint-faustina.com/Diary/DMIMS7.shtml |archivedate=2011-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clear &gt;''15 Days of Prayer with Saint Faustina Kowalska'' by John J. Cleary 2010 {{ISBN|1-56548-350-2}} page 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[Canonization|canonisation]] of Faustina in April 2000, [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the Divine Mercy and the image has increased.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook &gt;''Sourcebook for Sundays, Seasons, and Weekdays 2011: The Almanac for Pastoral Liturgy'' by Corinna Laughlin 2010 {{ISBN|1-56854-871-0}} page 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''15 Days of Prayer with Saint Faustina Kowalska'' by John J. Cleary 2010 {{ISBN|1-56548-350-2}} page 22&lt;/ref&gt; The devotional following of the image and Faustina's message has been stronger among Catholics at large than among theologians.&lt;ref name=Withyou &gt;''Am With You Always'' by Benedict Groeschel 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-58617-257-2}} page 548&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Benedict Groeschel]] considers a modest estimate of the following in 2010 to be over one hundred million Catholics.&lt;ref name=Withyou /&gt;

Faustina's diary relates the rays of light within the image to life and salvation, stating (Notebook 1, item 299) that she was told by Jesus:

{{cquote|"The two rays denote Blood and Water. The pale ray stands for the Water which makes souls righteous. The red ray stands for the Blood which is the life of souls... These two rays issued forth from the very depths of My tender mercy when My agonized Heart was opened by a lance on the Cross."&lt;ref&gt;''15 Days of Prayer with Saint Faustina Kowalska'' by John J. Cleary 2010 {{ISBN|1-56548-350-2}} page 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine M. Odell, 1998, ''Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy'' OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}} page 165&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Faustina also wrote that Jesus stressed the importance of the image as part of the Divine Mercy devotion, and in Notebook 1, item 327 attributed these words to Jesus:

{{cquote|"I am offering people a vessel with which they are to keep coming for graces to the fountain of mercy. That vessel is this image with the signature; 'Jesus, I trust in You."&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Deliverance'' by Gloria Perales 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4343-2765-9}} page 39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Catholic devotions thus stress the importance of the image as a "conduit for grace" as part of the Divine Mercy message.&lt;ref name=Clear /&gt;

Faustina's diary also relates the image to [[Divine Mercy Sunday]]. Faustina wrote (Notebook 1, item 49) that Jesus told her that he wanted the Divine Mercy image to be "solemnly blessed" on the first Sunday after Easter; and that Sunday was to be the Feast of Mercy.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt;&lt;ref name=odell66 &gt;''Faustina: The Apostle of Divine Mercy'' by Catherine M. Odell 1998 {{ISBN|0-87973-923-1}} page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope [[John Paul II]] instituted ''Divine Mercy Sunday'' (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) and placed it on the [[General Roman Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20000430_faustina_en.html Vatican website: Canonization of St. Faustina Kowalska, April 30, 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505032503/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20000430_faustina_en.html |date=May 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook /&gt;

The veneration of the Divine Mercy image also takes place in conjunction with the [[Divine Mercy Chaplet]] and Novena.&lt;ref name="Drake89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sourcebook for Sundays and Seasons 2008'' by D. Todd Williamson'' 2007 {{ISBN|1-56854-617-3}} page 195&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican biography of Faustina states that the veneration of the Divine Mercy image is part of the second component of her message, namely "entreating God's mercy for the whole world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20000430_faustina_en.html Vatican biography of Faustina Kowalska] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303000335/http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20000430_faustina_en.html |date=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praying before the Divine Mercy image (with the signature "Jesus I trust in you") is not only encouraged in Catholic devotions, but is mentioned as a partial condition for some of the [[indulgence]]s associated with Divine Mercy Sunday.&lt;ref name=Decree&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020629_decree-ii_en.html ''Decree of the Apostolic Penitentiary on Divine Mercy Indulgences'' at the Vatican web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219214545/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020629_decree-ii_en.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic renditions==

===First painting===
[[File:Divine Mercy Sanctuary in Vilnius4.JPG|thumb|The first Divine Mercy painting by [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski|Kazimierowski]] (1934) at the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius|Divine Mercy Sanctuary]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]].]]
The first painting was by [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski|Eugene Kazimierowski]], under the supervision of [[Mary Faustina Kowalska|Faustina]] and her confessor, [[Michał Sopoćko|Michael Sopoćko]], in [[Vilnius]]. After completion in 1934, the painting hung in the [[Bernardine order|Bernardine Sisters']] convent near the church of St. Archangel Michael, where Sopoko was a rector.&lt;ref name= Toretto84 &gt;A Divine Mercy Resource by Richard Torretto 2010 {{ISBN|1-4502-3236-1}} pages 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary, sister Faustina notes that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent. The first public exposition of the Kazimierowski rendition was on 26–28 April 1935, at the church of the [[Gate of Dawn]] in Vilnius.&lt;ref name=Drake85/&gt;  In 1937, on the Sunday after Easter, the current Feast of Divine Mercy, the picture was put on display beside the main altar in [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|St Michael’s Church, Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piligrimukelias.lt/index.php?id=122&amp;lng=1|title=Jono Pauliaus II piligrimų kelias. Divine Mercy Image|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet authorities, having occupied Lithuania, in 1948 closed St Michael's Church and destroyed the convent. The painting remained in the church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius Bronė Miniotaitė and Janina Rodzevič bought the canvas from a guard and gave it to the parish priest at the [[Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit]] for safekeeping. Professional restoration in the spring of 2003 left the image exactly as it was when Eugeniusz Kazimierowski painted it under the direction of Sister Faustina.

Sopocko was a professor of theology at the [[University of Vilnius]] and introduced Faustina to Kazimierowski, who was professor of art there. Kazimierowski had painted religious images before, but this task was difficult for him. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an [[alb]], and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter‘s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Christ told her it is not that important that the picture be beautiful. The true beauty, Christ said, would be the blessing that He would bestow to the people by the means of the painting.

The first Divine Mercy painting by [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski|Kazimierowski]] is currently exposed and devoted at the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius]], in [[Lithuania]].

=== Hyła painting ===
Another painting of the Divine Mercy was made by [[Adolf Hyła]], as a [[Ex-voto|votive offering]]. Through painting this picture, Hyła expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during [[World War II]].

Hyła was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent, and a small copy of the first painting. Hyła's image is somewhat different from Kazimierowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a "Divine Physician", walking the earth and healing people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of this painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica as it was deemed "non-liturgical".

The Hyła rendition is also called the "Kraków Divine Mercy Image" because it is kept in the sanctuary at [[Łagiewniki-Borek Fałęcki|Kraków-Łagiewniki]].

===Other versions===

Before Adolf Hyła offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned [[Stanisław Kaczor-Batowski|Stanisław Batowski]] to paint a third version. This was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hyła's. [[Cardinal Sapieha]], who happened to be in the convent then, selected the Hyła painting because it was a votive image.&lt;ref&gt;''A Divine Mercy Resource'' by Richard Torretto 2010 {{ISBN|1-4502-3236-1}} page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other artists have painted the image, but Hyła's rendition remains the most reproduced one.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;

"The image of The Divine Mercy, painted by Adam Styka (1957), [is] displayed in the Sanctuary of The Divine Mercy at the Congregation of Marians in Stockbridge, MA USA." (''Diary'' pictures of images). A popular image was created in 1982 by American artist Robert Skemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enid.uib.no/pictures/devinemercy.htm|title=ENID|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rendition depicts Jesus standing in front of an arched doorway, with a more pronounced [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] about his head. The Skemp and Hyła images are the most ubiquitous depictions found in the [[Philippines]], where the devotion to the Divine Mercy is a popular one.

The [[Divine Mercy Shrine (Misamis Oriental)|Divine Mercy Shrine, Misamis Oriental]], in [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador City]], [[Philippines]] was built in 2008, and has a 15.24-metre (50 foot) statue of the Divine Mercy towering above the shrine.&lt;ref name=BWeek &gt;''BusinessWeek Mindanao'' 26 August 2011: "DIVINE MERCY SHRINE in Misamis Oriental celebrates Birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary" [http://www.businessweekmindanao.com/2011/08/26/divine-mercy-shrine-in-misamis-oriental-celebrates-birthday-of-the-blessed-virgin-mary/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBCP News (Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines) March 28, 2008: "Divine Mercy Sunday in Mindanao" [http://www.cbcpnews.com/?q=node/1588/10221]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banning==
In 1959 the Vatican banned the image and devotion to it because of a number of factors. Some Polish bishops questioned Kowalska's claims and were uncomfortable with the image's similarity to the red and white [[Polish flag]].&lt;ref name="National Catholic Reporter"&gt;[https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/beatification-qa-4-whats-divine-mercy-connection National Catholic Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; Polish priests were reported to be interpreting the rays as a symbol of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;[''Development of the Worship of Divine Mercy in Poland and Abroad'', Bishop Pawel Socha, Peregrinis Cracoviensis 11, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on the image and devotion to it was only lifted on April 15, 1978, due to pressure from future Polish pope, [[Karol Wojtyła]], who was a great advocate for Kowalska.&lt;ref name="National Catholic Reporter"/&gt;

'''Elder rights''' are the [[rights]] of the aged, who in the [[United States]] are not recognized as a constitutionally [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=mitchellreview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=Nina|title=The Lawyer's Role in Fostering an Elder Rights Movement|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|date=2010|volume=37|page=51|url=http://web.wmitchell.edu/law-review/wp-content/uploads/Volume37/documents/Kohn.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Common rights issues faced by elders include age-related job [[discrimination]] (such as forced age of retirement), lack of access to medical treatments because of age or age-related obstacles, societal perceptions of ability/disability due to age,&lt;ref name="mitchellreview"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vulnerability to abuse, including financial, physical, psychological, social, and sexual&lt;ref name=srv&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Rights – Elder Abuse|url=http://seniorsrights.org.au/your-rights/|website=Senior Rights Victoria|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of diminished capacity and lack of access to/ability to use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Elders' Rights|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/caringforyourparents/handbook/legalissues/protectingeldersrights.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elder rights movement==
The concept of a unique set of needs and rights of the elderly started in 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] with the main focus being on the need for a national pension program to provide financial security to the no longer working elderly.&lt;ref name=walls&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walls|first1=David|title=Elders Rights Movement|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/elders-rights-movement.shtml|publisher=Sonoma State University|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous rival plans (the [[Townsend Plan]], the [[McClain Movement]], the [[Ham and Eggs Movement]]) were made to address the issue.  Eventually, as part of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], the [[Social Security Act]] was passed to meet the need.

As the [[population ageing|population aged]] and the aged grew wealthier throughout the second half of the twentieth century, their political influence increased.&lt;ref name='walls'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] and government bodies such as the [[Administration on Aging]] were created to meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Henry|title=The Gray Lobby: Politics of Old Age|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues far beyond simple financial security became the focus{{snd}}[[Maggie Kuhn]], angered over her mandatory retirement at 65, launched the [[Gray Panthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laursen|first1=Eric|title=Gray Panthers|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/2009/panthers.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Elder Law Foundation]] was created out of concern that elderly might have unique legal needs.&lt;ref name="nelf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 reauthorization of the [[Older Americans Act]] included a project called [[Choices for Independence]] to develop consumer-directed community-based (as opposed to congregate segregated choices such as traditional nursing homes) long-term care options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elder Rights Background Documents|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/index.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Errol Eustace Harris''' (19 February 1908 – 21 June 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6720843.ece|title=Professor Errol Harris: philosopher|date=21 July 2009|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=2009-07-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes cited as '''E. E. Harris''', was a contemporary [[South Africa]]n [[philosopher]]. His work focused on developing a systematic and coherent account of the [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]] implicit in contemporary understanding of the world. Harris held that, in conjunction with [[empirical science]], the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical tradition]], in its commitment to the ideal of reason, contains the resources necessary to accomplish this end.  He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/2065022.errol_harris/ ''The Westmorland Gazette'' (UK), 22 Feb. 2008 (retrieved 21 Oct. 2008)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information about his being Distinguished Professor of Christian Philosophy at Vilanova in 1982 is from the unpublished manuscript of Errol Harris's autobiography,'Bound in Shallows'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Errol E. Harris was born on 19 February 1908 in [[Kimberley, South Africa]], to parents who had emigrated from Leeds, England. His father, Samuel Jack Harris, had been one of the defenders of Kimberley when he was besieged there (together with [[Cecil Rhodes]]) during the [[Boer War]]. Errol studied philosophy at [[Rhodes University]] in South Africa, where he was a student of A.R. Lord and where he obtained his B.A. and M.A., and at the [[University of Oxford]], where he obtained a B.Litt. degree with a thesis on [[Samuel Alexander]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]].

He served as an education officer for the British Colonial Service, and during World War II was Chief Instructor of the Middle East Military Education College at Mt. Carmel, Palestine, with the rank of Major in the Education Corps of the British Army. He was succeeded as Chief Instructor by Huw Wheldon, later Managing Director of the BBC; another Instructor was Capt. Michael Stewart, later Foreign Secretary in Harold Wilson's government, and subsequently Baron Stewart of Fulham. Errol Harris received his D. Litt. in philosophy from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in 1950, where he was secretary, and then president, of the lecturers' association. He became a full professor there in 1953. He served on the executive of the South African Race Relations Board with Chief Luthuli, the Zulu paramount chief, and in this capacity came to know Oliver Tambo (Nelson Mandela's law partner, who succeeded Mandela as president of the ANC.), who advised the Board of the ANC's stand on various issues.  Harris's first important philosophical work, ''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'', appeared in 1954. In 1956 he went to the United States to lecture at [[Yale University]] and [[Connecticut College]], where he was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy. This allowed his philosophical activity to prosper unimpeded and gain growing recognition.

From 1959-1960 he was Acting Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at [[Edinburgh University]] in Scotland, and then returned to Connecticut College. In 1962 he became Roy Roberts Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Kansas]], and in 1966 Professor of Philosophy at [[Northwestern University]], where he was later named John Evans Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy and where he taught until his retirement in 1976. At the World Congress of Philosophy in Vienna in 1968, he chaired the meeting that established the International Society for Metaphysics. After retirement he taught as a visiting Professor at [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[Villanova University|Villanova]] (as Distinguished Professor of Christian Philosophy) and [[Emory University|Emory]] Universities and was an honorary research fellow at the Centre for Philosophy and History of Science at [[Boston University]]. He was President of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1969 (and in 1985 was awarded the Society's Paul Weiss Medal for the outstanding contribution to Metaphysics), and President of the Hegel Society of America in 1977-8. He had a home near Ambleside in the Lake District in England since 1963, taking up permanent residence there in his latter years. He died on 21 June 2009 at the age of 101.

== Philosophical work ==
During his years at Kansas and Northwestern Harris's major publications included ''The Foundation of Metaphysics in Science'' (1965) and ''Hypothesis and Perception: The Roots of Scientific Method'' (1970). He has also had an abiding [[historiography|historiographic]] interest in the metaphysics of Baruch Spinoza and G.W.F. Hegel. Spinoza's philosophy is reconstructed, interpreted, and appropriated by Harris in ''Salvation from Despair: A Reappraisal of Spinoza's Philosophy'' (1973). He argued for the cogency, truth, and timeliness of Hegel's speculative logic in ''An Interpretation of the Logic of Hegel'' (1983). In retirement his philosophical activity continued uninterrupted, giving rise to numerous articles and volumes, including ''Formal, Transcendental and Dialectical Thinking: Logic and Reality'' (1987).

===Critique of empiricism===

====Epistemological and methodological criticisms of empiricism====
Harris holds the epistemological position that philosophical [[empiricism]] was insuperably inconsistent in every version found in European thought from [[John Locke|Locke]] to the twentieth-century [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'' (1954), pp. 117-186, 274-351.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[verification principle]], upon which empiricism is grounded, is held by Harris to be intrinsically false because [[perception|sense perception]] is devoid of immediate [[self-evidence]], depending on an interpretative context that is a product of thinking's discursive activity. Furthermore, the verification principle is also unable to account for the empiricist epistemologist's claim to truth for his own doctrine. Empiricism's "fallacy" is that "of propounding a theory of knowledge from which, if it is true, the theorist himself must be exempt, and which, if it applies to the theorist himself, must be false".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Nor is empiricism able successfully to overcome the logical antinomies infecting the [[inductive reasoning|inductive method]], by which it usually tries to explain and justify the genesis and validity of the universal form of scientific theories. Finally, Harris argued that the [[hypothetico-deductive method]], which some empiricists such as [[Sir Karl Popper]] employ in order to overcome the shortcomings of the inductive method, is epistemologically unfruitful, owing to its merely analytic and conjectural nature.

====Theoretical and metaphysical criticisms of empiricism====
Harris does not limit himself to refuting empiricism in a purely logico-immanent way, but also argues that a careful examination of the [[theory|theoretical]] results achieved by contemporary [[physics]], [[biology]], and [[experimental psychology]], as well as of the procedures of scientific enquiry, reveals that empiricism is not even in harmony with the specific orientation of contemporary science. He concludes that science supports a world-view that is [[relativism|relativistic]], [[holism|holistic]], [[organicism|organicistic]], [[teleology|teleological]] and hierarchical in character—a world-view contradicted by  the unconfessed [[atomism|atomistic]], [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]], and [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] metaphysical presuppositions of [[formal logic|formal]] and [[mathematical logic]] that are wrongly privileged by philosophical empiricism.

===Philosophical historiography===

Harris maintains that the temporal variation of different metaphysical doctrines cannot be regarded as a procession of discontinuous, subjective opinions whose validity, at best, is confined to particular epochs. On the contrary, he asserts the existence of "eternal problems in philosophy" &lt;ref&gt;''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and conceives their historical development as a unique, logically necessary, teleological process through which they progressively achieve more coherent and adequate formulations. Philosophical historiography, therefore, should not simply confine itself to registering the external [[philology|philological]] characteristics of the doctrines under consideration without making [[value judgement]]s about them. Its peculiar task is rather that of discerning in them the [[Truth|true]] from the [[False (logic)|false]]. In his historiographical studies, Harris gives considerable attention to Spinoza's and Hegel's metaphysics.

====Substance and attributes in Spinoza====
By stressing the crucial relevance of Spinoza's doctrines of the infinity of the attribute of the ''cogitatio'', of the ''idea ideae'' and of the ''intellectus infinitus dei'' (the infinite mind of god) as an "infinite mode" of [[substance theory|substance]], Harris disputed what he saw as one-sided empiricist and [[materialism|materialistic]] interpretations of Spinoza's naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation from Despair'', pp.57, 87ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Spinoza's [[polemic]] against the [[final cause]]s ought to be understood as referring only to the standpoint of external teleology, and consequently that Spinoza does not exclude a valid explanation of natural processes in the light of an inner teleology.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation from Despair'', pp. 126-132.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Harris also rejects the opposite, [[mysticism|mystical]] or "acosmistic" interpretations of the relationship between substance and attributes, according to which substance would be undifferentiated and attributes would be nothing more than a contingent product of human intellect.  Harris on the contrary maintains that Spinoza's theory of the ''scientia intuitiva'' clearly shows that Spinoza consistently conceives of substance's self-identity as intrinsically differentiated into a rational system of "individual essences," and moreover that Spinoza's geometric method is simply the outward dress of an inferential procedure that is similar to dialectical method.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation from Despair'', pp. 49ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hegel's ''Naturphilosophie''====
Harris's interpretation of Hegel's philosophy—unlike that of most of Hegelian interpreters in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—emphasizes the crucial role of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' in Hegel's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'', pp. 241 -246.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the many philosophical developments which affected the theoretical underpinnings of the natural sciences in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Harris outlines a "reform" of Hegel's ''Naturphilosophie'' that rejects as obsolete at least three of its main contentions: (1) that the natural sciences are nothing more than the product of the finite intellect's analytic activity; (2) that it is impossible cogently to prove the coming-to-be in natural philosophy of a unitary process of real biological evolution; and (3) that the "bad infinity" of the spaciotemporal form of inorganic nature is clear evidence of its self-contradictoriness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} According to Harris, in fact, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], as well as the contemporary [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories of the "expanding universe", involve a plausible conception of the physical universe as a "finite but unbounded Whole," so that it can be safely regarded as an objective, natural embodiment of the ''infinitum actu'', or "true infinity," which Hegel had instead confined to the subjectivity of life and spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of Metaphysics in Science'', pp.41-63, 85-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harris's epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind===

Harris advocates the possibility of knowledge of [[objective truth]]; his criticism of the [[naïve realism]] of [[positivism|positivistic]] epistemology never takes the form of [[subjectivism]] or [[skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'', pp. 29-42&lt;/ref&gt;  For him truth is the apex of a teleological process, whose more abstract and elementary forms are the theoretical perspectives worked out by the natural and human sciences, while its most concrete, fully blown aspect coincides with the self-reflective activity of metaphysical thought. The elements of his metaphysics show the acknowledged influences of Spinoza's rationalistic [[monism]], Hegel's [[absolute idealism]], [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]]'s logic, and [[Harold Joachim|Joachim]]'s [[coherence theory of truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of Metaphysics in Science'', pp. 451-493.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

:"The philosophical theory demanded by the modern outlook must, accordingly, maintain five main theses: (i) that mind is immanent in all things; (ii) that reality is a whole, self-sufficient and self-maintaining, and that coherence is the test of truth of any theory about it; (iii) that the subject and object of knowledge are ultimately one – the same thing viewed from opposite (and mutually complementary) standpoints; (iv) that events and phenomena can adequately be explained only teleologically, and (v) that the ultimate principle of interpretation is, in consequence, the principle of value."&lt;ref&gt;''Nature, Mind and Modern Science'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Harris's view, the ultimate unity of the subject and object of knowledge means that [[reality]], which is the peculiar object of metaphysical thought, is identical with logical reason, which is the self-conscious act of systematic thought that thinks of reality. For Harris only [[dialectical logic]] can grasp the [[essence]] of such an identity. By sublating into the absolute idea the very negativity of finitude, appearance and error, only dialectical logic can disclose a logical universe that is not simply an aggregate of "bloodless categories,"but is rather a fully actual, self-sufficient and self-conscious Whole.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} As a consequence, Harris's metaphysics, like Hegel's, finally develops into a "logic of construction" and a [[panentheistic]] [[theology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

== Later Developments of Harris's Work ==
In 2017 James Schofield submitted his PhD thesis to the University of Canterbury titled 'Dialectical Holism: The Lost Metaphysics of E. E. Harris.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Schofield,|date=2017|title=Dialectical holism : the lost metaphysics of E. E. Harris.|url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/14560|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work he argued that Harris not only anticipated, but provided a metaphysical framework for unifying a range of current theories across the otherwise disparate special sciences of cosmology, systems biology, and consciousness studies. Perhaps the most important contention in this regard has been that Harris's work provides a neutral monist ontology for the philosophy of mind known as 'enactivism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Enactivism|date=2018-05-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enactivism&amp;oldid=842040659|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of '''Fascist ideology''' is long and it involves many sources. Fascists took inspiration from as far back as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. It has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences. In [[Italy]], Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a "high and noble" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a "parasitic" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its "myth of decadence", anti‐egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as "[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is essentially populist ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.  

Its relationship with other ideologies of its day were complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported limited private property rights and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by consolidating power with the state. They shared many goals with and often allied with the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often recruited from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional religion. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[Völkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative "national" socialism. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[classical liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[democratic socialism]].

[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Spartan Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]
Early influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]]. The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of [[Sparta]] under [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web| title = To what extent was Hitler's rule of Nazi Germany similar to life in Sparta?| url = https://www.academia.edu/4761037/To_what_extent_was_Hitlers_rule_of_Nazi_Germany_similar_to_life_in_Sparta| website = Academia | date = 2013| access-date = April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W.

[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), the book written by [[Thomas Hobbes]] that advocates [[absolute monarchy]]]]
There were a number of influences on fascism from the [[Renaissance]] era in Europe. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] is known to have influenced Italian Fascism, particularly his promotion of the absolute authority of the state.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705"/&gt; Machiavelli rejected all existing traditional and metaphysical assumptions of the time—especially those associated with the [[Middle Ages]]—and asserted as an Italian patriot that Italy needed a strong and all-powerful state led by a vigorous and ruthless leader who would conquer and unify Italy.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 706"&gt;Contemporary Political Theory: New Dimensions, Basic Concepts and Major Trends. 12th Edition. New Delhi, India: Sterling Publishers Private Ltd, 2007. Pp. 706.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini saw himself as a modern-day Machiavellian and wrote an introduction to his honorary doctoral thesis for the University of Bologna—"Prelude to Machiavelli".&lt;ref&gt;Benito Mussolini, "Prelude to Machiavelli," ''The Living Age'', Vol. 323, No. 4194, November 22, 1924. Originally published in the Italian journal ''Gerarchia'' in 1924, edited by Mussolini and Margherita Sarfatti). Mussolini's thesis was titled "Comments of the year 1924 on the Prince of Machiavelli," (University of Bologna, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini professed that Machiavelli's "pessimism about human nature was eternal in its acuity. Individuals simply could not be relied on voluntarily to 'obey the law, pay their taxes and serve in war'. No well-ordered society could want the people to be sovereign",&lt;ref&gt;(R.J.B. Bosworth, ''Mussolini'', Chapter Eight: Government 1922-24, Hodder Education, 2002, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Most dictators of the 20th century mimicked Mussolini's admiration for Machiavelli and "Stalin... saw himself as the embodiment of Machiavellian ''vertù''".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Stalin: A Biography'', UK, Macmillan Publishers, Ltd, 2004, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin was "very much influenced by [[The Prince]] as well, keeping a copy of it on his nightstand", as did Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Laura LeFae, "Political Philosophy: History Machiavelli Hitler Mussolini Fascism Socialism," ''Humanities 360o'', Nov. 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

English political theorist [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) created the ideology of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] that advocated an all-powerful [[absolute monarchy]] to maintain order within a state.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705"/&gt; Absolutism was an influence on fascism.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705"/&gt; Absolutism based its legitimacy on the precedents of Roman law including the centralized Roman state and the manifestation of Roman law in the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson. ''Lineages of the Absolutist State''. Verso Edition. New York, New York, USA: Verso, 1979. Pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Though fascism supported the absolute power of the state, it opposes the idea of absolute power being in the hands of a monarch and opposes the feudalism that was associated with absolute monarchies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], the creator of the concept of [[nationalism]]]]
During the Enlightenment, a number of ideological influences arose that would shape the development of fascism. The development of the study of universal histories by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] resulted in Herder's analysis of the development of nations, Herder developed the term ''Nationalismus'' ("nationalism") to describe this cultural phenomenon. At this time nationalism did not refer to the political ideology of nationalism that was later developed during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Motyl. ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism'', Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Herder also developed the theory that Europeans are the descendants of Indo-Aryan people based on language studies. Herder argued that the Germanic peoples held close racial connections with the ancient Indians and ancient Persians, who he claimed were advanced peoples possessing a great capacity for wisdom, nobility, restraint and science.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 62"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries of Herder utilized the concept of the Aryan race to draw a distinction between what they deemed "high and noble" Aryan culture versus that of "parasitic" Semitic culture and this anti-Semitic variant view of Europeans' Aryan roots formed the basis of Nazi racial views.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 62"/&gt; Another major influence on fascism came from the political theories of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705"/&gt; Hegel promoted the absolute authority of the state&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705"/&gt; and said "nothing short of the state is the actualization of freedom" and that the "state is the march of God on earth".&lt;ref name="Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 706"/&gt;

The French Revolution and its political legacy had a major influence upon the development of fascism. Fascists view the French Revolution as a largely negative event that resulted in the entrenchment of liberal ideas such as [[liberal democracy]], [[anticlericalism]] and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Opponents of the French Revolution initially were conservatives and reactionaries, but the Revolution was also later criticized by Marxists for its bourgeois character and racist nationalists who opposed its universalist principles.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Racist nationalists in particular condemned the French Revolution for granting social equality to "inferior races" such as [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Mussolini condemned the French Revolution for developing liberalism, [[scientific socialism]] and liberal democracy, but also acknowledged that fascism extracted and utilized all the elements that had preserved those ideologies' vitality and that fascism had no desire to restore the conditions that precipitated the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Though fascism opposed core parts of the Revolution, fascists supported other aspects of it, Mussolini declared his support for the Revolution's demolishment of remnants of the Middle Ages such as tolls and compulsory labour upon citizens and he noted that the French Revolution did have benefits in that it had been a cause of the whole French nation and not merely a political party.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Most importantly, the French Revolution was responsible for the entrenchment of nationalism as a political ideology – both in its development in France as [[French nationalism]] and in the creation of nationalist movements particularly in Germany with the development of [[German nationalism]] by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] as a political response to the development of French nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 342–343.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis accused the French Revolution of being dominated by Jews and [[Freemasons]] and were deeply disturbed by the Revolution's intention to completely break France away from its past history in what the Nazis claimed was a repudiation of history that they asserted to be a trait of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 257"/&gt; Though the Nazis were highly critical of the Revolution, Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' said that the French Revolution is a model for how to achieve change that he claims was caused by the rhetorical strength of demagogues.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 258"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Nazis idealized the ''[[levée en masse]]'' ([[mass mobilization]] of soldiers) that was developed by French Revolutionary armies and the Nazis sought to use the system for their paramilitary movement.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 258"/&gt;

===''Fin de siècle'' era and the fusion of nationalism with Sorelianism (1880–1914)===
{{Fin de siecle sidebar}}
The ideological roots of fascism have been traced to the 1880s and in particular the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' theme of that time.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 169"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought" in Griffin, Roger, ed., ''International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus'' (London and New York, 1998) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 23-24"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was based on revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought" in Griffin, Roger, ed., ''International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus'' (London and New York, 1998) p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' generation supported [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 24"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' mindset saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' intellectual school of the 1890s – including [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and [[Enrico Corradini]] in Italy; [[Maurice Barrès]], [[Edouard Drumont]] and [[Georges Sorel]] in France; and [[Paul de Lagarde]], [[Julius Langbehn]] and [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] in Germany – saw social and political collectivity as more important than [[individualism]] and rationalism. They considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as an atomized numerical sum of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; They saw modern society as one of mediocrity, materialism, instability, and corruption.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; They denounced big-city urban society as being merely based on instinct and animality and without heroism.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt;

The ''fin-de-siècle'' outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[biology]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] [[aesthetics]]; [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]]; [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s [[psychology]]; and the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought" in Griffin, Roger, ed., ''International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus'' (London and New York, 1998) p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social Darwinism]], which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the [[survival of the fittest]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race and environment.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism's emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered legitimacy and appeal for nationalism.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 29"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice, and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Nietzsche's argument that "God is dead" coincided with his attack on the "herd mentality" of [[Christianity]], democracy and modern collectivism; his concept of the ''[[übermensch]]''; and his advocacy of the [[will to power]] as a primordial instinct were major influences upon many of the ''fin-de-siècle'' generation.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 24-25"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson's claim of the existence of an "''élan vital''" or vital instinct centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism, thus challenged Marxism.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 25"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the Darwinian theory of evolution came claims of evolution possibly leading to decadence.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 30"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of decadence theories claimed that contemporary Western society's decadence was the result of modern life, including urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, the survival of the least fit and modern culture's emphasis on egalitarianism, individualistic anomie, and nonconformity.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 30"/&gt; The main work that gave rise to decadence theories was the work ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892) by [[Max Nordau]] that was popular in Europe, the ideas of decadence helped the cause of nationalists who presented nationalism as a cure for decadence.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 30"/&gt;

[[Gaetano Mosca]] in his work ''[[The Ruling Class (book, Mosca)|The Ruling Class]]'' (1896) developed the theory that claims that in all societies, an "organized minority" will dominate and rule over the "disorganized majority".&lt;ref name="William Outhwaite 2006. Pp. 442"&gt;William Outhwaite. ''The Blackwell dictionary of modern social thought''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2006. Pp. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy H. Koon 1943. Pp. 6"&gt;Tracy H. Koon. Believe, obey, fight: political socialization of youth in fascist Italy, 1922-1943. University of North Carolina Press, 1985. Pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca claims that there are only two classes in society, "the governing" (the organized minority) and "the governed" (the disorganized majority).&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12"&gt;Giuseppe Caforio. "Handbook of the sociology of the military", ''Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research''. New York, New York, USA: Springer, 2006. Pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12"/&gt; Mosca developed this theory in 1896 in which he argued that the problem of the supremacy of civilian power in society is solved in part by the presence and social structural design of militaries.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12"/&gt; He claims that the social structure of the military is ideal because it includes diverse social elements that balance each other out and more importantly is its inclusion of an officer class as a "power elite".&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12"/&gt; Mosca presented the social structure and methods of governance by the military as a valid model of development for civil society.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12"/&gt; Mosca's theories are known to have significantly influenced Mussolini's notion of the [[Political opportunity|political process]] and fascism.&lt;ref name="Tracy H. Koon 1943. Pp. 6"/&gt;

Related to Mosca's theory of domination of society by an organized minority over a disorganized majority was [[Robert Michels]]' theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] that has become a mainstream political theory.&lt;ref name="William Outhwaite 2006. Pp. 442"/&gt; The theory of the iron law of oligarchy, created in 1911 by Michels, was a major attack on the basis of contemporary democracy.&lt;ref name="James L. Hyland 1995. Pp. 247"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Michels argues that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy".&lt;ref name="James L. Hyland Pp. 247"&gt;James L. Hyland. Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims: "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy".&lt;ref name="James L. Hyland Pp. 247"/&gt; He states that the official goal of contemporary democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="James L. Hyland Pp. 247"/&gt; Michels had formerly been a Marxist, but became drawn to the syndicalism of [[Georges Sorel]], [[Édouard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]] and [[Enrico Leone (economist)|Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed the parliamentarian, legalistic and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 418"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, both Michels and Olivetti "conceived Italy's [[proletarian nation | proletarian nationalism]] to be revolutionary, indeed, Marxist in essence".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The early revolutionary syndicalists, including Michels, realized that proletarian internationalism did not suggest an "abandonment on part of the workers class of its national sentiment nor a neglect of national interest".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Under this interpretation, to be in compliance with Marx's theories for economic development, viewed as "the prerequisite of socialist revolution", the proletarian class required not only "national independence", but some sort of commitment "to a program of nationalism", a movement which Mussolini later referred to as proletarian nationalism&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John F. Pollard]], ''The Fascist Experience in Italy'', Routledge, 1998, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 418-419"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 418-419.&lt;/ref&gt; According to fascist intellectuals, the proletarian nations of National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy were to advance a socioeconomic and nationalist structure, designed to avoid the economic collapse experienced by Lenin's Russia that would "integrate the class into the nation through the nationalization of the masses".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, ''Fascism'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Such a social nationalistic framework was expected to "provide the basis for social justice" wherein "the state is to belong to all classes and will unite the nation with socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, ''Fascism'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Pp. 87-90&lt;/ref&gt; Barrès claimed that authoritarian democracy involved spiritual connection between a leader of a nation and the nation's people, and that true freedom did not arise from individual rights nor parliamentary restraints, but through "heroic leadership" and "national power".&lt;ref name="Soucy"/&gt; He emphasized the need for [[Cult of personality|hero worship]] and charismatic leadership in national society.&lt;ref name="Stanley G.

The rise of support for [[anarchism]] in this period of time was important in influencing the politics of fascism.&lt;ref name="Stuart Joseph Woolf 1970. Pp. 282"&gt;Stuart Joseph Woolf. European fascism. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1970. Pp. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s concept of [[propaganda of the deed]] that stressed the importance of [[direct action]] as the primary means of politics—including revolutionary violence—became popular amongst fascists who admired the concept and adopted it as a part of fascism.&lt;ref name="Stuart Joseph Woolf 1970.

One of the key persons who greatly influenced fascism, the French revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]] was greatly influenced by anarchism and contributed to the fusion of anarchism and syndicalism together into [[anarcho syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 1939.

Pp. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel promoted the legitimacy of [[political violence]] in his work ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a [[general strike]].&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 1939.

Avant-garde fascism: the mobilization of myth, art, and culture in France, 1909-1939. Duke University Press, 2007. Pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying "nothing is more aristocratic than democracy".&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 1939. Pp. 77"&gt;Mark Antliff. Avant-garde fascism: the mobilization of myth, art, and culture in France, 1909-1939. Duke University Press, 2007. Pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909 after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views – advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 1939. Pp. 82"&gt;Mark Antliff. Avant-garde fascism: the mobilization of myth, art, and culture in France, 1909-1939. Duke University Press, 2007. Pp. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Sorel had officially been a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that "socialism is dead" due to the "decomposition of Marxism".&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel became a supporter of reactionary [[Maurrassisme|Maurrassian]] [[integral nationalism]] beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78"/&gt; French right-wing monarchist and nationalist [[Charles Maurras]] held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] [[syndicalism]] as a means to confront [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;name="revolution1994"&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution''. Princeton, New Jersey, US: Princeton University Press, 1994.

Nonetheless, despite his support for a radical nationalism and his retreat from classical Marxism, Sorel was an early supporter of the Russian October Revolution, where "his final ideological incarnation appeared to be a Bolshevist".&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Werner Müller, ''Contesting Democracy: Political Ideas in Twentieth-Century Europe'', Yale University Press, 2011, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, Sorel called Lenin "the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sorel, "For Lenin," ''Soviet Russia'', Official Organ of The [[Russian Soviet Government Bureau]], Vol. II, New York: NY, January-June 1920 (April 10, 1920) p. 356 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgkEAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=sorel%20%22the%20greatest%20theoretician%20of%20socialism%20since%20Marx%22&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q=sorel%20%22the%20greatest%20theoretician%20of%20socialism%20since%20Marx%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; For years Sorel wrote numerous articles for Italian newspapers defending the Bolsheviks in their revolutionary efforts to socialize Russia. Around this time, Mussolini applauded Sorel by declaring: "What I am, I owe to Sorel". In return, Sorel lauded Mussolini in 1921 by calling the leader of Italy's Fascist party "a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He, too, is a political genius, of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day, with the only exception of Lenin".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Leib Talmon, ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution'', University of California Press, 1981, p. 451.

''Propos de Georges Sorel'', is a collection of Sorel's pronouncements published in Paris, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]].&lt;ref name=zs163&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Corradini spoke of the need for a [[National syndicalism|nationalist-syndicalist]] movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight.&lt;ref name=zs163/&gt; Corradini spoke of Italy as being a "[[proletarian nation]]" that needed to pursue [[imperialism]] in order to challenge the "[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]" French and British.&lt;ref name=mb9&gt;Blinkhorn, Martin, ''Mussolini and Fascist Italy''. 2nd ed. (New York: Routledge, 2003) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption in its political class, [[liberalism]], and division caused by "ignoble socialism".&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; The ANI held ties and influence among [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics, and the business community.&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, [[democracy]], liberalism, [[Marxism]], [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and [[pacifism]] and the promotion of [[heroism]], [[vitalism]] and violence.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 32"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manifesto of Futurism.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908) and later the co-author of the ''[[Fascist Manifesto]]'' (1919)]]
Radical nationalism in Italy—support for expansionism and cultural revolution to create a "New Man" and a "New State"—began to grow in 1912 during the Italian conquest of [[Libya]] and was supported by Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and members of the ANI.&lt;ref name="Gentile, Emilio 2003 p. 5"&gt;Gentile, Emilio, The Struggle for Modernity: Nationalism, Futurism, and Fascism (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers, 2003) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism that was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] who founded the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy for based on majority rule and egalitarianism while promoting a new form of democracy, that he described in his work "The Futurist Conception of Democracy" as the following: "We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers, to quantity, to the mass, for with us number, quantity and mass will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive".&lt;ref name="Andrew Hewitt 1993. Pp. 153"&gt;Andrew Hewitt. Fascist modernism: aesthetics, politics, and the avant-garde. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1993. Pp. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world and advocated a strong state and [[imperialism]], claiming that humans are naturally predatory and that nations were in a constant struggle, in which only the strongest could survive.&lt;ref name="Gentile, Emilio 2003 p. 6"&gt;Gentile, Emilio, The Struggle for Modernity: Nationalism, Futurism, and Fascism (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers, 2003) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1914, Italian nationalists and revolutionary syndicalists with nationalist leanings remained apart. Such syndicalists opposed the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911 as an affair of financial interests and not the nation, but World War I was seen by both Italian nationalists and syndicalists as a national affair.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 170"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 170 and 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and aftermath (1914–1922)===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] opposed the war on the grounds of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported intervention against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their [[reactionary]] regimes needed to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.&lt;ref name=zs175&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Corradini presented the same need for Italy as a "proletarian nation" to defeat a reactionary Germany from a nationalist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. pp. 173, 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of fascism resulted from this split, with [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]] forming the Revolutionary Fascio for International Action in October 1914.&lt;ref name=zs175/&gt; At the same time, Benito Mussolini joined the interventionist cause.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists supported nationalism and claimed that [[proletarian internationalism]] was a failure.

At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was very small. Its attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and it was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Gregor. ''Young Mussolini and the intellectual origins of fascism''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, US; London, England, UK: University of California Press, 1979. pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Antagonism between interventionists—including Fascists—and anti-interventionist socialists resulted in violence.&lt;ref name=ajg196&gt;Anthony James Gregor. ''Young Mussolini and the intellectual origins of fascism''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, US; London, England, UK: University of California Press, 1979. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on interventionists were so violent that even democratic socialists who opposed the war, such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]], said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in its campaign to silence supporters of the war.&lt;ref name=ajg196/&gt;

Italy's use of daredevil elite [[shock troops]] known as the ''[[Arditi]]'', beginning in 1917, was an important influence on Fascism.&lt;ref name=rg207&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Fascism and culture. London, England, UK; New York, New York, US: Routledge, 2004. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arditi'' were soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms and fezzes.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt; The ''Arditi'' formed a national organization in November 1918, the ''Associazione fra gli Arditi d'Italia'', which by mid-1919 had about twenty thousand young men within it.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt; Mussolini appealed to the ''Arditi'' and the Fascists' ''[[Squadristi]]'' developed after the war were based upon the ''Arditi''.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt;

[[File:Red Guard Vulkan factory.jpg|thumb|300px|Russian Bolsheviks shortly after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, whom Italian Fascists initially praised, but by 1919 had become violently anti-Bolshevik and Fascists politically benefited from fear of communist revolution by promising themselves as a radical alternative that would forcibly stop communist class revolution and resolve class differences]]
A major event that greatly influenced the development of fascism was the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in which [[Bolshevik]] communists led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] seized power in Russia.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Mussolini as leader of the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasci of Revolutionary Action]] praised the [[October Revolution]], but Mussolini later became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas.&lt;ref name="Peter Neville 2004. Pp. 36"&gt;Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. Pp. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, fascists have commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; Nonetheless, Mussolini during his [[Fascist Revolutionary Party]] (PFR) leadership determined that [[War communism|War Communism]] was leading to economic collapse instead of a productive proletarian state. Reversing his position, Mussolini criticized Lenin's actions for failing to uphold Marxist principles, writing that his colleague was "'the very negation of socialism' because he had not created a dictatorship of the proletariat or of the socialist party, but only of a few intellectuals who had found the secret of winning power".&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', New York: NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 41, original source: ''Opera omina di Benito Mussolini'', ed. E. and D. Susmel, Florence, 1951-, 13/168 (4 June 1919), ''Opera omina di Benito Mussolini'', ed. E. and D. Susmel, Florence, 1951-, 15/220 (20 Sept. 1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, both Bolshevism and fascism hold ideological similarities: both advocate a revolutionary ideology, both believe in the necessity of a vanguard elite, both have disdain for bourgeois values and both had totalitarian ambitions.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; In practice, fascism and Bolshevism have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; The former Prime Minister of Italy [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] observed the same Bolshevik-Fascist parallels in 1927, writing that under Mussolini's regime there is a "greater tolerance" displayed "toward Communists affiliated with Moscow than to Liberals, democrats, and Socialists".&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Saverio Nitti]], Bolshevism, Fascism and Democracy, translated by Margaret M. Green, London: UK, George Allen &amp; Unwin, LTD., 1927, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini had become well verse in Marxism after being tutored by [[Angelica Balabanoff]] and associating with [[Leon Trotsky]] and Lenin during his stay in Switzerland from 1902 to 1904.&lt;ref&gt; L. Kemechey, ''Il Duce: The Life and Work of Benito Mussolini'', New York: NY, Richard R. Smith, 1930, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism'', New York, NY, The Free Press, 1969, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Mussolini briefly referred to himself as the "Lenin of Italy" during the 1919 election,&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Modern Italy: A Political History'', University of Michigan Press, 1997, first publish in 1959, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; where his Fascist Revolutionary Party attempted to "out-socialist the socialists".&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Modern Italy: A Political History'', University of Michigan Press, 1997, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement in 1919 with the founding of the ''[[Fasci italiani di combattimento]]'', whose opposition to non-nationalistic socialism he declared:

{{quote|We declare war against socialism, not because it is socialism, but because it has opposed nationalism.

Van Nostrand Company, 1964, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This about-face with orthodox socialists lead Mussolini and the Fascists to ally with various industrial businesses and to attack Socialist Party activists and labor organizers in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Cristogianni Borsella, Adolph Caso. ''Fascist Italy: A Concise Historical Narrative''. Wellesley, Massachusetts, US: Branden Books, 2007. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Mussolini, who often played both sides to increase his political influence, had issued an open threat in 1921 that if the Italian government attempted to suppress the Fascists, he "might move to the other extreme and join the communists in revolutionary action".&lt;ref&gt; Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', Vintage Book, 1983, p 47&lt;/ref&gt; In his book 1927 book, ''Bolshevism, Fascism and Democracy'', Francesco Saverio Nitti observed that Mussolini was simply cloaking his true Bolshevik leanings since he had "always retained a great admiration for Bolshevism, though he presented himself to the public as an antidote to Bolshevism".&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Saverio Nitti, ''Bolshevism, Fascism and Democracy'', translated by Margaret M. Green, London: UK, George Allen &amp; Unwin, LTD., 1927, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascists identified their primary opponents as the socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I.&lt;ref name=zs189/&gt; The Fascists and the rest of the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites.&lt;ref name=zs193&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.&lt;ref name=zs193/&gt; In 1921, Mussolini joined a political alliance with [[Giovanni Giolitti]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's Prime Minister and leader of the [[Italian Liberal Party]] who was considered a left-wing liberal,&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt G. Barański and Rebecca J. West, editors, ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Italian Culture'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; due to his progressive social reforms and his nationalization of the private telephone and railroad operators. This alliance with the liberals and others helped Mussolini acquire authority, respectability and "freedom from arrest". In July 1921, Mussolini suggested a different coalition that would include fascists, socialists and ''populari''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Called the "[[Pact of Pacification]]", Mussolini signed the agreement with the Italian Socialist Party on 2 or 3 August 1921, but it was both unpopular and short-lived.&lt;ref&gt; Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914-1945'', Madison: WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for Mussolini’s signing of a peace pact with the Italian Socialist Party was his aspiration to rename his party the “Fascist Labor Party” and avoid the possibility of taking a “categorically antileftist position”.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism'', 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the Third Fascist Congress in Rome on 7–10 November 1921 his traditional faction of [[syndicalism| revolutionary syndicalists]] and national socialists was outvoted by the new majority of ''[[Squadrismo|squadristi]]'' leaders, who pressured Mussolini to rename the party the [[National Fascist Party]] and to reorganize as an “association of the ''fasci'' and their storm squads”.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Delzell, edit., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945'', New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922–1925, Fascism sought to accommodate the Italian Liberal Party, conservatives and nationalists under Italy's coalition government, where major alterations to its political agenda were made—alterations such as abandoning its previous populism, republicanism and anticlericalism—and adopting policies of [[economic liberalism]] under [[Alberto De Stefani]], a Center Party member who was Italy's Minister of Finance until dismissed by Mussolini after the imposition of a single-party dictatorship in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard M. Sachar]], ''The Assassination of Europe 1918-1942: A Political History'', University Press of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime also accepted the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the monarchy as institutions in Italy.&lt;ref name=ga145&gt;De Grand, Alexander. ''Italian fascism: its origins and development''. 3rd ed. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including promotion policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. In an effort to expand Italy's population to facilitate Mussolini's future plans to control the Mediterranean region, the Fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.&lt;ref&gt;Fascists and conservatives: the radical right and the establishment in twentieth-century Europe. Routdlege, 1990. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Fascism adopted a number of positions designed to appeal to [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying that "Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The birth of fascist ideology: from cultural rebellion to political revolution''. Princeton University Press, 1994. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn. ''Fascists and Conservatives''. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2001 p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Fascism's accommodation of the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.&lt;ref&gt;Cristogianni Borsella, Adolph Caso. ''Fascist Italy: A Concise Historical Narrative''. Wellesley, Massachusetts, US: Branden Books, 2007. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Cristogianni Borsella, Adolph Caso. ''Fascist Italy: A Concise Historical Narrative''. Wellesley, Massachusetts, US: Branden Books, 2007. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to power and initial international spread of fascism (1922–1929)===
Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several cities, including [[Bologna]], [[Bolzano]], [[Cremona]], [[Ferrara]], [[Fiume]] and [[Trento|Trent]].&lt;ref name=rop87&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. New York, New York, US; Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Random House, Inc., 2005 p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Benito Mussolini]] (centre in suit with fists against body) along with other Fascist leader figures and [[Blackshirts]] during the [[March on Rome]]]]
On 24 October 1922, the Fascist Party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; The march would be led by four prominent Fascist leaders representing its different factions: [[Italo Balbo]], a Blackshirt leader; General [[Emilio De Bono]]; [[Michele Bianchi]], an ex syndicalist; and [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]], a monarchist Fascist.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; Mussolini himself remained in Milan to await the results of the actions.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.&lt;ref name=rop88&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. New York, New York, US; Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Random House, Inc., 2005 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian government had been in a steady state of turmoil, with many governments being created and then being defeated.&lt;ref name=rop88/&gt; The Italian government initially took action to prevent the Fascists from entering Rome, but King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.&lt;ref name=rop90&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. New York, New York, US; Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Random House, Inc., 2005 p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Some political organizations, such as the conservative [[Italian Nationalist Association]], “assured King Victor Emmanuel that their own Sempre Pronti militia was ready to fight the Blackshirts” if they entered Rome, but their offer was never accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1943, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995,  p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.&lt;ref name=rop90/&gt; Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as "[[March on Rome]]", as a "seizure" of power due to Fascists' heroic exploits.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament.&lt;ref name=sgp110&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition government included a cabinet led by Mussolini and thirteen other ministers, only three of whom were Fascists, while others included representatives from the army and the navy, two Catholic Popolari members, two [[Liberal democracy|democratic liberals]], one [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]], one [[Social democracy|social democrat]], one Nationalist member and the pro-Fascist philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]],&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; who held substantial “sympathy for the neo-Hegelian Marxist intellectual tradition”.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''The Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time,'' New Brunswick, NJ, Transaction Publishing, 2009, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies under the direction of liberal finance minister [[Alberto De Stefani]] from the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; Initially little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions against communist and [[Gabriele d'Annunzio|d'Annunzian]] rebels were limited.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; At the same time, Mussolini consolidated his control over the National Fascist Party by creating a governing executive for the party, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], whose agenda he controlled.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; In addition, the ''squadristi'' blackshirt militia was transformed into the state-run [[Blackshirts|MVSN]], led by regular army officers.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; Militant ''squadristi'' were initially highly dissatisfied with Mussolini's government and demanded a "Fascist revolution".&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt;

In this period, to appease the King of Italy, Mussolini formed a close political alliance between the Italian Fascists and Italy's conservative faction in Parliament, which was led by [[Luigi Federzoni]], a conservative [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and nationalist who was a member of the Italian Nationalist Association (ANI).&lt;ref&gt;De Grand, Alexander. ''Italian fascism: its origins and development''. 3rd ed. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. pp. 45, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The ANI joined the National Fascist Party in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;De Grand, Alexander. ''Italian fascism: its origins and development''. 3rd ed. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the merger of the Nationalists with the Fascists, tensions existed between the conservative nationalist and revolutionary syndicalist factions of the movement.&lt;ref name=rs21&gt;Roland Sarti. "Italian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals". ''Fascists and Conservatives''. Ed. Martin Blinkhorn. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2001 p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative and syndicalist factions of the Fascist movement sought to reconcile their differences, secure unity and promote fascism by taking on the views of each other.&lt;ref name=rs22&gt;Roland Sarti. "Italian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals". ''Fascists and Conservatives''. Ed. Martin Blinkhorn. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2001 p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative nationalist Fascists promoted fascism as a revolutionary movement to appease the revolutionary syndicalists, while to appease conservative nationalist fascists revolutionary syndicalist Fascists declared they wanted to secure social stability and insure economic productivity.&lt;ref name=rs22/&gt; This sentiment included most syndicalist Fascists, particularly [[Edmondo Rossoni]], who as secretary-general of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations sought “labor’s autonomy and class consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979 pp. 289-290&lt;/ref&gt; After he returned to Italy to fight in World War I, Rossoni promoted a labor movement that favored “fusing nationalism with class struggle”.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the [[Acerbo Law]], which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote.&lt;ref name=sgp113&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The Acerbo Law was passed in spite of numerous abstentions from the vote.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; In the 1924 election, the Fascists, along with moderates and conservatives, formed a coalition candidate list and through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation the list won with 66% of the vote, allowing it to receive 403 seats, most of which went to the Fascists.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy [[Giacomo Matteoti]] was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]].&lt;ref name=sgp114&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but he insisted that he had done nothing wrong and proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.&lt;ref name=sgp114/&gt; From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King. Efforts to fascistize Italian society accelerated beginning in 1926, with Fascists taking positions in local administration and 30% of all prefects being administered by appointed Fascists by 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Fascist regime gained the political support and blessing of the Roman Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Fascist propaganda had begun to speak of the new regime as an all-encompassing "[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]" state beginning in 1925, the Fascist Party and regime never gained total control over Italy's institutions. King Victor Emmanuel III remained head of state, the armed forces and the judicial system retained considerable autonomy from the Fascist state, Fascist militias were under military control and initially the economy had relative autonomy as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fascist regime began to create a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the [[Palazzo Vidioni Pact]], in which the Italian employers' association [[Confindustria]] and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions.&lt;ref name=cb150&gt;Cyprian Blamires, Paul Jackson. ''World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California, US: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, nationalized all independent trade unions, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the [[Labour Charter of 1927|Charter of Labour]], which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt; In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime and employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt;

In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of [[Corfu]], aims to expand Italian territory in the [[Balkans]], plans to wage war against [[Turkey]] and [[Yugoslavia]], attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention and making [[Albania]] a ''[[de facto]]'' [[protectorate]] of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A.

London, England, UK: Routledge, 2000. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to revolt in the Italian colony of [[Libya]], Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the "inferior" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.&lt;ref name=aaa134&gt;Ali Abdullatif Ahmida.

===International surge of fascism and World War II (1929–1945)===
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|Benito Mussolini (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]
The events of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important{{According to whom|date=July 2017}} new fascist regime was [[Nazi Germany]], under the leadership of [[Adolf Hitler]]. With the rise of Hitler and the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in [[Germany]] and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial laws]] that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised and persecuted Jews and other racial minority groups. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula Gömbös]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and visited Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in order to consolidate good relations with the two regimes. He attempted to entrench his [[Party of National Unity (Hungary)|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country; created an eight-hour work day and a forty-eight-hour work week in industry and sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital Printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; The fascist [[Iron Guard]] movement in [[Romania]] soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister [[Ion Duca]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914–1945''. Digital Printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. pp. 282–288.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], [[France]] faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the [[Dreyfus Affair]] when the fascist [[Mouvement Franciste|Francist Movement]] and multiple far right movements rioted ''[[en masse]]'' in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Joseph Woolf. ''Fascism in Europe''. 3rd Edition. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1983.

Fascism also expanded its influence outside [[Europe]], especially in [[East Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[South America]]. In [[China]], [[Wang Jingwei]]'s ''Kai-tsu p'ai'' (Reorganization) faction of the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party of China) supported [[Nazism]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Dongyoun Hwang.

The [[Al-Muthanna Club]] of [[Iraq]] was a [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] movement that supported Nazism and exercised its influence in the Iraqi government through cabinet minister [[Saib Shawkat]] who formed a [[paramilitary]] youth movement.&lt;ref&gt;I.

During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy and denounced the contemporary "[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]" that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure due to its alleged [[decadence]], support for unlimited [[consumerism]] and intention to create the "standardization of humankind".&lt;ref name=gb2000&gt;Günter Berghaus.

From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy invaded [[Ethiopia]] in 1935, resulting in condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain, demanding the immediate concession of [[Corsica]] and [[Tunisia]] from France, a secondary set of objectives including the Italian acquisition of [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] from Britain and a tertiary set of objectives including the long-term goals of eventual Italian control over [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Suez Canal]] – considered by the Fascist government to be the "keys to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]".&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006 Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Germany prepared for war with [[Poland]], but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means. Germany demanded that Poland accept the annexation of the [[Free City of Danzig]] to Germany and authorize the construction of automobile highways from Germany through the [[Polish Corridor]] into Danzig and [[East Prussia]] in order to unite the infrastructure of Germany, Danzig and East Prussia. While aside from Germany's use of the highways, these territories would remain under Polish jurisdiction and a promised twenty-five year non-aggression pact.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson Pp. 371-372"&gt;Eugene Davidson. ''The Unmaking of Adolf Hitler''. Columbia, Missouri, USA: University of Missouri Press, 2004 Pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson Pp. 371-372"/&gt; With the strategic alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union against Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union planned to invade Poland in 1939 unless Poland conceded to German demands by 1 September 1939, but Poland refused, Germany invaded and was followed by a Soviet invasion of Poland.

The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Poland between them in late 1939 followed by the successful German offensive in [[Scandinavia]] and continental [[Western Europe]] in 1940. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini led Italy into [[World War II]] on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with [[France]] or the [[United Kingdom]] and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox.

Pp. 122-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.

After 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.

On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans who had his body and those of others executed displayed on a meat hook in front of crowds who celebrated his execution. On 30 April 1945, with the [[Battle of Berlin]] between collapsing German forces and Soviet armed forces, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was dismantled and key Nazi members arrested to stand trial for [[crimes against humanity]] involving the Holocaust.

[[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Greece]] and [[Ethiopia]] requested the [[extradition]] of 1,200 Italian war criminals, but these people never saw anything like the Nuremberg trials since the British government, with the beginning of [[Cold War]], saw in [[Pietro Badoglio]] a guarantee of an [[anti-communist]] post-war [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="pedaliu"&gt;[[Effie G.

===Fascism, neofascism and postfascism after World War II (1945–present)===
[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Juan Perón]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy]]
In the aftermath of World War II, the victory of the Allies over the Axis powers led to the collapse of multiple fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted multiple Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained multiple ideologies and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.

[[Francisco Franco]]'s quasi-fascist [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with Western powers during the early years of the Cold War until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.
 
[[Peronism]], which is associated with the regime of [[Juan Peron]] in [[Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was strongly influenced by fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to rising to power, from 1939 to 1941 Peron had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist economic policies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512" /&gt;

The South African government of Afrikaner nationalist and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Daniel François Malan]] was closely associated with pro-fascist and pro-Nazi politics.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. Pp. 338"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A history of fascism, 1914-1945. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995. Pp. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Malan's Purified National Party, the South African Fascists and the Blackshirts agreed to form a coalition for the South African election.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. Pp. 338" /&gt; Malan had fiercely opposed South Africa's participation on the Allied side in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The Nature of Fascism''. New York, New York, USA: St. Martin's Press, 1991. Pp. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Malan's government founded [[apartheid]], the system of [[racial segregation]] of whites and non-whites in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. Pp. 338" /&gt; The most extreme Afrikaner fascist movement is the neo-Nazi white supremacist [[Afrikaner Resistance Movement]] (AWB) that at one point was recorded in 1991 to have 50,000 supporters with rising support.&lt;ref name="Roger Griffin 1991. Pp. 160"&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The Nature of Fascism''. New York, New York, USA: St. Martin's Press, 1991. Pp. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The AWB grew in support in response to efforts to dismantle apartheid in the 1980s and early 1990s and its paramilitary wing the [[Storm Falcons]] threatened violence against people it considered "trouble makers".&lt;ref name="Roger Griffin 1991. Pp. 160" /&gt;

[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ba'ath Party]] founder [[Michel Aflaq]] (left) with Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] (right) in 1988, as both of Ba'athism's key ideologists [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] were directly inspired by Fascism and Nazism]]
Another ideology strongly influenced by fascism is [[Ba'athism]].&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Ba'athism is a revolutionary [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] ideology that seeks the unification of all claimed Arab lands into a single Arab state.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt; [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], one of the principal founders of Ba'athism, was strongly influenced by and supportive of Fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Michel (1971). ''People and Politics in the Middle East''. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87855-500-5}}. Pp. 132-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Several close associates of Ba'athism's key ideologist [[Michel Aflaq]] have admitted that Aflaq had been directly inspired by certain fascist and Nazi theorists.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt; Ba'athist regimes in power in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] have held strong similarities to fascism, they are radical authoritarian nationalist one-party states.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt; Due to Ba'athism's anti-Western stances it preferred the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] and admired and adopted certain Soviet organizational structures for their governments, but the Ba'athist regimes have persecuted communists.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt; Like fascist regimes, Ba'athism became heavily militarized in power.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt; Ba'athist movements governed Iraq in 1963 and again from 1968 to 2003 and in Syria from 1963 to the present. Ba'athist heads of state such as [[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] created [[personality cult]]s around themselves portraying themselves as the nationalist saviours of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84"/&gt;

[[Ba'athist Iraq]] under Saddam Hussein pursued [[ethnic cleansing]] or the liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an [[Iraqi nationalism]] that emphasized Iraq's connection to the glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 517"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian on fascism [[Stanley Payne]] has said about Saddam Hussein's regime: "There will probably never again be a reproduction of the Third Reich, but Saddam Hussein has come closer than any other dictator since 1945".&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 517"/&gt;

In the 1990s, Payne claimed that a prominent [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] movement ''[[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]'' (RSS) holds strong resemblances to fascism—including its use of paramilitaries and its [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims—calling for the creation of a [[Greater India]].&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 518"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprian Blamires in ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'' describes the ideology of the RSS as "fascism with Sanskrit characters" – a unique Indian variant of fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 333"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires notes that there is evidence that the RSS held direct contact with Italy's Fascist regime and admired European fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 333"/&gt; a view with some support from [[A. James Gregor]].&lt;ref name="Anthony James Gregor 2006, page 201"&gt;[[A. James Gregor|Gregor, Anthony James]] ''The Search for Neofascism: The Use And Abuse of Social Science'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views have met wide criticism,&lt;ref name="Anthony James Gregor 2006, page 201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Brass 2002"&gt;Brass, Paul ''Competing Nationalisms in South Asia:Essays for Asghar Ali Engineer'' (Hyderabad, India: Orient Blackswan, 2002) p.15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Connerney 2009"&gt;Connerney, Richard D., ''The Upside-Down Tree:India's Changing Culture'' (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2009) p 154-158&lt;/ref&gt; especially from academics specializing [[Politics in India|Indian politics]]. [[Paul Brass]], expert on Hindu-Muslim violence, notes that there are many problems with accepting this point of view and identified four reasons that it is difficult to define the Sangh as fascist. Firstly, most scholars of the field do not subscribe to the view the RSS is fascist, notably among them [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],&lt;ref name="Paul Brass 2002"/&gt; [[A. James Gregor]]&lt;ref name="Anthony James Gregor 2006, page 201"/&gt; and Chetan Bhatt.&lt;ref name="Chetan Bhatt 2001, page 124"&gt;Bhatt, Chetan ''Hindu Nationalism: Origins, Ideologies and Modern Myths'' (Oxford, UK: Berg Publishers, 2001) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The other reasons include an absence of charismatic leadership, a desire on the part of the RSS to differentiate itself from European fascism, major cultural differences between the RSS and European fascists and factionalism within the [[Sangh Parivar]].&lt;ref name="Paul Brass 2002"/&gt; [[Stanley Payne]] claims that it also has substantial differences with fascism such as its emphasis on traditional religion as the basis of identity.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. p. 517-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism's relationship with other political and economic ideologies==
Mussolini saw fascism as opposing [[socialism]] and left-wing ideologies: "If it is admitted that the nineteenth century has been the century of Socialism, Liberalism and Democracy, it does not follow that the twentieth must also be the century of Liberalism, Socialism and Democracy. Political doctrines pass; peoples remain. It is to be expected that this century may be that of authority, a century of the 'Right,' a Fascist century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/europe/duce.html Benito Mussolini, Doctrine of Fascism (1932).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Capitalism===
Fascism has had complicated relations regarding capitalism, which changed over time and differed between Fascist states. Fascists commonly have sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism to the state.&lt;ref name="comparison1980"&gt;Payne, Stanley G., Fascism: Comparison and Definition. (Madison, Wisconsin; London: University of Wisconsin Press, 1980) p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists support the state having control over the economy, although they support the existence of [[private property]].&lt;ref name="interpretations1978"&gt;Walter Laqueur, editor, Fascism - A Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography, paperback (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978) p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; When fascists have criticized capitalism, they have focused their attacks on "[[finance capitalism]]", the international nature of banks and the [[stock exchange]] and its [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, editor, Fascism - A Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography, paperback (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978) pp. 20, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Under fascism, the [[profit motive]] continues to be the primary motivation of contributors to the economy.&lt;ref name="interpretations1978"/&gt; That policy abruptly changed in Italy by 1934 when Mussolini "reiterated that capitalism, as an economic system, was no longer viable".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism'', New York: NY, The Free Press, 1969, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini went so far as to proclaim that the economy of Fascist Italy was to be "based not on individual profit but on collective interest".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván Tibor Berend]], ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe: Economic Regimes from Laissez-Faire to Globalization'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, first published in 2006, pp. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Fascists theoreticians supported limited private property, individual initiative and [[market economy]] because it was—as expounded by [[Sergio Panunzio]], a major theoretician of Italian Fascism-- "the only economic system that allowed a socialism for the entire nation" since it was believed to encourage "productionism".&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Most Fascist theoreticians and revolutionary syndicalists followed [[Karl Marx]]'s admonition that a nation required "full maturation of capitalism as the precondition for socialist realization".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist intellectuals were determined to foster economic development in order for a syndicalist economy to "attain its productive maximum" that was identified as crucial to "socialist revolution".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism's position towards capitalism adjusted over time, as the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 was radical and anti-capitalist, where he continued to campaign for "nationalization of land" and to have "workers' participation in the running of factories",&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', University of Michigan Press, 1983, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; but became more moderate in the 1920s when it sought to consolidate power, allied with the ''squadrismo'' and then grew more radical again during the 1930s under its entrenchment of power and by 1940 again emphasized anti-capitalism.

Mussolini praised the historic developments of "[[heroic capitalism]]" – what Mussolini considered the first stage of capitalism, which he found had provided useful economic developments, but he claimed that capitalism had deteriorated, and criticized the contemporary stage of capitalism that he termed "[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]". He argued: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not intend to defend capitalism or capitalists. They, like everything human, have their defects. I only say their possibilities of usefulness are not ended. Capitalism has borne the monstrous burden of the war and today still has the strength to shoulder the burdens of peace. ... It is not simply and solely an accumulation of wealth, it is an elaboration, a selection, a co-ordination of values which is the work of centuries. ... Many think, and I myself am one of them, that capitalism is scarcely at the beginning of its story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3icI7NLox4EC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=As%20We%20go%20Marching&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "As We Go Marching" By John Thomas Flynn. page 49]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Years later in a 14 November 1933 speech, Mussolini decidedly rebuked [[economic liberalism]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''. In the United States, the ''Hearst Press'' printed his speech under the headline: "Mussolini Abolishes the Capitalist System".&lt;ref&gt; [[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''Under the Axe of Fascism'', London, UK, Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1936, pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To-day we can affirm that the capitalistic method of production is out of date. So is the doctrine of ''laissez-faire'', the theoretical basis of capitalism… To-day we are taking a new and decisive step in the path of revolution. A revolution, in order to be great, must be a social revolution.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''Under the Axe of Fascism'', London, UK, Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1936, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Mussolini, the capitalism of his time had degenerated from original capitalism, which he called dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830–1870) to static capitalism (1870–1914) and then finally to [[Decadence|decadent]] capitalism or supercapitalism, which began in 1914.&lt;ref name="Falasca"&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Mussolini, amid the [[Great Depression]], announced that modern supercapitalism was a failed economic system that was the result of the long-term degeneration of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;name="Falasca"&gt;Falasca-Zamponi." ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy'' (2000) p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four Speeches on the Corporate State: With an Appendix Including the Labour Charter, the Text of Laws on Syndical and Corporate Organisations and Explanatory notes'' (Laboremus, 1935) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the "standardization of humankind" and for causing excessive consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists argued that supercapitalism "would ultimately decay and open the way for a Marxist revolution as labor-capital relations broke down".&lt;ref name="blamires2006"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini claimed that supercapitalism resulted in the collapse of the capitalist system in the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Salvemini, Gaetano, Under the Axe of Fascism (READ BOOKS, 2006) p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that fascism would preserve those elements of capitalism that were deemed beneficial, such as [[private enterprise]] provided that it would be supervised by the state in fascist economics.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. p. 134"&gt;Salvemini. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mussolini claimed that fascism explicitly rejected the typical capitalist elements of economic individualism and laissez-faire.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. p. 134" /&gt; Furthermore, Italian Fascism also acknowledged [[Socialism|socialist]] influences, such as revolutionary [[syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1986 p. 203"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France''. English translation ed. (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1986) p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that in supercapitalism "[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously".&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 p. 158"&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson, Sears, Olivia E. and Stampino, Maria G., eds.. "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2000) p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy.&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 p. 158"/&gt;

Not long after the creation of the Institute of Industrial Reconstruction, Mussolini boasted in a 1934 speech to his Chamber of Deputies: "Three-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state".&lt;ref name="Gianni Toniolo 2013, p. 59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carl Schmidt 1939, pp. 153"/&gt; As Italy continued to nationalization its economy, the IRI "became the owner not only of the three most important Italian banks, which were clearly too big to fail, but also of the lion's share of the Italian industries".&lt;ref name="Costanza A. Russo 2012 p. 408"/&gt;

During this period, Mussolini identified his economic policies with "state capitalism" and "state socialism", which later was described as "economic dirigisme", an economic system where the state has the power to direct economic production and allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe'', New York: NY, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 1922, Lenin employed the same phrase to favorably characterize "state capitalism" as an appropriate economic system for Soviet Russia that would encompass "a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control", where according to Lenin every state-owned enterprises had to operated on a "profit basis".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, "The Role and Functions of the Trade Unions under the New Economic Policy", LCW, 33, p. 184. Decision of The C.C., R.C.P. (B.), January 12, 1922. Published in ''Pravda'' No. 12, January 17, 1922; ''Lenin's Collected Works'', 2nd English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 33, pages 188-196&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, Fascist Italy attained the highest rate of state–ownership of an economy in the world other than the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="Patricia Knight 2003, p. 65"/&gt; where the Italian state "controlled over four-fifths of Italy’s shipping and shipbuilding, three-quarters of its pig iron production and almost half that of steel".&lt;ref name="Fascist Italy 1991, p. 26"/&gt;

Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. p. 134"/&gt; Corporatism was promoted as reconciling the interests of capital and labour.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, editor, Fascism - A Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography, paperback (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian capitalist industrialists had opposed the Fascist government's intervention in arbitration of labour relations, and dominant groups in finance were strongly opposed to Mussolini's decision to revalue the [[Italian lira]] to be the same as the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] in 1926–1927.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, editor, Fascism - A Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography, paperback (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978) p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Gino Olivetti, head of the Italian Confederation of Industry, remained suspicious of the possibility of government intervention in the economy to support Fascist trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, editor, Fascism - A Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography, paperback (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978) p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1939, Mussolini encouraged Italians to foster an anti-bourgeois attitude by having Italians send in anti-bourgeois cartoons to be published in newspapers and by denouncing "social games, five o'clock tea, vacations, compassion for Jews, preference for armchairs, desire for compromise, desire for money" as indulgent bourgeois practices.&lt;ref&gt;"LIFE on the Newsfronts of the World". ''LIFE magazine''. 9 January 1939. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Mussolini excalated a public relations campaign against the Italian [[bourgeoisie]], accusing them of preferring private gain to national victory.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1997. p. 394"&gt;Smith, Denis Mack, Modern Italy: A Political History (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini ordered Fascist Party members to detach themselves from bourgeois culture, including abstaining from going to nightclubs, drinking coffee, wearing formal evening dress and starching their collars, which were all considered bourgeois traits.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1997. p. 394"/&gt; That year, Mussolini's anti-bourgeois theme spoke of removing first-class compartments, dining cars and sleepers on railroads and possibly closing the stock exchange.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1997. p. 394"/&gt; Also in that year, Mussolini appointed [[Achille Starace]] to his cabinet. Starace criticized Northern Italian bourgeoisie for Fascism's inability to permeate across the Italian nation, accusing them of being pacifist and pro-England.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1997. p. 394"/&gt;

Nazi officials, such as [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]], in private viewed [[Nazism]] as more radical than Italian Fascism, which they identified as being too supportive of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A history of fascism, 1914-1945. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995. pp. 463-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis argued that capitalism damages nations due to [[international finance]], the economic dominance of [[big business]] and Jewish influences within it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20&gt;Bendersky, Joseph W. ''A history of Nazi Germany: 1919-1945''. 2nd ed. (Burnham Publishers, 2000) p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]], both in public and in private, held strong disdain for capitalism and he accused modern capitalism of holding nations ransom in the interests of a parasitic [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[rentier capitalism|rentier]] class.&lt;ref name="J. Overy 2004. p. 399"/&gt; He opposed free-market capitalism's profit-seeking impulses and desired an economy in which community interests would be upheld.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 403"&gt;R.J. Overy. The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2004) p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; He distrusted capitalism for being unreliable due to it having an [[Egotism|egotistic]] nature and he preferred a state-directed economy.&lt;ref name="J. Overy 2004. p. 399"&gt;Overy, R.J., The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2004) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1940s, over 500 companies in key German industries had been nationalized, mostly accomplished through the creation of the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Overy| R. J. Overy]], ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-national industries in occupied territory were particularly targeted for state ownership, where the Reichswerke absorbed approximately 50–60% of heavy industry in Czech and slightly less in Austria.&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Overy| R. J. Overy]], ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Oxford University Press, 1994,  p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Göring industrial empire was a major attempt towards "restricting private industrial capitalism and substituting a 'völkisch', state-run industrial economy".&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Overy| R. J. Overy]], ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's National Socialist regime was committed to an economic "New Order" controlled by the "Party through a bureaucratic apparatus staffed by technical experts and dominated by political interests", similar to the economic planning of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Penguin Press (2005) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler said: "It may be that today gold has become the exclusive ruler of life, but the time will come when man will bow down before a higher god. Many things owe their existence solely to the longing for money and wealth, but there is very little among them whose non-existence would leave humanity any the poorer".&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Alan S., ''Mind vs. Money: The War Between Intellectuals and Capitalism'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 2010) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler told one party leader in 1934: "The economic system of our day is the creation of the Jews".&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 399"&gt;R.J. Overy. The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2004) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; In a discussion with Mussolini, Hitler said that "[c]apitalism had run its course".&lt;ref name="J. Overy 2004. p. 399"/&gt; In another conversation, Hitler stated that business bourgeoisie "know nothing except their profit. 'Fatherland' is only a word for them".&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy. 'R.J. Overy. The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2004) p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany that he obscenely referred to as a "cowardly shits".&lt;ref&gt;Kritika: explorations in Russian and Eurasian history, Volume 7, Issue 4. Slavica Publishers, 2006. Pp. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Spanish [[Falange]] also held anti-capitalist positions. Falangist leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] in 1935 declared: "We reject the capitalist system, which disregards the needs of the people, dehumanizes private property and transforms the workers into shapeless masses prone to misery and despair".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent. ''Modern Political Ideologies''. (Blackwell Publishing, 2010) p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian [[Iron Guard]] espoused anti-capitalist, anti-banking and anti-bourgeois rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, R.J.,  ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century'' (London, England; New York: Routledge, 1994) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arrow Cross Party]] of Hungary held strong anti-feudal and anti-capitalist beliefs and supported redistribution of property.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael, ''Fascists'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004) p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism===
[[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and fascists in [[Europe]] have held similar positions on many issues, including [[anti-communism]] and support of national pride.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 147"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives and fascists both reject the liberal and Marxist emphasis on linear progressive evolution in history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erin G. Carlston]]. Thinking Fascism: Sapphic Modernism and Fascist Modernity. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1998. Pp. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism's emphasis on order, discipline, hierarchy, martial (military) virtues and preservation of private property appealed to conservatives.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 147"/&gt; Fascists' promotion of "healthy", "uncontaminated" elements of national tradition such as [[Chivalry|chivalric]] culture and glorifying a nation's historical golden age have similarities with conservative aims.&lt;ref name="printing2003"&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The nature of fascism''. Digital Printing, 2003. Pp. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists also made pragmatic tactical alliances with traditional conservative forces in order to achieve and maintain power.&lt;ref name="printing2003"/&gt;

However, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] saw little conservative influence within fascist ideology or its movement, writing: "Fascists were not conservative in any very meaningful sense… The Fascists, in a meaningful sense, were revolutionaries".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. "Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center", ''New York Times Magazine'', (April 4, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1933 English-translated "Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism", Mussolini argued that the Fascist state is an "original creation", maintaining that Fascism "is not reactionary, but revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;Benito Mussolini, "The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism", Jane Soames, authorized translator, Hogarth Press, London, 1933) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists of Italy and Germany opposed the traditional constituents of conservatism, which included the monarchy, the Church and Jewish-financed capitalism, alongside "disdain for bourgeois values",&lt;ref&gt; Cyprian P. Blamires, with Paul Jackson, ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Vol. 1, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006, p. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; while upholding the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' concept of self-sacrifice that was to bring about "social equality".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fritzsche, ''Life and Death in the Third Reich'', President and Fellows of Harvard College, 2008,  p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; After 1930, the "nationalist-conservative Right" turned hostile to the Nazis, portraying Hitler as a "wild and vulgar demagogue, not a statesman, an obstacle to political recovery, the head of an extremist movement with menacing socialistic tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1999, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler enshrined his collectivist ethos under the slogan of the "common good before the individual good", which was stamped on Nazi Germany's coinage.&lt;ref&gt; "The Nazi 25-point Programme," Hitler's speech on party's program (February 24, 1920) in Munich, Germany. Barbara Miller Lane, Leila J. Rupp, introduction and translation, ''Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation'', Manchester University Press, 1978, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike conservatism, fascism specifically presents itself as a [[Modernism|modern]] ideology that is willing to break free from moral and political constraints of traditional society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley. Fascism and political theory: critical perspectives on fascist ideology. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative authoritarian right is distinguished from fascism in that such conservatives utilized traditional religion as the basis for their views while fascists based their views on more complex issues such as [[vitalism]], [[Irrationalism|nonrationalism]] or secular neo-idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. Pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of fascism's recruits were disaffected [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] conservatives who were dissatisfied with the traditional right's inability to achieve national unity and its inability to respond to socialism, feminism, economic crisis and international difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore. ''Fascism: a very short introduction''. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With traditional conservative parties in Europe severely weakened in the aftermath of [[World War I]], there was a political vacuum on the right which fascism filled.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore, ''Fascism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2002. Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism===
Fascism is strongly opposed to the individualism found in classical liberalism. Fascists accuse liberalism as being the cause of despiritualization of human beings and transforming them into materialistic beings in which the highest ideal is moneymaking.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''WESTERN CIVILIZATION: IDEAS, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY- FROM 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 Pp. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; Mussolini directed his criticism not against modern, Keynesian liberalism, but the older form of [[classical liberalism]], due to its individualistic nature, writing: "Against individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State; ... It is opposed to classical Liberalism ... Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]", Firenze: Vallecchi Editore (1935 version), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fascists and Nazis support a type of hierarchical individualism in the form of [[Social Darwinism]] because they believe it promotes "superior individuals" and weeds out "the weak".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt; They also accused both Marxism and democracy, with their emphasis on equality, of destroying individuality in favor of the "dead weight" of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Waddington, (2007) Hitler's Crusade: Bolshevism and the Myth of the International Jewish Conspiracy. I.B.Tauris. pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue where Fascism is in accord with liberalism is in its support of [[private property]] rights and the existence of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"/&gt; Although Fascism sought to "destroy the existing political order", it had tentatively adopted the economic elements of liberalism, but "completely denied its philosophical principles and the intellectual and moral heritage of modernity".&lt;ref name="Maia Ashéri p. 7"&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the economic hardships that resulted from "War Communism", which almost toppled the leadership of Soviet Russia in 1921, fascists in Germany and Italy followed the examples of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which had endorsed "state capitalism" and permitted the public to trade, buy and sell for "private profit".&lt;ref&gt;V. N. Bandera "New Economic Policy (NEP) as an Economic System," ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 71, No. 3 (June, 1963), 265-79: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Bolsheviks]] were averse to the principles of open markets and profit, they were nonetheless forced by dire circumstances to allow "privatization and private initiative" that resulted in a Soviet "mixed economy".&lt;ref&gt;[[L.K. Samuels]], "The Socialist Economics of Italian Fascism," ''Library of Economics and Liberty'', July 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenez, Peter, ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; For fascist leaders, following the two economic pillars of Fascism — "productionism" and "syndicalism"&lt;ref&gt; [[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; — was more important than adhering to ideological commitments that could risk economic collapse and mass unemployment that had plagued Lenin's nationalization policies. Moreover, Fascism espoused antimaterialism, which meant that it rejected the "rationalistic, individualistic and utilitarian heritage" that defined the liberal-centric [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Maia Ashéri p. 7"/&gt;

===Social welfarism and public works===
Both National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy were [[welfare state]]s that spent heavily on public works. A former school teacher, Mussolini's spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini "instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivalled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals, and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hibbert]], ''Benito Mussolini: A Biography'', Geneva: Switzerland, Heron Books, 1962, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; As for the scope and spending of social welfare programs, Italian fascism "compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive".&lt;ref&gt; [[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; When New York City politician [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]] asked Mussolini about the meaning behind Italian Fascism in 1939, the reply was: "It is like your New Deal!".&lt;ref&gt; [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]], ''Mr. New York: The Autobiography of Grover A. Whalen'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1955, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1925, the Fascist government had "embarked upon an elaborate program" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 258-264&lt;/ref&gt; As for public works, the Mussolini administration "devoted 400 million lire of public monies" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler and the German National Socialists spent large amounts of state revenues for a comprehensive social welfare system to combat the ill effects of the Great Depression, promising repeatedly throughout his regime the "creation of a socially just state".&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's speech to workers at Berlin's Rheinmetall-Borsig factory, Oct. 10, 1940. Published in [[Götz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Hitler ordered the [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt | National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) chairman [[Erich Hilgenfeldt]] to "see to the disbanding of all private welfare institutions" in an effort to socially engineer society by selecting who was to receive social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 92, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this state-operated welfare structure, Nazi administrators were able to mount an effort towards the "cleansing of their cities of 'asocials'".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Geyer, Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the NSV instituted expansive programs to address the socio-economic inequalities among those deemed to be German citizens. [[Joseph Goebbels]] remarked about the merits of Hitler's welfare state in a 1944 editorial "Our Socialism", where he professed: "We and we alone [the Nazis] have the best social welfare measures. Everything is done for the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Klemperer, ''I Will Bear Witness: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1942-1945'', Vol. 2, Random House, Inc., 2001, p. 317. Goebbels' "Our Socialism" editorial was written on April 30, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

With 17 million Germans receiving assistance under the auspices of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, the agency "projected a powerful image of caring and support".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; The National Socialists provided a plethora of social welfare programs under Nazi's concept of [[Volksgemeinschaft]] which promoted the collectivity of a "people's community" where citizens would sacrifice themselves for the greater good. The NSV operated "8,000 day-nurseries" by 1939 and funded holiday homes for mothers, distributed additional food for large families and was involved with a "wide variety of other facilities".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Nazi social welfare provisions included old age insurance, rent supplements, unemployment and disability benefits, old-age homes, interest-free loans for married couples, along with healthcare insurance, which was not decreed mandatory until 1941&lt;ref&gt;[[Götz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the NSV branches, the Office of Institutional and Special Welfare, was responsible "for travellers' aid at railway stations; relief for ex-convicts; 'support' for re-migrants from abroad; assistance for the physically disabled, hard-of-hearing, deaf, mute, and blind; relief for the elderly, homeless and alcoholics; and the fight against illicit drugs and epidemics".&lt;ref&gt; Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Youth Relief, which had 30,000 branches offices by 1941, took the job of supervising "social workers, corrective training, mediation assistance" and dealing with judicial authorities to prevent juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref&gt; Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialism and communism===
Fascism is historically strongly opposed to [[socialism]] and [[communism]], due to their support of [[Class conflict|class revolution]] as well as "decadent" values, including [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], horizontal [[collectivism]], [[materialism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref name="blamires1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blamires2006"/&gt; Fascists have thus commonly campaigned with [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] agendas.&lt;ref name="blamires3"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism opposed the [[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|international]] character of mainstream [[socialism]], but in opposing this international character, it often defined itself as a "nationalist" form of socialism, an alternative to the mainstream form of socialism which it regarded as its bitter enemy.&lt;ref name="blamires1"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler at times attempted to redefine the word socialism, such as saying: "Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, ''"German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler"'', Oxford University Press, 1985. pg 77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Hitler said: "Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not".&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, Francis Ludwig ''The Rise of Fascism'', 2nd ed. University of California Press, 1982. p. 137. Quoting: Hitler, A., Sunday Express, September 28, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; The name that Hitler later wished he had used to describe his political party was "social revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Heiden]], ''A History of National Socialism'', vol. 2, New York: NY, Rutledge, 2010, p. 85. First published in 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mainstream socialists have typically rejected and opposed fascism in turn.&lt;ref name="blamires1"/&gt; However, fascism and communism have common positions in their opposition to liberalism, capitalism, individualism and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]].&lt;ref name="blamires2006"/&gt; Fascists and communists also agree on the need for violent revolution to forge a new era.&lt;ref name="blamires2006"/&gt; While fascism is opposed to [[Bolshevism]], both Bolshevism and fascism promote the [[one-party state]] and the use of political party [[militia]]s.&lt;ref name="blamires3"/&gt;

Fascism denounces [[democratic socialism]] as a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists oppose it for its support of [[reformism]] and the [[parliamentary system]] that fascism reject.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, social democracy, similar but less socialist than democratic socialism, was denounced by [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] as a variant of fascism—"[[social fascism]]"—and that designation became the "official ideology of the world Communist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Hildebrand]], ''The Third Reich'', Tayor &amp; Francis e-library, 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin described fascism and social democracy as "twin brothers".

Italian Fascism had ideological connections with revolutionary [[syndicalism]], in particular [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] syndicalism.&lt;ref name="massachusetts2004"&gt;Miller, David and Janet Coleman, ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political thought'', 10th ed. (Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford, England; Carlton, Victoria, Australia: Blackwell Publishing, 2004) p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Fascist regime officially acknowledged revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]]—along with [[Hubert Lagardelle]] and his journal ''[[Le Mouvement socialiste]]''—as major influences on fascism.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1986 p. 203"/&gt; According to Sternhell, "most syndicalist leaders were among the founders of the Fascist movement" and that by the mid-1920s "many even held key posts" in the Fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, with Mario Sznajder, Maia Asheri,''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sorelian emphasis on the need for a revolution based upon action of intuition, a cult of energy and vitality, activism, heroism and the utilization of myth was utilized by fascists.&lt;ref name="massachusetts2004"/&gt; Many prominent fascist figures were formerly associated with revolutionary syndicalism, including Mussolini, [[Arturo Labriola]], [[Robert Michels]], [[Sergio Panunzio]] and [[Paolo Orano]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, ed., "Fascism" by Zeev Sternhill, ''International Fascism: Theories, Causes, and the New Consensus'' (London, England; New York: Arnold Publishers, 1998) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Croom Robertson''' (10 March 1842 – 20 September 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{wsPSM|Obituary Notes|42|December 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]].  In 1857 he gained a bursary at [[Marischal College]], and graduated MA in 1861, with the highest honours in [[classics]] and [[philosophy]]. In the same year he won a [[Robert Fergusson|Fergusson]] scholarship of £100 a year for two years, which enabled him to pursue his studies outside Scotland. He went first to [[University College, London]]; at the [[University of Heidelberg]] he worked on his [[German language|German]]; at the [[Humboldt University]] in [[Berlin]] he studied [[psychology]], [[metaphysics]] and also [[physiology]] under [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], and heard lectures on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the history of philosophy, ancient and modern. After two months at the [[University of Göttingen]], he went to [[Paris]] in June 1863. In the same year he returned to Aberdeen and helped [[Alexander Bain]] with the revision of some of his books.

In 1864 he was appointed to help [[William Duguid Geddes]] with his [[Greek language|Greek]] classes, but he devoted his vacations to working on philosophy. In 1866 he was appointed professor of philosophy of mind and logic at University College, London. He remained there until he was forced by ill-health to resign a few months before his death, lecturing on [[logic]], deductive and inductive, systematic psychology and [[ethics]].

He left little published work. A comprehensive work on [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] was never completed, though part of the materials were used for an article in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], and another portion was published as one of [[William Blackwood|Blackwood]]'s "Philosophical Classics." Together with Bain, he edited [[George Grote]]'s ''[[Aristotle]]'', and was the editor of ''Mind'' from its foundation in 1876 till 1891.
Robertson had a keen interest in German philosophy, and took every opportunity to make German works on English writers known in the [[United Kingdom]]. In philosophy he was principally a follower of Bain and [[John Stuart Mill]]. He and his wife (a daughter of Mr Justice Crompton) were involved in many kinds of social work; he sat on the Committee of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]], and was actively associated with its president, John Stuart Mill. He also supported the admission of women students to University College.

He is the author of numerous philosophical works that circulated in [[samizdat]] and made an impact on the liberal [[intelligentsia]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Early life ==
Grigory Pomerants was born in 1918 to a [[Polish Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=stal&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/vestnik/2010/28/po30-pr.html "Становление личности сквозь террор и войну"], by Grigory Pomerants, ''Вестник Европы'', 2010, no. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. His family moved to [[Moscow]] in 1925. Pomerants graduated in [[Russian language]] and literature from the {{ill|Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History|ru|Московский институт философии, литературы и истории}} (IFLI, MIFLI). His thesis on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] was condemned as "anti-Marxist" and as a result he was barred from admission to [[post-graduate studies]] in 1939. He went on to lecture at the Tula Pedagogical Institute in 1940.&lt;ref name=hro/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], Pomerants volunteered to the front, where he fought as a [[Red Army]] infantryman. He was wounded in the leg, as a result of which he was assigned as a writer to the editorial office of the divisional newspaper. He was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]].&lt;ref name=hro&gt;{{cite web|title=In memory of Grigory Pomerants|url=http://hro.rightsinrussia.info/archive/human-rights-defenders/pomerants/obituary|publisher=hro.org|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, he was expelled from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] for "anti-Party statements". Three years later he was arrested and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for [[anti-Soviet agitation]]. After [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953, he was released due to a general amnesty. He did not rejoin the Party, which prohibited him from teaching at tertiary level. He was also denid Moscow residence.&lt;ref name=stal/&gt; From 1953 to 1956, Pomerants worked as a village school teacher in the [[Donets Basin]] and later, upon his return to Moscow, as a [[bibliographer]] in the [[Fundamental Library of Social Sciences]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;''The International Who's Who 2004'', Europa Publications, Routledge, London 2003, p. 1342. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-217-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=caux-announcement /&gt;

== Dissident activities ==
Under the impression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the persecution of [[Boris Pasternak]], Pomerants became active as a [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]]. In 1959–1960, he led semi-secret seminars on philosophical, historical, political and economic issues. During this time he established contact with dissidents such as Vladimir Osipov and the editors and contributors of the dissident magazine ''[[Sintaksis (Moscow)|Sintaksis]]'' [[Alexander Ginzburg]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]]. He also became close to the painters of the underground [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo group]].&lt;ref name=officialsite/&gt;

On December 3, 1965, Pomerants gave a lecture at the Institute of Philosophy in Moscow publicly denouncing Stalinism.&lt;ref name=pomerants-o-roli&gt;{{cite web|last=Pomerants|first=Grigory|title=O roli nravstvennogo oblika lichnosti v zhizni istoricheskogo kollektiva|url=http://www.igrunov.ru/cat/vchk-cat-names/pomerants/publ/vchk-cat-names-pomer-moral_image.html|publisher=Igrunov.ru|accessdate=23 February 2013|date=3 December 1965|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zubok-zhivagos&gt;{{Cite book

He also put his signature to [[Larisa Bogoraz]] and [[Pavel Litvinov]]'s "Appeal to the World Public Opinion" in protest of [[The Trial of the Four|Trial of the Four]]. As a result, he was deprived of any opportunity to defend his thesis on [[Zen Buddhism]] at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]].&lt;ref name=hro/&gt;&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grigory Solomonovitch Pomeranz|url=http://pomeranz.ru/en/|publisher=Pomeranz.ru|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to official articles, which focused on the spiritual traditions of [[India]] and [[China]], Pomerants began to write essays on historical and social topics. While his works were soon stopped from being printed in the Soviet Union, they were widely published in samizdat.&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wesleyan University Press| isbn = 0-8195-6176-2| last = Alexeyeva| first = Lyudmila|author2=John Glad| others = Carol Pearce (trans.)| title = Soviet Dissent: Contemporary Movements for National, Religious, and Human Rights| location = Middletown, Conn.| year = 1987 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also reprinted in the western émigré magazines ''[[Kontinent]]'', ''[[Sintaksis]]'' and ''Strana i Mir'', and a collection of essays under the title ''Neopublikovannoe'' (Unpublished Works) was published in 1972 in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Possev| last = Pomerants| first = Grigory| title = Neopublikovannoe. Bol'shie i malen'kie esse. Publitsistika| year = 1972 | oclc= 353359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomerants' political and social articles as well as his public conduct attracted the attention of the [[KGB]]. On November 14, 1984, Pomerants was officially warned in connection with his publications abroad. On May 26, 1985, KGB agents searched his flat and confiscated his literary archive.&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt;

== Philosophical positions ==
[[Andrei Sakharov]], who had met Pomerants in an informal seminar at [[Valentin Turchin]]'s flat in 1970, describes his interests as follows:

{{quote|text=The most stimulating speaker at Turchin's seminar was Grigory Pomerants, a former political prisoner and a specialist in Oriental philosophy. I was astounded by his erudition, his broad perspective, his sardonic humor, and his academic approach (in the best sense of that term). Pomerants's three of four talks paid homage to the civilization created by the interaction of all nations, East and West, over the course of millennia. He praised tolerance and compromise, deploring (as I do) the poverty and sterility of narrow chauvinism, dictatorships, and totalitarian regimes. Pomerants is a man of rare independence, integrity, and intensity who has not let material poverty cramp his rich, if underrated, contribution to our intellectual life.|sign=Andrei Sakharov, ''Memoirs''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hutchinson| isbn = 978-0091746360| last = Sakharov| first = Andrei| others = Richard Lourie (trans.)| title = Memoirs| location = London
| year = 1990| page = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pomerants was among the first Russian disciples of [[cultural theory|cultural]] and [[literary theorist]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mihailovic|first=Alexandar |title=Corporeal Words: Mikhail Bakhtin's Theology of Discourse|year=1997|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-1459-3|location=Evanston, Il|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Pomerants was involved in polemics with [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]. Pomerants strongly criticized what he saw as Solzhenitsyn's dogmatic Christian nationalism and positioned himself closer to the liberal, internationalist wing of the [[intelligentsia]]. He countered Solzhenitsyn's notion of "evil" as an unavoidably global, well-established phenomenon, associated with Communism, by citing Eastern traditions which reject the notion of an inherently permanent, ontological evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boobbyer|first=Philip |title=Conscience, Dissent and Reform in Soviet Russia|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33186-9|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://old.russ.ru/antolog/vek/1990/11/spor.htm «Сон о справедливом возмездии (затянувшийся спор с Александром Солженицыным)»], Григорий Померанц, «Век ХХ и мир», #11, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomerants himself stated that he preferred to be called a "thinker" (''myslitel''') rather than a "philosopher", since this term does not imply the academic discipline of philosophy, which he felt was merely neighboring his own work (''po sosedstvu'').&lt;ref name=pomerants-school&gt;[http://vimeo.com/28418709 Interview with Pomerants] on [[NTV Russian TV channel|NTV]]'s ''School of Slander'', November 24, 2008 (English subtitles)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most quoted pieces in Russian by Pomerants reflected his views on the nature of social debate:
{{quote|text=The devil is born from an angel spitting in rage… People and systems crumble to dust, but the spirit of hate, bred by the champions of good, is immortal and thus evil on Earth knows no end. In the debates of the 1970s I stubbornly went against all my instincts and impulses to spit in rage, and in this struggle, I found another truth – the manner of the debate is more important that the object of the debate. Objects come and go, while manners form the building blocks of civilizations.|sign=Grigory Pomerants, ''Dogma of Debate''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pomeranz.ru/p/pub_dogmats.htm |title=Догматы полемики|author=Григорий Померанц |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pomerants' lectures and a rejected thesis on [[Zen Buddhism]] were studied by filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and composer [[Eduard Artemyev]] during their work on ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Iskusstvo| isbn = 5210002799| first = Maya | last = Turovskaya| title = 7½, ili filmy Andreia Tarkovskovo| location = Moscow| year = 1991|chapter=Eduard Artemyev talks to Maya Turovskaya|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/artemyev.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naumenko|first=Oleksiy-Nestor|author2=Eduard Artem'ev|title=Eduard Artemyev.

In 2009, The Bjørnson Prize of the [[Norwegian Academy of Literature and Freedom of Expression]] was awarded to Pomerants and Mirkina "for their extensive contribution to strengthening the freedom of expression in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bjornsonakademiet.no/Bjornson/eng_prisen.html The Bjørnson Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174542/http://www.bjornsonakademiet.no/Bjornson/eng_prisen.html |date=2011-07-24 }}", Bjørnson Academy (2009). Retrieved 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomerants was married to Russian poet [[Zinaida Mirkina]]. He died, aged 94, in [[Moscow]], Russia.

'''Han Yong-un''' ({{lang-ko|한용운}}, August 29, 1879 – June 29, 1944) was a twentieth century [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhist]] reformer and [[Korean poetry|poet]].&lt;ref&gt;"Han Yong-un " LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was his religious name, given by his meditation instructor in 1905, and '''Manhae''' (만해) was his pen name; his birth name was Han Yu-cheon.

==Life==
Manhae was born in Yucheon in [[Chungcheongnam-do]], [[Hongseong]]. During his childhood, he studied Chinese classics in [[Seodang]], a popular elementary school during the [[Joseon]] Dynasty. Prior to being ordained, he was involved in resistance to Japanese influence in the country, which culminated in the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1905 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Lee1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Korean Literature|chapter=Han Yong-un|page=137|author=Lee, Kyung-ho|publisher=Hollym|location=Seoul|year=1996|isbn=1-56591-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in seclusion at Ose-am in the [[Baekdam Temple]] from 1896. During this period, he studied Buddhist sacred texts and several books of modern philosophy. In 1905 he received the robes of the [[Jogye Order]] of monks and in 1908 he went to Japan and visited several temples to study Buddhism and Eastern philosophy for six months.&lt;ref&gt;"Han Yong-un" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he was one of the patriot signatories to the [[Korean Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.koreanlitinfo.com/han-yongun/ |title= Han Yong’un |website= ''koreanlitinfo.com''|publisher= Korean Literature |accessdate= November 20, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223809/http://www.koreanlitinfo.com/han-yongun/ |archivedate= December 2, 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

As a social writer, Manhae called for the reform of [[Korean Buddhism]].

Manhae's poetry dealt with both nationalism and sexual love, often mingling the two. One of his more political collections was ''Nimui Chimmuk'' (Lover's Silence, 님의 침묵), published in 1926. These works revolve around the ideas of equality and freedom and helped inspire the tendencies toward passive resistance and non-violence in the [[Korean independence movement]].

In 1913, Han Yongun published "The Restoration of Korean Buddhism (''Joseonbulgyo-yusimlon''), which criticized the anachronistic isolationist policy of Joseon Buddhism and its incongruence with the then contemporary reality. The work sent tremors through the intellectual world. In this work, the author promulgated the principle of equality, self-discovery, the potential for Buddhism for safeguarding the world, and progress. His development as an activist and thinker resulted from his adherence to these very principles.&lt;ref name="klti.or.kr"&gt;Source-attribution|"Han Yong-un" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or [http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Han published "Whole Mind" (''Yusim''), a work that aimed to enlighten young people. In the following year, he played an important role in the [[March 1st Movement|3.1 Independence movement]] with Chae Lin, for which he was later imprisoned and served a three-year sentence. During his imprisonment, Han composed "Reasons for Korean Independence" (''Joseondoglib-i-yuseo'') as a response to the official investigation into his political engagement. He was later acquitted in 1922, at which time he began a nationwide lecture tour. The purpose of the tour was to engage and inspire youth, an objective first established in Han's "Whole Mind". In 1924, he became the Chair of the Buddhist youth assembly.

The poems published in Han's ''Nim-ui Chimmuk'' had been written at Baekdam Temple in the previous year. This book garnered much attention from literary critics and intellectuals at the time. Despite his many other publications, from Chinese poems to [[sijo]]s and the poems included in ''Yusim'', and novels such as Dark Wind (''Heukpung''), Regret (''Huhoe''), Misfortune (''Bakmyeong''), this collection remains the poet's most significant and enduring literary achievement.&lt;ref name="klti.or.kr"/&gt; In it, love for the motherland plainly appears under the guise of longing for the loved one, as in the poem "I Do Not Know".

Han's model for such rhapsodic, long-lined expressions of devotion was [[Rabindranath Tagore]], whose work he knew, and behind Tagore the long Indian tradition of combining mysticism with eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Pankaj Mohan, "Revisiting Han Yong-un's Buddhist Texts and their Nationalist Contexts", [http://congress.aks.ac.kr/korean/files/2_1357533976.pdf pp.7–8]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilary Lawson''' is an English post-realist philosopher. Known for his [[theory of closure]], he is director of the [[Institute of Art and Ideas]] and founder of the philosophy festival [[HowTheLightGetsIn]].  He has also had a journalistic and documentary career, is the founder of [[TVF Media]], and the originator of the video painting movement.

==Biography==
Hilary Lawson was born and grew up in [[Bristol]], England, the only son of Harold Lawson and his wife Norma (née Gear). Awarded a scholarship whilst an undergraduate at [[Balliol College]] [[Oxford]] he gained a first in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]]. As a post-graduate he came to see paradoxes of self-reference as the central philosophical issue&lt;ref name="Closure 2001 p.328"&gt;''Closure: A Story of Everything''; Routledge (2001) p.328&lt;/ref&gt; and began a DPhil on The Reflexivity of Discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/forumForEuropeanPhilosophy/whosWho/executiveCommitte/hilaryLawson.aspx|publisher=LSE|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later became the basis for his first philosophical book ''Reflexivity: The [[Post-Modern]] Predicament''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;HarperCollins Publishers Ltd, 21 November 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside his philosophical writing, Lawson pursued a media career.  Within a few years he had created his own prime time television series ''Where There's Life''&lt;ref name="Where There's Life 1982"&gt;''Where There's Life'', Michael Joseph, 1982. {{ISBN|0-7181-2137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a weekly UK audience in excess of ten million.&lt;ref&gt;BFI National Library and BFI National Archive, JICTAR Weekly Audience TV Reports (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Hilary Lawson co-authored a book based on the series.&lt;ref name="Where There's Life 1982"/&gt; At 28, he was appointed Editor of Programmes and later Deputy Chief Executive at the television station [[TV-am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/17/bbc.itv | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Waking up to a new era | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | first=John | last=Mair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile he continued to develop his philosophical thinking and had initial sketches of the theory later to become Closure.&lt;ref&gt;''Closure: A Story of Everything''; Routledge (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he wrote ''Reflexivity: The [[Post-Modern]] Predicament'' (1985), as part of a series on modern European thought.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The book argued that the paradoxes of self-reference are central to philosophy and drive the writings of Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida.

In the late 1980s he founded the production company [[TVF Media]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvf.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; which made documentary and current affairs programming, including Channel 4's flagship international current affairs programme, ''The World This Week''. Hilary Lawson was editor of the programme which ran weekly between 1987 and 1991. The programme predicted the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the war in [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9f28499f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, he focused on writing ''Closure''. It took a decade to complete and was published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Closure: A Story of Everything''; Routledge (2002 edition), page 328&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been described as the first non-realist metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Closure-Story-Everything-Hilary-Lawson/dp/0415136504&lt;/ref&gt; Having begun his philosophical career as a proponent of postmodernism latterly he became a critic arguing for the necessity of an overall framework and the need to move on from a focus on language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;iai.tv/video/the-limits-of-my-world&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the framework of openness and closure to the visual medium, he created the first video paintings in 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengallery.co.uk/video-art/hilary-lawson&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of escaping narrative closure. He went on to found the Artscape Project in 2003, which brought a collective of artists together to develop the new medium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengallery.co.uk/philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Lawson founded the [[Institute of Art and Ideas]] in 2008 with the aim of making ideas and philosophy a central part of cultural life. IAI.tv was launched in 2011. IAI news in 2013 and the IAI Academy in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://iai.tv/home/host/hilary-lawson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Hilary Lawson's theory 'Closure' proposes that the human condition is to find ourselves on the cusp of openness and closure.  The world is open and we, along with other living organisms, are able to apprehend and make sense of it through the process of closure. Lawson defines closure as the holding of that which is different as one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Closure, Routledge (2001), page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Human experience is seen to be the result of successive layers of closure, which Lawson describes as preliminary, sensory and inter-sensory closure.  The highest level of closure, inter-sensory closure realises language and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Closure, Routledge (2001), page 27 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The theory shifts the focus of philosophy away from language and towards an exploration of the relationship between openness and closure.  An important element of the theory of closure is its own self-referential character.

The framework of closure enables Lawson to give an account of the relationship between language and the world that does not rely on reference and which he argues overcomes the problem of how language is hooked onto the world that has beset twentieth century philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Closure, Routledge (2001), page 59 ff&lt;/ref&gt; One of the consequences of the theory is that philosophical oppositions, between language and the world, fact and value, are no longer regarded as oppositions and instead are seen as a consequence of the play of closure and openness. As a result, science is not in opposition to art and religion but in a different relationship to openness and closure.  Lawson proposes that science is 'driven by the search for closure'.&lt;ref&gt;Closure: A Story of Everything; Routledge (2002 edition), page 144&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of closure cannot however succeed and in the failure of closure openness is uncovered.  Art in contrast is described as 'the pursuit of openness and the avoidance of closure'.&lt;ref&gt;Closure, Routledge (2001), page 206&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the pursuit of openness cannot succeed and elements of closure remain.

===Background===
Lawson began his philosophical development at [[Oxford University]], one of the primary centres of the analytic school. While still an undergraduate he became convinced that problems of self-reference undermined the analytic project.&lt;ref name="Closure 2001 p.328"/&gt; His trajectory to this conclusion started with the reflexive problems of relativism which were explored with the political theorist, [[Steven Lukes]]; continued with an examination of [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]], with the translator BF McGuiness; and were cemented in conversation with Alan Montefiore  who had close links with [[Jacques Derrida]] and was aware of similarities of argument and approach.

As can be seen from the pamphlet After Truth - A Post Modern Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;''After Truth'' A Post Modern Manifesto Inventions Press UK 1986,&lt;/ref&gt; written in collaboration with [[Hugh Tomlinson]] the translator of a number of Deleuze's works, under the pseudonym the 2nd of January group,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/tag/the-second-of-january-group&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary Lawson's approach increasingly diverged from the mainstream of analytic philosophy having more in common with the American philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] and the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Rorty collaborated on his film ''Science...fiction?''&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, [[List of Horizons]],17 February 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist Review 27 Feb 1986 p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horizon, BBC, tx 17 February 1986&lt;/ref&gt; which argued that "''science is not powerful because it is true, but true because it is powerful''" and took part in a subsequent documentary film of his on Plato entitled ''The First World''. Rorty also contributed to a collection of essays co-edited by Hilary Lawson: ''Dismantling Truth: Reality in the Post-Modern World''&lt;ref&gt;''Dismantling Truth: Reality in the Post-Modern World'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson's subsequent work can be seen as a response to the writings of [[Rorty]] and Derrida, and an attempt to overcome the self-referential paradoxes in which he believed they were mired. While in his early work he is a proponent of postmodernism he has latterly become a critic arguing for a return to metaphysics and the necessity of an overall theory. This is apparent in his public debates with [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;http://iai.tv/video/after-relativism&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;iai.tv/video/after-postmodernity&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
In ''Reflexivity'' Hilary Lawson argued that self-reference was central to contemporary philosophy.  Using [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]] and [[Derrida]] as the main examples, he sought to show that reflexivity was the primary motor of their work. It was implicit that similar arguments could be applied to Wittgenstein and the analytic tradition.

The introduction to ''Closure'', referred to as the Prologue, extends the arguments put forward in ''Reflexivity'' to the broader philosophical tradition.  It argues that issues of self-reference undermine currently available philosophical positions. The main body of the book describes the process of closure and the means by which we can intervene in the world and seemingly understand it.  In doing so it seeks to demonstrate that meaning and understanding are not dependent on notions of reference and truth, arguing that although there is nothing in common between closure and openness this does not limit our ability to intervene successfully in the world.

Other books include ''Dismantling Truth: Science in Post-Modern Times'', and ''Closure: A Story of Everything''. Articles include ''After Truth'', ''On Integrity'', ''Philosophy As'', and ''The Poetic Strategy''.

==Documentary film and factual television==
The BFI ([[British Film Institute]]) lists more than 200 credits as producer, director, writer or presenter.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Film Institute|BFI]] National Library and [[British Film Institute|BFI]] National Archive, London&lt;/ref&gt;

His documentary films include: ''Your Own Worst Enemy'', writer and producer, ([[ITV Network|ITV]]); ''Science … fiction?'', written and directed ([[BBC]]); ''Broken Images'', written and directed ([[BBC]]); ''The First World'', written and directed ([[Channel 4]]); ''The Man, the Myth, and The Maker'', produced and presented  ([[Channel 4]]); ''DNA in the Dock'', written and directed ([[Channel 4]]); ''The Greenhouse Conspiracy'', written, directed and presented ([[Channel 4]]); ''Incredible Evidence'' (90mins), written and directed ([[Channel 4]]).

His current affairs output includes: ''The World This Week'' (1hr, weekly 1988-93), Editor ([[Channel 4]]); ''Cooking the Books'', written and directed ([[Channel 4]]); ''South Africa:  After Apartheid'', produced and presented  ([[Channel 4]]); ''Patent on Life'', written and directed ([[Channel 4]]); ''For Queen or Country'', written and directed ([[Channel 4]]).

==Art==
Lawson shot the first [[video painting]]s, ''Orange and Grey'', and ''Cusp'' in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name="opengallery.co.uk"&gt;http://www.opengallery.co.uk/concept.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the Artscape Project in 2003 consisting of a collective of artists, including [[William Raban]], Sarah Turner, [[Sanchita Islam]] and [[Isabelle Inghillieri]], whose aim was to develop and explore the medium of the [[video painting]].  The Artscape Project is now represented by [[Open Gallery]].

The video painting flows from his philosophical outlook and constitutes a break from the film-making narratives that had been his focus for more than a decade. Hilary Lawson sees video painting as a means to encourage the viewer to escape everyday closures and approach openness, or what [[Heidegger]] would have called Being.

In 2003 he was instrumental in developing a technology with computer scientists&lt;ref name="opengallery.co.uk"/&gt; which enabled video paintings to be stored and played in such a manner that their order did not repeat but was also not random.  The [[software]] and [[technology]] (known as [[Laluna]]) were created in order to allow video paintings to be integrated and put together so that they could constitute [[Art collection|collection]]s of work that never repeated or recapitulated, and yet had structure.

His video painting work has been exhibited at: the [[Hayward Gallery]] (2006);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haywardgallery.org.uk/;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sketch (restaurant)|Sketch]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sketch.uk.com/&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ica.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Globe at Hay]] gallery (2008).&lt;ref name="opengallery.co.uk"/&gt; ''Now Revisited'', performed at [[Shunt, London]] in 2009, was a video painting installation in five acts in which the audience found themselves the subject of the work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shunt.co.uk/loungehistory.php?p=4&amp;d=27&amp;m=2&amp;y=2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hirsch Bär Fassel (1802-1883)''' (also known as Hirsch Baer Fassel or Hirsch B. Fassel) was an influential [[rabbi]] and [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Boskowitz]]. His book ''Mozene Zedek'', a manual for rabbis on [[Talmud]]ic decisions on practical matters, urged other rabbis to be lenient in making rulings against individuals in non-criminal matters. Fassel believed that reforms in Judaism were legitimate, so long as they were brought about by rabbis.

Hirsch was a prolific writer who often had his sermons published in the Jewish press, and who was a frequent contributor to Austrian Jewish newspapers. In addition to ''Mozene Zedek,'' he wrote and published at least a dozen other books.

His manuscript of ''Mozene Zedek'' is on display at [[Hebrew Union College]].

His daughter [[Rosa Sonneschein]] was the founder of [[American Jewess]].

The '''historiography of science''' is the study of the history and methodology of the sub-discipline of history, known as the [[history of science]], including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development ("History of History of Science", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science).

Since historiographical debates regarding the proper method for the study of the history of science are sometimes difficult to demarcate from historical controversies regarding the very course of science, it is often (and rightly) the case that the early controversies of the latter kind are considered the inception of the sub-discipline. For example, such discussions permeate the historical writings of the great historian and philosopher of science [[William Whewell]]. He is thus often (and rightly) viewed as the grandfather of this discipline; other such distinguished grandfathers are [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Alexandre Koyré]].

As to the explicit presentation of the Historiography of Science it is usually dated in the early Sixties of the 20th century. Thus for example, in 1965 we find [[Gerd Buchdahl]] reporting "A Revolution in Historiography of Science" referring to the innovative studies of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Joseph Agassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Buchdahl Gerd |title= A Revolution in Historiography of Science|journal= History of Science|year= 1965 |pages=55–69|volume=4|bibcode = 1965HisSc...4...55B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that these two writers had inaugurated the sub discipline by distinguishing clearly between the history and the historiography of science, as they argued that historiographical views greatly influence the writing of the history of science.

== The origins of the discipline ==
Though scholars and scientists had been chronicling the results of scientific endeavors for centuries (such as [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' from 1837, and the popular and historical accounts which accompanied the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century), the development of the distinct [[academia|academic]] discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century, and was intimately bound to the changing role of science during the same time period. The history of science was once exclusively the domain of retired researchers &amp;mdash; former scientists whose days in the [[laboratory]] had expired but still with a hearty interest in the field &amp;mdash; and the rare specialist. However, in the decades since the end of World War II the field has evolved into a full academic discipline, with [[graduate school]]s, research institutes, public and private patronage, [[peer-review]]ed [[academic journal|journals]], and professional societies.

The study of the history of science has had great effects on the [[philosophy of science]], conceptions of the role of science in society, and [[Public policy#Science Policy|scientific policy]].

The founding figure of the discipline in the [[United States]] was [[George Sarton]], later the founding editor of the journal ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''. Sarton and his family fled [[Belgium]] after the [[Germany|German]] invasion in World War I, and after a brief stay in [[England]], he arrived in the United States penniless and unemployed. Sarton began lecturing part-time at several academic institutions, and in 1916 began a two-year appointment at [[Harvard University]]. When his appointment did not look like it would be renewed, he appealed to [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], for patronage. Woodward gave Sarton a two-year position and in 1920 extended it to a permanent tenured appointment as a Research Associate in the Institution's Department of History.

Though modern scholars do not usually share Sarton's motivations &amp;mdash; Sarton saw the history of science as the only genuine example of human progress &amp;mdash; the tools he left to the field, the journal ''Isis'' and the annual volume ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'' (both still in print today), provided the foundation of the discipline in the United States.

== The Hessen thesis and the birth of externalism  ==

Just as the 1930s were a seminal decade for the development of our modern understanding of science, they were a seminal decade for the history and [[historiography]] of science as well. While Sarton taught the first American doctoral students in the discipline, in Europe some of the most influential historians and philosophers of science were first coming into the picture, and the setting of the philosophical battle which is now known as "the [[Science Wars]]" was being set.

In 1931, the Second International Congress of the History of Science was convened in London. The papers delivered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation, led by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|N.I. Bukharin]], quickly invigorated the discipline. [[Boris Hessen]] in particular delivered a paper entitled "The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's ''Principia''," in which he asserted that [[Isaac Newton]]'s most famous work was created to cater to the goals and desires of 17th century industry and [[Economic system|economy]]. Hessen asserted that Newton's work was inspired by his economic status and context, that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was little more than the solution of technical problems of the [[bourgeoisie]].

Present scholarship has revealed that Hessen's motives were not completely academic. At that time in the Soviet Union, the work of [[Albert Einstein]] was under attack by [[Communist Party]] [[philosophers]]; being supposedly motivated by bourgeois values, it was "[[bourgeois science]]" {{Harvcol|Graham|1985|p=&amp;nbsp;711}},  and should henceforth be banned. (In many ways this attack was similar to the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement in Germany which occurred only a few years later.) Hessen's paper was a lobbying tactic: Party philosophers would not challenge the accuracy of Newton's theories, and to show them as being motivated by bourgeois concerns would, in Hessen's eyes, show that scientific validity could exist whatever the motivations were for undertaking it. However, there is little evidence that his paper had any effect in the internal Soviet philosophical battles over Einstein's work.

Despite its lack of effect in his home country, Hessen's thesis had a wide effect in Western history of science. Though Hessen’s work is now easily dismissed as "vulgar [[Marxism]]" {{Harvcol|Shaffer|1984|p=&amp;nbsp;26}}, its focus on the relationship between society and science was, in its time, seen as novel and inspiring. It was a challenge to the notion that the history of science was the history of individual [[genius]] in action, the dominant view at least since [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' in 1837.

Few contemporary Western readers of Hessen took his paper at face value. His rigid connection between economy and [[knowledge]] was not accepted by a majority of historians. However, his assertion that a connection existed between the growth of knowledge and the art of war, and that [[ballistics]] played a central part of physics and Newton's world, was viewed with keen interest. In the shadow of the first war to employ [[chemical weapons]], and as the war machines were again gearing up in preparation for another world war, the role between science, [[technology]], and warfare was becoming more interesting to scholars and scientists. Previous views of science as separate from the mundane or vulgar aspects of practical life &amp;mdash; the disembodiment of the scientific mind from its context &amp;mdash; were becoming less attractive than a view that science and scientists were increasingly embedded in the world in which they worked.

This became reflective in the scholarship of the time as well, with dissertations written on such subjects as "Science and War in the Old Regime," which examined the ways in which military engineering influenced pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] [[France|French]] scientists.

This method of doing the history of science became known as ''[[externalism]]'', looking at the manner in which science and scientists are affected, and guided by, their context and the world in which they exist. It is an approach which eschews the notion that the history of science is the development of pure thought over time, one idea leading to another in a contextual bubble which could exist at any place, at any time, if only given the right geniuses.

The contrast to this approach, the method of doing history of science which preceded externalism, became known as ''[[Internalism#Historiography of science|internalism]]''. Internalist histories of science often focus on the [[rational reconstruction]] of scientific ideas and consider the development of these ideas wholly within the scientific world. Although internalist histories of modern science tend to emphasize the norms of modern science, internalist histories can also consider the different systems of thought underlying the development of [[History of astronomy#Mesopotamia|Babylonian astronomy]] or Medieval [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] theory

In practice, the line between [[internalism and externalism]] can be incredibly fuzzy. Few historians then, or now, would insist that either of these approaches in their extremes paint a wholly complete picture, nor would it necessarily be possible to practice one fully over the other. However, at their heart they contain a basic question about the nature of science: what is the relationship between the producers and consumers of scientific knowledge? The answer to this question must, in some form, inform the method in which the history of science and technology is conducted; conversely, how the history of science and technology is conducted, and what it concludes, can inform the answer to the question. The question itself contains an entire host of philosophical questions: what is the nature of scientific truth? What does [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] mean in a scientific context? How does change in scientific theories occur?

The historian/sociologist of science [[Robert K. Merton]] produced many famous works following Hessen's thesis, which can be seen as reactions to and refinements of Hessen's argument. In his work on science, technology, and society in the 17th century [[England]], Merton sought to introduce an additional category &amp;mdash; [[Puritan]]ism &amp;mdash; to explain the growth of science in this period. Merton worked to split Hessen's crude category of economics into smaller subcategories of influence, including transportation, mining, and military technique. Merton also tried to develop [[empirical]], [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] approaches to showing the influence of external factors on science. Despite these changes, Merton was quick to note his indebtedness to Hessen. Even with his emphasis on external factors, though, Merton differed from Hessen in his interpretation: Merton maintained that while researchers may be inspired and interested by problems which were suggested by extra-scientific factors, ultimately the researcher's interests were driven by "the internal history of the science in question.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}" Merton attempted to delineate externalism and internalism along disciplinary boundaries, with ''context'' studied by the [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]], and ''content'' by the historian.

== Ludwik Fleck ==

Around the same period, in 1935, [[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish medical microbiologist published his [[Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact]] which used a case study in the field of medicine (of the development of the disease concept of Syphilis) to present a thesis about the social nature of knowledge, and in particular science and scientific 'thought styles' (Denkstil) which are the epistemological, conceptual and linguistic styles of scientific (but also non-scientific) 'thought collectives' (Denkkollektiv). This work's importance was not noticed, as [Thaddeus J. Trenn] editor of the English edition published in 1979 writes, 'Fleck's pioneering monograph was published at almost the same time as [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Logik der Forschung]]. But, developed in very different cognitive styles, the books met with contrasting response. In Popper's own words, his book "was surprisingly successful, far beyond Vienna. [...]" [...] It is perhaps most diagnostic that the book received no review notice at all in [[George Sarton]]'s [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']], by then the leading international journal of the [[history of science]].' [pp. xvii-xviii].

As evident from Fleck's book's title, it revolves around the notion that epistemologically, there is nothing stable or realistically true or false about any scientific fact. A fact has a 'genesis' which is grounded in certain theoretic grounds and many times other obscure and fuzzy notions, and it 'develops' as it is subject to dispute and additional research by other scientists. Fleck's work, unlike Hessen's work focuses more on the epistemological and linguistic factors that affect scientific discovery, innovation and progress or development, while Hessen's work focuses on socio-political factors.

Fleck's work was one of the major influences noted by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] which led to the writing his ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. Kuhn also wrote the foreword to Fleck's English translation.

== Vannevar Bush and World War II ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of [[Big Science]] after World War II. The influential bureaucrat [[Vannevar Bush]], and the president of Harvard, [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.

== Thomas Kuhn and the 1960s ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
From the 1940s through the early 1960s, most histories of science were different forms of a "march of progress" {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, showing science as a triumphant movement towards truth. Many philosophers and historians did of course paint a more nuanced picture, but it was not until the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' that this approach became seriously suspected as being misleading {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Kuhn's argument that scientific revolutions worked by [[paradigm shift]]s seemed to imply that truth was not the ultimate criterion for science, and the book was extremely influential outside of academia as well {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Corresponding with the rise of the [[environmentalism]] movement and a general loss of optimism of the power of science and technology unfettered to solve the problems of the world, this new history encouraged many critics to pronounce the preeminence of science to be overthrown {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

'''Hurufism'''&lt;ref name="HORUFISM"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Hamid Algar|Algar]]|first=[[Hamid Algar|Hamid]]|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/horufism|title=HORUFISM|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|حُرُوفِيَّة}} ''ḥurūfiyyah'') was a [[Sufi]] doctrine based on the mysticism of letters (''ḥurūf''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Secrecy in Religions |last=Bolle |first=Kees W.  |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=Brill Archive |location= |isbn=90-04-08342-1 |pages=89 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in [[Astrabad]] and spread to areas of western [[Persia]] and [[Anatolia]] in the late 14th–early 15th century.

== Foundation ==
The founder and spiritual head of the Hurufi movement was [[Fazlallah Astarabadi|Fażlu l-Lāh Astar-Ābādī]], also called [[Fazlallah Astarabadi (Naimi)|Nāimī]] (1340–94). Born in [[Astrabad]], [[Iran]], he was strongly drawn to [[Sufism]] and the teachings of [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] and [[Rumi]] at an early age. In the mid-1370s [[Fazlallah Astarabadi (Naimi)|Nāimī]] started to propagate his teachings all over [[Persia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. While living in [[Tabriz]], Fazlallah gained an elite following in the [[Jalayirid]] court, where the writing of his main work, ''Jawidan-Al-Kabir'', allegedly took place. At that time he was still in the mainstream of Sufi tradition. Later, he did move towards more [[esoteric]] [[spirituality]], and, failing to convert [[Timur]], was executed in 1394 near [[Alinja Tower|Alinja]] castle in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] by the ruler's son [[Miran Shah]]. The uprising of Hurufis, who had gathered a large following, was crushed in [[Azerbaijan]], but the popular movement survived for another decade or so in different guises.
{{Ismailis}}

== Key elements ==
According to Fazlallah, the key to open seventh sealed book, the [[Qurʾan]], is a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic system of letters]] that is expounded by later Hurufis in the ''Hidayat Namah'', ''Jawidan'' and in the ''Mahram Namah''.  The [[Universe]] is eternal and moves by rotation. [[Divine countenance]] is imperishable and is manifest in Man, the best of forms — ''zuhur kibriya''. God is [[panentheism|incarnated in every atom]]. Hurufis considered [[Fazlallah Astarabadi]] a manifestation of God's force after [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and [[Muhammad]]. God is also embodied in words and the 28 letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] and the 32 letters of Persian one are the basis for love and beauty in the world.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} [[7#Religion and mythology|Seven]] is a key number corresponding to noble parts of the face, the verses of ''[[Al-Fatiha]]'' and verbal confession of faith. Man is a supreme copy of the divine and the key to ''[[haqiqa]]''.

According to R. N. Frye's ''[[The Cambridge History of Iran]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |last=Frye |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2=Fisher, William Bayne |year=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-20094-6 |pages=624 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufism was an expression of [[Isma'ilism]] in its mystical identification of human figure, but differed in its recognition of ''haqiqa'' in the substance of letters rather than in the person of the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Imam]].

== Impact ==
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}} 
After his death [[Fazlallah Astarabadi|Nāimī]]'s ideas were developed and propagated by [[Imadaddin Nasimi|‘Alī ‘Imādu d-Dīn Nasīmī]] and [[Certain accursed ones of no significance|Ali-ul A'la]] in Azerbaijan and [[Seyid Ishag]] in Turkey. Poet [[Imadaddin Nasimi|Nasīmī]] (?–1417) and other Hurufis make [[kabbalistic]] tendencies subordinate to mystic concepts of [[Sufism]], and specifically those of [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]], who was another great influence on [[Imadaddin Nasimi|Nasīmī]].

Through [[Imadaddin Nasimi|Nasīmī]]'s poetry Hurufi ideas influenced, in different degrees, people like  [[Niyaz-i Misri]], [[Fuzûlî|Fuzuli]], Habibi, [[Khatai]] ([[Ismail I]]), and [[Rushani]]. The [[Bektashi order]] that still is active in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]] was a repository for the Hurufi teachings and writings.  One of Nasîmî's personal students, Rafî'î, emigrated into the Balkans.  He transmitted a central thesis of Hurufism, that the cardinalities of the Arabic and Persian alphabet respectively enumerate all types of shape and sound, by axes of symmetry. A Hurufi rebellion in Kwarezem was suppressed by the Mongols, and that motivated the exodus of Hurufis to the Balkans. The Bektashi manuscripts show almost 500 years of Hurufism in the Balkans, with a peak in the 1700s. Other Sufi orders, such as the [[Qadiriyya]] and the [[Naqshbandi]], contributed in the collection, retrieval, and translation of Hurufi manuscripts. From the Balkans, a great number of records were recorded in what is today Albania, but the relation between Bektashism and Hurufism is evidenced from Greek transcriptions. In total, many of the Hurufi manuscripts that are existent today were safeguarded in the libraries of Bektashi lodges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ||last1 = Usluer | first1 = Fatih | last2 = Yildiz | first2 = Fırat | year = 2010 | title= Hurufism among Albanian Bektashis | journal =  The Journal of International Social Research | volume = 3 | issue = 15 | page= 268-280 | url = http://fatihusluer.com/archive/USLUER%20Hurufism%20among%20Albanian%20Bektashis.pdf| format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufi terms and concepts permeate Bektashi poetry. [[Gül Baba (poet)|Gül Baba]] provided an extensive compendium of Hurufi ideas in ''The Key to the Unseen''.

The [[Shattari]] ''[[tariqah]]'' is a contemporary repository of ''Hurf-e-Muqattiyat'' (secrets of the alphabets).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sufishattari.com/IntroductionMain.htm Shattari] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420074808/http://www.sufishattari.com/IntroductionMain.htm |date=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Transhumanism}}

The '''Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies''' ('''IEET''') is a "[[technoprogressive]] [[think tank]]" that seeks to contribute to understanding of the likely impact of [[emerging technologies]] on individuals and societies by "promoting and publicizing the work of thinkers who examine the [[science and technology studies|social implications of scientific and technological advance]]".&lt;ref name = about/&gt;&lt;ref name="Felsted"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Felsted |first1=Katarina | last2=Wright  | first2=Scott D. | date=2014  |title=Toward Post Ageing: Technology in an Ageing Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7deBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Institute%20for%20Ethics%20and%20Emerging%20Technologies%22&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=Institute%20for%20ethics%20and%20emerging%20technologies&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Springer |page=109 |isbn=9783319090511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herkert"&gt;Joseph R.

II.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The IEET works with [[Humanity Plus]] (also founded and chaired by Bostrom and Hughes, and previously known as the World Transhumanist Association),&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; an international [[non-governmental organization]] with a similar mission but with an [[activist]] rather than [[academic]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/07/29/ethics-and-policy-concerns-in-the-transhuman-transition/ Daniel Faggella, Ethics and Policy Concerns in the Transhuman Transition, Humanity+, (July 29, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of technoprogressive thinkers are offered honorary positions as IEET [[Fellow]]s. Individuals who have accepted such appointments with the IEET support the institute's mission, but they have expressed a wide range of views about emerging technologies and not all identify themselves as transhumanists. In early Oct 2012, Kris Notaro became the Managing Director of the IEET.

==Activities==

===Publications===
The Institute publishes, the ''Journal of Evolution and Technology'' (JET), a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]].&lt;ref name = programs&gt;[http://www.ieet.org/index.php/IEET/programs Programs and Activities, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, (Retrieved Dec. 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; JET was established in 1998 as the ''Journal of Transhumanism'' and obtained its current title in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/blackford20140928 |title=Transhumanism and The Journal of Evolution and Technology |last1=Blackford |first1=Russel |last2= |first2= |date=September 18, 2014 |website= |publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies |access-date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Russell Blackford]].&lt;ref name = programs/&gt; It covers [[Futurology|futurological research]] into long-term developments in [[science]], [[technology]], and [[philosophy]] that "many mainstream journals shun as too speculative, radical, or interdisciplinary."&lt;ref name = programs/&gt;  The Institute also maintains a technology and ethics blog that is supported by various writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieet.org/index.php/IEET/IEETblog Blog, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, (Retrieved Dec. 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs===
In 2006, the IEET launched the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies - Programs and Activities|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Securing the Future'': Identification and advocacy for global solutions to [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|threats to the future of civilization]].
#''Rights of the Person'': Campaign to deepen and broaden the concept of [[human rights]].
#''Longer, Better Lives'': Case for longer healthier lives, addressing objections to [[life extension]], challenge [[ageist]] and [[ableist]] attitudes that discourage the full utilization of health technology.
#''Envisioning the Future'': Collection of images of posthumanity and non-human intelligence, positive, negative and neutral, e.g., in [[science fiction]] and popular culture; engagement with cultural critics, artists, writers, and filmmakers in exploring the lessons to be derived from these.

===Conferences===
In late May 2006, the IEET held the Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights conference at the [[Stanford University]] Law School in Stanford, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies - Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/HETHR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IEET along with other progressive organizations hosted a conference in December 2013 at Yale University on giving various species "personhood" rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/experts-gather-at-yale-to-discuss-whether-animals-are-1480618670 George, Dvorsky Experts Gather at Yale to Discuss Whether Animals Are People, Io9, (Dec. 10, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/personhood-beyond-the-human-conference Personhood Beyond the Human Conference, Kurzweil, (Retrieved Dec 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://figureground.org/personhood-beyond-the-human/ Conference: Personhood Beyond the Human, Figure / Ground, (Retrieved Dec. 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nonhumanrights.net Personhood Beyond the Human, (Retrieved Dec. 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2013/04/16/personhood-beyond-the-human/ Michael Mountain, Personhood Beyond the Human, Nonhuman Rights Project, (April 16, 2013).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231001104/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2013/04/16/personhood-beyond-the-human/ |date=December 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows of the Institute represent the Institute at various conferences and events, including the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieet.org/index.php/IEET/calendar Events, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, (Retrieved Dec. 30, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Wesley J. Smith]] wrote that the Institute has one of the most active transhumanist websites, and the writers write on the "nonsense of uploading minds into computers and fashioning a post humanity."&lt;ref name ="wesley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/328021/transhumanism-religion-atheists-wesley-j-smith|title=Transhumanism is Religion for Atheists|last1=Smith |first1=Wesley |last2= |first2= |date=June 6, 2012 |website= |publisher=[[National Review]] |access-date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also criticized the results of the Institute's online poll that indicated the majority of Institute's readers are [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name="wesley"/&gt; According to Smith, this was evidence that transhumanism is a religion and a desperate attempt to find purpose in a nihilistic and materialistic world.&lt;ref name="wesley"/&gt; The Institute's advocacy project to raise the status of animals to the legal status of personhood also drew criticism from Smith because he claimed [[Anthropocentrism|humans are exceptional]] and raising the status of animals may lower the status of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2011/02/transhumanists-launch-campaign-for-animal-personhood |title=Transhumanist Launch Campaign for Animal Personhood |last1=Smith |first1=Wesley |last2= |first2= |date=February 13, 2011 |website= |publisher=[[National Review]] |access-date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katarina Felsted and Scott D. Wright wrote that although the IEET considers itself technoprogressive some of its views can be described as strong transhumanism or a "radical version of post ageing," and one particular criticism of both moderate and strong transhumanism is that moral arbitrariness undermine both forms of transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Felsted"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">'''Jacqueline Lichtenstein''' (1947) is a French philosopher, art historian, and professor of aesthetics and the philosophy of art at the [[University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/IMG/pdf/Jacqueline_LICHTENSTEIN.pdf Jacqueline LICHTENSTEIN - Université Paris-Sorbonne pdf] "Jacqueline Lichtenstein. Professeur des universités, 17° section. UFR philosophie-Sociologie. Directrice adjointe de l'UFR de Philosophie-Sociologie ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franceculture.fr/plateformes-jacqueline-lichtenstein Jacqueline Lichtenstein - France Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work focuses on 17th- and 18th-century art, and the ways in which people think, talk, and theorize about art. Another theme of her work is the shift, since the 17th century, in how people think about the amateur.

== Career ==

Lichtenstein has taught at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Paris X-Nanterre, and at the University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne, among other places. She has published numerous articles in French and American journals.

She is the joint director of a philosophy and sociology training and research unit at University Paris IV-Sorbonne, where she coordinates a master’s program in aesthetics and philosophy of art. She is also in charge of the series "Essays on art and philosophy" (Aesthetics and philosophy of art), founded by [[Henri Gouhier]] in 1949 and published by [[Editions Vrin]].

== The eloquence of color ==

A central theme of Lichtenstein's work is the reception of color by various disciplines, such as philosophy, art, sociology, and ethics. A focal point for her analysis is the antagonistic relationship between color and the notion of the design or plan of a work (in 17th-century French, the ''dessein'' of the work, etymologically related to ''dessin'', drawing).

Philosophically suspect due to its material character, morally culpable because of its seductive luster, color, in Lichtenstein's view, has long been deemed aesthetically dangerous, the source of a pleasure and a beauty that does not, at first blush, seem connected with the True and the Good. This is, she argues, one aspect of an ongoing conflict between reason and the universe of sensible forms. Painting not being reducible to drawing, it is a source of disunity and disorder in our systems of knowledge, one which elicits an experience of "lack" (''insuffisance'').

The history of this conflict, she argues, begins in Platonic thought, which condemns color and rhetoric equally. The arts of speech and those of imagery are thus definitively linked. A central later figure is [[Roger de Piles]], the leader of the [[Rubenist]]s, the partisans of color (''coloris''). The Rubenists broke with the Platonic tradition and defended illusion, makeup, and seduction. They shifted, Lichtenstein maintains, the focus to those feminine aspects of representation, that is the suspected and cursed elements. They made these the essence of painting.

From that point onward, painting was linked with the linguistically inexpressible. Only the gaze may be spoken of, not the picture itself. This, argues Lichtenstein, was the birth of aesthetics, in the sense that the word was to take on in the 17th century.

'''Jean-Yves Lacoste''' is a French philosopher. Lacoste is associated with what [[Dominique Janicaud]] called the "theological turn in phenomenology", along with other influential French phenomenologists like [[Michel Henry]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]] and [[Jean-Louis Chrétien]].&lt;ref&gt;Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française, Paris, Éditions de l'Éclat, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacoste's work straddles philosophy and theology, and displays an interest in what might be called [[postmodern]] themes. He works in [[Paris]] and [[Cambridge]] and has a life membership at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell "&gt;{{cite book | author=Ward, Graham R. |title=The Blackwell Companion to Postmodern Theology |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2001 |pages=394 |isbn=0-631-21217-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BsuCm-SG8xsC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;vq=lacoste |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lacoste's influential 1994 book ''Experience and the Absolute'' argues against the modern prizing of "religious experience" and defends the view that God is knowable as lovable but does not give himself by way of experience or feeling.&lt;ref name="artsandsciences.virginia.edu"&gt;http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/pbrlect/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lacoste delivered the James W. Richards lectures at the [[University of Virginia]] while he was a Visiting Professor of Religious Studies. His paper, "From Theology to Theological Thinking", called for erasing rigid distinctions between philosophical and theological disciplines.&lt;ref name="artsandsciences.virginia.edu"/&gt;

'''Jean George Pierre Nicod''' (1893, France &amp;ndash; 16 February 1924, [[Geneva]], Switzerland) was a French [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[logician]].

==Biography==
In his best known work, he showed that the classical [[propositional calculus]] could be derived from one axiom and one rule, both expressed using the [[Sheffer stroke]]. He also proposed the [[Nicod's axiom]] and developed [[Nicod's criterion]].

Nicod died at the age of 31 from [[tuberculosis]].

See also [[Carl Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]].

== Legacy ==
The [[Institut Jean Nicod]] (Paris) &amp;mdash; a branch of the French ''Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique'' ([[CNRS]]) -- is research laboratory at the interface between  [[cognitive science]] and the [[social science]]s &amp;mdash; was named in honour of Nicod's memory. Jean Nicod's name is also commemorated by the prestigious [[Jean Nicod Prize|Jean Nicod Lectures]], delivered annually in Paris by a leading [[philosopher of mind]] or philosophically oriented [[cognitive scientist]], and published as a series by the [[MIT Press]]. The lecturer is awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] by the [[CNRS]].

He was the [[White's Chair of Moral Philosophy|White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and a [[Fellow]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].

==Biography==
Broome was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], at the [[University of London]] and at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he received a PhD in [[economics]]. Before arriving at Oxford he was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of St. Andrews]] and, prior to that, Professor of Economics and Philosophy at the [[University of Bristol]]. He has held visiting posts at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[Australian National University]], [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Washington]], the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences]], and the [[University of Canterbury]]. In 2007 Broome was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

His book ''Weighing Goods'' (1991) explores the way in which goods "located" in each of the three "dimensions" &amp;mdash; time, people, states of nature—make up overall goodness. Broome argues that these dimensions are linked by what he calls the ''interpersonal addition theorem'', which supports the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] principle of distribution. In his book ''Weighing Lives'' (2004), Broome rejects the presumed intuition that adding people to the population is ethically neutral. In his collection of papers, titled ''Ethics out of Economics'' (1999), he discusses topics such as [[Value (economics)|value]], [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[Social justice|fairness]], and [[utility]].

Initially formed as a traditional continuing education center for practicing clergy, the foundation gradually evolved into a self-directed education model where most of the students and faculty reside around the globe. Faculty come from a broad spectrum of faith backgrounds, and many also serve on the faculty of established colleges and universities, including the [[University of Oxford]], with which the Foundation has a continuing education affiliation through the Oxford Theology Summer School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/details.php?id=V610-16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement''''' is a 2001 work of [[political philosophy]] by [[John Rawls]], a revision of his 1971 classic ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971).

==Background==
This shorter summary of the main arguments of Rawls' political philosophy was edited by Erin Kelly. Prior to publication, many versions were circulated in typescript and much of the material was delivered by Rawls in lectures when he taught courses covering his own work at Harvard University.

==Summary==
''Justice as Fairness'' is a revision of Rawls's ''A Theory of Justice'' (1971). Rawls is responding to criticism as well as adding further thought to his earlier ''A Theory of Justice''.  It was written shortly before his death in 2002. In part I, he discusses several fundamental ideas, all of which are familiar to a reader of his earlier book as well as ''Political Liberalism'' (1995): a well-ordered society; the basic structure of society; the original position; free and equal persons; public justification; reflective equilibrium; and overlapping consensus.  In part II, he moves on to his principles of justice, revising them from his earlier edition, which now read (p. 42):

(a) Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all; and

(b) Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle).
 	
In part III, Rawls expands on his argument for the two principles of the ''[[Original position]]''.  Here he brings in a new concept, that of ''[[Public reason]]'', an idea that is not well discussed in ''Theory of Justice''.  
	
Part IV takes the reader to public institutions that will be present in a just and fair society.  He lists five types of social systems: 
# [[Laissez-faire capitalism]]
# [[Welfare capitalism|Welfare-state capitalism]]
# [[State socialism]] with a command economy
# [[Property-owning democracy]]
# [[Democratic Socialism|Liberal (democratic) socialism]]. 

Rawls holds that the first three "[violate] the two principles of justice in at least one way" (p. 137), thus leaving only (4) property-owning democracy and (5) liberal socialism as the "ideal descriptions" that include "arrangements designed to satisfy the two principles of justice" (p. 138). 
In part V he explains why political liberalism is not only possible, but why it is not utopian thinking to believe that such a society is possible.

Looking primarily at the twentieth century United States, he is certain that institutions within US society are causing injustices.  The very expensive campaign system essentially rules out all but the very rich from even deciding to run for public office.  The expense of healthcare restricts the best care to those who can afford it, leaving the poor to only the most basic of services.

'''Karel Kosík''' (26 June 1926 – 21 February 2003) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Neomarxist]] [[philosopher]]. In his most famous philosophical work, ''Dialectics of the Concrete'' (1963), Kosík presents an original synthesis of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s version of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the ideas of [[Karl Marx]]. His later essays can be called a sharp critique of the modern society from a [[leftist]] position.

==Biography==

Karel Kosík was born on 26 June 1926 in [[Prague]].

From 1 September 1943 until his arrest by the [[Gestapo]] on 17 November 1944, he was a member of an illegal [[anti-nazi]] [[communist]] [[resistance group]] ''Předvoj'' (The Vanguard) and a chief editor of an illegal journal ''Boj mladých'' (The Fight of Youth). After his seizure Kosík was accused of [[high treason]] and repeatedly questioned. From 30 January to 5 May 1945 he was imprisoned in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].

From 1945 to 1947, Kosík studied philosophy and sociology at the [[Charles University in Prague]]. In the years 1947–1949, he also attended courses at the [[Leningrad University]] and the [[Moscow State University]] in the [[USSR]]. He graduated in 1950 in Prague at the Charles University. In this part of his life he met his future wife [[Růžena Grebeníčková]] (later laureate of [[Herder Prize]]), from this marriage came three children (Antonín Kosík, [[Irena Kosíková]] and Štěpán Kosík). In 1963, he published his ''[[wikt:magnum opus|magnum opus]]'', ''Dialectics of the Concrete'', a re-working of Marxian categories in terms of humanist [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which earned him an international reputation as a leading philosopher of [[Marxist Humanism|humanist Marxism]]. During the "[[Prague Spring]]" of 1968, Kosík became a leading voice for [[democratic socialism]] (a distinction he shared with [[Ivan Sviták]], Czechoslovakia's other prominent Marxist humanist). This political engagement led to Kosík's dismissal from university work in 1970, after the period of democratization had ended. He remained unemployed until 1990, when he returned to public intellectual life as one of Central Europe's few prominent leftist social critics.

==Legacy==
Spanish-Mexican Marxist [[Adolfo Sánchez Vázquez]] wrote in the prologue for the Mexican edition that he considered ''Dialectics of the Concrete'' to be "one of the richest in thinking, [one of the] most charming and attractive works as we know it in Marxist literature".{{sfn|Sánchez Vázquez|1967}} French-Brazilian Marxist [[Michael Löwy]] and Argentine historian Horacio Tarcus wrote for ''[[Le Monde]]'':

{{quote|Karel Kosik is not only one of the most important philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century, but also one of those who best embodied the spirit of resistance of critical thinking. He is also one of the few who have fought in succession the three major forces of oppression of modern history: Fascism in the 1940s, the Stalinist bureaucratic regime in 1956, and the dictatorship of market since 1989. At a time when so many thinkers have abdicated their autonomy to serve the powerful of this world, or turned away from the historical reality to engage in academic language games, Kosik appears as a standing man who refuses to bow down, and who does not hesitate to think, against the current, [about] the major problems of the time.{{sfn|''Le Monde'' 2004}}}}

The Institute of Philosophy of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]] (CAS) held a conference on Kosík's ''œuvre'' between 4 and 6 June 2014 in Prague.{{sfn|Czech Academy of Sciences 2014a}} Organized by Ivan Landa, Jan Mervart, and Joseph Grim Feinberg, it had people from around the world discussing the impact of Kosík's thought on "issues that are still relevant today".{{sfn|Czech Academy of Sciences 2014a}}{{sfn|Czech Academy of Sciences 2014b}} Landa and Mervat are working on a "critical edition" of "everything Kosík had ever published or written for print during his lifetime", includinga books, essays and short notes.{{sfn|''Lefteast'' 2016}} To be published in Czech, it is planned to have seven volumes, out of which three are complete as of September 2016: one of essays on political activities and on the Czech radical democrats of 1848; a volume of essays on culture and politics from the period of 1956–1967; and a re-edition of ''Dialectics of the Concrete'' and philosophical essays the same time period.{{sfn|''Lefteast'' 2016}} Also, with funding from the CAS Landa and Mervat are translating texts to published "a comprehensive English volume" on Kosík'.{{sfn|''Lefteast'' 2016}}

'''The Seal of the Saints''' or '''"Khatam ul Awliya"''' is a central concept in the writings of 12th-century [[Islamic]] thinker and spiritual leader [[Ibn Arabi]].

== Concept of ''The Seal of the Saints'' in Ibn Arabi's writings ==

Ibn Arabi (1165-1240), in his ''"[[Mecca]]n Revelation"'' (''"Futuhati Maqiyya"''),&lt;ref name="Meccan1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Meccan Revelations 1 | publisher=Pir Press |author1=Al Arabi, Ibn |author2=Chodkiewicz, Michel |author3=Morris, James W. | year=2002 | isbn=978-1-879708-16-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that all the prophets and saints derive their light from the spirit of [[Muhammad]], the [[Islamic prophet|prophet of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Seal of the Saints: Prophethood and Sainthood in the Doctrine of Ibn 'Arabi | publisher=Fons Vitae | author=Chodkiewicz, Michel | isbn=0-946621-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ibn Arabi's thinking, the prophets and saints are manifestations of the spirit of Muhammad, which is the start and end point of the whole spiritual hierarchy.  The first manifestation of the spirit of Muhammad was the first man, [[Adam]]. The last and most perfect was Muhammad himself.

=== Two lines of spiritual transmission ===

In the [[Mysticism|mystical]] branch of Islam, [[Sufism]], there are two main lines of spiritual transmission:

#  The 40 [[tariqa]]s, which trace their line of Spiritual Transmission through Ali Ibn abi Thalib to the prophet Muhammad. The Seal of Saints of the 40 Tariqas line is said to be Ibn Arabi himself.&lt;ref&gt;Toshihiko Izutsu. ''Sufism and Taoism'', page 270&lt;/ref&gt;
# The chain of transmission which runs through Abu Bakr us Siddique to Muhammad. The Seal of Saints of the Abu Bakr as Siddique line is Abdullah Faiz Dagistani. This is the [[Naqshbandi]] (or Siddiqi) Tariqa.&lt;ref name=Nazim&gt;[http://www.sheiknazim2.com/khatmulawliya.html Khatm ul Awliya (The Seal of Saints), Sheikh Abdullah Faiz Daghistan] Retrieved 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi, in his book ''"The Astonishing Phoenix – on the Seal of the Saints and the Sun of the West"'', explains that the name of the Seal of Saints is Abdullah, who is a despised [[ajami]].&lt;ref name=Nazim /&gt;  Ibn Arabi describes the Seal of Saints in detail, using notably difficult symbolic language.

Similarly, Sharafuddin ad Dagistani, Moulana Sheikh Nazim and Adnan Kabbani explain that the Seal of Saints of the Siddiqi or Naqshbandi Tariqa is Abdullah Faiz Dagistani.&lt;ref name=Nazim /&gt;

      <comment>/* The moral */They mistaked Socrates for Plato</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10185">[[File:Plato Republic manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A Renaissance manuscript Latin translation of ''The Republic'']]
'''The Myth of Er''' is a legend that concludes [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (10.614–10.621). The story includes an account of the cosmos and the afterlife that greatly influenced religious, philosophical, and scientific thought for many centuries.

The story begins as a man named Er ({{IPAc-en|ɜr}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἤρ}}, ''gen''.: Ἠρός; not to be confused with [[Eros]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ἔρως|Ἔρως]]}})); son of Ἀρμένιος, ''Armenios'' of [[Pamphylia]] dies in battle. When the bodies of those who died in the battle are collected, ten days after his death, Er remains undecomposed. Two days later he revives on his funeral-pyre and tells others of his journey in the [[afterlife]], including an account of [[metempsychosis|reincarnation]] and the [[celestial spheres]] of the [[astral plane]]. The tale includes the idea that moral people are rewarded and immoral people punished after death.

Although called the Myth of Er, the word "myth" means "word, speech, account", rather than the modern meaning. The word is used at the end when Socrates explains that because Er did not drink the waters of [[Lethe]], the account (''mythos'' in Greek) was preserved for us.

==Er's tale==
{{Platonism}}
With many other souls as his companions, Er had come across an awe-inspiring place with four openings &amp;ndash; two into and out of the sky and two into and out of the ground. Judges sat between these openings and ordered the souls which path to follow: the good were guided into the path into the sky, the immoral were directed below. But when Er approached the judges, he was told to remain, listening and observing in order to report his experience to humankind.

Meanwhile from the other opening in the sky, clean souls floated down, recounting beautiful sights and wondrous feelings. Those  returning from underground appeared dirty, haggard, and tired, crying in despair when recounting their awful experiences, as each was required to pay a tenfold penalty for all the wicked deeds committed when alive. There were some, however, who could not be released from underground. [[Murder]]ers, [[tyrant]]s and other non-political criminals were doomed to remain by the exit of the underground, unable to escape.

After seven days in the meadow, the souls and Er were required to travel farther. After four days they reached a place where they could see a shaft of [[rainbow]] light brighter than any they had seen before. After another day's travel they reached it. This was the Spindle of Necessity. Several women, including [[Ananke (mythology)|Lady Necessity]], her daughters, and the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s were present. The souls &amp;ndash; except for Er &amp;ndash; were then organized into rows and were each given a [[lottery]] token.

Then, in the order in which their lottery tokens were chosen, each soul was required to come forward to choose his or her next life. Er recalled the first one to choose a new life: a man who had not known the terrors of the underground but had been rewarded in the sky, hastily chose a powerful dictatorship. Upon further inspection he realized that, among other atrocities, he was destined to eat his own children. Er observed that this was often the case of those who had been through the path in the sky, whereas those who had been punished often chose a better life. Many preferred a life different from their previous experience. Animals chose human lives while humans often chose the apparently easier lives of animals.

After this, each soul was assigned a guardian spirit to help him or her through their life. They passed under the throne of Lady Necessity, then traveled to the Plane of Oblivion, where the River of Forgetfulness (River [[Lethe]]) flowed. Each soul was required to drink some of the water, in varying quantities; again, Er only watched. As they drank, each soul forgot everything. As they lay down at night to sleep each soul was lifted up into the night in various directions for rebirth, completing their journey. Er remembered nothing of the journey back to his body. He opened his eyes to find himself lying on the funeral pyre early in the morning, able to recall his journey through the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Er's tale is abridged from Desmond Lee's translation in the Penguin/Harmondsworth edition of ''The Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The moral==
In the dialogue [[Plato]] introduces the story by explaining to his questioner, [[Glaucon]], that the soul must be immortal, and cannot be destroyed. Plato tells Glaucon the "Myth of Er" to explain that the choices we make and the character we develop will have consequences after death. In Book II of the ''Republic'', Socrates points out that even the gods can be tricked by a clever charlatan who appears just while unjust in his psyche, in that they would welcome the pious but false "man of the people" and would reject and punish the truly just but falsely accused man. Thus in the ''Myth of Er'', when the gods send all men to choose another life, the true characters of the falsely-pious and those whose are immodest in some way are revealed when they choose the lives of tyrants. Those who lived happy but middling lives in their previous life are most likely to choose the same for their future life, not necessarily because they are wise, but out of habit. Those who were treated with infinite injustice, despairing of the possibility of a good human life, choose the souls of animals for their future incarnation. It is through the careful cultivation of attention to the types of lives that emerge from a combination of experience, character, and fate—through the practice of philosophy, in other words—that men knowingly make good choices when confronted with the possibility of a new life. No matter how life treats one or how successful or famous or powerful one becomes, one way or the other, or even, as in the Myth, how many temporary heavenly rewards or hellish punishments one experiences, these virtues will always work to one's advantage.

==The Spindle of Necessity==
The myth mentions "The Spindle of Necessity", in that the cosmos is represented by the Spindle attended by [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s and the three daughters of the Goddess Necessity known collectively as [[Moirai|The Fates]], whose duty is to keep the rims of the spindle revolving. The Fates, Sirens, and Spindle are used in ''The Republic'', partly to help explain how known celestial bodies revolved around the Earth according to Plato's cosmology.

The "Spindle of Necessity", according to Plato, is "shaped . . . like the ones we know"—the standard Greek [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]], consisting of a hook, shaft, and [[Spindle whorl|whorl]]. The hook was fixed near the top of the shaft on its long side. On the other end resided the whorl. The hook was used to spin the shaft, which in turn spun the whorl on the other end. 
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|250px|''The classical heavens'']]
Placed on the whorl of his celestial spindle were 8 "orbits",&lt;!--Greek term?--&gt; whereof each created a perfect circle. Each "orbit" is given different descriptions by Plato.

Based on Plato's descriptions within the passage, the orbits can be identified as those of the [[classical planets]], corresponding to the Aristotelian [[planetary sphere]]s:

*Orbit 1 - Stars
*Orbit 2 - Saturn
*Orbit 3 - Jupiter
*Orbit 4 - Mars
*Orbit 5 - Mercury
*Orbit 6 - Venus
*Orbit 7 - Sun
*Orbit 8 - Moon

The descriptions of the rims accurately fit the relative distance and revolution speed of the respective bodies as would appear to an observer from Earth (aside from the Moon, which revolves around the Earth slightly more slowly than the sun).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31519">A '''nuclear-free zone''' is an area in which [[nuclear weapons]] (see [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]) and [[nuclear power]] [[power station|plants]] are banned. The specific ramifications of these depend on the locale in question.

Nuclear-free zones usually neither address nor prohibit [[radiopharmaceuticals]] used in [[nuclear medicine]] even though many of them are produced in nuclear reactors. They typically do not prohibit other nuclear technologies such as [[cyclotrons]] used in particle physics.

Several sub-national authorities worldwide have declared themselves "nuclear-free". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated at higher levels of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse nuclear-free zones via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared nuclear-free zones.

[[Palau]] became the first nuclear-free nation in 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|last2=Roff|first2=Sue Rabbitt|title=Micronesia: the problem of Palau|date=1984|publisher=Minority Rights Group|location=London|isbn=9780946690145|page=13|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] was the first Western-allied nation to legislate towards a [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|national nuclear free zone]] by effectively renouncing the [[nuclear deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lange|first=David|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear-free zone by geographical areas==

===Australia===
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

Many Australian [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of Australia have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation; notable among these are [[Brisbane]], capital of Queensland, which has been nuclear weapon free since 1983, and the South and North Sydney councils. However the passage of such legislation is generally considered just a symbolic measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear-free city? Afraid no|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/nuclearfree-city-afraid-not/2009/03/18/1237054855860.html|accessdate=6 Feb 2014|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of councils which have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation are members of the Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat which has 44 member councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | publisher=Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201519/http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | archivedate=22 February 2014 | title=[Untitled leaflet]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
Austria is a nuclear free zone, when a nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at [[Zwentendorf]], [[Austria]], start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. The completed power plant is now marketed as a shooting location for film and television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-power-plant.net/index.php?lang=en&amp;item=location Zwentendorf – location&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1997, the [[Parliament of Austria|Austrian Parliament]] voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/478/aai.html |publisher=WISE News Communique |date=September 26, 1997 |title=Coalition of Nuclear-Free Countries |accessdate=2006-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223141723/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww10.antenna.nl%2Fwise%2F478%2Faai.html |archivedate=February 23, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the headquarters of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] is located in Vienna, and the IAEA maintains nuclear laboratories both in Vienna and Seibersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910162745/http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA has also established programs to assist nuclear energy projects in developing countries.

Austria's anti-nuclear stance also causes tension with its nuclear neighbors. Vienna is located close to the Czech reactor at [[Temelin]], and four reactors are being built in neighboring Slovakia and two in neighboring Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16359991 | work=BBC News | title=Austria and Czech Republic divided over nuclear power | date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria also draws from regional electricity grids, meaning it imports nuclear power, although chancellor Werner Faymann has pledged to eliminate Austria's reliance on foreign power by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.myeurop.info/2011/07/11/nucleaire-l-autriche-se-debranche-des-2015-2936 Nucléaire: l'Autriche se débranche dès 2015&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[Vancouver]] is a nuclear weapons free city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoning &amp; Development Bylaw 3575, Section 10|url=http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/zoning/sec10.pdf|publisher=City of Vancouver|page=10.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, British Columbia]] is also a nuclear weapons free city. This has caused problems as nearby Esquimalt houses [[CFB Esquimalt]], Canada's Pacific naval base, which is used frequently by the [[United States Navy]]. The USN routinely sends ships or aircraft carriers loaded with nuclear weapons to Esquimalt. As a result, the ships are forced to dock out of the city limits as not to violate the city by-laws.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}The policy does not limit operations at [[TRIUMF]], Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The province of [[British Columbia]] also bans mining for uranium, and the construction of nuclear power plants within its territorial limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html EnergyBC: Nuclear Power&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307170021/http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanaimo, British Columbia]], [[Kitimat, British Columbia]]; [[Red Deer, Alberta]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] are also  nuclear weapons-free cities.

===Former Soviet Union===

====Central Asia====
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

All states of [[Central Asia]] have signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] and signed the [[Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone]] treaty. Thus, there are no technologies to create a weapon or enrich the particles, but in [[Tajikistan]], during the Soviet Union, such initiatives were brought to life, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the facilities were dismantled and moved to the [[Russian Federation]]. The Treaty came into force on 21 March 2009.

====Estonia====
{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
After Estonia [[Singing Revolution#Estonia|seceded from the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, Estonia became a nuclear-free country.  
The two land-based [[nuclear reactor]]s at the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Nuclear navy|nuclear submarine]] training centre in [[Paldiski]] were removed when Russia finally relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.
There are no nuclear power stations in Estonia.

===Japan===
[[File:Kobe City view from Po-ai Shiosai Park01s3.jpg|thumb|350px|Nuclear-free [[Kobe Port]], seen from Po-ai Shiosai Park in 2011]]

{{main article|Japan's non-nuclear policy}}

As a resource-poor nation, Japan is heavily reliant on nuclear power, but its unique experience in [[World War II]] has led to the wholesale rejection of nuclear weapons, holding nuclear weapons shall not be manufactured in, possessed by, or allowed entry into Japan. These tenets, known as the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], were first stated by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Eisaku Satō]] in 1967, and were adopted as a parliamentary resolution in 1971, though they have never formally been entered into law. They continue to reflect the attitudes of both government and the general public, who remain staunchly opposed to the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons.

The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] have never made any attempt to manufacture or otherwise obtain nuclear arms, and no nuclear weapons are known to have been introduced into the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] since the end of [[World War II]]. While the United States does not maintain nuclear bases within its military installations on the Home Islands, it is believed to have once stored weapons at [[Okinawa]], which remained under US administrative jurisdiction until 1972.

===Italy===
{{main article|Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987}}
Italy is a nuclear free zone since the Italian nuclear power referendum of November 1987. Following center-right parties' victory in the 2008 election, Italy's industry minister announced that the government scheduled the construction to start the first new Italian nuclear-powered plant by 2013. The announced project was paused in March 2011, after the Japanese earthquake, and scrapped after a referendum on 12–13 June 2011.

===New Zealand===
{{main article|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone}}

In 1984, Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using [[New Zealand]] ports or entering New Zealand waters.  Under the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"&gt;[http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/peace/nukefree.html Nuclear Free Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; territorial sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ship free zones. It does not ban nuclear power stations. A research reactor was operated by the University of Canterbury until 1981. Official planning for a nuclear power station continued until the 1980s. A nuclear reactor provided electricity for McMurdo Station, in the New Zealand Antarctic Territory from 1962–1972.

The Act prohibits "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 miles (22.2 km) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" and bans the dumping of [[radioactive waste]] within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device."&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill – Green Party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630032138/http://greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html |date=2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the firm policy of the United States to "neither confirm nor deny" whether particular naval vessels carry nuclear weapons, the Act effectively bars these ships from entering New Zealand waters.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite book

New Zealand's security treaty with the United States, [[ANZUS]], did not mention nuclear deterrence and did not require unconditional port access. However, after New Zealand refused entry to [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']], the [[United States]] government suspended its [[ANZUS]] obligations to New Zealand, seeing New Zealand's effective rejection of United States Navy vessels as voiding the treaty. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Lange Labour government]] did not see their stance as incompatible with the treaty and sought a compromise for over two years before passing the Act.&lt;ref name="Pugh"/&gt; Support for the non-nuclear policy was bolstered by the perceived over-reaction of the United States and by the [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] by [[DGSE|French spies]] while docked in [[Auckland]]. According to some commentators, the legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4150550.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lange's impact on NZ and world | date=August 14, 2005 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110518224427/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/08/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-Nuclear-Landmark.php Nuclear threat continues to grow, New Zealand warns on anniversary of anti-nuclear law – International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]]’s three decade [[anti-nuclear]] campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The nuclear-free zone law does not make building land-based nuclear power plants illegal. However, the relatively small [[Electricity sector in New Zealand|electricity system]], abundance of other resources to generate electricity, and public opposition has meant a nuclear power plant has never gone beyond the investigation phase – a nuclear power plant was proposed north of [[Auckland]] in the early 1970s, but the discovery of large natural gas reserves in [[Taranaki region|Taranaki]] saw the proposal shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf97.html|title=Nuclear Energy Prospects in New Zealand|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=April 2009|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
Nuclear weapons-free Nordic (''Finn. Ydinaseeton Pohjola'') was an initiative by the [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the [[Nordic countries]]. The aim was to prevent the Nordic countries from becoming a nuclear battleground and a route for [[cruise missile]]s in the event of a nuclear war between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[NATO]].

Nuclear energy, however, is used in both [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

===Palau===
[[Palau]] adopted its first constitution in July 1979, stating that the Micronesian country would be "nuclear-free". The United States told the Palauan government that this constitution was likely incompatible with the [[Compact of Free Association]]. The Palauan government submitted a revised version of the constitution  without the "nuclear-free" clause the following October. The Palauan people rejected the revised document and instated the original constitution in July 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"/&gt; Seven years later, however, the Palauan people voted to overturn their nuclear-free status out of "economic survival".&lt;ref name="NY Times Palau"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/world/palau-drops-nuclear-free-status.html |title=Palau Drops Nuclear-Free Status |date=7 August 1987 |publisher=AP |work=The New York Times |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The Nuclear Free Zone Movement in the [[United Kingdom]] was very strong in early 1980s; up to two hundred local authorities including [[county council]]s, [[Districts of England|district council]]s and [[city council]]s such as the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) (before its abolition) declared themselves to be 'nuclear free'. The first 'nuclear-free zone' in the UK was [[Manchester City Council]] in 1980 – this still exists to this day.  Wales became 'nuclear free' on 23 February 1982 after Clwyd County Council declared itself 'nuclear free' and the Nuclear Free Wales Declaration was made.  This policy was legally underpinned by Section 137 of the Local Government Act, which allowed local authorities to spend a small amount on whatever members considered was in the interest of their area or a part of their area.

UK nuclear-free local authorities refused to take part in civil defence exercises relating to nuclear war, which they thought were futile. The non-cooperation of the nuclear-free zone authorities was the main reason for the cancellation of the national 'Hard Rock' [[civil defence]] exercise in July 1982.  In England and Wales 24 of the 54 county councils refused to participate and seven more co-operated only in a half-hearted way.&lt;ref&gt;Bolsover, Philip, "A victory – and a new development", in Minnion, J., and Bolsover, P., ''The CND Story'', London: Alison and Busby, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen as a victory for the [[Peace movement#United Kingdom|British Peace movement]] against the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Generally, nuclear-free zones were predominantly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] controlled councils but [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and even a few [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] councillors were often active in this respect too.

===United States===

A number of towns, cities and counties in the [[United States]] established themselves as Nuclear-Free Zones in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first was [[Missoula, Montana]]. In the November 1978 general election, Missoula voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative in the form of a land-use ordinance establishing the entirety of Missoula County as a "'nuclear free' zoning district" banning all nuclear facilities except those for medical purposes. (In the same election, Montana voters approved a statewide initiative by a 2–1 margin barring nuclear facilities or reactors without strict state-enforced regulatory standards and ratification by popular referendum, and in a follow-up 1980 initiative, Montanans narrowly voted to ban the disposal of nuclear waste.) That Missoula's measure was originally drafted as a zoning ordinance legally enforceable by the county planning department apparently created the popular term "Nuclear Free Zone" adopted as the name of the local political action group sponsoring the initiative and later used by other jurisdictions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the Missoula zoning ordinance, see Missoula Independent, Nov. 30, 2000, at: http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/reading-the-sign/Content?oid=1133059. For the zoning ordinance text as updated in 2007, see Missoula County, MT Nuclear Free Zone, at: http://greenpolicy360.net/index.php?title=Missoula_County%2C_MT_Nuclear_Free_Zone{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the tiny town of [[Garrett Park, Maryland]], attracted worldwide attention with its referendum in May, 1982. The following year, [[Takoma Park, Maryland]], was officially declared a nuclear-free zone in 1983 by then-mayor Sam Abbott. A citizen committee of the local city council continues to monitor city contracts. The city cannot hold contracts with any company associated with any aspect of nuclear weapons without a waiver from the citizen committee. In September 2005, Takoma Park took a stand against the transportation of high-level nuclear waste through the City. It voted to amend its Nuclear-Free Zone Ordinance to give its citizen committee responsibility to collect information and from this information and from consultations with individuals and organizations involved in the transportation of high-level nuclear waste, to advise the City on how to promote the safety and welfare of its citizens from harmful exposure to high-level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Takoma Park's nuclear-free history see: {{cite web |url=http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628032216/http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known nuclear-free community is [[Berkeley, California]], whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons-related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure. The City of Berkeley has posted signs at city limits proclaiming its nuclear free status. The ordinance specifies possible fines for such activities within its borders. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is deeply involved in the [[history of nuclear weapons]], and the [[University of California]] system until recently managed operations at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], a U.S. nuclear weapons design laboratory, and continues to manage the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. At the time of the passage of the act, the University operated a nuclear reactor for research purposes, the [[Etcheverry Hall|Etcheverry Reactor]], which it continued to operate after the act went into effect. The University of California, as a state institution, is not subject to Berkeley's municipal regulations, including the ban. Berkeley also has major freeway and train lines which are used in transporting nuclear materials.

On November 14, 1984 the [[Davis, California]] [[City Council]] declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daviswiki.org/Nuclear_Free_Zone Nuclear Free Zone – Davis Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis has major freeway and train arteries running through it which are used for transporting nuclear materials.  The [[University of California]], with a campus at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], runs a research reactor at the nearby former [[McClellan Air Force Base]], as well as workers who are involved with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On November 8, 1988 the city of [[Oakland, California]] passed "Measure T" with 57% of the vote, making that city a nuclear free zone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12656">'''Philippe Mottu''' is a [[Swiss]] diplomat, author and activist born on 9 October 1913 in [[Geneva]]; he died in [[Lonay]] ([[Vaud]]) on 23 August 2010.&lt;ref name = FPD&gt;[http://www.hommages.ch/Defunt/55122/Mottu_Phillipe Philippe Mottu's death notice]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, inspired by the American [[Frank Buchman]], he was instrumental in the acquisition of the former [[Caux Palace Hotel]], a dilapidated hotel above [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], by a group of about 100 Swiss, in order to create an international conference centre at the service of European reconciliation and reconstruction.&lt;ref name = PI&gt;[http://protestinfo.ch/201008245347/5347-caux-philippe-mottu-un-des-trois-fondateurs-meurt-a-96-ans.html Article published by the Swiss protestant news agency, Protestinfo, on 24 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a dozen of books of political and social philosophy.

== Biography ==

=== Background and youth ===
The scion of an old Geneva family whose ancestor Jacques Mottu had moved to Geneva towards 1597,&lt;ref&gt;From Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse en ligne, version of 15 January 2009. Article on the Mottu family, by Henry Mottu&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Mottu is the son of the pastor Henri Mottu, moderator of the « vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Genève », and of Marthe Mottu, née Reverdin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gen-gen.ch/MOTTU/Philippe+Alexandre/99263 Philippe Mottu's record on the Geneva Genealogy site]&lt;/ref&gt;
A graduate of the Political Science school of the Geneva University, he started his professional life in a bank. In 1933 he underwent a deep spiritual experience&lt;ref name = reg308&gt;Philippe Mottu, ''Regards sur le Siècle'', Éditions L’Âge d’Homme, Lausanne, 1996, 319 pages, {{ISBN|2825107867}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; which led him to undertake theology studies in [[Lausanne]]. There, his Latin professor, Jules Rochat, put him in touch with the [[Oxford Group]], soon to become [[Moral Rearmament]] (and currently [[Initiatives of Change]]). He was immediately won by the ideas and practice of the Oxford Group.

=== Moral Rearmament ===
[[File:13-mottus---buchman2.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mottu and his wife Hélène accompanying [[Frank Buchman]] in [[Caux-Palace|Caux]] in the early 1950s]]
In 1935, Philippe Mottu meets for the first time [[Frank Buchman]], the Oxford Group's founder who visits Geneva with a team in order to talk to [[League of Nations]] delegates. It is the beginning of a lifelong friendship, with its ups and downs, through which the two men will exchange abundant correspondence.&lt;ref name = ACV&gt;[http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=567276 Biography on the Vaud cantonal Archives’ site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, as European nations re-armed for war, Buchman called for 'moral and spiritual re-armament' as the way to build a 'hate-free, fear-free, greed-free world'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iofc.org/history History page the Initiatives of Change's website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiastic, Philippe Mottu became one of the main activists of Moral Reamament (MRA) in Switzerland. In this capacity he participated in numerous MRA actions at home and abroad, particularly the massive meeting of Palais Baulieu in Lausanne in 1937 (10’000 participants) or the international meeting of Interlaken in 1938.

In 1939 Philippe Mottu was called into active service and joined the "Army and Home" section at the Swiss Army's headquarters, probably at [[Henri Guisan|General Guisan]]'s request as the general partly relied on MRA to build up Swiss morale and resistance spirit.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;Frédéric Burnand, "Le Réarmement moral, un fil rouge dans l’histoire suisse", [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/changemaker_how-an-american-idea-influenced-swiss-morality/42259232 article on ''[[Swissinfo]]'' site on 29 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;
With [[Denis de Rougemont]] and [[Theophil Spoerri]], he took an active part in the setting up of the [[Gotthard League]], a civil society movement dedicated to countering "[[defeatism]] and deceptive [[propaganda]]" in the face of intense Nazi propaganda which Switzerland was subject to at the time. "We wanted to proclaim that our country would remain faithful to his multi-secular democratic tradition", he explained.&lt;ref name="ObIC"&gt;{{fr}}Andrew Stallybrass, Obituary of Philippe Mottu on Initiatives of Change site [http://fr.iofc.org/node/197]&lt;/ref&gt;

He then joined the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Bern]].

=== The war years ===
In 1940, Philippe Mottu established contact with a German diplomat in Bern, Herbert Blankenhorn, and, through him, with [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]], one of the leaders of [[German resistance to Nazism]]. Upon von Trott's invitation, Mottu travelled to Berlin in November 1942 where he meets with other members of the resistance. During a British bombardment, a top German Foreign Affairs official, Hans-Bernd von Haften, asked him: "As Christians, are we allowed to kill Hitler?&lt;ref name="ObIC"/&gt;"

Supported by the Swiss foreign minister, [[Marcel Pilet-Golaz]], Philippe Mottu continued his contacts with von Trott and offered to act as a liaison person between the allied powers and the German Resistance by travelling himself to the United States, even though it was difficult to travel outside Switzerland.  In April 1944, von Trott visited Switzerland where he was promised assistance to reach Lisbon, while [[Allen Dulles]], chief of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] in Switzerland, promised his assistance for a transatlantic trip. A few days after the joint US-British [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944, Mottu was in Stuttgart with von Trott and his group of friends : their [[coup]] was imminent. Mottu left for Washington having memorised all the names of the new German government.

To his despair, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and his advisors didn’t believe in the German resistance. Additionally on 20 July 1944, [[20 July plot|Operation Walkyrie]] failed. His worst fears became reality when, in the course of the following weeks and months, he got confirmation of the arrest and execution of all the main conspirators : von Trott, von Haften and hundreds of others...

=== Caux ===
Philippe Mottu had been deeply affected by his experience during WWII. In 1943 already, a recurring thought had come to him: "If Switzerland escapes the ravages of this war, its mission will be to create a venue where French and Germans will be able to reconcile and build peace. Caux is the place.&lt;ref name = PI/&gt;"

With the financial support of around 100 Swiss families, Philippe Mottu and one of his friends Robert Hahnloser bought the derelict [[Caux Palace Hotel]] in 1946. It was repaired and refurbished thanks to the efforts of the Swiss and international teams, and, between 1946 and 1950, it welcomed thousands of French and German participants, among whom [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Robert Schuman]], who will later rely on their exceptional mutual trust to launch the first steps of the European construction. The Caux summer conferences dedicated to peace and reconciliation are still taking place today.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

Philippe Mottu contributed to the governance of the Caux conference centre from 1946 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1973 as a member of the Caux Foundation council. He was the Foundation's first president, from 1946 to 1958.&lt;ref name = ACV/&gt; Later on, he increasingly turned to the writing of numerous political philosophy books.

== Family ==
On {{date|1 September 1939}}, Philippe Mottu married Hélène de Trey. They will have four children, and, on the date of Philippe Mottu's death, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name = FPD/&gt;

His younger brother Daniel Mottu&lt;ref&gt;Born on {{date|31 March 1923}} in [[Chêne-Bougeries]], he married Monique de Reynier on {{date|8 September 1967}}in [[Caux (Montreux)|Caux]], and died on {{date|2 Mayi 2002}} in Geneva.[http://m.gen-gen.ch/MOTTU/Daniel+Arnold/99361 Daniel Mottu's record on the Geneva genealogy website]&lt;/ref&gt; will be the Caux Foundation's president from 1977 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;A law graduate from Geneva University, he committed to working full-time for MRA, and lived for a long time in Latin America, mainly in Brazil from 1952 to 1964. He became a member of the council of the Caux Foundation in 1958, which he presided from 1977 to 1987. [http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=566902 Biographic note on Daniel Mottu on the [[Vaud]] Cantonal Archives site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Philippe Mottu wrote several books on international, political and social issues. Building on a vast culture and on a rigorous analysis of his time's trends, he for instance exposed the rise of intolerance and extremism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Mottu, ''Regards sur le Siècle'', Éditions L’Âge d’Homme, Lausanne, 1996, 319 pages, {{ISBN|2825107867}}, {{pp.|297-308}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he was searching in which way humanity would adapt to the momentous transformations of the 20th century, and develop a harmonious society in the future, expressing the hope is that humanity will find spiritual resources allowing it to envisage its future with « a measure of serenity".&lt;ref name = reg308/&gt;

== Legacy ==
As a thinker and as an activist, Philippe Mottu played a role in Swiss and European history, contributing to reinforce the spirit of resistance to fascism in Switzerland through the Gotthard League, to support German resistance to Hitler and on the European scene in triggering the setting up of the Caux conference Centre.

Pioneer of [[Moral Rearmament]] in Switzerland, he left to the next generations the [[Caux Palace Hotel|Caux conference centre]], of which he was the inspirator and one of the most instrumental administrators. He was also a daring entrepreneur who signed the purchase contract for Caux in 1946, together with Robert Hahnloser, risking his name without knowing whether the necessary funds would be found in order to meet the down payments deadline&lt;ref name = ACV/&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref name="ObIC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1155">From the [[anthroposophy]] teachings of [[Rudolf Steiner]]. "'''Pneumatosophy'''" (wisdom of the spirit) can be seen as part of his teachings on spiritual science and approaches the human spirit in terms of truth and error and the meaning and the effects of imagination, intuition, and inspiration. In some cases it will be difficult to understand the context between the subject matter and what is here termed pneumatosophy. Pneuma ([[Greek language|Greek]]) literally "breath" or "wind". In the [[Bible]] is usually translated as "spirit". The [[suffix]] sophy stands for knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10065">'''Posthumanization''' comprises "those processes by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological [[Human|human beings]] who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the [[society]]."&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018 def"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sapient Circuits and Digitalized Flesh: The Organization as Locus of Technological Posthumanization|edition=second|last1=Gladden|first1=Matthew|date=2018|url = http://www.matthewgladden.net/wp-content/uploads/Sapient-Circuits-and-Digitalized-Flesh-2e-M-Gladden-2018.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Defragmenter Media|isbn=978-1-944373-21-4|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=19|accessdate=March 14, 2018}} Elsewhere (p. 35) in the same text Gladden proposes a longer definition, stating that "The processes of posthumanization are those dynamics by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, activities, or meaning of the society. In this way, a society comes to incorporate a diverse range of intelligent human, non-human, and para-human social actors who seek to perceive, interpret, and influence their shared environment and who create knowledge and meaning through their networks and interactions."&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumanization is one of the key phenomena studied by those academic disciplines and methodologies that identify themselves as "posthumanist", including critical, cultural, and philosophical [[posthumanism]]. Its processes can be divided into forms of ''non-technological'' and ''technological'' posthumanization.&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013 two forms"&gt;{{cite book|title=Posthumanism: A Critical Analysis|last1=Herbrechter|first1=Stefan|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-7809-3690-1|location=London}}After referring (p. 3) to "the current technology-centred discussion about the potential transformation of humans into something else (a process that might be called 'posthumanization')," Herbrechter offers an analysis of Lyotard's essay "A Postmodern Fable," in which Herbrechter concludes (p. 7) that "What Lyotard's sequel to Nietzsche's fable shows is that, on the one hand, there is no point in denying the ongoing technologization of the human species, and, on the other hand, that a purely technology-centred idea of posthumanization is not enough to escape the humanist paradigm."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sapient Circuits and Digitalized Flesh: The Organization as Locus of Technological Posthumanization|edition=second|last1=Gladden|first1=Matthew|date=2018|url = http://www.matthewgladden.net/wp-content/uploads/Sapient-Circuits-and-Digitalized-Flesh-2e-M-Gladden-2018.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Defragmenter Media|isbn=978-1-944373-21-4|location=Indianapolis, IN|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological vs. non-technological posthumanization ==

=== Non-technological posthumanization ===
While posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s;&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ferrando|first = Francesca|title = Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations|journal = Existenz: An International Journal in Philosophy, Religion, Politics, and the Arts|volume = 8|issue = 2|date = 2013|pages=26-32|url=https://existenz.us/volumes/Vol.8-2Ferrando.pdf|issn = 1932-1066|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of ''non-technological'' posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as [[Pet|household pets]] or in which [[ghosts]], [[Monster|monsters]], [[Angel|angels]], or semidivine [[Greek hero cult|heroes]] were considered to play some role in the world.&lt;ref name="Graham 2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Representations of the Post/Human: Monsters, Aliens and Others in Popular Culture|last1=Graham|first1=Elaine|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-8135-3058-X|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=Posthumanism: A Critical Analysis|last1=Herbrechter|first1=Stefan|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-7809-3690-1|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018" /&gt;

Such non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of [[Temple|temples]], [[Cemetery|cemeteries]], [[Zoo|zoos]], or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society,&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018" /&gt; to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: "the notion of [[spirituality]] dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence." &lt;ref Name="Ferrando 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferrando | first = Francesca | editors = Banerji, D. | title = Critical Posthumanism and Planetary Futures | edition = 1st| publisher = Springer  | location = New York | isbn = 9788132236375 | year = 2016 | pages = 243–256 | chapter = Humans Have Always Been Posthuman: A Spiritual Genealogy of the Posthuman | chapterurl = https://www.academia.edu/31138169/HUMANS_HAVE_ALWAYS_BEEN_POSTHUMAN_A_SPIRITUAL_GENEALOGY_OF_POSTHUMANISM |  accessdate=2018-08-08 | display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological posthumanization ===
Some forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to [[genetic engineering]] or [[Neuroprosthetics|neurocybernetic augmentation]]; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by [[Cyborg|cyborg theory]].&lt;ref name="Gray 1995"&gt;''The Cyborg Handbook'' (1995). Chris Hables Gray, editor. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415908498}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly "posthumanize" human society through the deployment of [[Social robot|social robots]] or attempts to develop [[Artificial general intelligence|artificial general intelligences]], [[Cognitive robotics|sentient networks]], or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies.

The dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of [[science fiction]]; genres such as [[cyberpunk]] take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] future for humanity,&lt;ref name="Moravec 1988"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence|last1=Moravec|first1=Hans|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-57618-7|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|date=2005|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101218884|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|title=Medical Enhancement and Posthumanity|chapter=Why I Want to Be a Posthuman When I Grow Up|chapterurl=https://nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf|format=pdf|year=2008|editor1-last=Gordijn|editor1-first=Bert|editor2-last=Chadwick|editor2-first=Ruth|pages=107-137|publisher=Springer Netherlands|ISBN=978-1-4020-8851-3|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[Bioconservatism|bioconservative]] critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology.&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last1=Fukuyama|first1=Francis|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|isbn=9781861972972|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of technological and non-technological posthumanization ==
Processes of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial "de-[[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentrization]]" of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple [[Binary opposition|binaries]], such as those of "human versus non-human", "natural versus artificial", "alive versus non-alive", and "biological versus mechanical".&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2013 non-dualistic"&gt;Ferrando, Francesca (2013). "Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations." ''Existenz: An International Journal in Philosophy, Religion, Politics, and the Arts'' 8 (2): 26-32. ISSN 1932-1066. Ferrando notes (p. 27) that such challenging of binaries constitutes part of "the post-anthropocentric and post-dualistic approach of (philosophical, cultural, and critical) posthumanism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt;

'''R. Edward Freeman''' (born December 18, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and [[professor]] of [[business administration]] at the [[Darden School]] of the [[University of Virginia]], particularly known for his work on [[stakeholder theory]] (1984) and on business works.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Columbus, Georgia]], Freeman received a B.A. in [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] from [[Duke University]] in 1973 and a Ph.D. in [[philosophy]] from [[Washington University]] in 1978.

He taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], and is now Elis and Signe Olsson Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School of the University of Virginia. He is also academic director of the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, and director of the Darden's Olsson Center for Applied Ethics.&lt;ref name="F-CV 84"&gt;[http://www.csrhellas.org/portal/images/stories/files/1984_Freeman_CV.pdf Freeman's curriculum vitae]. Accessed Feb 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Freeman served as president of the [[Society for Business Ethics]]. He is one of the executive editors of the journal [[Philosophy of Management]] and he serves as the editor for the Ruffin Series in Business Ethics from [[Oxford University Press]].

In 2001 Freeman was awarded the Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement by the [[World Resources Institute]] and by the [[Aspen Institute]], and in 2005 the Virginia State Council on Higher Education honored him with the Outstanding Faculty Award.

== Work ==
Freeman is particularly known for his work on [[stakeholder theory]] originally published in his 1984 book ''Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach''. He has (co)authored other books on corporate strategy and business ethics. Also recently he co-edited standard business textbooks such as ''The Portable MBA'' and the ''Blackwell's Handbook of Strategic Management.'' His latest book, ''Managing for Stakeholders'', was published 2007.

=== Stakeholder theory ===
[[Stakeholder theory]] is a theory of organizational management and [[business ethics]] that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It was originally detailed by Freeman in the book ''Strategic Management: a Stakeholder Approach'', and identifies and models the groups which are [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s of a [[corporation]], and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the "Principle of Who or What Really Counts."&lt;ref name="REF 84"&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategic Management: a stakeholder approach |last=Freeman |first=R. Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1984 |publisher=Pitman |location=Boston |isbn=0-273-01913-9 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional view of the firm, the [[shareholder]] view, the shareholders or stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding [[fiduciary]] duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. However, stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including [[Government agency|governmental bodies]], [[political group]]s, [[trade association]]s, [[trade unions]], [[community|communities]], [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[employee]]s, and [[customer]]s. Sometimes even competitors are counted as stakeholders - their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its other morally legitimate stakeholders. The nature of what is a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholders: essentially contested or just confused?|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2012|volume=108|issue=3|pages=285–298|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-1090-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholder Definitions: Profusion and Confusion|journal=EIASM 1st interdisciplinary conference on stakeholder, resources and value creation, IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Barcelona|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate social responsibility ===
[[Corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) &lt;ref&gt;D Wood, 'Corporate Social Performance Revisited' (1991) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/258977 16(4) The Academy of Management Review]&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[corporate]] [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] integrated into a [[business model]]. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance within the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s. CSR is a process with the aim to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and all other members of the [[public sphere]] who may also be considered as stakeholders.

The term "corporate social responsibility" came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond [[shareholders]] as a result of an influential book by Freeman, ''Strategic management: a stakeholder approach'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="REF 84"/&gt; Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses. Others argue CSR is merely [[Display window|window-dressing]], or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful [[multinational corporations]]. Anticipation of such concepts appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 &lt;ref&gt;"Integrated structures in the Italian distribution system," Giuffre Editore, Milan, 1968, pp. VIII / 351&lt;/ref&gt; by Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of the "Method of the decomposition of the parameters" for the calculation of the results does not directly cost of business, regarding ethical issues, moral, social, cultural and environmental.&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Biographical Encyclopedia" Treccani, 2007 edition, Vol. 14, p. 617; "Treccani - Portal", Social sciences / economics / Biographies; Bancoper Annual Meeting, Bologna, 15.11.2008, Prefect Angelo Tranfaglia, "Profit and Social Responsibility", p. 12; "Finanza e Mercati", 3 February 2009, p. 11, Mara Consoli, "When ethics becomes a bargain"; News Chronicles, CNEL, Rome, 12.01.2009, Adelaide Mochi, "Socialis Awards and Corporate Social Responsibility"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''S. Debono''' (19th century) was a Maltese [[scientist]], [[linguist]] and minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, his exact [[Christian]] name is unknown. Neither do we possess as yet a portrait of him.

==Life==
Details about Debono’s personal life are still unidentified. Considering his philosophical contribution, this is indeed unfortunate. Nevertheless, research might bring to light who this person was, and also the whole extent of his philosophical production. It is actually regretful that Debono’s philosophy has still not been studied well and thoroughly.

==Extant works==
Only one philosophical work of Debono is known to exist: '''''Lezioni di Filosofia su i Principi della Ontologia''''' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writing, insignificant to philosophy, is ''Note Grammaticali concernenti la Lingua Inglese'' (Grammatical Notes concerning the English Language; 1845).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debono’s ''Lezioni'' is a 415-page book in Italian published in [[Malta]] (at Tipografia E. Laferla). It is a great pity that this is just one of a multi-volume work, all of the rest have as yet not been discovered. The work opens with a preface and proceeds with thirty-three ‘lessons’ (''lezioni'') organised in four sections, of which the first serves as a general introduction. The other sections deal successively with general [[metaphysics]], special [[metaphysics]], and [[moral philosophy]]

Debono insists on the central importance which concepts should have within the framework of ‘erudite philosophy’, and hence within the methods used to have understanding and acquire sure knowledge. In this context, Debono reveals his dislike of philosophical [[materialism]], particularly that proposed by [[Spinoza]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Victor Cousin|Cousin]].

In the preface, Debono expounds on the esteem which philosophy enjoys with regard to other sciences. This is derived from the nobility of its object, which Debono identifies with the human spirit. In the introduction (composed of eleven ‘lessons’) he explores the concepts on which philosophical teaching is based, and the objectives which such teaching tries to achieve. In the context, Debono deals with the concept of [[truth]], the main principle of philosophy (the satisfaction of reason), the intellective method, [[syllogism]], syllogistic argumentation, [[sophistry]] (two ‘lessons’), the aim of rational thought, logical judgement, and the centrality of concepts to philosophy.

In the section dealing with general [[metaphysics]] (only four ‘lessons’), Debono discusses the concepts of the structure (or organisation) of [[being]] and of [[truth]] as the correspondence to [[reality]], [[causality]], the inclinations of humans as contingent beings, and simple and composite [[being]].

Next, in the part dealing with special [[metaphysics]] (eleven ‘lessons’), Debono deals with the beginning and progress of philosophy, the world, [[destiny]], natural and non-natural effects, humans, the non-elementary virtues of humans, the generation of the human spirit, the [[existence of God]], and internal cult (as opposed to that external). One of these ‘lessons’ is dedicated entirely to [[John Locke|Locke]], in which Debono opposes him on all counts.

In the final section, that dealing with [[moral philosophy]] or [[ethics]] (in seven ‘lessons’), Debono discusses religion, happiness as humans’ highest end, the duties of scientists, on right behaviour (especially moderation), duties in general, genuine ethical mistakes, and the principal reason for acquiring knowledge and science.

Alexandrian's initiation to [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]] came in the summer of 1943 when, aged 16, he met [[Raoul Hausmann]] who was staying in [[Peyrat-le-Château]] near [[Limoges]] as a refugee. From 1947, he served as the last secretary of [[André Breton]] and became an essential figure of the surrealist current.

Alexandrian was an advocate of the philosophy [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] advanced in ''The Gay Science'' (''[[Die fröhliche Wissenschaft]]''). He headed the journal ''[[Supérieur Inconnu]]'' (a title provided by Breton), which exalts four values shared by the surrealists and Alexandrian: [[dream]]s, [[love]], [[knowledge]], and [[revolution]]. [[Catherine Millet]] is one notable contributor to the magazine.

Alexandrian was a friend of [[Victor Brauner]], and remained an admirer of [[Charles Fourier]], and an ardent defender of [[Mata Hari]].

==Works==
Alexandrian has more than 40 books to his credit. His best known works are:

*''André Breton par lui-même'', 1971 (''André Breton in His Own Words'');
*''Hans Bellmer'', 1971;
*''Les Libérateurs de l'amour'', 1977 (''The Liberators of Love'');
*''Surrealist Art'', 1985 (Thames &amp; Hudson World of Art);
*''Max Ernst'', 1986;
*''Histoire de la littérature érotique'', 1989 (''The History of Erotic Literature'');
*''LJUBA'', Paris, Cercle d'Art, 2003.

==Further reading==

* Gallimard (1974). ''Dans le Surréalisme et le rêve'', p.&amp;nbsp;246-9. Paris. The author first discusses the dream of Breton and then proposes an analysis.

==Texts and Prefaces==

{{Frankfurt School}}
'''''The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction''''' (1935, ''Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit''), by [[Walter Benjamin]], is an essay of cultural criticism which proposes that the ''aura'' of a work of art is devalued by mechanical reproduction. The subject and themes of the essay have much influenced the fields of [[art history]] and [[architectural theory]], and of [[cultural studies]] and [[media influence|media theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Brian. ''Benjamin for Architects'', Routledge, London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the Nazi régime (1933–45) in Germany, Benjamin wrote the essay to produce a [[theory of art]] that is “useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art” in mass culture; that, in the age of mechanical reproduction, and the absence of traditional and ritualistic value, the production of art would be inherently based upon the praxis of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell, Paddy. (2003) “Benjamin Contextualized: On ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ ”, in ''Canonic Texts in Media Research: Are There Any? Should There Be? How About These?'', Katz ''et al.'' (Eds.) Polity Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780745629346}}. pp. 74–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three editions of ''The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'' were published: (i) the original, German edition in 1935; (ii) the French edition in 1936; and (iii) the revised German edition in 1939, from which derive the contemporary English translations of the essay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://noppa.aalto.fi/noppa/kurssi/a-60.3320/materiaali/A-60_3320_walter_benjamin_lecture.pdf ''Notes on Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"'', a commentary by Gareth Griffiths, Aalto University, 2011.]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Summary==
The themes of ''The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'' (1935) are initially presented in a quotation from the essay “The Conquest of Ubiquity” (1928), by [[Paul Valéry]], which establishes that the works of art developed in the past are different from contemporary works of art; that the understanding and treatment of art and of artistic technique must progressively develop in order to understand a work of art in the modern context.

{{Quotation|Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth of our techniques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful. In all the arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or treated as it used to be, which cannot remain unaffected by our modern knowledge and power. For the last twenty years neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time immemorial. We must expect great innovations to transform the entire technique of the arts, thereby affecting artistic invention itself and perhaps even bringing about an amazing change in our very notion of art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Valéry, La Conquête de l’ubiquité (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Preface presents Marxist analyses of the construction of society and of the place of art in a capitalist society; and explains the socio-economic conditions to extrapolate future developments of capitalism, which, ultimately, result in the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the proletariat, and produce the social conditions that would abolish capitalism. 

Benjamin reviews the development of the means of the mechanical reproduction of art — an artist manually copying the work of a master artist; the industrial arts of the [[foundry]] and the [[stamp mill]] in Ancient Greece; [[woodcut|woodcut relief-printing]], [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[lithography]], and [[photography]] — to establish that artistic reproduction is not a modern human activity, and that the modern means of artistic reproduction permit greater accuracy throughout the process of [[mass production]].

Benjamin discusses the concept of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], of being in accordance with fact, noting that “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.”&lt;ref name="benart" /&gt; In the artwork proper, Benjamin argues, the “sphere of authenticity is outside the technical [sphere]” of producing the art work; hence, the original work of art is independent of the copy. The action of mechanical reproduction diminishes the original art work by changing the cultural context (original vs. copy); thus, the ''aura'', the unique aesthetic authority, of an artwork is absent from the mechanically produced copy. Benjamin’s concept of the ''aura'' of a work of art derived from the work of [[Ludwig Klages]].&lt;ref&gt;Merquior, J.G. (1986). ''Western Marxism'', London: Palladin, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Miriam Hansen|Hansen, Miriam Bratu]] (2008). “Benjamin’s Aura”, ''Critical Inquiry'' No. 34 (Winter 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

That the social value of a work of art changes as society change their value systems, which accounts for the changes in artistic style and in the cultural [[taste (sociology)|taste]] of the public; “the manner in which human sense-perception is organized, the [artistic] medium in which it is accomplished, is determined not only by Nature, but by historical circumstances as well.”&lt;ref name="benart" /&gt; 

Despite the socio-cultural effects of reproduction-art upon the original work of art, Benjamin said that “the uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition”, which separates the original work of art from the reproduction.&lt;ref name="benart"&gt;{{cite book|title=“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”, ''Illuminations''|year=1968|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=9781407085500|author=Walter Benjamin|editor=Hannah Arendt|pages=214–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discusses the ritualization of art-reproduction and the emancipation of “the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.”&lt;ref name="benart" /&gt; That the social-value of the exhibition of art progressed from the [[private sphere]] to the [[public sphere]] of life; historically, works of art were for the private viewing and aesthetic enjoyment of the owner of the artefacts (usually [[High art|High Art]]); contemporarily, works of art are exhibited in a public gallery, to provide the enjoyment of aesthetic pleasure to a greater number of people.

&lt;!-- there's no mention of the epilogue, arguably the most cited and well known part of the essay. In short: the aestheticization of politics practiced by fascist regimes--&gt;

==Influence==
''The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'' much influenced the [[intellectualism]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], especially the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and political analyses of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, George. ''The Political Philosophy of the Frankfurt School''. Cornell University Press, New York, 1988. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, in the television program ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'' (1972), [[John Berger]] drew from the themes of Walter Benjamin’s essay, and explained the contemporary [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of social-class and racial-caste in the production of art. That the modern means of artistic production and of artistic reproduction have destroyed the aesthetic, cultural, and political [[authority]] of art: “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free”, for lacking the ''aura'' of the original work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, John. ''Ways of Seeing''. Penguin Books, London, 1972, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World as Will and Representation''''' ('''''WWR'''''; {{lang-de|Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung}}, '''''WWV''''') is the central work of the [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]] [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. The first edition was published in 1818/19,&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 ({{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt; the second expanded edition in 1844, and the third expanded edition in 1859.

Aquila in collaboration with David Carus (New York: Longman, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day translator Richard Aquila argues that the reader will not grasp the details of the philosophy of Schopenhauer properly without this new title: "The World as Will and &lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation". According to him, "Idea", "&lt;u&gt;Re&lt;/u&gt;presentation", and "&lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation" are all acceptable renderings of the word ''Vorstellung'', but it is the notion of a performance or a theatrical presentation that is key in his interpretation. The world that we perceive is a "presentation" of objects in the theatre of our own mind; the observers, the "subject", each craft the show with their own stage managers, stagehands, sets, lighting, code of dress, pay scale, etc. The other aspect of the world, the Will, or "thing in itself", which is not perceivable as a presentation, exists outside time, space, and causality. Aquila claims to make these distinctions as linguistically precise as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|title=It’s All in the Presentation: A New Look at Schopenhauer|publisher=|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2012-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130722063326/http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier philosophical work==
[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815, second of the critical five years of the initial composition of ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'']]
The main body of the work states at the beginning that it assumes prior knowledge of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories,&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of [[transcendental idealism]] than any of the other later [[German Idealism|German Idealists]]. However, the book contains an appendix entitled "[[Critique of the Kantian Philosophy]]," in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's [[ethics]] and significant parts of his [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]]. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of [[Plato]] or he is already familiar with [[Indian philosophy]].

Schopenhauer believed that Kant had ignored inner experience, as intuited through the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], which was the most important form of experience.  Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian [[thing-in-itself]]. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body. According to Schopenhauer, the entire world is the representation of a single Will, of which our individual wills are phenomena. In this way, Schopenhauer's metaphysics go beyond the limits that Kant had set, but do not go so far as the rationalist system-builders who preceded Kant.  Other important differences are Schopenhauer's rejection of eleven of Kant's twelve categories, arguing that only [[causality]] was important.  [[Matter]] and causality were both seen as a union of [[time]] and [[space]] and thus being equal to each other.

Schopenhauer frequently acknowledges drawing on [[Plato]] in the development of his theories and, particularly in the context of aesthetics, speaks of the [[Platonic forms]] as existing on an intermediate [[ontology|ontological]] level between the representation and the Will.

==Development of the work==
The development of Schopenhauer's ideas took place very early in his career (1814–1818) and culminated in the publication of the first volume of ''Will and Representation'' in 1819. This first volume consisted of four books – covering his epistemology, [[ontology]], aesthetics and ethics, in order. Much later in his life, in 1844, Schopenhauer published a second edition in two volumes, the first a virtual reprint of the original, and the second a new work consisting of clarifications to and additional reflections on the first. His views had not changed substantially.

His belated fame after 1851 stimulated renewed interest in his seminal work, and led to a third and final edition with 136 more pages in 1859, one year before his death. In the preface to the latter, Schopenhauer noted: "If I also have at last arrived, and have the satisfaction at the end of my life of seeing the beginning of my influence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule, it will last longer in proportion to the lateness of its beginning."&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will==
Schopenhauer used the word ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' as a human's most familiar designation for the concept that can also be signified by other words such as  ''desire,'' ''striving,'' ''wanting,'' ''effort,'' and ''urging.'' Schopenhauer's philosophy holds that all nature, including man, is the expression of an insatiable ''will to life''.
It is through the will that mankind finds all their suffering. Desire for more is what causes this suffering. He argues that only aesthetic pleasure creates momentary escape from the Will. Although the concept of desire may be influenced by Buddhist teachings, it should not be treated as direct reference since desire is not thought to be the fundamental nature of human beings in Buddhism.

==Volume 1==

===Epistemology (Book 1)===
As mentioned above, Schopenhauer's notion of the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant believed to be the fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity.  Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being.  All knowledge gained of objects is seen as self-referential, as we recognize the same will in other things as is inside us.

===Ontology (Book 2)===
In Book 2, [[electricity]] and [[gravity]] are described as fundamental forces of the will. [[Knowledge]] is something that was invented to serve the will and is present in both human and non-human animals. It is subordinate to the demands of the will for all animals and most humans. The fundamental nature of the universe and everything in it is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.

===Aesthetics (Book 3)===
Like many other aesthetic theories, Schopenhauer's centers on the concept of [[genius]]. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. An aesthetic experience occurs when an individual perceives an object and understands by it not the individual object itself, but the [[Platonic form]] of the object. The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire by becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing". Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art. Based on this theory, Schopenhauer viewed Dutch [[still-life]] as the best type of painting, because it was able to help viewers see beauty in ordinary, everyday objects. However, he sharply criticized depictions of nude women and prepared food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from the aesthetic experience and becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing".

Music also occupies a privileged place in Schopenhauer's aesthetics, as he believed it to have a special relationship to the will. Where other forms of art are imitations of things perceived in the world, music is a direct expression and articulation of the will.

===Ethics (Book 4)===
Schopenhauer claims in this book to set forth a purely descriptive account of human ethical behavior, in which he identifies two types of behavior: the affirmation and denial of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, the Will (the great Will that is the [[thing-in-itself]], not the individual wills of humans and animals, which are phenomena of the Will) conflicts with itself through the [[Psychological egoism|egoism]] that every human and animal is endowed with.  Compassion arises from a transcendence of this egoism (the penetration of the illusory perception of individuality, so that one can [[empathise]] with the suffering of another) and can serve as a clue to the possibility of going beyond desire and the will.  Schopenhauer categorically denies the existence of the "freedom of the will" in the conventional sense, and only adumbrates how the will can be "released" or negated, but is not subject to change, and serves as the root of the chain of [[causality|causal]] [[determinism]].  His praise for [[asceticism]] led him to think highly of [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]], as well as some monastic orders and ascetic practices found in [[catholic Church|Catholicism]].  He expressed contempt for [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], which he saw as optimistic, devoid of [[metaphysics]] and cruel to non-human animals. According to Schopenhauer, the deep truth of the matter is that in cases of the over-affirmation of the will – that is, cases where one individual exerts his will not only for its own fulfillment but for the improper domination of others – he is unaware that he is really identical with the person he is harming, so that the Will in fact constantly harms itself, and justice is done in the moment in which the crime is committed, since the same metaphysical individual is both the perpetrator and the victim.

Schopenhauer discusses suicide at length, noting that it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of the will, one can slowly weaken the individual will in a way that is far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, denial of the will to live is the way to salvation from suffering. "Schopenhauer tells us that when the will is denied, the sage becomes nothing, without actually dying."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannan, ''The Riddle of the World'', Chapter 5, "Pessimism, Depression, and Salvation," "Salvation as Denial of the Will," p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; When willing disappears, both the willer and the world become nothing. "...[T]o one who has achieved the will-less state, it is the world of the willer that has been disclosed as 'nothing'. Its hold over us, its seeming reality, has been 'abolished' so that it now stands before us as nothing but a bad dream from which we are, thankfully, awaking."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, NY, 2005, Chapter Eight, "Salvation," p. 197 f.&lt;/ref&gt; As Schopenhauer wrote: "...to those in whom the will has turned and denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its [[Sun]]s and [[Milky Way]]s, is – nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Volume I, § 71. [...ist Denen, in welchen der Wille sich gewendet und verneint hat, diese unsere so sehr reale Welt mit allen ihren Sonnen und Milchstraßen – Nichts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy (Appendix)===
At the end of Book 4, Schopenhauer appended a thorough discussion of the merits and faults of Kant's philosophy. Schopenhauer's [[critique of the Kantian philosophy]] asserted that Kant's greatest error was the failure to distinguish between perceptual, intuitive knowledge, or insight and conceptual, discursive knowledge, or investigative thinking. One of Kant's greatest contributions, according to Schopenhauer, was the distinction of the [[phenomenon]] from the [[thing-in-itself]].

==Volume 2==
The second volume consisted of several essays expanding topics covered in the first.  Most important are his reflections on [[death]] and his theory on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], which saw it as a manifestation of the whole will making sure that it will live on and depriving humans of their [[reason]] and sanity in their longing for their loved ones. Less successful is his theory of [[genetics]]: he argued that humans inherit their will, and thus their character, from their fathers, but their intellect from their mothers and he provides examples from biographies of great figures to illustrate this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Recent genetics research might show Schopenhauer to be right.  For example, from New Scientist: "Eric 'Barry' Keverne ... and Azim Surani ... have evidence that in the mouse the mother's genes contribute more to the development of the 'thinking', or 'executive', centres of the brain, while paternal genes have a greater impact on the development of the 'emotional' limbic brain." (by Gail Vines, 03 May 1997, p 34, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420804.300-where-did-you-get-your-brains--baby-mice-may-inherit-their-mothers-wits-and-their-fathers-basicinstincts-but-what-does-this-mean-for-us-asks-gail-vines.html Where did you get your brains?])&lt;/ref&gt;  The second volume also contains attacks on contemporary philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].

==Influence==
The first decades after its publication ''The World as Will and Representation'' was met with near silence. Exceptions were [[Goethe]] and [[Jean Paul]]. Goethe immediately started to read the [[magnum opus]] of Schopenhauer when it arrived and "read it with an eagerness as she [Ottilie von Goethe] had ''never'' before seen in him.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe told his daughter-in-law that he had now pleasure for an entire year, because he would read it completely, contrary to his custom of sampling pages to his liking. The influence of Schopenhauer can be read in [[Gespräche mit Goethe]] and {{interlanguage link|Urworte. Orphisch|de|Urworte. Orphisch}}.

In the years where the work was largely ignored, [[Jean Paul]] praised it as “a work of philosophical genius, bold, universal, full of penetration and profoundness — but of a depth often hopeless and bottomless, akin to that melancholy lake in Norway, in whose deep water, beneath the steep rock-walls, one never sees the sun, but only starts reflected.”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthur-schopenhauer-studienkreis.de/Arthur_Schopenhauer_7/arthur_schopenhauer_7.html|title=Unsere Zeit.

This neglect came to an end in the last years of his life. Schopenhauer would become the most influentual philosopher in Germany until [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Weltschmerz"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900.|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0198768710|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ...

Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially artists were attracted to the work. No philosopher had given so much importance to art: one fourth of ''The World as Will and Representation'' is concerned with [[aesthetics]]. To be mentioned are [[Wagner]] ([[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]]), [[Arnold Schönberg|Schönberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Pamela C.|date=1984|title=Schopenhauer and Schoenberg|url=|journal=Journal of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute|volume= 8| issue =  1|pages=39–57|quote=The influence of Schopenhauer on Schoenberg's thinking can be seen in several different ways. First, the influence is reflected directly in Schoenberg's own essays, and philosophical writings about music and other matters. … Schoenberg owned almost all of the works of Schopenhauer … Schoenberg's use of his Schopenhauer volumes may be compared to his books by other philosophers: of Kant, Schopenhauer's direct intellectual forebear, he owned practically everything.

Francisco|first=|publisher=University of Washington|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].

The philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Philipp Mainländer]] both described the discovery of ''The World as Will and Representation'' as a revelation. Nietzsche commented, “I belong to those readers of Schopenhauer who know perfectly well, after they have turned the first page, that they will read all the others, and listen to every word that he has spoken.”

[[Charles Darwin]] quoted ''The World as Will and Representation'' in ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some read ideas in it that can be found in the theory of evolution, for example, that sexual instinct is a tool of nature to ensure the quality of the offspring and that intellect is a mere means to preserve life. Schopenhauer argued in favor of transformism by pointing to one of the most important and familiar evidences of the truth of the theory of descent, the homologies in the inner structure of all the vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Arthur O.|date=April 1911|title=SCHOPENHAUER AS AN EVOLUTIONIST|jstor=27900310|journal=The Monist|volume= 21| issue =  2|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's ideas on the unconscious can be found in [[psychoanalysis]] and the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Whereas Jung acknowledged Schopenhauer's influence, Freud denied to have read Schopenhauer until late in life, a claim which is considered to be doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schopenhauer and Freud.|first=Young C. -  Brook A.|date=February 1994|title=Schopenhauer and Freud.|url=|journal=Int J Psychoanal.|volume=|pages=|quote=A close study of Schopenhauer's central work, 'The World as Will and Representation', reveals that a number of Freud's most characteristic doctrines were first articulated by Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer's concept of the will contains the foundations of what in Freud became the concepts of the unconscious and the id. Schopenhauer's writings on madness anticipate Freud's theory of repression and his first theory of the aetiology of neurosis. Schopenhauer's work contains aspects of what become the theory of free association. And most importantly, Schopenhauer articulates major parts of the Freudian theory of sexuality. These correspondences raise some interesting questions about Freud's denial that he even read Schopenhauer until late in life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's discussions of language and ethics were a major influence on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the deeper preoccupation of his [Wittgenstein’s] later years remained the same as that of his youth: to complete the logical and ethical tasks begun by Kant and Schopenhauer." Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 7, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Moving on by way of Schopenhauer to Wittgenstein .... The only hope for the individual is to save his own soul; and even this he can do only by avoiding worldly entanglements. One of the few pieces of authentic moral advice Wittgenstein was heard to give in his later years is the maxim, ‘One must travel light.’" Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 8, p. 244. Also, "The only life that is happy is the life that can renounce the amenities of the world." Wittgenstein, ''Notebooks 1914–1916'', Note of August 13, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In theoretical matters, Wittgenstein’s later philosophy of the ''Philosophical Investigations'' is very different from – according to many an explicit rejection of – the philosophy of the ''Tractatus''. But since his personal life was rather clearly an attempt to live the ‘ethical’ life as conceived in the ''Tractatus'', it seems that in existential matters he did not change his mind. Given that this conception of the ethical life is so strongly influenced by Schopenhauer, it may be said that, in a way, Schopenhauer stayed with him all his life."  Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, New York, 2005, p. 232 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's views on the independence of spatially separated systems, the ''[[principium individuationis#Arthur Schopenhauer|principium individuationis]]'', influenced [[Einstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ...

'''Thoralf Albert Skolem''' (23 May 1887 – 23 March 1963) ({{IPA-sv|ˈtuːralf ˈskuːlɛm|no}}) was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]].

== Life ==
Although Skolem's father was a primary school teacher, most of his extended family were farmers. Skolem attended secondary school in [[Kristiania]] (later renamed [[Oslo]]), passing the university entrance examinations in 1905. He then entered [[Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet]] to study mathematics, also taking courses in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]].

In 1909, he began working as an assistant to the physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]], known for bombarding magnetized spheres with [[electron]]s and obtaining [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like effects; thus Skolem's first publications were physics papers written jointly with Birkeland. In 1913, Skolem passed the state examinations with distinction, and completed a dissertation titled ''Investigations on the Algebra of Logic''. He also traveled with Birkeland to the Sudan to observe the [[zodiacal light]]. He spent the winter semester of 1915 at the [[University of Göttingen]], at the time the leading research center in [[mathematical logic]], [[metamathematics]], and [[abstract algebra]], fields in which Skolem eventually excelled. In 1916 he was appointed a research fellow at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet. In 1918, he became a Docent in Mathematics and was elected to the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].

Skolem did not at first formally enroll as a Ph.D. candidate, believing that the Ph.D. was unnecessary in Norway. He later changed his mind and submitted a thesis in 1926, titled ''Some theorems about integral solutions to certain algebraic equations and inequalities''. His notional thesis advisor was [[Axel Thue]], even though Thue had died in 1922.

In 1927, he married Edith Wilhelmine Hasvold.

Skolem continued to teach at Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet (renamed the [[University of Oslo]] in 1939) until 1930 when he became a Research Associate in [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]. This senior post allowed Skolem to conduct research free of administrative and teaching duties. However, the position also required that he reside in Bergen, a city which then lacked a university and hence had no research library, so that he was unable to keep abreast of the mathematical literature. In 1938, he returned to Oslo to assume the Professorship of Mathematics at the university. There he taught the graduate courses in algebra and number theory, and only occasionally on mathematical logic. Skolem's Ph.D. student [[Øystein Ore]] went on to a career in the USA.

Skolem served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society, and edited the ''Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift'' ("The Norwegian Mathematical Journal") for many years. He was also the founding editor of ''Mathematica Scandinavica''.

After his 1957 retirement, he made several trips to the United States, speaking and teaching at universities there. He remained intellectually active until his sudden and unexpected death.

For more on Skolem's academic life, see Fenstad (1970).

== Mathematics ==
Skolem published around 180 papers on [[Diophantine equations]], [[group theory]], [[lattice theory]], and most of all, [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]]. He mostly published in Norwegian journals with limited international circulation, so that his results were occasionally rediscovered by others. An example is the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]], characterizing the [[automorphisms]] of simple algebras. Skolem published a proof in 1927, but [[Emmy Noether]] independently rediscovered it a few years later.

Skolem was among the first to write on [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s. In 1912, he was the first to describe a free [[distributive lattice]] generated by ''n'' elements. In 1919, he showed that every [[implicative lattice]] (now also called a [[Skolem lattice]]) is distributive and, as a partial converse, that every finite distributive lattice is implicative. After these results were rediscovered by others, Skolem published a 1936 paper in German, "Über gewisse 'Verbände' oder 'Lattices'", surveying his earlier work in lattice theory.

Skolem was a pioneer [[model theory|model theorist]]. In 1920, he greatly simplified the proof of a theorem [[Leopold Löwenheim]] first proved in 1915, resulting in the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which states that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model. His 1920 proof employed the [[axiom of choice]], but he later (1922 and 1928) gave proofs using [[Kőnig's lemma]] in place of that axiom. It is notable that Skolem, like Löwenheim, wrote on mathematical logic and set theory employing the notation of his fellow pioneering model theorists [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Ernst Schröder]], including ∏, ∑ as variable-binding quantifiers, in contrast to the notations of [[Peano]], [[Principia Mathematica]], and ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''. Skolem (1934) pioneered the construction of [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|non-standard models of arithmetic]] and set theory.

Skolem (1922) refined Zermelo's axioms for set theory by replacing Zermelo's vague notion of a "definite" property with any property that can be coded in [[first-order logic]]. The resulting axiom is now part of the standard axioms of set theory. Skolem also pointed out that a consequence of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]]: If Zermelo's axioms are consistent, then they must be satisfiable within a countable domain, even though they prove the existence of uncountable sets.

== Completeness ==
The [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]] is an easy corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann's ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]'' clearly articulated it. In any event, [[Kurt Gödel]] first proved this completeness in 1930.

Skolem distrusted the completed [[Infinity|infinite]] and was one of the founders of [[finitism]] in mathematics. Skolem (1923) sets out his [[primitive recursive arithmetic]], a very early contribution to the theory of [[computable function]]s, as a means of avoiding the so-called paradoxes of the infinite. Here he developed the arithmetic of the natural numbers by first defining objects by [[primitive recursion]], then devising another system to prove properties of the objects defined by the first system. These two systems enabled him to define [[prime number]]s and to set out a considerable amount of number theory. If the first of these systems can be considered as a programming language for defining objects, and the second as a programming logic for proving properties about the objects, Skolem can be seen as an unwitting pioneer of theoretical computer science.

In 1929, [[Presburger arithmetic|Presburger]] proved that [[Peano arithmetic]] without multiplication was [[consistent]], complete, and [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. The following year, Skolem proved that the same was true of Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named [[Skolem arithmetic]] in his honor. [[Gödel]]'s famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompletable]] and hence ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' undecidable.

[[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] praised Skolem's work as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Skolem tends to treat general problems by concrete examples. He often seemed to present proofs in the same order as he came to discover them. This results in a fresh informality as well as a certain inconclusiveness. Many of his papers strike one as progress reports. Yet his ideas are often pregnant and potentially capable of wide application. He was very much a 'free spirit': he did not belong to any school, he did not found a school of his own, he did not usually make heavy use of known results... he was very much an innovator and most of his papers can be read and understood by those without much specialized knowledge. It seems quite likely that if he were young today, logic... would not have appealed to him." (Skolem 1970: 17-18)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tsakli''' (also “tsakalis”) are [[Tibetan Buddhist]] miniature paintings, normally produced as thematic groups or sets, which are used in rituals as initiation cards, and in the training of monks. Examples of this miniature art are also known from [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronge,Veronika: "Kunst und Kunstgewerbe bei den Mongolen". In: Michael Weiers (ed.), ''Die Mongolen. Beiträge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur''. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1986, {{ISBN|3-534-03579-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjects ==

The subjects found on tsakli are similar to the better known larger Tibetan [[thangka]] scroll paintings on cloth, but much simpler, usually showing only a single deity, or a pair. The subjects are usually deities or ritual objects and offerings associated with these deities are represented on the tsaklis. Occasionally, Tibetan inscriptions on the backside can identify the subjects which are painted on the front.

== Ritual use of tsakli ==

The tsakli which are normally painted in sets which can comprise from 6 to almost 100 small paintings of similar subjects are used as offerings in temples or in rituals. For example, before a temple building is started, the area can be marked with tsakli representing protective deities. In this case they are mounted on small wooden sticks. Similarly tsakli can be used by a buddhist [[lama]] to remove evil influences from a sick person, from a tree which does not bear fruit or a stack of grain which is going to be thrashed.&lt;ref&gt;According to Albert Shelton: Unpublished notes in the Newark Museum files. In: Olson. Eleanor: Catalogue of the Tibetan collection and other Lamaist Material in the Newark Museum, vol. III, Newark, 1971, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; A tsakli can also be placed in a portable shrine or box (Tibetan “gau”) and carried as a device giving protection to the traveller or pilgrim who carries this box around the neck or on a shoulder strap.

== Materials ==

The majority of tsakli are painted on cloth (like most of the tangkas) or [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]. There exist also tsakli which are printed from woodblocks on cloth or paper. Larger sets of tsakli are kept between two wooden covers in a similar manner as pages of Tibetan books are protected.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Li: Tibetan Ritual Miniature Paintings, March 17, 1995. http://www.asianart.com/li/li.html#fnt1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wedding-invitation-cards.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mix of wedding invitations of Chinese and western styles]]

A '''wedding invitation''' is a letter asking the recipient to attend a [[wedding]]. It is typically written in formal, [[grammatical|third-person]] language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.

Like any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host—historically, for younger brides in [[Western culture]], the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family—to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social [[secretary]] to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service.  With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a [[mail merge]] with [[word processing]] and [[spreadsheet]] software.

==History==

===The Middle Ages and before===
Prior to the invention of the moveable-type [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a [[Town crier]]: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.

In the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of [[Calligraphy]], to hand-craft their notices.

Such documents often carried the [[Coat of arms]], or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.

===From 1600 onward===
Despite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.

In 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or [[Mezzotint]]) by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Antony (ed), ''Landmarks in Print Collecting - Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753'', p. 138, 1996, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|0714126098}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engraving]], as the name implies, requires an artisan to "hand write" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.

At the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.

===The Industrial Revolution===
Following the invention of [[Lithography]] by [[Alois Senefelder]] in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lithography and Lithographers|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher|place=London|year=1915|editor=Pennel ER|url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.

Wedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‘double envelope’ was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.

===Modern times===
The origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the life-styles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as [[Amy Vanderbilt]] and [[Emily Post]], emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate [[etiquette]].

Growth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of [[thermographic printing|thermography]]. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.

More recently [[Letterpress printing]] has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and [[craft]] appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.

Laser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years.  Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic, or to mark certain types of metal invitations.

The latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organising and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.

==Text==
Etiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language.  In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in formal, third-person language, saying that the [[Hospitality|host]]s wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bard Graduate Center|url = http://www.bgc.bard.edu/news/multimedia/academic/indian-wedding.html|website = www.bgc.bard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., "Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith" or "Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:

[[Image:RedBumbleBeeInvitations.JPG|thumb|right|A modern wedding invitation]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith&lt;br /&gt;
request the honour of your presence&lt;br /&gt;
at the wedding of their daughter&lt;br /&gt;
Jessica Marie&lt;br /&gt;
to&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Michael Francis Miller&lt;br /&gt;
on the first of November &lt;br /&gt;
at twelve noon &lt;br /&gt;
Christchurch Hall&lt;br /&gt;
Richmond, Virginia&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the seemingly anglicised spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by [[Emily Post]] in the 1920s.

In the United States, the line "request...presence" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; "pleasure of your company" is used when it is held elsewhere.

If the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well.  If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice:  "The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of..."

Formal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.

Informal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter.  So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.

==Printing and design==

Commercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: [[engraving]], [[lithography]], [[thermography]], [[letterpress printing]], sometimes blind [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], compression plate process, or [[offset printing]].  More recently, many [[do-it-yourself]] brides are printing on their home computers using a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]].  For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in [[calligraphy]].

Historically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite book

|pages=390–391
|isbn=0-393-05874-3
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mass-production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing.  Hand-written invitations, in the hosts' own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings, and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

Tissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text.  Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Post, ''Emily Post on Weddings'', page 65. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.&lt;ref name="Martin1990"&gt;Martin, Judith. ''Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium''. Simon and Schuster; 1990-11-15 [cited 17 September 2012]. {{ISBN|9780671722289}}. p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern invitation design follows fashion trends.  Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme.  For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty [[typefaces]] and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations.

The invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters).  Other options include a sheet of paper, a [[tri-fold]], or a trendy pocket-fold design.  The appropriate [[paper density]] depends on the design, but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock.

==Mailing==
Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner [[envelope]] may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing.  More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.

In countries that issue them, the envelope may be [[franking|franked]] with [[love stamp]]s. The [[United States Postal Service|United States postal service]] issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).

==Other items==

In addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials.  The ensemble may include an [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] response card, a separate invitation to a [[wedding reception]], and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.

Wedding invitations should be sent out 6–8 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings.  Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.

These printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.

==Response==
As with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|title=Miss Manners' guide for the turn-of-the-millennium
|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster
|location=New York
|year=1990
|page=436
|isbn=0-671-72228-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.

A proper response is written on the recipient's normal [[stationery]], following the form of the invitation.  For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either "Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November", or "Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November."

Pre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates.&lt;ref name="isbn0-393-06914-1"&gt;{{cite book

'''Yungchen [[Lhamo]]''' is a [[Tibet]]an [[singer-songwriter]] living in [[New York City]]. She won an Australian Record Industry Association award (ARIA) for best Folk/World/Traditional album, and was then signed by [[Peter Gabriel]]'s Realworld Record label.

Yungchen has performed with [[Billy Corgan]] (Smashing Pumpkins) and has sung duets with [[Natalie Merchant]] on ''[[Ophelia (album)|Ophelia]]''. She collaborated with [[Annie Lennox]] on her album ''Ama''. Lhamo's recordings have been used in ''Seven Years in Tibet'' and many Tibetan documentaries. Yungchen has also performed at other venues such as [[London]]'s [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[New York City]]'s [[Carnegie Hall]], and [[Berlin]]'s [[Berliner Philharmonie|Philharmonic Hall]].

==Life and career==
&lt;div style="text-align:justify;"&gt;
Yungchen Lhamo has toured extensively throughout the world, singing unaccompanied, a combination of songs of her own unique composition and traditional [[Buddhist]] chant and [[mantra]]s. She has performed with artists including [[Annie Lennox]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Bono]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Michael Stipe]]. She has performed in the [[Lilith Fair]] Festival and toured widely as a part of the [[WOMAD]] World music festivals. 

Lhamo's name means "Goddess of Song" – a name given to her by a [[lama]] soon after she was born near [[Lhasa]]. Yungchen left [[Tibet]] in 1989 to make pilgrimage to [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]]. She was inspired to reach out to world through her music. She moved to [[Australia]] in 1993, then to [[New York City]] in 2000.

Lhamo's Australian debut album, ''Tibetan Prayer'', produced by [[John Prior (musician)|John Prior]], won the [[ARIA Music Awards]] for best Folk/World/Traditional Music release in 1995. She is the first Tibetan singer to win a prestigious music industry award.&lt;ref&gt;[[ARIA Music Awards of 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; The success of that record led to her signing with [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records|Real World]] label. Her first record for the label, ''Tibet, Tibet'', mainly features a cappella renditions of original compositions—authentic [[Tibetan Buddhist]] prayers and songs. Her next recording, ''Coming Home'', was a collaboration with producer [[Hector Zazou]], showcasing her voice, and also featuring chanting by [[Tibetan monk]]s, a wide range of mostly modern Western instruments, and the benefits of multi-track recording, enabling Lhamo's voice to be layered repeatedly.

On November 20, 22 and 24, 2007, at the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]], Yungchen accompanied a site-specific dance work 'Walking The Line' by American choreographer [[Bill T. Jones]]. This performance, with solo percussion by [[Florent Jodelet]], took place in one of the museum's locations (the one-hundred meter perspective) stretching from the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], to the [[Renaissance Arch]] (from the [[Stanga Palace]]) in which the celebrated sculptures ''[[The Dying Slave]]'' and ''[[The Rebellious Slave]]'' (c1513) by [[Michelangelo]] are exhibited.  

Lhamo's album ''Ama'' (which means Mother in the Tibetan language) was released in April 2006 and was produced by Iranian-American musician [[Jamshied Sharifi]]. Featured artists include [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Joy Askew]].  Yungchen's music has earned her recognition by the Province of [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], as a “[[Messenger of Peace]]” and she was awarded the title of “[[Ambassador of Culture]]”.

'''Zdeněk Neubauer''' (30 May 1942 – 5 July 2016) was a Czech [[philosopher]] and [[biologist]], remarkable especially for original interpretations in [[science history]] and [[epistemology]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Brno]] to family of the Brno normative legal school representative Zdeněk Neubauer (sr.), Neubauer graduated from [[Charles University in Prague]] (1965 in [[microbiology]], [[biology]] and [[chemistry]], 1971 in [[philosophy]]). During his activity in ''Laboratorio Internazionale di Genetica e Biofisica'' in [[Naples]] (1967–1970) he made several discoveries in [[genetics]]. In 1982 left the university because of nonconformist attitudes (both scientific and political). After that, he was mainly a philosopher (a programmer analyst by job), publishing underground. Since 1990, he has been a member of the department of philosophy and history of science at [[Charles University]] Faculty of Science.
